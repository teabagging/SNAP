So far its working. I'm a pretty picky eater and if I am completely turned off by the smell, I usually wont eat something - the grape juice is working.

The Protagonist frequently veers of the story with other stories that don't seem to do much in furthering the lesson of plot as a whole.

The main male characters..Roland in Secret Song and I can't remember the guys name in Fire Song...border on insane! They are so jealous and suspicious through the entire book. Well, to be fair, the last 10 pages they find they really love the lady...too late for me I guess. At one point Daria got so mad at Roland she knocked him down some stairs. I enjoyed reading that part because he deserved it. I love Catherine Coulter's writing but found myself getting mad reading this after the guys had called their ladies lying and deceitful one too many times!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Secret Song","review":"This is the last and perhaps the best book in the medieval quartet. It's the story of Roland de Tournay and Daria of Fortescue. This book kept me engrossed from the very first page. There are real secrets lie in wait for your discovery. I kept reading it and simply couldn't put it down. The story is captivating and the plot is exciting and remains mysterious until the very last pages. Throughout the book before the plot turns out I felt sorry for Daria for Roland sees her as a liar and she just can't prove herself not one. Ms.Coulter did a good job in describing the love scenes and there are such scenes every once in a while.

He has no choice but to oblige the king and queen suggestion but to make her his wife. But he soon learns that she is like no other with her honesty and spirit.

I'll probably go back to the Elementary Go series after I finish Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go next.The chapters on capturing races were very good; these alone are worth the price of the book. I usually avoid rote memorization (EG, I find joseki study boring), but the six types of capturing races seemed quite worth committing to memory, so I did.(nearly?) every chapter has recommendations on books to read for further study of the subject covered by that chapter.If you're serious about go, I'd recommend something else as a first book (of course), but it'd be a good idea to make this your second - read concurrently with the first two volumes of Kano's \\"Graded Go Problems for Beginners\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Filling the gap none others due.","review":"I almost never give a book 5 stars, and probably wouldn't have here if it weren't for the fact that the book is practically the only of its kind in my experience.

Actually the guy is in his early 30's and she in her early 40's so for me the age difference was not big she was not old enough to be his mother after all. And if it was the other way round no one would bat an eyelid. I suppose this highlights the hypocrisy our society has about women being older than their lovers as if that is a bad thing.But sit back and enjoy two people discovering love and each other - romantic, sensual and just right.I would give if 5 stars but being so short the ending seemed a bit rushed"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Rochelle","review":"This book is totally not a good book....It took my four longdays to get through it when it usually only take hours to read books with two times as many pages....Kumi Walker is the bad to the bone wanna be and Veronica is definetly in need of this type...usually a good story but she fourty-something years old!..what a waste! On top of all the \\"playing around\\" and the \\"I really dont know what I want\\" you can guess what is going to happen, and when you really get to the outcome you're ready to scream bloody murder because you acually sat there and read it..For sure not one of her best pieces of work, and I know.

It is not only a practical guide for the physical expression of spirituality within many traditions - conventional and new age - but is also a rich offering of historical perspective to further our appreciation and understanding of sacred dance."},{"rating":"2","title":"handy little book","review":"This book is different from others on this topic in that it seems to be written out of experience rather than research or theory. In this, it is very helpful and encouraging in addressing the practical aspects of starting a dance worship ministry, as I am doing. It's more casually written, so it's a nice change of pace from the more heavily edited books, and it offers some wise advice from a perspective that I can relate to. :) It's a friendly and educational book to help the beginning liturgical dancer/dance leader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruined by environmental warning","review":"I sat through this meditation and found it quite enjoyable, planning to recommend it to child clients and have my son use it, until, at the end of the meditation, a wise, old \\"merman\\" leaves us with, \\"Water is the life blood of Earth, and just as you need water to sustain yourself, so does the earth. When we pollute our oceans, we're polluting ourselves. So take care of the ocean. Take care of Your ocean.\\" The narrator then tells you that \\"he leaves you to think about this as the scene fades.\\" That is the end of the meditation ---- thinking about how the ocean shouldn't be polluted. I find that to be quite an inappropriate use of a meditation. I consider myself a strong environmentalist, but I found my eyes snapping open when the old man spoke about pollution in this manner, just stuck on at the end as an advertisement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"Beautiful music, lovely voice, child-friendly and uplifting for both children AND adults.

This book is composed of a number of short stories seperated into different color sections. Each section has 1-3 enchanting tales that relate to that M:TG color. All in all, it is a great book for M:TG readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a realistic and fun journey into the aspects of magic","review":"This anthology managed to convey and differentiate between the different feelings and intentions behind and involved in the various types of magic. While not necessary to understand the stories, knowledge of the game would add to the enjoyment of the book. Not all of the stories took the same angle, some dealing with the magical doings in a circumspect way, others making it the focus and explaining the visual imagery in detail. I would recommend reading this book to anyone who is not overly concerned with continuity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good - Some bad.... overall not worth reading","review":"This anthology, like many anthology books, is filled with various stories that are both good and bad. One big problem I had with the anthology on a whole was there was only one black story - and it was awful. While the other colors had two or three stories to balance out the different styles of play and effect the various colors could incorporate the color black was left with a very poor story. It was absolutely hideous. I can only hope the other books by Vance Moore (the author of the black story) in the magic series are a billion times better.While my favorites were the red and white stories (white being my favorite overall) and they were worth reading, the others were only mediocre at best, and black being, well you've read the above paragraph.Decent anthology, but not worth it to read it. I would've much rather have started the ice age cycle instead of delving into these stories that were not worth the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Detailed","review":"I used this book for my online class and it was such a big help. While it didn't fully go into detail about the fighting and the people, it does examine the uniforms and weapons used and how tactics were used to overpower or deceive and enemy. It is very well thought out with colour illustrations and full explanations of the battles the usage of all weapons and gear and what they were made out of. For anyone interested in this or even for a class, I recommend this book. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Have Book For Wargamers","review":"Lavishly illustrated, well-written (a few typos, but let's not nit-pick), and extensive for its size, this book is full of information for the wargamer, miniatures painter, and military history enthusiast.

If you plan on building a library covering the military practices of the ancient world, this book is an excellent place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"good hot sauce","review":"It is not my favorite hot sauce but I have been using and enjoying it for a long while.

But, I have used many, many bottles of it over the years.Good stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unappealing hot sauce","review":"For well over a year, I have been using different types of hot sauce on different types of food. Before I started doing this, I only ever remember using hot sauce on barbeque sandwiches. Even though I have tried numerous types of hot sauce during this period, Original Louisiana Hot Sauce has set itself apart from the others as being a hot sauce that I find to be unappealing. Awhile back, I had tried this hot sauce, but I could not remember what I had thought about it. So recently, I decided to get another bottle of it in order to give it another try. When I tried it, my impression was that it was strong and sharp, yet it did not have a pleasant taste. Also, Original Louisiana Hot Sauce is hotter than the other hot sauces that I like, but I do not consider this to be a problem--it is not overpoweringly hot. I am glad that I gave this hot sauce another shot, but it just is not my thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sharp Organizer","review":"Instead of improving the Sharp Organizer with new technology, this product cannot hold a candle to its predecessors.

All of my products in my house are SONY. I never had any problems. Plus, the special rebate offer on this one. I could have given this product 5 stars but it lacks some of the essential parts of it. It lacks all the backup cds. Like: audio & video drivers and this laptop has already a pre-installed Windows Vista, but lacks its CD :( The drivers you can download at Sony's website, but getting the Windows Vista...you can't.

Not drivers, restore or Windows vista.the rest its ok, its really pretty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Misleading title, but still worth watching.","review":"I recently purchased this DVD at Target for $2.00. When I picked it up (with several other Echo Bridge 3 - 4 Movie titles) I was not expecting much. But then again when you are paying less than you would on Amazon.com it is still a great deal. While most of the DVDs I purchased were only worth 1 watching, this DVD was different. It includes several stories related to Vietnam and other recent wars (nothing on Afghanistan or Iraq though). The storytelling, interviews, and dramatizations is excellent. Definitely worth the purchase if you can get it cheap enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Title","review":"I bought this DVD thinking it was (as the title indicates) about modern warfare. The closest to modern that these documentaries got was the marines training which I'm guessing was filmed in the '90s. It targets missions in Granada, Somalia, Panama, Desert Strom, and Vietnam. Those take place in the '60s, '70s, and '80s. I guess I'm too young for this to be 'modern.' They are descent documentaries that aired on TLC and Discovery Channels. All-in-all I was highly disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good case good price","review":"I've used earlier versions of this case before, so I was happy to find a good price on this barebones version. Kindof ironic, but I put a $82 power supply in this $40 case. It is a plain-Jane case, that's why I like it. The only problem I encountered, the new-fangled screwless/rail-less 5-1/4\\" mounts are cheap and stiff, and I had trouble with a tight-fitting tape drive. And putting a 3-1/2\\" hard drive with adapter brackets in those slots was a real challenge getting it aligned. Otherwise, good case good price."},{"rating":"1","title":"complicated case","review":"This is one product where the customer was not thought of! Imagine having to unlock the front panel before you can even open the side panels; and it was not easy to pull the release mechanism under the chassis. The screws are hidden behind the front panel; duhhh. Who was the wise guy who came up w/ this idea? Then the individual modules have to be slided out to insert the different drives; but if you place the screws without adjusting the sliding module you won't be able to slide this thing completely because the screws will block it. My, what a stupid concept."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hangs/overheats","review":"I replaced my old Sonicwall SOHO/10 firewall with the TZ 170 in December of 2004. I used it for 3 years. The most annoying aspect of this unit is that it would just hang and require a power cycle. Early on this happened about once every other month and towards the end it was happening monthly. The unit ran very hot and seemed to require some time to cool down before it would recover. Even then, sometimes it took multiple power cycles to have the unit start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slash is it.","review":"Usually I'm always looking for new genres of Slash, BL and Yaoi, and this was one of the titles I picked up.

His interpretations are breathtakingly fanciful, superbly accurate and breathe life into the sometimes sewing machine-like semiquavers that Bach has no end of. A genius after the spirit of the great composer himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously Disappointed","review":"I couldn't be more disappointed in this DVD. After receiving it I noticed that it was only in stereo (not even the center channel is used). The video quality is OK, but most of the plays sound like the mic is about 20 ft away from the stage so most tracks sound like you are far away from the stage.Lastly I was disappointed in the camera work. While the mic is fixed, the camera follows the action. So even though the sound is moving from right to left (in stereo), the actor always appear in the center of your screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"FastPaced For Its Time","review":"Renfrwew of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police was the hero of several films of the time. Although a Mountie, his adventures were not restricted to the usual Jack Londonish idea of the Yukon. Renfrew was a modern for his time hero, in this film, trying to track down a killer.Renfrew was a Singing Mountie, so in addition to fights and chases, he gets to burst into song during the course of the story.By current standards, this would be classifird as a family film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dog bowls...","review":"I am not pleased with this item.

Not one for the collection.","review":"I have to say that after obtaining every Parr book I can get my hands on, I have been pleased with all of them and kept every one in my collection, except this one. I completely have no interest in people hurrying to France to stock up on booze because there is no tax. I feel it is his worst book, and apart from a few decent shots of people in line in a supermarket, there aren't any standout photos here. Definitely not his best work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diversity is the Key to Success","review":"I could not disagree more with the previous review. Martin Parr is a renown photographer who captures images as diverse as are the experiences in Life. His candid photos, which can be thematic or not, show how funny people can be, or how colorful the world is around us. His images make us laugh, ponder, question, and most importantly, think. Who would have thought to develop a theme of Brits crossing to France to purchase booze, and then capturing their pleasure at having cheated the system, for just a moment. With images as strong as Paul Graham, Parr masterfully captures us in colorful snapshots as we scurry around doing our business at hand. I think this book is terrific - Oops, more diversity....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it","review":"I'll admit that I and my e-mail correspondants have been duped by some of the urban legends contained in this book. However, the book's title is misleading. Most of these stories are campfire stories and jokes that no reasonably intelligent person believes happend to \\"a friend of a friend.\\"Those looking for an easy quick read of a mildly entertaing book should order it.

It is freshing to have many of these stories gathered up into one place. Did any one really wake up with one Kidney? Do baby alligators that live in the sewer really come out to attack people? All of these stories do seem somewhat plausible for a moment. Read this book for peace of mind, and then enlighten your friends with the truth. This book is perfect to read when you are waiting for a train, or at the doctors office. No heavy reading here, but rather something nice, light, and entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Derivative, no value added","review":"I must say, I got a wonderful sense of deja vu reading the entries we compiled for our urban legends web site in someone else's book.

Extremely good. Niles does a good job of Porthios especially, and it explains a lot about what was happening in the elven Kingdoms during the summer of chaos. Read it and i'm sure that you'll be pleasently surprised."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good, well written book","review":"Niles brings you right into action at the start of the book. I was immediately interested. Niles also made the bad guys so bad and annoying you wish you could just enter the book and slap them around. It is very well written. Lots of detail. The only semi-bad thing I notcied was how Porthios seemed to always defeat impossible odds. Douglas Niles wrote about Porthios and made him into a good charecter, when before he always seemed kind of mean and grouchy. I would have liked to hear more at the ending about what the elven nation was like after they won the war. The way that Niles wrote the battles make them intense and they seem to flow. He wrote the battles especially well."},{"rating":"1","title":"To hard to use and too small","review":"I got a deal on it but it is to hard to use and to small.

I'm just 6', so I don't need somthing abnormally large, but the Intuos pen shows Wacom knows how to make a comfortable pen if you're willing to pay for it.And with that ultra-comfortable pen, I looked forward to using this tablet. It's great...except for the amazing amount of memory the drivers demand. There was a noticeable performance lag immediately after installing the new drivers despite my dual 1ghz G4 processors.

This is absolutely false!!! Can't you see, Mr. Carpenter, that the world set up by Tolkien is based on Nordic pre-christian religions???!!! The source for all his mythology and characterization are germanic and anglo-saxon sources (Beowulf, Sagas, etc) Tolkien has more to do with a heroic Saga-like world than with a humble Christian one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware the side effects!","review":"Took this supplement to help with the blues and mild arthritis, since I am above average weight, I started at 800 mg per day, which I increased over a month to 1600 mg since I noticed no effect. I even tried 2 brands.The one thing that I did notice was VERY severe lower abdominal pain that occured about 4 hours after each dose. Sometimes I could relieve some of the pain with antacids/simethicone or going to the bathroom, but it was very bothersome. After about 2 months of use and no noticeable positive effects and increasing abdominal discomfort, had to discontinue use.After 4 days off the SAMe, gut pain is gone and no withdrawls, just left with a lesson of pain and expense that was unsatisfactory.I recommend you go to yoga, meditate or seek therapy if you have the blues and do not take this poisonous, useless product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Naivety Helps","review":"This type of supplement worked a lot better for me when I was younger (and more naive).

(Signature authentication, tank recognition, car steering systems, etc.)This proved to be the ideal book for me... introducing the concepts of ANNs in the context of comparisons with their natural equivalents. The thrust, therefore, was on the insights that ANN research could give for psychology/neurology, and the lessons that psychology/neurology could give to ANN research.Despite its welcome lack of heavy mathematics, it is a serious overview of the subject, worthy of reading at the research level."},{"rating":"2","title":"And so begins \\"The FBI Story\\"","review":"As a child, my parents took me to see the movie \\"The FBI Story\\" with Jimmy Stewart. What I remember most about the movie is the beginning, when Jack Graham places a bomb aboard a plane and blows it up. He did this after placing his mother on it and buying her insurance from an airport machine where one could buy life insurance. This story has stuck with me all these years. This book gives us a minute by minute, hour by hour account of that tragedy and allows us into the heads of many people who were involved from the initial bombing to the trial etc. Great book for those of us that remember, vaguely, that \\"old\\" movie and the impression the opening scene had on us.

My son received this as a gift at 9 months. He played with the ark for about a day and has not bothered with it much since. The blocks, which looked pretty interesting to me, were not any better. The corners are rounded so they don't stack well and are always falling down. The fish block looks neat but it is much heavier than the other blocks and throws off the balance of the ark. I put it away thinking that he might be more interested in it when he was older, but he is now 18 months and still not interested. The ark constantly falls over because the base is so narrow, which defeats the whole purpose of the rocking feature. I was pretty disappointed in the whole thing, blocks and all."},{"rating":"1","title":"DANGEROUS","review":"I know, every toy can be dangerous to an uncoordinated tike. But this one seems particularly so, almost poking out my daughter's eye. I never write these things, but seeing her push on the rocking boat, stumble, and have the shart purple movng thing clonk her just a hair below her eye was enough to get me to share this experience.The blocks are good -- nice rounded edges -- but why they put that rotating sharp purple thing on the top of a rotating, rocking boat, I'll never know. I just hope no one gets hurt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the Giraffe Tower instead","review":"My little brothers got this for their birthday along with the Giraffe tower and several other block sets. All of the sets are great except for this one. It only comes with four blocks and two of them barely do anything. The blocks fall out of the arc anytime it gets moved or bumped. It's a cute toy if you want to use it for decoration only, but to play with, it is not very good. They both love the tumbling giraffe tower though and play with all of the other blocks. They also love the vehicles set. I love this toy too because it keeps my brothers busy for hours while my mom is working on chores and cooking and it's easy to help her watch them. They actually play by themselves. Also, this keeps them out of my stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Fun Toy","review":"This toy was bought for my 9 month old daugter. I thought this toy looked like fun at the store but guess I was wrong. They toy includes four clear plastic blocks that each have a place in the arch. One is elephants, lions, penguins, and fish. The best two blocks are the fish which is full of water, and the penguins which have \\"snow\\" inside the blocks.Well the idea is to put the blocks in the arch and rock it back and forth to create motion inside the blocks. One problem is the motion in the lion and elephant can hardley be detected by an adult much less an infant. They barely tilt their head and only if they are in the proper position. It is also hard to keep the blocks on the arch, they always come off.They make a similar toy involving the same type of blocks called Tumbling Giraffe, it looks more fun than this one. I personally would not recommend this and would take it back had I not thrown out the packaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless....","review":"This toy does nothing. My 7 month old son received this as a gift and has touched it maybe twice. When you try to rock it back and forth, the blocks fall out. The blocks are supposed to have movement inside but the only one of any interest is the fish. He does like looking at himself in the mirror but I can sit him in front of the one in our bathroom and accomplish this. I plan to buy the truck and just use the blocks from the ark as extras. The ark itself is useless!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!!!!","review":"I bought this toy for my 7-1/2 month old daughter, after seeing an ad for these blocks in the mail. I was greatly disappointed to see that the only blocks that the animals move were the fish! You can barely tell that the heads move on the lions. Needless to say-you can't really put the blocks anywhere on the arc-the fish were a lot heavier than the other blocks and had to go in the middle...not very fun for my daughter...Great idea, not thought through all the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"Although the fisher price blocks in this series (and associated toys) have been a major hit with our 12 month old son, this toy has been the biggest disappointment in the series. As other reviewers have states, it tips over easily, is difficult to balance, and is just plain boring! Our son has never given it a moment of his time. In our opinion, this combination set is only worth it for the fish-in-water block, which is the most interesting one in the whole series and can't be bought in any other set! I would skip this set, and try one of the other ones (the truck set has been a hit in our household)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take a pass on this toy","review":"Money can be better spent on another toy.

I give it two stars for fun simply because he still likes to knock it down and play with the blocks. The arc itself is what makes it such a bad toy mainly because it's only purpose is to hold the blocks...which constantly fall out. All of the other Peek-a-Blocks items are much better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!","review":"This toy does absolutely nothing! And as far as the \\"engaging mirror\\" on the top of the ark, anytime my son tries to look in it, he gets poked in the eye w/the purple bird thing on the top.

I like the way photos are in sync with the text, and the reader carried through the design process in an economical discussion of salient points. The major downfall in the book, and it is major, appears in the authors credits for the landscape designs highlighted for discussion. In every instance the authors own designs are found in the category of the right way to design, as might be expected.

His influence over today's music has been subtle, but it's hard to imagine Arto Lindsay, Carlinhos Brown or Tortoise without Gil. His last album, \\"Quanta,\\" was good but maybe a little too slick. \\"O Sol De Oslo\\" is his most natural-sounding, relaxed record in years. Texturally Trilok Gurtu's percussion adds that certain element of mysticism that has been present in Gil's work from the beginning. In fact Gil is one of the few pop artists who can combine that ineffable feeling of joy with a finely honed formal beauty. \\"O Sol\\" is immensely enjoyable; it's too bad earlier albums like \\"Realce\\" (1978) and \\"Refazenda\\" (1975) aren't more readily available in the United States, not to mention his groundbreaking \\"tropicalist\\" work from the swinging sixties."},{"rating":"2","title":"FCE HD Truly Made Easy","review":"All of us learn via multiple modalities, this tutorial DVD provides an excellent visual learning method which is far more effective than the typical screen shots in books.

I really didn't like the book beacause i didn't like the main character of Charlie much- maybe because i don't get him- but the book wasn't too bad. Obviously, since this is one of King's early works (I think he wrote this one before he even wrote Carrie) he can do a lot better. The idea that all those students aren't even moved when Charlie shoots their teacher- dead- to the floor- seems a little unbelievable to me. Plus, athough Ted was a pain in the neck, i still didn't see why they all started beating him to the point where he became a slobbering mess.

It's not a typical horror novel - more like a psychological thriller. The book revolves around a high school kid that had a traumatic childhood that eventually comes out via several acts of escalating violence against the teachers and administrators in his school. He also takes an entire classroom hostage where they have some very bizarre interactions. Definitely not as good as most works by Stephen King. Does an admirable job of exploring the psyche of a tormented and mentally ill individual and it does make you think a little bit (particularly in the context of the world we live in 30+ years after it was first published). A chilling preview of what would happen at Columbine and other schools - but otherwise one of King's worst books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Unlikable characters, irritating dialogue, stupid plot, immature, boring.

I want to add to the excellent negative critiques posted here that her research on the self-help movement was about 15 years out of date. Moreover, I'm afraid that McGee misunderstood Eckart Tolle's work. One hopes this is due to her selective \\"skimming\\" rather than inability to understand Buddhist-based thought.Ultimately as much a waste of time as \\"The Secret.\\" Ms. McGee's thesis is set upon an \\"either/or\\" straw dog argument that finding one's \\"authentic\\" self negates socialization and community.

Great title and cover though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a big disappointment","review":"This book has its good points, particularly where McGee is talking about how we got to where we are today, or analyzing the forces that make self-help what it is. But I don't really understand how that's supposed to help us find our way out of this mess, and to me, that's the crux of it: Okay, here we are, what do we do now? Really, the amount of practical advice in this book is nil. I realize that in a way if the author gave advice she'd be in effect writing a self-help book of her own, and that was not she set out to do. Still, you'd think that at the very least the book would help you understand which self-help program is better than which other program, where to go for real help if you need it, etc., and that's something McGee never gets around to doing. So in the end what's the point? Just to tell us what is? Anybody who's ever put on Oprah or Dr. Phil knows the score there without needing somebody like McGee to tell us."},{"rating":"1","title":"super disappointed","review":"let me give you a word of advice about some genuine self help you can put to use in your life immediately: don't buy this book. i had expected or at least hoped for an explanation of where self help breaks down and whether or not it works, and what i got instead was a long overly philosophical text that reminded me of my reading for college sociology. this book is a case of how many angels can dance on the head of a pin, in spades."},{"rating":"1","title":"--snoooooorrrrrre--","review":"For a topic that seems incredibly hot right now, this book is b-o-r-i-n-g.

My reference in religious music is Josquin Desprez: I love the purity, the simplicity of Josquin's music and the inner peace it brings... though different in kind, I found with Ropartz's masses this sense of purity and simplicity that I like especially. Both the interpretation and the recording are great... highly recommendable CD! Can't understand why Ropartz is not better known!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I've Heard These Songs Before","review":"If you're looking for a great collection of Harry James standards from the 40's and 50's, look no further.

All the original recordings are here, with all the legendary vocalists - Rosemary Clooney, Helen Forrest, a very young Frank Sinatra, and one appearance by Betty Grable (Mrs. James at the time), and more. Highly recommended for the fan of the big band sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small, educational, and very cute.","review":"I got this for my little brother's 3rd birthday. He is a little young according to the age recommendation, but I figured he could handle it, and I was right. The solar robot is very cute and very small, and although it hasn't gotten harmed by either one of my young siblings so far, it seems like it's probably fragile. I wouldn't suggest leaving it on a high desk or table where the sun might hit it and cause it to walk off the edge. My brother handles his toys with care, but you might not want to get this toy for a more rambunctious child who might throw it. My only issue with this product is that the head with the solar receiver on it should be more adjustable; As it is, there are times during the day when there's plenty of sun but it won't quite hit the robot at the right angle, and thus it remains immobile. But my brother loves it anyway -- He pretends it's a new character from the movie Wall-E. :) My parents think the toy is great too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Solar robot not fun","review":"This robot is too small , we expect a bit bigger size , it's moving too slow , not as much fun as we expected , my son lost his interest to this toy in 5 minutes , not worth the spending money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it.","review":"My son, Max, was very disappointed with this product.

After a little practice I find that I spend very little additional time preparing my classes. My students have all progressed very well and most plan to continue through additional levels of the course. Vocabulary and grammar from each unit are repeated and reviewed at intervals through all subsequent units and levels so that students don't lose old knowledge as they acquire new. I allocate 45 hours of class time to each level which typically gives me plenty of time for review and additional activities. Most students with no prior language background become \\"conversational\\" by the end of level 2. I highly recommend this course for serious students."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Right","review":"This 'no-name' is just as comfortable as the popular $400 GPA.

But the fact is, this is not real kefir. Real kefir does not need to be rebought once you buy it. It is a living symbiosis of bacteria and yeast that replicates and grows larger, producing more 'grains'. In no way can this be replicated in a commercial starter pack. If you want REAL kefir, do some research, find what do look for, and buy it elsewhere. Real kefir will last you forever, you'll never have to buy more unless you let the grains die from neglect!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SunStrike","review":"Excellent product!

When that did not work, I used a thermometer and followed the instructions precisely and it still did not work. Shame on Body Ecology.

But just when you think things are going great, tragedy strikes. And just keeps striking, right to the very end.The ending left me upset, angry and in tears, and makes me mist back up everytime I think of it. This book is a senseless tragedy, and unnessacarily sad, in my opinion.

Sophia Delza learned under the famous Ma Yueh-liang in China and yet she seems to have gone off on her own in many ways. She was trained as a dancer and she interpreted taijiquan as an exercise for health. Many people practice it this way. She has also written some unique poetry about taijiquan, some of which is actually quite profound. Somehow she completely missed the boat on the fact that taijiquan is a true martial art--if one has learned the complete art and mastered it. Sadly, very few people including so-called \\"masters\\" can demonstrate this. I would probably only recommend this book to a Wu stylist who already has many years of experience and many other, better books on taijiquan. This is more of a curiosity to glance at every once in while, certainly not essential."},{"rating":"2","title":"For advanced players","review":"This book is not a how-to book.

My students love it, I suspect, because of the high image to text ratio... but the style gets them to see and think differently.

The interviews he includes often lack proper contextualization, and I think he stretches the term \\"narrative\\" far too much, trying to subsume things like games and theater as narratives only, without attending to their game-ness or theatricality. The problem is that there aren't many other books dealing with this genre of work yet, so some readers will find it useful for the excellent example of interesting case studies at least until someone with better analysis writes a book.

I was skeptical that it would not work as billed and had resigned myself to glass replacement. Much to my suprise, this stuff works.

I precisely followed the directions and scrubbed like CRAZY with the enclosed pad. The directions tell you to scrub in a small area at a time - even if it only took a minute to actually work, it would still take a long time to do just one door.

One must find a balance with the water and powder mix, expect to scrub and work hard to remove the spots, and severely spotted glass will take at least two applications and one to two hours to complete (by hand). In my experience, the best results occured when minimal water drops were used to obtain a thick pasty appearance with enough grit (during application scrubbing process) to remove the spots. The automotive glass cleaned with the product was severely hard-water spotted for about nine to eleven months. I would have rated the product five stars if it had worked with less scrubbing intensity or less time. Spot-X removed spots that normal glass cleaners and glass clay bars could not. The cost and time investment are less than the other alternatives: glass polishing, professional detailer, or glass replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product","review":"Spot-X saved us from buying a new shower door.

Before long, the plastic coating on the wire tears, exposing raw metal. Then it shorts out and your computer crashes. Of course, if you are super careful never to put any stress on that wire, your mileage may differ. Also, I typically have to click this mouse 2 or 3 times for my computer to register one click.

What should have been an interesting tale falls flat as the book wanders off in too many directions, including a cast of solid secondary characters who, while charming, do little to move the plot along and a strange, convoluted epic journey.

But, its poorly written and lacks the excitement of other, much better, outdoor books by better writers. I found myself plodding through the cheesy prose and finally giving up before the end. I totally agree with the review posted at the top of this page about the book being \\"seriously sappy\\" and like being on a \\"long camping trip with Shirley MacLaine.\\" This obviously astute reviewer did elicit a chuckle and his comments made up (almost) for the money I wasted on this book. In short, spend your money on something better and don't engourage this author to waste our time with another book. I'll think twice before I make an impulse buy on an unknown writer I've never heard of before - and I think there's a good reason we haven't heard of this \\"author.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Try - But No Cigar!","review":"As an avid reader of outdoor literature and magazines, I happened across this book by chance and was intrigued by the premise. But, I was sadly disappointed when I started to read. The author's story was vaguely interesting, but the jacket copy was much better written than the text. The jacket copywriter should have been given the task for chronicling this outdoor program and maybe it would have been more compelling and readable. I give this book two stars for effort because at least the author tried but overall nothing new, groundbreaking or interesting here that can't be seen or heard on any daytime talk show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Doesn't come close to the wonders of a Paul Theroux or Aldo Leopold, etc. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bore...","review":"The Kirkus review says \\"At its worst, it's like being stuck on a long camping trip with Shirley MacLaine.\\"Please, does anybody have Shirley MacLaine's phone number?

I began to read it on our way home after leaving my 16 year old son at Aspen. I could hardly put it down. In the five hour drive home I experienced sadness at leaving my son, resolve that we had made the right decision and even more importantly, comfort---reading about the outdoors, the staff and the groups of kids that Gary interacted with brought me so much comfort and hope. Upon arriving home, I picked up this book the following day and finished reading it. Now that my son has been gone three weeks I can identify with the stages of the program and well as his changes in outlook. I am so grateful that Mr. Ferguson took the time to prepare and write this excellent book.

Aspen owns many programs-- many of which have been shut down for teen deaths from dehydration, deadly restraints, and heat exaustion. Anyone who raves about this book is giving into the scandal.

Some of the feats that Dong describes seem beyond belief but the book is well documented and convincing. It is both a serious and humorous study of subtle-energy sciences in China. Reading China's Super Psychics will totally enlarge your view of yourself and many of the events described in the book will stay with you long after reading it. In my view, this is certainly one of the best books published on the subject of human paranormal ability. It leaves you wondering whether these abilities are really \\"paranormal,\\" as we commonly believe, or perhaps are innate to all of us.(Simeon Hein is the author Opening Minds: A Journey of Extraordinary Encounters, Crop Circles, and Resonance (Mount Baldy Press, Inc.))"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Book on China's Psychics according to Paul Dong","review":"This book asks the reader to take practically everything the author says as fact. Many of the \\"Wonders\\" described are opening flower blossom's, using PK to move pills out of a sealed bottle, reading words (characters) in sealed envelopes, mass healings, and catching clothes on fire. I might be wrong, but any good stage magician can replicate these AND pull a rabbit out of a hat!The foreward to the book is laughable, something I would expect to find in a \\"South Park\\" novel. Really..If you can get past all of that, there is some interesting information to be found.

I contact iomega's support via their online interactive chat and the support person informed me that the first thing I needed to do was plug the drive directly into a wall outlet instead of into a power strip; apparently these drives are extremely sensitive to power fluctuations (already not a good sign). I don't know about you, but with my setup that's just not possible and I told him so and asked what other avenues we could explore. There were none. That was it.

But I didn't find her transcribed sessions too wordy or too full. Both Peterson and Dawn hit all the nails I needed to have hit, and a few more.I greatly appreciated the lower key toward church growth, with the emphasis on spiritual growth over numerical. I've been waiting a long time for a church leader to espouse the method that our first century fathers used . . . God added to the church daily those who would be saved!In the next few days, I'll go back through the book and highlight all the good stuff, and borrow many of the quotables.

In the background, without his noticing, a dragon threatens a princess, and a prince intervenes to save her. As he does, Arthur realizes he needs tools to fix his tractor, so he borrows the prince's sword, the dragon's fire, and the princess's scarf.Then he suddenly realizes there is a fair maiden behind him, and he starts hitting on her.Without her uttering but three sentences, she accepts his proposal to live on his farm forever, and the prince and the dragon disappear as the sun sets and the new couple sits on Arthur's tractor together.Kate[...]A blog on children's books"},{"rating":"2","title":"Leave the Beatles out of this!","review":"This is A&E story of the late King Of Rock and Roll.

Why is it so popular ? Planescape used to be better and even the Manual of the Planes offered really SPECIFIC rules to go adventuring on the other planes. So why am I upset ? Because this book offers no specific rules ( I mean serious ones) once you leave your beloved Prime material plane. Plane shifting to the Abyss or Pandemonium is as trifle a matter as teleporting to the nearest petty castle. Your magic, your spells, everything is basically left unhindered (well, nearly). All in all, a book for younglings who simply get fascinated at discovering there are brand new planes with sometimes, uh, spooky monsters. For the others, well, a good artwork (hence it doesn't get the insulting one star)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I am a long time fan of the Planescape campaign setting from 2nd edition, and I have to say that this product was very disappointing. It is far less detailed than its 2E precursor, especially concerning Sigil. The center of the D&D cosmology is relegated to little more a paragraph, and the Lady of Pain and factions are given no more than a brief mention. What's worse than this, to my mind, is that all of the flavor and atmosphere from the original setting have been done away with. The distinctive dialect and book art are gone. Furthermore, the numerous typographical errors, badly worded explanations, pointless illustrations, and confusing descriptions of how the layers of a plane relate to one another make this book seem as though it was quickly and shoddily tossed together.

It would lead me to believe that childbirth wasn't the primary role of women in the 18th Century. There are snide hints that women worked while men got drunk and often the author distorts what primary sources have said. For example it says that women starved themselves so their husbands and kids could eat, when what their source (Which they provide in the book.)says that men and especially women starved themselves so their children could eat. This has nothing to do with having anything against feminism.

Williamson's voice does not soar. Rather, it connects you to the earth; a solid low timber emanates and gives a good solid base for the poems selected. The music doesn't interfere with the words; it accompanies them in a cooperative manner, making the music work for the poetry unobtrusively. The fact that Williamson put his heart into this work can be easily heard. The only difficulty with this CD is the unbalanced nature of the compositions chosen; Thomas's work dominates, and the other pieces chosen from Welsh traditionals and Mr. Williamson's own work don't quite have the same beauty, although Williamson's \\"For Mr. Thomas\\" is a worthy effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of CM Widor Organ Symphonies by Kaunzinger","review":"This is a tough recording to review, given the fact that the last recording of ALL 10 Widor organ symphonies was sold at least 30 years ago, and is long out of circulation. But, this is an excellent recording, high sould quality (you can occaisonally hear the stops), and excellent playing on the part of Kaunzinger. The only item of note that keeps me from giving this a 5 star review is that Kaunzinger plays some of the movements a little 'strangely', comparied to how they're written."},{"rating":"2","title":"M. Travis Looks at Madison Cooper","review":"Written four decades ago, this slender volume by Marion Travis reveals much about one of Texas's most interesting and least understood literary figures, while contributing to the mystique which surrounds Madison Cooper. A well-written and interesting look at Cooper, Travis worked from primary source material fortuitously provided by the Cooper Foundation based in Waco, Texas. Cooper's two-volume Sironia, Texas, which still may be the longest novel in the English language, made him an overnight sensation, but a controversial member of his own community. A must-read for students of grand Southern novels in general, and Cooper's work in particular. Good for Amazon.com to be able to make this book available, in mint condition, for Cooper enthusiasts."},{"rating":"1","title":"kindle not the Penguin edition","review":"Unfortunately one is directed from the Penguin edition of the book to the kindle digital edition without a clear notice that it is not the same book. The work may be the same, but it lacks the 40 page introduction, and appendix. Also, it is not the same translation. It's a bit frustrating that the book is advertised as the penguin edition when it is not. I find it particularly odd for amazon to do this since when one is looking at a book's preview (Look inside!) one is always told when the book shown is not the same as the one advertised if that is the case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"I was forced to read this spinning slop on writing as a creative writing major.

I had assumed I needed to take the medications but turns out I feel better now that I'm off. I am keeping my condition under control without any medication.

Glad I found the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truth versus repetitive pharmaceutical marketing.","review":"Like the book says, most of us AND our doctors have been indoctrinated to believe too much stomach acid is the cause of most heartburn and pain. Read the book and you will know why this simply is not true and we are being hooked on antacids and drugs that keep the root problem from EVER being cured.We bought the book to help educate family members who have been suffering for years under their doctor's care and prescriptions. We do not say to not see a doctor, just to be educated and ask them the right questions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life-altering advice!","review":"This is an incredibly helpful book. Not only do the authors explain just how the stomach and GI system is supposed to work, they make a stunning case for how 21st century pharmaceutically-driven medical practice is completely off course when it comes to treating common digestive problems. The authors offer a range of good practical suggestions on how to manage your symptoms while encouraging your stomach to function normally again.I suffered from heartburn for 20 years and had the symptoms of low stomach acid for 5 or more years which was never properly diagnosed. Since reading this book and following the authors' advice, I have not taken any stomach acid suppressors for over a year now--I now have no heartburn, no gas, and no pain. Yes, it's possible! Do yourself a huge favor and read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insubstantial and obscure","review":"I'd avoid this book.

However, I found a few of the concepts mentioned to be a little over my head such as the chapter about the lifting of the veils that surround God(swt)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A hard read....","review":"I suppose this book is a good beginner's guide if you can follow the reading. I found it to be a very taxing read. I found myself reading sentences several times and slowing down tremendously to try to understand what exactly was meant by each sentence. The sentence structure, the run on sentences, and the way the book is organized, makes it hard for someone like myself to follow the actual point of it all. The book pulls you in too many directions all at once, which often leads to the reader finding themselves lost in the sauce. The price is great, but that might be due to the fact that no one wants a book they can't understand:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"They Sell Broken Crystal Horse!","review":"It is apparent that they intentionally sell Broken Crystal Horse.

My theory is obviously these two ladies could not find jobs due to may I say, lack of talent. So they begged for money and made a movie they could be the stars in.

Advanced spanish is an appropriate title for this program since It literally immerses you in the language with an actual spanish soap opera episode. You can practice in a number of ways, as well as take quizzes. Some of the activities include a visually based vocabulary program. In this area of the software the program shows you a still from the movie with an object circled and you name the word in spanish. Others include listening for the missing word in a conversation- harder than it sounds. You can watch the movie with and without spanish subtitles so you can follow along with the script or try to watch it without. Some minor- very minor- technical glitches not really affecting the operation of the program or use of it prevent me from giving this a full 5 stars. But a really great, well rounded buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough room for socket.","review":"I purchased these for a small block Chevy with the one piece rear main seal.

It's also good about telling you about historic societies and museums where you can find history of the culture. But most of the sites they mention are listed in the the other books that I have (Maui Revealed and The Big Island Revealed). These two books cover much more information, and cover the same information as this book, but in more detail. For instanace, this book will tell you that there's a legend associated with a certain place, and make a small mention of it, but the Revealed books explain it more.

Had it not been the selection of the month for the book club I'm in, I'm sure I would never have finished it. The premise is intriguing: a forty-year old woman begins to actually and figuratively disappear. Unfortunately, the potential of this concept is never reached. Disjointed and confusing, the novel is painfully short on plot and characterization, with little conflict and no resolution. The last section of the book is so bizarrely contrived that you truly feel cheated upon finishing.I gave it two stars instead of one because it did actually lead to an interesting discussion, and occasionally there were moments of insight regarding the role of middle-aged women in American society. But do yourself a favor -- don't read this book unless you intend to talk about it with someone else.

My cats go crazy for it, and it's far better made than anything comparable at Petsmart. The sparkly attachment especially stands out, because one of my cats has a vision problem that appears to be degenerative. She is relying more and more on sound, and the sparkly attachment, in addition to catching the light in a way that makes it easier for her to see, also makes a delightful rustling noise that helps her find it.

This is the second one I've bought because I was hoping the first one was just defective, but the second one fell apart even faster. It's really frustrating because this is by far my cat's favorite toy, but the sparkly pieces are easily pulled out of the red cap. I keep trying to find ways to fix it, but so far I've been unsuccessful. I'm going to keep trying though, because he never seems to get tired of playing with it. I really hope the Da Bird people will find a way to make this more durable.

Two of my cats are under two and are very active. They love chasing feathers, doing flips in the air and all of that but part of their play is to chew on the toy. My orange Tabbie has been to the vet twice to have her stomach emptied of fod (foreign objects) and I have to constantly monitor both of them to make sure they're not eating something they shouldn't. Kids. My vet told me that I was lucky that Pumpkin was able to finally vomit up the heavy plastic wrapping she ate or it would have required a $2,500 surgery to remove it.

Extremely disappointed! False advertising! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ITEM. I also had to take away the broken sparkler as tinsel is dangerous for cats. The Da Bird rod is great but all the attachments so far have fallen apart so quickly (1 a day) that it is getting costly. I have ordered 7 attachments total of 4 different types and this was the 2nd type tested. The first was the pheasant feather that is popular with all 6 cats."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not convinced it's safe","review":"As another recent reviewer experienced, my cat loved the toy but was able to chew a piece off and eat it - fortunately it came back up rather quickly, so a vet visit wasn't necessary.

Many of the books about writing screenplays out there (and there are certainly many) may make a good point here or there, but I often find myself wondering, \\"Well, what does he really mean by that?\\" This book never has that problem. The author is so generous with examples that the connection between theory and practice is always clear.This makes it so much easier for someone just learning thecraft, to really get a handle on what works and what doesn't.The depth of the book is only enhanced by its simplicity of design and language. Again, many of the books I've read seem to want to rely on some razzle-dazzle new formula or philosophy which will then be the \\"guarantee of success\\" for the person whofollows the guru.

I was wrong, they are the fastest-boring spade bits that I've ever used, by far. You actually have to pull back with a fair amount of force to stop the bit if you're not going all the way through the wood. These are especially useful if you are drilling overhead or in a tight spot where you can't get much muscle behind the drill. The bits do all the work. As for the previous reviewer, old yellow pine can be VERY hard and have some pretty tough knots in it. If these bits broke on something, I'm sure any other bit on the market would have broken also. Bosch does not make shoddy products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tip broke off on first use","review":"Unfortunately I can't echo the nice comment already here. I did not have good luck with these. I picked up this exact set at a local big box store and had to take it back the next weekend with broken bit. I was drilling in some old pine joists when the tip jammed and broke off - this was within the first 5 mins of use. Nice idea, but didn't work for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bits","review":"Very sharp. When used with a drill press, it bites into the wood immediately, so be careful. Also, when using free hand with a portable drill, don't let it snatch the piece of wood out of your hands. I have used these numerous times, and are grateful that they don't skip around on top of the wood, especially hardwoods. I actually use a tiny pilot hole when I need precision, as the bits dig in to whatever depression there is on the wood. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"pulls themselves through wood","review":"The threaded end actually pulls your drill through the work piece. I find that using an impact driver works best and the last 1/4 inch you have to put some pressure on it to break through the wood on account of the threaded tip not having anything to grab on to at the end of a hole. The holes are not too clean, but spade bits never are. This works good in 2 by material.The case is great.....more tools should come in FLAT cases. It takes up minimal space in my tool bag unlike tool sets with bulky plastic containers. In fact, a big reason I bought this set was because of the flat case design.I will probably buy more Bosch stuff just because of the well though out cordura flat cases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Spade Bits","review":"This is a great spade bit set.

I thought they could have done more to soften up the picture with today's technology, but it's clear that they either could not or would not. Regardless, this is a top notch Nanci performance. During the song \\"Love at the five and dime\\" and on a couple other songs, observant fans will notice Eric Taylor (Nanci's one-time husband) doing backing vocals (on the screen to the right of James Hooker).

I've got to learn to play that!''.In Chaos (as well as almost all of the other Macca solo albums)there's just nothing new or creative anymore.

Given time, this album will open up like a bottle of great French wine given time to breath, which, even when it is ready to drink, is not all berry and oak. Its flavors have a complexity and depth and richness that can only come from a rich past and years of cultivation. I suppose in this analogy Paul might be a great old vineyard allowed to go to pot, finally given the careful cultivation its soil and vines and tradition deserve, but I should probably just stop.On further reflection, I might reconsider this album up to 5 stars but for now, as it plays for its fifth time, I'm sticking with 4."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paul McCartney like I have never heard him!","review":"I have been a fan of Paul since the start of the Beatles. The first time I listened to this album I thought it was OK, but not what I was used to. I listened to it a few weeks later on my computer while at work, and started playing it over and over. This is a very good album, if not the best Paul McCartney has done. Every song is great, I can't listen to it enough. It is a blast to the past of the White Album. There is a sense of meaning to every song and Paul is at his best. Thank you Paul McCartney."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Should Have Known Better......","review":"All the critical applause of this new McCartney CD had me foaming at the mouth waiting for my copy to come from Amazon. And as I write this review, I see that this is the #1 selling CD on Amazon currently. So, is it me or is it them? \\"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard\\" is bland and without inspiration. I guess I could blame the producer but I can't imagine this material being very interesting, regardless of who helped Paul put it together. I've only given it 2 stars on the hope that it might grow on me over time but that seems unlikely. Sir Paul McCartney has been and will continue to be a musical hero of mine but I should have known better than to trust the critics this time out. Maybe they all hope to get stage-front tickets from Paul for his new concert tour by pumping-up their acclaim. Save your money for seeing Sir Paul live if you get a chance. He won't disappoint you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Here we go again.....","review":"Other LPs of McCartney's that belong in a box set; Press to Play, Pipes of Peace, Broadstreet, and now Chaos.... I was SOOOooo Disappointed there were NO McCartney Rockers on this cd, except for Fine Line. I felt that while I was listening to this I should have had a bubble machine plugged in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Back Off Boogaloo","review":"While Paul's latest is considerably better than Driving Rain,that's not saying much. I found 9 of the 13 tracks listenable, the other 4 boring. Of the listenables, there is nothing \\"Great\\" as you would expect at least something great on every album. When the best material is just OK or not bad, to me, that constitutes a sub-par McCartney album.What became of the \\"man of a thousand voices\\"? Paul is down to 1 or 2. Paul needs a reminder of what Ringo wrote (and sang) 35 years ago - \\"Get yourself together now and give me something tasty; everything you try to do, you know it sure sounds wasted.\\"While this album may be Paul and sounds like Paul, Beatle Paul is not present."},{"rating":"1","title":"Supermarket Music","review":"I love Paul McCartney, and I have been a Beatles and a Wings fan since my early years, but this album is probably only something for hardcore Paul fans. It is dull, boring, self-indulgent, over-produced, at times overly simple, and definitely in my opinion, does not even come close to any Wings album or specifically the \\"Flaming Pie\\", with all these wonderful ballads. One word: no heart or soul. As a number of folks have already commented as to each individual song, there is no reason to chime in. I regret having spent almost $10 for this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disappointment","review":"I complete lost interest in anything Paul released after Band on the Run. But when I heard Drivin' Rain, my appreciation was renewed. Boy is this thing ever getting hyped. Best post-Beatles work?? Gee - not even close. After the grossly overlooked Drivin' Rain, I was expecting this to top that, what a disappointment. I almost fell asleep in the car during the morning rush hour listening to this piece of drivel. I can't imagine him performing any of this stuff live. If you don't have Drivin' Rain - do yourself a favor a pick up one of the used copies here online for $3 (or George Harrison's Brainwashed), a much better bang for your buck than this waste of plastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Music's Got Absolutely No Feel To It","review":"Simply put, this is one of the five worst albums/CD's I've ever heard and I've listened to well over five thousand of them. I'm a 40 year Beatles fan and am not at all anti-McCartney. This \\"music\\" is bland, lifeless and duller than a speech by Dick Cheney. After reading all the glowing pre-release hoopla, I was literally stunned by how weak this music is."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best one-REALLY!","review":"Well,OK,I've listened daily to this for 5 months.I am not tired of it.My five year old is not tired of it.My wife is not tired of it.This may be the start of another McCartney renaissance.There is not a weak moment here.The pairing of Goodrich-McCartney was inspired(thanks George Martin!).Let's face it,this is a Beatle,folks-Lennon's songwriting partner-the man who co-wrote Eleanor Rigby,Sgt.Pepper's,Magical Mystery Tour,etc.Just think of the second side of Abbey Road,for crying out loud! So,this is not just his best since RAM or Band on the Run or McCartney 1-this is his best PERIOD!Quality like this doesn't come along very often.It's like Haley's comet!Buy it NOW-you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Consistently Brilliant","review":"Thirteen gorgeous 3-4 minute songs. It's like listening to Rubber Soul for the first time again. You're not going to find any rockers here but the songs, performances, arrangements and production are stunning. Up until this CD Paul had released (in my opinion) 4 five star albums (Band on the Run, Tug of War, Flowers in the Dirt, Flaming Pie). Chaos and Creation takes it's rightful place alongside those great works."},{"rating":"2","title":"A mature piece of work","review":"Like other reviewers, it took two listens for me to grasp the depth of this \\"album.\\" (Am I dating myself? :-) ) I can't get it off my CD player now.All I can say is, thank God Sir Paul is still there making music for us adults. I have for many years basically tuned out the rock scene because of all the (ahem) junk being produced...McCartney has revived my interest with this effort.A wonderful, deep, rich, beautiful recording...don't pass it up.(I was thinking of the awful Rolling Stones Super Bowl appearance. When was the last time they made any good music...25 years ago?! The 63 year old McCartney just set the bar for all the old rockers!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Since Flaming Pie","review":"This is McCartney's best since 1997's Flaming Pie. He still has got the magic. It should have won album of the year... If you are even thinking about getting this album, go ahead and buy it, because it will not disappoint. Paul at his best!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Chaos & Creation - Nothing But Drivel !","review":"I am a long time fan of the Beatles (together and solo) and have loved nearly everything the fab-four have put out, except for this one. Upon hearing the critics praising this new album you would have thought it WAS McCartney's best. Boy, was I suprised! I tried (I really have) to listen with an open mind several times and I don't see what the fuss is over? This is drivel and not worthy to be compared to anything McCartney has done in the past. I much rather liked Flaming Pie than this one! No comparison between the two. I hope Paul is able to redeem himself with the next album (if he has anything left in him). If not, I would prefer that he hang it up and rest on his prior accomplishments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brutal","review":"Did McCartney call Rolling Stone and plead with them not to savage this brutal effort? I'm at a loss at how they could've favorably reviewed this album. In fact, if this had been produced as a demo by a wannabe, it would have never seen the light of day.Here's an idea--compile all of Paul's best post-Beatle work and see if it adds up to one or two good discs. Here's another idea---compile John's, Paul's, and George's best (Ringo DQ'd). Now there's a best seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard: Lacks Pop & Fizz","review":"McCarthney comes from a well known and storied past that makes us all curious about his next release. \\"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard\\" lacks the color and texture of some of his better work. It does not help that he is the major or at times the sole musician on its songs. Some are promising yet as a collection do not feel fully developed. Disappointing work from an incredibily talented man. I just expected more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Letmedownagain","review":"I too fell for the five stars that reviewers gave this album. Lets face it, McCartney hasn't made a strong album since \\"Flaming Pie\\" in 1997. Sure, I'll play the album again although I don't believe there are any songs that will stay in my head. The music is geared for a dentist office. Stick with \\"Band on The Run\\",\\"Tug of War\\" or \\"Flowers In The Dirt.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"It's no Tug of War","review":"To be fair, I never compare solo work by Lennon or McCartney to their work together; it's apples and oranges.So this one sounds a lot like other ones Sir Paul has turned out over the years. Tug of War remains my fave.Can't say I'd buy this one if I were you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like older wings","review":"I don't know why I keep wasting my money buying McCartney stuff lately....., Driving rain, same, Choas & Creation same...Just not like old wings stuff, nor other McCartney albums. Where's the old rocker stuff??"},{"rating":"2","title":"best mccartney yet","review":"As a Paul Mccartney fan for 40 years I see this as his best solo effort yet. From my days as a 9 year old fan in 1965 until now, I am enjoying this immensely. What I most appreciate are the clever touches that make the songs shimmer and glide."},{"rating":"2","title":"best for many years","review":"I actually thought that Driving rain was very underrated, this is better and I hope that it also sells better. I personally think that the stripped production enhances McCartney's songs and always has from the Beatles onwards. Some classic tunes here and the darker mood and self-depreciation are a welcome addition. It's the way forward for McCartney."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT'S ALL IN THE STARS","review":"good side:Paul's playing most of the instruments (26 to be exact) himself, wonderful arrangements, lyric sheet, bonus DVDbad side:no sign of his son James on the CD, could have used more picturesstandout tracks:fine line; how kind of you; jenny wren; friends to go; riding to vanity fair; promise to you girl; anyway"},{"rating":"2","title":"I need of this cd","review":"Only McCartny can make this musicThis cd is positive as Paul.Produced and played with groove!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uneventful","review":"First, McCartney is such a giant that any new music from him should be welcomed. If you think of any of the great composers of popular music in the last one hundred years (Cole Porter, Richard Rodgers, Bacharach, Irving Berlin, etc.), none of them did much good work in their sixties. They all hit their stride in their twenties, thirties, and forties. I am happy that McCartney is still having a go at it. That being said, this is a weak album. It is totally forgettable. I have to wonder if he worked at these melodies - they have the appearance of being lazy and show little effort. Gone are the days when he did take after take or let a song percolate in his memory for months before committing it to the recording studio. Paul is a good family man, a genius of popular music, a great rocker. His best creative work appears to be behind him. Nothing wrong with that. He can perform his back catalogue for years and we will love him for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paul's Chaos And Creation","review":"\\"Chaos And Creation In The Backyard\\" finds Paul McCartney in a mellower, laid-back mode. No real rockers on this album, just pleasant melodies and exquisite playing, which will do just fine. McCartney plays most of the instruments himself, his songwriting is still equally sharp, and he still weaves a good story. Excellent songs include \\"Fine Line,\\" \\"Jenny Wren,\\" \\"English Tea,\\" and \\"This Never Happened Before.\\" But the standout song is easily \\"Riding To Vanity Fair,\\" a marvelously hypnotic confection and one of the finest songs Paul has ever written. But the whole album is highly enjoyable, a perfect disc to wind down with at the end of the day. I strongly recommend Paul McCartney's \\"Chaos And Creation In The Backyard.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"son of blackbird","review":"The haunting \\"Jenny Wren\\" is a beautiful ballad that Sir Paul McCartney has described as \\"sort of a son of 'Blackbird'\\" but it probably owes as much to \\"Elenaor Rigby\\" or \\"She's Leaving Home\\" or countless other McCartney classics. He has no rival when it comes to lonely women.And what's wrong with that? I'd like to know ...Macca has an amazing back-catalogue of beautiful ballads into which \\"Jenny Wren\\" will settle in nicely. The only shame is that a younger generation out there probably wouldn't get to hear it unless someone younger covered it. \\"Riding to Vanity Fair\\" is a lovely melody featuring Macca's voice at it's best. as for the rest of the album while i don't go in for the breatheless enthusiasm of some reviewers, I reckon it's a very good serious work by Macca."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid effort","review":"Paul McCartney since the break up of the Beatles has been inconsistant. Some of his albums have not even been worth listening to, and others are brilliant. Over the years I have bought just about all of them and I have to say I have only kept a few.Chaos and Creation in the Backyard is one of the few that is Beatle quality. Paul seems to come out of his rut, and like with Flaming Pie he has come up with an outstanding album.This is not only a fine album but some of the best songs he has ever written are on here.Songs of note are Fine Line and How kind of You and Friends to Go. Now for the best ever. Jenny Wren is along the lines of Blackbird. The guitar is very similar. Paul has really outdone himself on that one.There is also a song called Engish Tea that I find myself listening to over and over.Paul is British and I love songs that sound British, this is a real treat. This is for Beatles fans as well as McCartney fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho hum","review":"McCartney hasn't put out anything relevant or memorable since \\"Band on the Run.\\" That was 32 years ago, and sadly he should have quit while he was ahead. It's too bad that his reputation has been sullied by \\"Silly Love Songs,\\" \\"Let Em In,\\" \\"Goodnight Tonight,\\" \\"Say Say Say,\\" etc.Sorry Paul, this newest album may be a critical favorite (what are THEY smoking?), but radio and the public won't bite. Boring, unimaginative lyrics and melodies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Angry at these Reviews","review":"I went and bought this album because of all the 5 star ratings and got it home and found it abysmal. The lyrics are trite and undeveloped, the music is just rehash and too short- Paul raids his whole catolog of songs to rip off of and it's just more of the same- I've listened to it more than once and it's just garbage. I prefer \\"Driving Rain\\" better than this, at least it had some rockers on it- this is just hospital waiting room music- some of it is just pure torture. I'm going to have to trade this CD now and I hope I can get something out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chaos and Creation in my car","review":"After I bought the cd, I put it into the cd player and cruised down the highway expecting some good stuff. What I got made me yearn for \\"Octopus's Garden\\", \\"Your Mother Should Know\\", or maybe even something from Yoko.... and I've always liked McCartney!I hated it. It was drivel. It was weak lyrically and musically. Sir Paul was trying to be Sir Mathis. If I wanted syrup, I'd listen to my wife's Josh Groban collection. (Naw, that's asking too much.)Fortunately, by the time I got home, I put in \\"I am the Walrus\\" and I woke from my near coma."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened To Paul??","review":"Been a Beatle fan since '63. Held off buying this one for a few weeks. Bought it and was playing it all week. My wife (Beatle fan too) finally said to me,\\"What is that cd you've been playing to death, gawd it's awful!\\" When I told her it was McCartney, she just rolled her eyes and said \\"getting old isn't pretty sometimes\\" and walked out of the room. Sadly , I feel the same way. This cd is terrible considering who made it. Hey, even if it wasn't Paul McCartney it's still a terrible album!! Ringo's recent albums have been better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"more of the same...","review":"What happened? Did he finally dig into his millions/billions to \\"buy\\" all the reviewers too? C'mon, even snippets will tell you it is more syrupy junk from a true talent that no longer has Lennon to tell him \\"NO\\". Lennon, probably the the best that rock ever had to offer, served as a competition and a sounding board during the Beatle days, and McCartney grew and basked in that true glory. Since the break-up he has surrounded himself with worshippers that will not tell the emperor that he has no clothes. What ever he once had(the Beatles), he no longer has and is a sad old man. Don't buy the hype OR the disk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chaos","review":"I don't know what everyone's raving about. This album is by far his worse ever; even Press to Play's innovationations have some kindal of tonal sense. This is a real mess. The only thing that sounds like a well-constructed song is the song \\"Fine Line\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Some Promise, Same Old Flaws","review":"First of all, let me say that the really sad song, Riding To Vanity Fair is a flawless record. It already may rank right up there with the Long and Winding Road in my book.By his own admission, McCartney has often been \\"in his element\\" aping the style of a popular artist or record. In the case of Vanity Fair, it's pure Beck from Sea Change - down to using the instruments from Golden Age (track #1 coincidentally)Other songs are trivialized by trite, rushed lyrics - a worsening problem for Paul lately. The handful of tunes with true promise here are reduced to throw-aways by throw away lyrics.Oh, and \\"Jenny Wren\\" isn't a sequal to Blackbird, it the sequal to \\"Put It There - and its irritating, to be kind.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Careful Fans","review":"This is good CD but it is not what the critics say. I was little disapointed in it and probably now have to make a decision whether to keep it or sale it back to the store that I got it. It does not remind me early days of the Beatles or Paul himself. Be careful of the critics on this one"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass this one","review":"I bought this album because I saw a review of it by Barry Manilow in the Wall Street Journal. I am not a fan of Barry Manilow, but I was a fan of Paul McCartney's Ram, Venus and Mars are Alright Tonight and a few other oldies. I listened to this three or four times and sent it to the back of my CD storage. It's not bad, just boring as an album. If this album was a tribute to his love for his second wife, it is a good indication of how stilted that realationship was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ham On The Run","review":"Far be it from mortal me to attempt to knock a legend off his pedestal, but, sick of hearing, every few years when Sir Paul releases a new album that it's \`his comeback!' \`He hasn't been this good in years!!' \`The best since the 70s!!!' Please, Rock-N-Roll Hall of Fame solo be damned, he's never released a masterpiece [closest was his almost-covers CD post-Linda, a fine tribute to 50s nostalgia]. While not as lethargic as \`Driver Rain', or cringe-inducing as his last live opus, this is still a major annoyance. He was balanced by John, George and Ringo in the 60s, unbalanced by Linda and - who else? - ever since. My grade: B-"},{"rating":"2","title":"lovely set, might be his best since The Fabs","review":"McCartney's made some fine records (Ram, Band on the Run, Flaming Pie) but this one may very well be the best of the lot. Everybody's making a big deal of the production but the thing I noticed about it was the decision to leave the voice alone without resort to the usual Beatly tricks. And interestingly the singing is probably the weakest part of the record. But what makes a good record of original songs are the songs, and this time McCartney's rediscovered his old knack for melodies. And the lyrics are solid, very much in the usual McCartney vein with a slightly darker hue. Really not a weak track in the set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard","review":"Paul Mccartney's albums sound lightweight at first, then a couple of years later you love them. This album is an exception. It sounded great the very first time I listened. Say what you want, naysayers, Paul McCartney is the most popular and talented musician on our planet, and this album is prime Paul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quintessential McCartney","review":"Most everybody says this is Paul's return to his first two solo albums I really think it's a definate return to Flaming Pie.Flaming Pie was and is one of his best, period."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as The Beatles!","review":"This album is fantastic from beginning to end. It sounds just like a classic Beatles' album and infact it is better than some of them. I don't see why some reviewers think that this album sounds so different. It sounds like \\"Revolver\\" and \\"Abbey Road.\\" If you don't like those albums then you won't like this one. If you like those then this is exactly what you're looking for. It is way better then \\"Band On The Run\\" which sounds very seventies and dated. This is Paul's best solo album!I wonder how many of these one star reviewers could write even one song half as good as any of the ones on this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Content Protected","review":"I like the CD and would normally rate it with 4 stars.However, what Amazon.com doesn't tell you is: this CD is content protected - hence I cannot put a lossless copy onto my NAS which makes hearing this CD a hassle.Thus, I cannot rate it with more than 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Strong Release by McCartney","review":"Chaos and Creation offers a strong element of solid songwriting throughout the album. \\"Fine Line,\\" \\"How Kind of You,\\" \\"Jennie Wren,\\" and \\"At the Mercy\\" are the first four songs on this and four of the strongest songs on the album, melodically, harmonically, and lyrically.The album continues with \\"Friends to Go,\\" a catchy folk rock song. On his \\"Chaos and Creation\\" TV special, Paul describes \\"Friends to Go\\" as what sounded to Paul like a \\"George song.\\" The CD continues with \\"English Tea,\\" a catchy piano number complete with orchestral accompaniment in typical Paul fashion.Most of the tracks are catchy and melodic, and the album has the effect of pulling you in. The last track is a simple piano ballad titled \\"Anyway,\\" which has a lulling quality and feeling of completeness. Overall, Chaos and Creation is a strong release from an artist whose career has spanned decades."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful!","review":"Paul McCartney has quite a repertoire of wonderful music from the Beatles to his solo (or Wings) work. The present album contributes many beautiful new songs to the McCartney collection. The album is definitely ranked with his best solo work including Tug of War, Flowers in the Dirt, and Flaming Pie. Both lyrically and musically McCartney is at the top of his game in this album. The songs remind me mostly of the White Album (1968), Abbey Road (1969), and the McCartney album (1970). The album lacks a ballad like \\"Let It Be\\" or \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" or \\"Only Love Remains,\\" but it has a lot of great songs along the lines of \\"Blackbird,\\" \\"Golden Slumbers,\\" and \\"Junk.\\" On the new record my favorite songs are \\"Too Much Rain,\\" \\"Anyway,\\" and \\"Promise to You Girl.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo! Macca","review":"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard is really a masterpiece, this guy is a genius with the beautiful melody in every song, in every chord, in every instrument.

But, alas, i found little. Very little inspiration here at all. Maybe these songs could've used his BAND to inject some drive, some spunk, some imagination. Boring string arrangements (if playing one note can be called an arrangement), stale guitar parts, drum machines. God, what a bollocks from such a talented songwriter and musician. Paul, re-hire your band before they get away! Please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This album really isn't a very good effort by McCartney. The only decent tracks on the CD are \\"Fine Line\\", \\"Friends To Go\\", and, what I think is the best track, \\"English Tea\\", which is really a lovely song. The other ten tracks are totally forgettable and aren't distinctive at all. The album is short and appears to have been quickly thrown together. He has done much better stuff in the past - I usually love his albums - but he misses the mark with Chaos and Creation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the Real Paul???","review":"All the hype, and all the expectant results are missing from this very simple, boring offering by Sir Paul. In a few of the songs I really thought this legendary artist was going to start singing the Barney song... ' I love you, you love me etcc...' Want some quality offerings by an ex-Beatle? Check out Ringo Stars most recent release. This offering by Paul again makes us long for and truly miss John Lennon. Dont even think of listening to some of Paul's solo work prior to this, ie: Band on the Run, Venus and Mars, etc.. as you will become even more disenchanted with this poor offering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snoozorama","review":"One of the most boring cd's I have ever listened to. The only time I will ever listen to it again is if I have trouble falling asleep. Quite a difference from his live performances which are very good. Slow, monotonous, boring songs. He needs his live band to kick him into gear on his next studio album instead of trying to do everything himself. If it did not have Paul McCartney's name on the cover the critics would dismiss it entirely. At least plug in the electric guitar and include a couple of rockers. 13 straight slow ones is enough to bore anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"The McCartney Taliban Is Wrong Wrong Wrong!","review":"I am a huge fan, particularly of the middle/late Beatles and early solo work. This album is nearly unlistenable. The instrumentation and vocals are fine! It's the songs. It's like Macca has jettisoned harmony and melody. Yeah, I read the reviews where they say anyone slamming this CD is an idiot. Call me a moron, but this album is pathetic, and Macca would better served taking a nostalgia show on the road. The Macca taliban will beat on me for this, but it's the truth.In the last year, Neil Young, Big Star, The Posies, and Brian Wilson all veterans, and some as old as Paul released new CDs, and hit home runs. McCartney bobbled a bunt and then tripped over his shoelaces on he way to first base."},{"rating":"1","title":"chaos; no creation","review":"It's interesting how this CD can generate so many five star reviews and plenty of 1 star reviews. I took a chance and bought this- after all, I have every Paul CD and then some. After several listens, I just had to read these 5 star reviews again. Are these folks listening to the same CD I am? I get the feeling these 5 star reviewers would basically rate anything by Paul 5 stars. I'm a huge fan, but this CD is extremely boring. If it wasn't Paul, I'd never listen to it again. I won't bother with the song by song analysis, because frankly, they all sound the same. Nothing memorable. Comments about this being \\"dentist-office muzak\\" are right on the mark. I can only hope his next is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total piffle !","review":"Lord knows, I love Paul Mccartney & the Beatles. But this latest CD of his is an abomination. If Amazon alowed me to give it no stars whatsoever , that's what my rating would be .

It's a disgrace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable for any McCartney fan","review":"If you are a McCartney fan you'll enjoy \\"Choas\\". Paul's writing is a bit dark and subdued but very melodic. It took a couple of listens to get the feel of the album but I get the sense that he put alot of effort into this one and it basically shows where he is at today at age 63. Definitely worth a serious listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"An appropriate title Paul.","review":"I had just seen the Paul McCartney tour and was hooked on the melody of Jenny Wren. The problem with this cd is that it is essentially light weight fluff that you will listen to once and put away in your collection. Paul is still wonderful in concert but this cd was a disappointment - the rock doesn't rock, and alot of the material sounds forced and empty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are we listening to the same CD?","review":"Chaos and Creation is a dreadful dirge of McCartney sappiness. The songs are an endless blend of ballads where it's hard to hear where one song picks up and the other leaves off. I'd like to here McCartney make some rock-n-roll again. Maybe he could team up with Ringo Starr, who could show him how it's done. All of you who like this CD are probably the same ones who liked Brian Wilson's \\"Smile\\", another example of washed up old musicians who just don't know when to retire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad","review":"So sad that a brilliant musician like Paul McCartney is putting out trash like this.

Mindless dribble, poor production, lousy orchestration, it goes on and on. I swear, I knew the next lyric before it was sung!

He needs to join a band - maybe the Wilbury's? All the songs sound like demos, especially after watching the DVD. This Nigel producer guy pretty much fiddled with a few knobs and let McCartney do what he wanted, including play all the instruments. Where's the creative challenge in that? This is the audio equivalent of masturbation. In front of a picture window.

This album is much different than Sir Paul last albums which is more rock edge. Every song in this album is outstanding and suprisingly my favorite song is the last one - Anyway.

I knew when I bought it, it wouldnt be rock n roll and the interviews with him indicated as such, its a mature, introspective pop album, maybe some of the songs arent genius, but they are well done and nigel godrich made him work hard for the sound on the cd.He demonstrates again how versatile he is playing most of the instruments on the cd and his voice is fine almost melancholy at times to fit the mood of the songs. Im not saying its his best cd, but its a nice change of pace for him and solid proof that he still can deliver a quality product and take chances musically by working with a different and current edge type of producer who wouldnt just be a yes man with him in the studio. The songs dont all jump out at you at first hearing but grow on you as time goes on. A great start for him before his big tour gets underway. willie."},{"rating":"1","title":"impulsive?","review":"i bought this record i don't know why. i heard a few tracks and thought it sounded ok.i listened to it once and it sounded so blase. i don't really know what i expected. i have add so sometimes lyrics don't really matter-- the rocking of the music does, which may be why i like jazz so much, because it doesn't have words. neither here nor there.any way: and yes i know this isn't really much of a review: i think this is a record the casual observer may pick up for whatever reason and thrust aside. i think this is one that one must make a conscious effort to listen to and appreciate for what it is.first listenl-- not impressed. but give it a chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding?","review":"Wow...what a letdown.

To think that Sir Paul actually is dragging the name of his former partner as a source of inspiration for this confused clutter is truly an injustice to Mr. Lennon's memory.Most of the melodies are disjointed and the lyrics are pedestrian.

I heard the single \\"Fine Line\\" on Paul's website and wasn't impressed. But after hearing the entire album, it does seem to be one of the better songs. In Rolling Stone, which claimed it to be his \\"Best work in years\\", they confess that the album doesn't \\"rock\\", which it doesn't. It's bland, boring and, I would say, one of his worst. A few of the songs are downright embarrassing (like \\"English Tea\\") If you want to buy it, please listen to the samples first. This is for DIE-HARD Macca fans only.

The first song \\"Fine line\\" was ok nothing to get excited about. The CD went downhill fast from their, couldn't even listen to each song, it was that bad. Nothing really uptempo on the CD, which would be ok if the slow stuff was good. McCartney's voice is strange to. We will just have to forgive him for this dud.

I have to say that, first of all, I thought that Paul McCartney was on a bit of a downside since his last album wasn't exactly that great. But he proved me wrong!!! This album is amazing!!!! Is by far one of the best of his career. It has this Beatle taste, the taste that McCartney has all over and that apparently does not want to get rid of it. It's simply beautiful. I heard it all for the first time and I already liked like 6 of the songs, then I heard it for a second and third time and I like every single song!!! This is for me, today, the album of the year.

So after reading some of the pre-reviews I was very much looking forward to Sir Paul's new CD. Well, it is a monster disappointment. Gone are the catchy hooks and inspiring craftsmanship we long ago have come to expect from Paul. The songs are drab, slow and dare I say? Boring. Not one upbeat rocker in the lot. Virtually all the songs come across as introspective meanderings that just fall flat. I rate this LP right up there with McCartney II which was filler music from the first track to the last. This? John Lennon said it best; \\"the sound you make is muzak to my ears\\". Really folks this is elevator music."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Huge Disappointment","review":"This effort is from a man that wrote \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" and \\"Hey Jude\\". When you keep this phrase in mind whilst listening to this cd, you simply cannot believe how melodically bereft this album is. Unfortunately, Macca has lost the art of writing hooks with any real quality. I first believed that McCartney II was an insult to his legion of fans, well this comes pretty close (albeit with better production). For those reading this review - yes I am a McCartney fan. I was a 12 year old that copped flack back in 79 for buying \\"Back To The Egg\\" and also believed that \\"Daytime, Nightime Suffering\\" was a great b side. Ah well at least I can go back and live in the past.

Yes, it's very light-hearted and skips along at a fair pace, but the mystery itself takes up only about half the book! The other half is some nonsensical tripe about several of the local ladies being kidnapped by a couple of rouges WHO HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE MYSTERY AT HAND. What?!? Why am I reading about them?? What on God's green earth does this have to do with the main story? The mystery itself is interesting enough conceptually, but it's ignored for so much of the book that it remains completely underdeveloped. The denouement itself takes about two pages; that's how simple it was, almost as though it were an afterthought."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent book","review":"My lab has the first edition of this book.

It took up a lot of topics, but treated each in a summary fashion. In fairness, though, I must say that this may be as good as any other book with its aim and scope, and better than some. Any writer on computer vision faces the problem of guessing who the reader is likely to be and what the reader's background is. Also, each of the various topics really merits a sizable book. In particular, the mathematics needs a truly mathematical treatment in a separate book.

Some missing episodes include:The Amazing Cosmic Awareness Of Duffy MoonP.J. and the President's SonMe and My Dad's New WifeThe Boy Who Drank Too MuchThe WaveMy Mother and the MonsterBridge Of Adam RushSummer SwitchThese sets are very misleading, allowing the buyer to believe they are getting all of the episodes. In my eyes, just the fact that The Boy Who Drank Too Much isn't included is enough to nix the idea of buying the set (Scott Baio and Lance Kerwin are stellar, believable teens in this excellently written and acted drama) The price they are asking for this set and the other split sets is ridiculous, and for that much money certainly it should be complete and then some."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anyone know the answer?","review":"I am still looking for 2 shows:1.

The watch stopped for good on January 6th at 4.20pm. Can't blame the battery (there isn't one).Deployment buckle clasp is awkward to use but you get used to it after a while. I chose this watch after reading the blurb on Stuhrling's website and some positive reviews on Amazon.com.

I read that the quality just wasn't there. I decided to purchase the watch anyway; besides, it wasn't really that much for an auto anyway. I have been pleasantly surprised that it really isn't as bad as most people say it is in terms of quality. To put it into perspective, the watch looks VERY similar to the Jaeger LeCoultre Reverso Duo Rose Gold (without the dual face). Considering that watch is between 10-15k, I think this is worth the money. Mine came with a power reserve feature and the twenty-four hour time, which is helpful to know when the date is going to change if you don't wear the watch that often. Mine did have a speck of dust that bugs me, but other than that, great watch. Oh, and I dig the clasp, even though it is a little light in alloy. Bottom line, if you have had an auto in the past and know what you are doing, it's a good watch for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pretty!","review":"I just love this chain.

I never did finish it because the writing was so bad. I've read Tolkien, Herman Melville, Sir Walter Scott, none of which are easy reads, but they know how to set a scene and tell a story. This was total rubbish. As a writer I have to refer to this book and wonder what better writer got pushed out for the publisher to have printed this. Not that editor's best moment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tough one, this one...","review":"I'm not at all new to the Merlin stories, but this book was way too deep into metaphores and the likes. I couldn't get through the first 50 pages. This book is something for native speakers, and I'm not sure of what language.

Highly disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Coming of the King","review":"As the other two reviewers noted, the book is difficult to get through. I made it past page 65, but I had to push myself. I actually purchased the book over 10 years ago, tried to read it, and became bored. I picked it up again recently, wanting to give it a second chance. I just couldn't stay with it. I am pretty well versed in Arthurian myth, Welsh mythology, etc., and the obscure references to gods, people, and places left me totally confused.I checked out the reviews here to see if others were having the same experience.I think this book looks good on a shelf, but not to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"I don't know how they advertise this as being a 180 capacity unit -- it can hold about half of that, maybe 100 at best (if you really squished your records). It doesn't look too bad (if you don't mind black carpet cases), unfortunately mine came with the bottom wood base slightly warped, which really wouldn't be that big of a deal since records sit on top anyway, but it does further speak to bad design and quality (and poor marketing).

I thought the descriptives were pretty realistic. Overall a pretty good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"It reads like a sex manual...","review":"The beginning of this book was all about graphic and lusty sex, and there was no substance to the story at all. I found Christina's indecisive skittishness to be teasingly annoying, and Max's promiscuity to be vulgar. It's not very believable that such a man who can't keep his zipper up would suddenly become a one-woman man after meeting Christina. The graphic language was a bit crude for my tastes.There's only so much erotica I could take before it got tedious and boring, so I nearly put the book down midstream. I'm glad I stuck with it because around page 150, the story picks up a considerable amount of depth. Christina and her cruel husband Hans return to Germany to celebrate Christmas with their sons and his very controlling family. Max is fiercely determined to help her escape this brutal marriage. When their affair is discovered, Hans attempts to severley punish her, and elements of suspense and adventure are introduced, redeeming the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Plain Bad....","review":"I like great plots, great characters and great love scenes, but this book lacked all three. The love scenes were just plain base, out of the gutter type scenes. And not once did I feel as if I knew anything about Christina other than her desire to feel wicked with Max, so it just didn't fly when \\"her people\\" raved about her. What were her good deeds? And Max was quite the womanizer but I do believe it was plausible for him to fall in love and remain faithful. True love can happen to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't recommend it!","review":"Early Susan Johnson books are great but recently, her novels are either so-so or so boring. What happened? Tempting doesn't measure up to Blaze,Wicked or Brazen. It is just one boring sex story similar to her late novels.I'm actually apprehensive about buying her next novels. In the past, i don't even wait for the review before i buy her new books but recently, i've been depending on the customer reviews.In Tempting, Max and Christina enter into an adulterous affair. It was somewhat justified because her husband was cheating on her and everybody in the book have affairs and multiple partners. Max and Christina have a lot of sex but the lack of variety makes it boring and i just skipped the sex scenes(which i don't usually do) so i could finish the book right away. I just could not recommend this book. It's overpriced and not worth every penny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing writing","review":"I do love a sexy romantic book and this book did give the sexy part, but it lacked in writing.

There's no story nor character development. All there is just plain sex. You don't care about the characters cuz you don't know them. It's like watching porn show. The story is stupid and just excuses for the sex scene. You have no feelings for the characters cuz they're just plain porn stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"All sex, just sex, no story","review":"I have read a number of SJs stories and as a general rule enjoy the story itself and of course the sex scenes are graphic and descriptive but usually written with some finesse as to avoid the porn label. Not so with this one. This is strictly a book written to display sexual acts and the story is non existent. We have two people who get together for a rendezvous, have sex and are now madly in love (when that could have happened I don't know because they weren't out of bed long enough to have an intellectual discussion and never have one that doesn't include the f or c word). The story is ridiculous and the conclusion was just to convenient. Not worth the read, sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I always rush out and buy Susan Johnson's books. This book left much to be desired. I was expecting the sex but not the bordom. I read a book a day and this book took me three weeks to read. I gave it one star because I forced myself through it. This book however will not stop me from buying and reading Ms.Johnson's books; I'll just have to buy them used, very used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Porn","review":"I used to be a fan of Susan Johnson, but this one has crossed the line into pure porn. There is very little plot and no characterization to support the many very graphic and detailed sex scenes. In fact, once Max and Christina get into the bedchamber, it's as if they're two different people, further straining the credibility of the book. The big problem facing the characters is solved through a rather flimsy, deus-ex-machina type of plot device, but by then you almost don't care. This will be the last Susan Johnson book I buy, especially since I can't put it on my bookshelf--I'd be embarrassed to have someone pick it up and skim through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Tempted","review":"Being the first time reading any of susan johnson's booksI won't be tempted to read any more .this book make's me think of the XXX rate movies ,threeminutes into it and you have see all ,just a repeat .ms johnson seems very very fond of the four letter wordthat starts with F that you find in any of our public toilets, the time frame and the language dose not go togethershe uses modern slang with 1800 time period.she needs to rewrite Tempting in today'ssetting ,there is little or no plot .I deal in books and belive me this is not a keeper"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring sex story.","review":"This is one boring sex story.I agree with one reviewer that this book is all about sex. I found it gross that when Christa walked in on her friend and Max having sex together, her friend offered to share him with her. What followed is one sex scene after the other that are so boring and seem like quickies. Max's obbsession with Christa is weird and all he cared about is how to get the husband out of the way so they can continue having sex, i guess. Ms Johnson suggests that it's OK to commit adultery if your husband is also commiting adultery. I didn't even believe that Max and Christa love each other. They have great sex but I don't think i'll call it love. This book is also overpriced... Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love...not..","review":"This is a love story? ....

All the great and fascinating characters are there, plus a few surprising ones from the past. This book is brilliantly paced and plotted, and reminds me very much of the Strunk & White writing primer dictum: \\"Make every word tell.\\" There are some splendid twists to this story, and every one of them is foreshadowed if you read carefully enough.Of course, the wry humor (especially Grunthor's) was enough to make me laugh out loud in more than a few places, which coupled with the satisfying action and further character development, make this a book you simply can't put down.While this novel stands on its own, it is much richer if the reader has read the trilogy first. I was very pleased to note that Haydon left some threads on which to start her next novel in this series, which can't come soon enough for me!BRAVO!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning- looks like the rest of the series may not be written","review":"Just a quick note that this is an unfinished series. There were supposed to be five books in this series but only the first three have been written, with the last being published in 2006. Nothing has been heard from the author regarding this series in years. It's quite likely this series will never be finished and it left everything hanging. Very unsatisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book, but the Kindle version had a lot of mistakes.","review":"I have read this book at least a couple times in paperback. When I read it on my Kindle however, there were so many typos and word mistakes and places where the words just all ran together that it was really hard to read. I think if I had been reading it for the first time I probably would have just given up reading it at all. Especially because there where times that the mistakes changed the sentences so much that it made no sense and if I hadn't known what was going on from reading it previously, I would have been totally lost.As for the book itself. It's not the best of the series, but I love the characters so much that I like it anyway. This book and the next one, Elegy for a Lost Star just seem like filler books. The Assassin King is where the story really picks up again. And of course the original trilogy is wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Breath Catcher","review":"The story was great! Elizabeth Haydon pulls you farther into Rhapsody's story(past and present). It re-introduces her old tormentor, Michael, with a great twist.

Very easy to clean, less smells. This pail is slightly larger than most available in this price range which makes it more useful without giving up space. However, we were very disappointed that the lid is too snug to actual use in the closed position for daily inside use. In order not to have to use 2 hands to open it [one pulling up on the lid and one holding the side knob] I have to keep it tilted open [most inside use requires being able to just pull off the top with one hand because the other is full of veggie scraps] - The snug lid is useful for while making the trip to the back yard compost bin when it is completely full."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unusable after 3 months because side split","review":"I bought this compost pail with a mother's day gift certificate and loved it.

I empty it about twice/week, turning my compost tumbler as I add to it, so it creates a good cycle of rotating/emptying two times a week. I usually wash it out after every couple of trips.The outside finish is still just like new, no turning color, dulling or rusting at all. It's just PERFECT. I like the size, not too big to be an eyesore, yet large enough that I don't feel I'm running outside to empty it constantly.Excellent product I highly recommend!

I found his telling of the shabby treatment of Joan by her mother, Lilian Fontaine and sister, Olivia, to be heartbreaking.

The vocabulary was not reviewed prior to the very quick paced converstions, so it was hard to work on proper pronunciation. The chapters did not have very practical topics (You are a secretary, aren't you?, Do you want to see a photograph of my family?, Do you still work in a hotel? Do you still have a temperature?). I found Vietnamese for Beginners by Jake Catlett and Huong Nguyen to be much more worthwhile. It has a lot of practical vocabulary which is slowly pronounced prior to the conversations.

Alternatively, recording in 2 speeds could be provided - slow and natural. Individual vocabulary words could be read as well. As for the text, vocabulary choice and exercises, they are not bad and manageable, not always spoon-fed but the words can be found in the provided glossary.

There is no problem with describing the generation of lift using Newtonian momentum principles in a global sense, but this does not imply that classical circulation theory is invalid! This book is written with a great deal of misunderstanding of fluid dynamics. Fluids cannot be analyzed as a discrete number of particles which act independently of each other. Due to the continuum nature of fluids, air flow around a wing cannot flow in a \\"regenerative\\" pattern as proposed in this book.

Many of the assumptions made in the starting premises of this book are faulty and thus subsequent developments are invalid.

My foot is long and narrow - a 15AA - and I have an unusual forefoot angulation. The Dunham last and large toe box does a good job of accommodating my foot.

In large groups of people, you can usually run across a perpetual complainer, and that seems to be what the author's attitude is towards his various superiors in Vietnam. I'm not denying that some or all were incompetent; it's just that it gets tiring to hear his rebellious attitude towards them.

Arthur opened his sole and was brave in revealing all the details of this war that he experienced and all the emotions that he felt, including some that may be surprising and even offensive to some people but are typical of what the vast majority of soldiers felt in Vietnam. The book is written in great detail and description which made me feel as if I was right there with Arthur, it made me feel all the emotions of a soldier who is totally uncomfortable and in fear for his life 24/7.

Guys in the so-called rear were attacked by sappers and mortared. Those rear echelon men who flew in slicks were bigger and more obvious targets than any platoon size element on the ground.

To my mind, Mr. Witnik has exactly captured the contradictions of that war.The primary goal of every soldier in every war is to survive.

I would definitely recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good deal","review":"For fifty bucks you can't get much better than this.

There is still room left for a flash or another lens. I like the fact that you can customize the inside to how you want it. There are several pieces to use. I really like the shoulder strap b/c it is nice and cushioned and makes it easy to carry. One of the main reasons I chose this case is b/c it zips. It also has buckles that you can use for easier access if you don't want to use the zipper. There are plenty of extra pockets for other things such as batteries, chargers, SD cards, etc. I also like the straps on the bottom front for a tripod! The yellow color inside the bag makes it easy to see things in there. I just LOVE this camera case! It is very well made and seems to be very safe and cushioned for my camera. It also seems that it will keep dirt and dust out fairly well. I totally recommend it to anyone that has a DSLR camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ape Case","review":"I am very happy with this case. It holds a Nikon 5100, 2 lenses, a point and shoot, two battery chargers and all other accessories with room to spare. It is extremely durable with thick padding and a rigid construction and seems much safer than other bags I was looking at locally.My only problem with the bag is there is no pocket large enough to hold my cameras manual.

The chapters continually get harder (like any other text book) and the example problems are amazing! Very thorough and easily thought-out, not a quick answer! They definitely take time to think through and discuss options with other classmates! I'm extremely glad that my professor chose this text book!

It would serve as a great reference book for a lab researcher or grad student. But it's way too technical and dense for an introductory genetics class.

Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way Too Much...","review":"This book is used in my undergrad genetics class and I don't think it should be. The text is way too difficult to understand and it is also very dense for an intro class. The way sentences are worded on the chapter problems problems are confusing.

My professor even had trouble understanding what some of the questions are asking."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Review Like No Other","review":"I think this book is preety good. It is funny, sad, and exciting. I enjoyed reading this book very much. If you are craving adventure and want to know what it would feel like to leave your home and change schools for one year I highly suggest this book.

Over all this was a realistic book and Beverly Cleary is an superb writer with a lot of talent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"enjoyable","review":"i enjoyed the book, but it was a little pretentious, and the story was similar to that of Jean and Johnny. it did make me want to go to a different school for a year, though. a good, if not excellent, book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet First-times","review":"I think the whole point if this book is that, things aren't always one-sided. We have to learn to think things by different angles. And that's when you start to learn things, you start to understand how other people feel. Just like Shelley, she's never left her hometown before, so she never knew what was going on the outside world. Before, at her hometown, she thought yellow slickers were awful, but when she leaves for Southern California, slickers were the real fashion everyone was wearing. It was a whole new experience for her, and a good one too"},{"rating":"2","title":"What an ending to a great book!","review":"I just loved this book! It is a great book for teens or preteens.

I thought that if you havent read this book, its not really worth reading, but I still love Beverly Cleary. By the age of 10, I had read the book Fifteen about 20 times.

Seasons were covered in five pages and, in one instance, the text reviewed one game by stating that Honus had hit, \\"a three-run double, but the Pirates lost 5-2.\\" How can the Pirates lose 5-2 if Honus hit a three-run double? There seemed to be many errors of this nature in the book as the editing was not very crisp.I tried not to be too harsh in my review as I know the material on Honus is not easy to find, but even the material that is available in the text is not presented very well. Honus Wagner was arguably the greatest player of his time and a simple, interesting person off the field, so his story is indeed an important one to baseball fans. Unfortunately, I don't think this biography is the one you want to read if you want a well-written, in-depth portrait of Honus Wagner."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"I wasn't disappointed in this product.

They have recently become so threadbare and worn that holes have appeared. This isn't really a complaint because at 200 thread count I didn't expect them to last forever, it's just a heads up to let you know how long you can expect them to last. The color on these sheets began to fade almost immediately and now I think there is more blue dye that has bled into my mattress pad than still remains in the sheets themselves. The Twin XL sheets are a very tight fit as well, I have found myself checking the tag many times to make sure I didn't order regular twin sheets by mistake. The one and only good thing I can say about this sheet set is that it looks cool, for a little while anyway, once the color starts to go they mostly just look gross."},{"rating":"2","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"My wife had bought some bargain sheets for my son's bed at JC Penny's.

I had two pairs for two winters in a row, and neither one made it even half-way through the winter. I only wore them indoors as slippers, and liked the support and comfort. But within a month the insoles wear thin and start coming loose - as your feet sweat they stick to your foot and get wrinkled and messed up in the shoe so that you constantly have to take the shoes off, take out the insoles, and put them back in correctly. It makes them completely useless, and is unforgivable in shoes of this price.I have never had this problem with any of my Uggs, but every Merrell shearling shoe/slipper seems to do this - poor quality and no attention to a fairly important detail is inexcusable for a $90 - 100 shoe. As I said, I do like the support and impact protection, but they seriously need to fix this problem that has been around for at least 3 years!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Premillennial literalism","review":"I didn't find this book very helpful.

Mr. Calder's book describes the nuclear state of the world around 1980, and how near we came to conflict. His writes well, and has no difficulty keeping the reader's attention. But I found many of his opinions to be as dangerous as war itself. At one point he criticizes the American Congress for refusing to make surrender plans! Apparently he was prepared to give up before a fight even started.

And that's pretty much what I bought it for: some drawers for storage, plus a little file storage capacity.The drawers work great. They operate smoothly, without sticking. There're two of them, which is nice for organization. But the filing part leaves a little to be desired. Maybe I'm just doing something wrong, but hanging file folders don't seem to fit in with the folders parallel to the front, like in most filing cabinets. But they do fit in 'sideways'. This might be okay, but then the included supports don't really stay in place, and so trying to go through the folders usually results in some coming loose.The construction seems sturdy (and heavy!), and the casters work well, and it looks great.

I also think that it was an insult to true fitness women out there to not be featured on this month's muscle fitness hers and have Kim Kardashian on the cover instead.

While the minerals may be in the areas indicated, the maps are so crude that the likelihood of your finding the sites is very poor. I have tried using the guide for several years with almost no success."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book","review":"Night Journey is a compelling work of literature by a young author destined to become a literary star. In his remarkable novel, Kalam dares to go where few other writers have gone, using the Third Ward in Phoenix Arizona, an area where prostitution and drugs are rampant, as the setting for his novel. Night Journey beautifully tells the tale of Eddie Bloodpath, a young man who struggles to become a boxer in order to avoid a life of hustling and drug dealing. In addition to Eddie, Night Journey's cast of characters includes pimps, hustlers, drug dealers, and prostitutes- all of whom are depicted with a sense of tragic realism. Few other writers could have written about Phoenix's Third Ward with the same sense of grace and humanity. Although this book certainly deserves 5 stars, I'm withholding one star until the author writes a sequel finishing Eddie's tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Young Writer","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, which describes people, places, and events completely outside anything I have ever (or will ever for that matter) experience.

This book will tell you virtually nothing about the neighborhood, aside from the casual mention of a few streets and places.

It could have happened anywhere anytime in America, in Brooklyn or Chicago as well as in Washington Heights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could have said more","review":"The author is a sensitive soul.

There is a chapter for each Super Bowl up through the 2000 game. Each chapter is a story told by someone who was a part of the game. Stories are from coaches, players and even referees. They offer different perspectives on the game and how the experience affected them and their teams. It was an enjoyable read and the insert comments from the CBS sports people who covered the games were also neat to see. I would recommend this for any football fan to add to their sports book collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Bowl Sunday: The Day American Stops.","review":"The good things about this book that make it unique are that you get to hear the points of view of important people in Super Bowl history that you normally do not get to hear from. (linemen, non-superstar players, team executives) Their unique perspectives on the biggest of all football games makes this book stand apart from the typical Super Bowl book.The negatives are that for the money, the book is too short. There are a couple of factual errors, as well as printing errors, where the same paragraphs and pages are accidentally repeated.

With tax and shipping you can easily spend twice the ammount of the original MSRP if not more- Design, The ship is constructed in such a way that you must remove the upper portion to play inside it. To me this detracts from it asteticly. The Republic ship currently out now has a better design. I suppose this is to be expected as this set is several years older.- On a very minor note the weapons the are included are the old style stud type.the weapons that are included in todays sets are much more apealing to me.In closeing, despite the few short commings I have mentioned I would recomend this set to anyone who wants the Star Destroyer and missed out on it when it was out originaly. Unless Lego reissues it, this set is the only way you will get a Star Destroyer if you want one for your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gift","review":"I purchased this for my 9 year old grandson for Christmas, he was thrilled with it.

I could watch these episodes over and over again, which is why I bought this DVD set. Arrested Development jokes often play off of previous episodes, so they're funnier when you watch several in a row.The quirky antics of the Bluth family, combined with the witty, pun-filled writing, make for a show that keeps you laughing the whole way through (even if sometimes you feel a little bad)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Funny and VERY Under Rated Show","review":"Do you remember a few years back when Family Guy only made it to 3 seasons and then Fox pulled it from the air? The fans of the show were floored by this decision because they knew how original and funny the series was, but somehow the show managed to pass under the radar of the mainstream success. It wasn't until the DVD box set showed explosive success that Fox realized the mistake they made in pulling the show off the air. This is where Arrested Development currently sits right now. The show passed quickly in and out of the mainstream lime light without much attention. However, the box set is blowing up so quickly that almost everyone I know can quote the show with even more familiarity than Family Guy. If you've ever sat through even a few episodes, you'll know what I'm referring to. This is truly one of the best series that you've probably never heard of."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREATEST SHOW EVER","review":"After hearing rave-reviews for many years, I finally decided to watch what I thought was going to be a mildly amusing show and found what is quite possibly the greatest show ever created.

I only recall watching a single episode which was good, but not enough to keep me interested in the show. A couple of months ago, I saw the entire series on sale, and decided to go for it after hearing plenty of critical acclaim. I sat down, watched it, and realized what a great show this was. The dialogue is well-written, the characters are varied and interesting, with plenty of growth, and a storyline that keeps moving, but is not overly complicated. I can safely say it's one of my favorite TV series now. I got the complete series for a great deal on Amazon ($27.99), but it's easily worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Show","review":"I purchased this on a whim when it went on sale, and it did not disappoint. This is probably the funniest show I have ever seen. There are so many undertones and jokes that it takes a second viewing to fully understand. The only problem is that the show got dropped and there were only 3 seasons!In terms of quality, it is standard for a TV series.

But mine is Gob.You can enjoy the comedy of this show with any episode you happen to watch. However, to get the most out of it, watch all seasons from the start. The episodes build on each other. The more you watch, the more you know about the characters and the story. Everything funny ties into the history of the characters and story, so the humor grows and grows. I watch laughing at what is happening and how it relates to what has happened previously!It's a shame we only got 3 seasons of this show. Somehow, not everyone gets it. But if you get it, you'll LOVE it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Arrested Development Box Set","review":"Far and away the funniest sitcome to come out of The States since The Simpsons... Deliciously funny, brilliant acting and every time I watch it I see something new or see someone in a whole new light - usually hilarious but not flattering.Even though every character should be despicable, you can't help loving their self centred, completely oblivious lifestyle.Liza Minelli is an absolute gem and I relished every moment of her return guest appearances.For me this whole series is pure genius and watching it complete indulgance. Makes you laugh outloud, cringe and be forever grateful that I don't live in the Bluth Family bubble. The humour is 'quirky' but never alienating. To everyone involved I say bravo - thank you for taking a chance on something that does not fit the mould.Well worth the investment, you will watch this series time and time again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Show Ever Made","review":"The show has and always will be amazing, if you haven't seen it yet, I promise you will not be dissapointed with this purchase.

The odd silences really bring some hilarious moments in the show. Operation Hot Mother, just thinking about that makes me happy.At different times,the show begins to focus on different characters for different directions in the show. Whenever this happens, it is so seamless, the transitions are so natural and the timing is perfect. Gob, Buster, Tobias, George Michael, Maybee the rest of the characters have such independent personalities. The absurdity of it all is so original. Now that rumours of an AD movie are around, I'm becoming more and more excited. If you have a chance to catch this show, watch it! The show is one of my favourites."},{"rating":"2","title":"bang for the buck","review":"Great show in a great package.

I would not recommend this particular set."},{"rating":"2","title":"You need your own copy of this great show","review":"This is a great opportunity to own the entire series of a perfectly written, smart and irreverent comedy.

Ended too early.","review":"This is an excellent series that is worth repeated watching. There are lots of sight gags that you will probably miss on the first viewing.The plots tend to hang together well with different characters having their own motivations and the results of all the in-fighting lead to unexpected results.Shame on the execs for killing it off.At least they managed to tie up most of the loose ends when it finished - unlike many other cancelled series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This show is so funny.

However, the item was listed as \\"Like New,\\" yet the 3rd season case was broken inside, causing the disc to tumble around. By the time I got it, it had several scratches.

Now normally I'm not a big fan of TV series, but I guess this was just an awesome show that lost everything and had no choice but to box up all three seasons together. It's Arrested... No, seriously, A.D.'s complex, cleverly crafted wit grows on you with multiple viewings, so I would certainly suggest fans own it on DVD. It's unique style and memorable characters are entirely its own, but those who like the likes of the Office or 30 Rock might find this right up their ally. Hats off to Hurwitz, Howard, and all the actors for pulling off some masterfully crafted, too-good-to-last entertainment before it's development was finally arrested."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best shows ever","review":"Arrested Development is one of the funniest shows ever.

Too bad, because the mainstream missed out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something for Everybody","review":"Arrested Development, although no longer on TV networks, lives on with great frivolity in a home near you. What makes Arrested Development amazing are the dynamics between so many seemingly dissident family members who can at the same time, leave no doubt in your mind that they are quite complimentary. Every viewer can find parts of himself or herself in the characters on the show. Soon, the inside jokes in the series will become inside jokes for you and your friends too.The more you watch Arrested Development, the more you will enjoy it because there are great nuances and amazing situational comedy supplemented by a cast of loonies and jokesters. You may even wish that you grew up a Bluth! Well, probably not."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best no longer on television...","review":"This show has some amazing writers and actors and it's non-stop laughter!

For example, on the first season bundle, the cover says it has \\"Inside look at arrested development,\\" Museum's cast panel discussion, original songs by david schwartz, and tv land featurettes. But actually, it does not have any of that. It only has just the shows, blooper reels, and commentary. It is the same for the second and third season. It is missing extra features. I feel cheated by false advertising, so i gave the DVD only a 2 star. Other than that, great show. The two star is for the DVD and not for the show. Everyone here knows how great the show is, so i don't need to rate the show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damaged cases inside!

I really wish they would work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"I'm on the last season and it's a disappointment slogging over the first two episodes. Why all the 5 star ratings?Now I understand why, thankfully, there are only three seasons. Entertaining TV shows would be House, Lost, CSI, 24, The West Wing, Ally McBeal, Heroes and so many others. Funny would be Arthur (Dudley Moore), My Cousin Vinny (Joe Pesci), Trading Places (Eddie Murphy), The Pink Panther (Peter Sellers) or The Three Stooges. Arrested Development is anything but funny or entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why the hype?!","review":"I bought season 1 of \\"Arrested Development\\" because of the rave reviews posted here, and I feel gypped. The characters are complete stereotypes-- unusual stereotypes, admittedly-- but totally cardboard. The level of unpredictable interaction among the characters is virtually nil, and the story lines are silly without being entertaining. I'm amazed that so many reviewers found it so satisfying. Compared to, say, \\"Weeds,\\" this series has no grip or bite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this DVD set!","review":"If you enjoy witty banter and intelligent television for a change, you will love this DVD set.

The show is so densely packed with dry and matter of fact humor that you can't help but watch the episodes over and over while embracing the different layers of the show. Fans of Python, Fawlty Towers, The Office, Mr. Show or even Seinfeld will love this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best TV Comedy","review":"I loved this show when it was on TV but missed a few episodes in season 1 & 2 and didn't get to see any of the 3rd season because it wasn't shown in my region.

Possibly a bad connection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Season one was a masterpiece...","review":"Would really rate a 4.5. The first two seasons (especially the first) were absolutely hilarious, but the show jumped the shark halfway thru the second season. Looking forward to the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Great Series","review":"I had never seen this comedy series before. I purchased the complete series based on the positive comments made here on Amazon. I watched the first couple of episodes and thought they were okay, but weren't the rave everyone commented about. But then as I watched the next few, the show really grew on me. The combination of narration and film clips worked great. The comedy ranges from prop-gags to intellectual humor - all stacked on each other to the point you will probably miss some of it the first time around. Others have already discussed the show in detail, so all I can say is they were right - it is a great series. If you haven't seen this series, get the full three-year set. You'll love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best show ever? probably","review":"There's always money in the banana stand.What more can be said about this show that hasn't already been said?

Now I am mad at myself because maybe if more like me had, it woud still be on TV. I love it! It doesn't talk down to you; the characters are interesting and quirky; the plotlines are twisty and hilarious. I'm enjoying every minute of it (and also realizing how attractive Jason Bateman is)."},{"rating":"2","title":"COME ON!!

From a comedy standpoint, I do believe it's the best.The cast of characters work extremely well together to provide a phenomenal comedy.Unfortunately the show really only lasted 2.5 seasons. (Yes, it's \\"3\\" seasons, but the third-season was a limited number of episodes.) Even more unfortunately, I never came across this show until a few years *AFTER* it was canceled from the airwaves. I say unfortunately in this regard, as if I (and others) had come across it sooner, perhaps it could have lived a longer life.Not going to write much more about this show, with 995 other reviews (and most of them being 5 stars).Bottom Line: Just watch it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A keeper!

It is up there with the likes of Seinfeld and The Office (US), which are, in my personal opinion, the two greatest comedies ever to grace my television screen. Lovers of those two shows will also love and appreciate the humor in Arrested Development."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show!","review":"This show should never have been canceled. This collection is a must have for any fans of TV comedy. Simply amazing. Great writing and great acting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best. Show.

Only comment: I wish the commentary contained a bit more insight into their production process, but that's a minor critique. Excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Of course I'm satisfied with this purchase!","review":"Arrested Development is undoubtedly one of the best shows television has seen in recent times. Every time I watch any episode, I am amazed to see a new facet of the script that I didn't notice before. The depth of the characters, humor, motifs, and themes is not something you see very often on TV, especially now that the show is off the air.What better way is there to celebrate Arrested Development than by purchasing a collection of the complete series on DVD?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is one scratched?","review":"Upon taking the set out of the Shipping box I heard a rattle.

I'm not sure who to blame this on but I would avoid this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up to the hype","review":"I bought this as a gold box special since all my friends rave about it, and feel it was so unjustly cancelled. I did catch a few episodes of the 2nd or 3rd season when it was on and figured that I didn't understand it because I hadn't been following it from the beginning.Well, I'm almost done the entire first season already, and I still don't get it.

Now after years of touring, Winners Never Quit, Control, Achilles Heal and the Headphones album, he just sounds like a bitter old man. \\"Fewer Moving Parts\\" might be the worst one yet -- for crying out loud, track 3 is about his choice to pursue a \\"solo\\" career! Dude, no one wants to hear about that stuff, no matter how facetiously you present it. Somewhere, somehow, Bazan turned into a crochety, unpleasant grandpa writing cold, distant, heavyhanded songs that overly generalize their subjects and condescend to the listener. He needs to somehow summon whatever weird ghost inspired him to write songs in the past place and get some of the old inspiration back. If he can.Two stars for a sentimental favorite, I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Durable","review":"This looked like a great thing but it's not durable enough for kids to play with.

Convoluted, confusing and almost impossible to read and comprehend on your own if you didn't already know the topic. In addition I had the student solution guide which was full of the wrong answers to many of the problems. The verbiage used and some of the typos in this book made using it as a student... a nightmare.

In addition, I have pictures of the package the book was shipped in and it shows that upper right and lower left corners were exposed and protruding out of the box. I feel very mislead and taken advantage of in this situation.

There is no way it is re-sellable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book for AP-B Physics","review":"I have used Giancoli for several years for my AP-B Physics Class which I typically cover in just one year as opposed to the recommended two years. I have found that the Giancoli 6th edition is a great resource for the students to use when I am hitting them with all of Physics for the first time. Giancoli covers the fundamentals extremely well and then builds upon them with examples to create critical thinking.The only negative I have with the book is the fact that many of the problems are not SI based. In the AP exam they deal only with Kilograms, Meters and Seconds and I really would rather have them focus on problem solving rather than have to convert units first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended as a college-level text","review":"I have used this book extensively for the past two years in my trig-based physics classes. The problems frequently force the student to make assumptions that simply aren't reasonable and the book glosses over content that really should be covered in greater detail. I know this is typical of many physics texts, however, when your book dedicates all of one paragraph to adiabatic changes of state you might want to reconsider it as your text."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible text book!","review":"Physics isn't the easiest subject to learn but this Giancoli text makes it look even more complicated than it is. The book is unnecessarily wordy. Very heavy on algebra but a bit light on the actual principles of physics, and many of the explanations and sample problems given in the chapters are nothing at all like the questions at the end of each chapter. Hard to believe this book is the choice of most physics professors. I found it frustrating. Would have been better if Giancoli would just get to the point instead of all those long paragraphs with a lot of useless information. Not a good book for beginning physics students. If you really want to learn physics get a different book to use as a supplement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginning physics students","review":"This book has some great diagrams and a lot of interesting problems, but learning from this book is very difficult.The text is lacking: A lot of things are missing that would really help students understand some of the more difficult concepts. I like the Walker text much better. Walker also has a lot of great diagrams, but the text is much easier to follow. Walker seems to intuitively know what you are unsure of and answers the questions in the text before you have to ask them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating book because of different teaching style","review":"I used this book for a college course in physics and found it very frustrating. The book has good intentions of not showing you how to solve everything to try and get you to apply physics yourself and not just use some memorized formulas. However the book falls short in that it doesn't provide a foundation of how to go about solving problems when you're not sure what equations to use. As someone who took a prior physics course I found this book very disappointing with their approach of throwing you in the water and seeing if you can swim. If you plan to learn physics effectively I would plan on buying another physics book to supplement this one to answer the physics questions this book doesn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be wary!","review":"Well after I ordered the book, I have still yet to receive the item.

Strange things start to happen with the mail and I won't give it away. This book reaches out and grabs ahold of by the throat.Little-ites will see characters fleshed out and small-town america represented well here.

The case is very high quality metal, the cover is glass for almost the entire surface, the watch is much thinner than other models (only 10mm) and has heft - in short, this model exudes quality. On the downside, the functions are very limited - chronograph, alarm, and a second time zone. If you want weekly alarms or flix, etc. - forget it. This watch is more versatile than most TIMEXs as this one uses traditional spiedel straps - Timex began shipping inferior proprietary plastic watch straps on most of its newer models starting in ~2009.Still, I would gladly own one of these watches again, as the quality is way above average."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, elegant, reliable watch","review":"The large LCD numbers make the time easy to see, even from a distance.

Over the year and a half I have had it two-thirds of the black plastic rim (the bezel), including the button guides, has dropped off in two pieces in mild, daily use. The buttons are still attached and work but are askew and must be moved into the right alignment to function.Bought a T77517 in Aug 2007, lost it off my wrist in the yard in May 2010. Found it in the yard again in fall 2010, still working, rain and all, and I still use it when I work in the yard. That rim is still intact; it is not black but grey.I do not know if the bezel has been cheapened in all the Atlantis 100's or if there is a difference in the resin in the bezel of the T77511 and T77517.

It feels a bit thin and unsubstantial compared to my old Ironman (which could be a positive if you want light weight). For my purposes, it disappoints on a fashion level and on a practical level (readability during sports), I'll be returning and getting something larger.Love the easy Amazon returns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Atlantis 100","review":"This is about the 5th Atlantis 100 I've owned. I've worn one daily for more than 10 years. It's not fancy but the watch does what it's supposed to. It keeps time well, has dual time zones for travel, an alarm, count down and count up timers. The Indiglo display is bright enough and big enough for my old eyes to read it at night until the battery is almost dead. My watches have been underwater a lot and only one ever failed during scuba diving. The only problem with the watch is that replacing the battery when it finally fails after a few years and pressure testing the watch costs about as much as replacing the watch. The plastic band is better than the expansion version for diving and it wears out after one to two years. But at less than $30 for the watch, plus the cost of replacing the band once, it's a great deal for those who don't need to show off a fancy watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"anybody can take orb photos with corn starch","review":"All you need to get orbs in your photos is:*a digital camera with flash*a cellulose based powder such as pollen, corn starch, whole wheat flour*darknessToss the powder into the air and photograph.

Don't repeat my mistake.Nice pictures. That is all.Receipts require ingredients that hard to find or cost much.

I am a do-it-yourself kind of person and these recipes were fun and healthy.

Nothing replaces the soothing and relaxing effect of the spa that you can only get while being pampered by someone else. But if you're like me mixing up a few of these pure elixirs at home is sure to be an ideal replacement. Most likely you already have the ingredients at home so just whip up a nice lavender salt scrub and enjoy pampering yourself. A few ingredients that come in handy for a nice body scrub are, rock salt (easy to find at the grocery store), olive oil, lavender oil extract or dried rosemary. There's much more too. for instance, masks, wraps and spa foods.

It gives a good treatment of fullerenes (C60 and related compounds), and how to grow crystals of these. An alternative means of growing nanoparticles is by electrochemistry, and this is also discussed. Yet another method is via electrodeposition.Various materials are covered.

I'm not generally drawn to yoga, but because I have liked Jillian Michael's other videos, I decided to give this one a chance. I have very limited time and limited space, so I was pleased to discover that this video provides an outstanding (and truly difficult!) workout without requiring any extra equipment (such as handweights). My previous experience with yoga classes left me a bit frustrated because they seemed to focus more on breathing and relaxation, without giving enough of a true workout. Not this one! Jillian uses yoga principles, but with her own dynamic twist. The result is an intense, effective workout. I would definitely buy any future yoga or pilates-based workout videos put out by Jillian -- I hope that she makes more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Um.?","review":"Bought it a week ago and tried it out three times.

If anyone else likes it, more power to you. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not real yoga","review":"Ok I'm not a yoga expert but neither is Jillian Michaels.Although she's lean and in great shape, she's lacking flexibility, even she admits it in the video. I was very dissapointed not to see real yoga in her sequences, this is just a workout shaped as yoga, but not the real thing.And one more very important thing, alignment is not taught at all, even the advanced model is not well aligned at times, and that is crucial in yoga, especially because with certain movements you may suffer injuries due to bad posture.This is definitely not for beginners.

It includes mainly fast paced yoga moves and some modified moves, but I would say NOT to purchase it if you're looking to do yoga ONLY as this is much more fast paced and not really \`relaxing' as yoga usually would be at a normal pace. I like that there is someone on either side of Jillian doing advanced moves and beginner moves, so if you're just starting out, you can do a little bit less and work up to the advanced moves. Some are hard at first, but with a few times of practicing you'll be able to do them. I wouldn't include this as your only cardio though, and would definitely recommend some other type of cardio with your workout regimen as well (such as elliptical, treadmill, etc.). Overall, a great DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good 2nd Workout","review":"I got this video in an attempt to mix up my exercise routine. It only requires a yoga mat. However, it is not really a true yoga video. It uses some of the yoga postures as a starting place for cardio routines. It was reasonably difficult for me as a very regular exerciser. I have been doing it in the evenings to supplement my am workouts (30-40 minutes of running or intense cardio). A word of advice: do this on a relatively empty stomach. I am used to eating a little bowl of Special K before my workouts. I promptly got incredibly nauseated when I did this before trying the video.

It's really challenging but there are beginner and intermediate versions of the poses to help get you through the workout. I've been taking Yoga classes at the gym on and off for about three years but this is my favorite yoga workout ever. It's really helping me get back into shape after giving birth to my fifth baby.

I am a great JM fun, she kicks butt in the Banish Fat, Trouble Zones and 30-day shred DVDs, but this one.... I love Yoga, I have DVDs (try Bryan Kest for a great workout at the right tone) and I have classes where my butt is kicked without ever raising the the tone of voice just by hanging out in a pose for a minute. Jillian's instruction feels all wrong for this type of exercise. She is meant to do boot camps, not lead meditation practices. I should have known better when I bought the DVD, but I really liked everything she did so I thought I give it a try. Big waste of money. Maybe it's ok for people who have never done yoga before in their lives and who want a variation on daily training, but it's definitely not for those who actually want to do yoga. I think Jillian should just stick with what she knows and make more kick-butt workouts to offer variety to her audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I bought this based on a casual reading of the reviews yet was very disappointed.

I've tried doing this video multiple times on Level 1 and still find it very frustrating. She does not properly explain the poses, nor does she give you any time to get into the groove of one pose before going into another. It's like she just expects you to be able to watch the screen and immediately know how to do the pose. Of course, even if it were that easy, for many of the poses your head is supposed to be down. Maybe if you are already well versed in yoga poses, it would be better. I've done a few classes, but am still very new to yoga. For semi-beginners, bluntly put, this video stinks. This was my first Jillian Michaels video, and will be my last. Maybe she should go searching for quick cash in an area more suitable. She is clearly NOT a yoga instructor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not this one...","review":"I have three other Jillian DVDs - and love them. I was hoping this would be intense in a different way, like yoga should be. The other reviewers are right: this isn't yoga. It is yoga poses in her style of circuit training.

I enjoy a lot of her DVDs (30 Day Shred, 6 Week 6 Pack, and the Ultimate Body duo). I bought the Yoga Meltdown because I wanted to increase balance and flexibility, but without the guru-mantra-hippie feel of other Yoga videos. What I got instead could be entitled \\"Stretching 101\\" instead of any kind of meltdown. I didn't even break a sweat, so this DVD was shuffled to the bottom of the pile.

She rushes though the moves at a fast pace and focuses very little on form.

She tries to combine cardio movement with yoga and the end result is something that's not really yoga at all, even though it incorporates yoga postures. The box says vinyasa, but to be more accurate, it should be called \\"yoga cardio fusion\\" or something along those lines. It's by no means an intro to vinyasa and there is almost zero emphasis on proper alignment or breathing. If you just want a workout and don't really care how you get from point A to point B, maybe this DVD is for you. If this is your first venture into yoga practice, you will most likely get the wrong idea. If I were looking for an introduction to vinyasa yoga and I thought this DVD was it, I would be completely turned off to practicing yoga."},{"rating":"2","title":"very happy","review":"not your traditional yoga, as the flows are much faster paced. Very happy with the workout. also enjoyed there was more instruction than \\"inspiration\\" as seen in 30 day shred. heart rate elevated and i did break a sweat. totally worth the money. using in unison with 30 day shred to prevent boredom/burnout."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a very good yoga video","review":"I love the JM workout DVDs and I enjoy yoga. Since much of her strength training is yoga based, I thought this would be better.It just isn't. She doesn't guide you toward proper positions and even promotes pushing to improper positions. I was not impressed with this DVD ... if I could return it, I would."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD!","review":"I really like this DVD. While as many others have already pointed out, it is not a traditional yoga routine, I like the athleticism she introduces to the practice. Workout 1 has become a nice, easy workout for me to start my week with, while still maintaining the right amount of sweat and strain.I'm not the biggest fan of workout 2. It's hard for me to hold my balance while incorporating reps/movement, and I can't do a couple of the \\"bonus\\" moves. Honestly, I think workout 1 is an overall better workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast paced intense yoga moves!!","review":"I like a high cardio workout, so I purchased this video thinking it would make me like yoga. It's got a lot of fun and interesting moves that are extremely challenging to your balance/core and breathing patterns. It is a little too fast paced for me personally, when being so stretched out I want a little more time between one move to the other. Do not let that stop you from buying this video though! If you like yoga, but you want to incorporate cardio then you'll dig this. This video really leaned me out, especially my arms and back. I really enjoy the resting poses :) This is an ideal video for someone who enjoys fast paced/intense yoga moves! There are two levels which are both difficult, so if you're a yoga beginner I would not recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yoga","review":"It has been great! easy going easy to understand it almost feels as if she is in the room with you to get you tooshie going and doing it right!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good morning stretch","review":"Jillian always gives me a good challenge. I was surprised by how easy the first video was....of course she came through with her usual \\"push you to your limits\\" personna in the 2nd video.It's a good yoga workout for people that aren't looking to be yogi pretzels!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Few Poses, Fast","review":"Not a great variety of poses. Lots of speed work for cardio followed by holding pose for strength. Get slightly sore in 30 min. Decent DVD but I've already ordered a different one hoping for a more traditional yoga class feel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for non-yogi people","review":"I've never been a fan of yoga, i've tried, but i just don't feel like its enough of a cardiovascular work out. My friend had this video and recommended it. I have 3 other Jillian Videos (six week 6-pack, ripped in 30 and 30 day shred) all of which i love. I have only done level 1 on the yoga so far, I don't do it as much as the other videos because it is a little longer, but I do really enjoy it. Its based on yoga and yoga positions, but its dynamic in that she has you poping in at out of the poses and also holding the poses. When i have time after a run, i'll run through it quickly, i think it helps with my flexibility (which i have none). Overall, i would recommend this video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, fast, and fun..","review":"This workout has yoga moves in it, but it is far from a \\"regular\\" yoga workout. The length is great for when you don't have a lot of time, but even then I felt like I got a decent workout ( was sore the next day).It's a fun workout to put into rotation. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Different than Yoga","review":"I do like this DVD but it's different than normal yoga. It uses the moves, but not in the normal style. So if you're looking for a good workout (and quick) then this is great, but if you want a traditional yoga dvd go for something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jillian is awful in this!","review":"While I know Jillian Michaels is known for being a tough trainer and really pushing people, she and yoga do not mix! The workouts are intense and you can feel the burn afterwards but I do not enjoy the yoga aspect in this video. Yoga is about relaxation and moving your body along with your breath. In this video, you are constantly moving in the poses which works your body more but the whole time Jillian is yelling at you to \\"FOCUS ON YOUR BREATH!\\" and clapping her hands together. It really takes away from the whole yoga experience. She also complains a lot about not being very flexible and that's why she doesn't do most of the moves. I need someone WAY less intense for yoga."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I absolutely love this dvd. It isn't your average yoga dvd though, it's more of a repetitive strength training video using only your body weight and a mat if you are on a hard floor. I am an avid user of Jillian Michaels' 30 Day Shred dvd, and Yoga Meltdown is great to mix things up. I do this about twice a week. Some of the moves may be a little difficult if you are just beginning strength training, but if you use the modified positions you should progress nicely. Love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yup. Awesome.","review":"I LOVE THIS DVD. It is so nice to add this into my week of working out..after doing her other DVDs of lots of jumping, cardio, weights and just getting my ass kicked. I come from a background of classical ballet, so I love using my body as my strength training with this DVD. You rep out each move and then hold for 15 seconds; and it's tough!!! Add this into your work out mix and enjoy!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your grandma's yoga!","review":"This is not the type of yoga dvd that you ease through poses and get all bendy... Jillian comes through, as always, with her version of yoga. It is tough and I sweat like crazy keeping up with the repetitions! Great workout dvd. Great job Jillian!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fat burning yoga","review":"This is another great workout from Jillian! Your muscles will burn and ache and you will work up a great sweat with this workout. It isn't as cardiovascular as Jillians other dvd's but that doesn't mean it isn't a good workout, because it still gets your heart rate up. What I particularly love about this one is that it made my muscles burn and ache more than they have when I have done Jillian's other dvd's."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good!","review":"Just finished my first exercise on level 1. Not incredibly difficult, but you will still definitely feel it! I'm I'm somewhat decent shape. Trying to get in better shape... and I like this DVD. Builds your confidence because the moves are simple, yet effective. And I like Julian's personality. I can't stand those bubbly types.I'm using this with the 30 day shred, alternating days. (This was a nice break from the 30 day shred. My calves and arms are absolutely DEAD from it! In a good way of course.)Overall, very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout","review":"Definitely not for yoga newbies, but this is a sweat-inducing workout. You'll be panting by the end of it, whether from trying to do the moves, or successfully making it through them all. I definitely recommend this for anyone wanting to build strength. I noticed a significant change. After two weeks, I could actually do push ups!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my style","review":"If you are looking for a \\"power flow\\" yoga DVD, I would not recommend this workout. It is full of poses with semi-fast repetative motions. It doesn't really capture the true essence or meaning of the practice of yoga. Pretty much a typical workout video. The \\"intermediate/advance\\" workout wasn't my style AT ALL. I like the classes at studios with power flow with an intermediate pace. if you like those classes, i would NOT recommend this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for the lower-back!!!","review":"I really like some of Jillian's other DVDs (30 day shred, banish fat, no more trouble zones) but this one is not for me. It made my lower back scream in pain!!!!! There is a lot of moving from a standing position to a floor position - which makes it difficult to follow and perform the correct positions."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!","review":"I'm not necesarily a Jilian fan, but I was looking for something to mix in to my current workouts. It is crazy hard! I don't think I've ever sweat so hard! I was slipping in my own sweat on my yoga mat! (I know, TMI). But a good workout - not the usual soothing yoga moves and breathing, but a good workout!"},{"rating":"2","title":"After run workout","review":"Usually I hate yoga becuase it's too slow but Jillian Michaels makes yoga an actual workout and I was sore afterwards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"She does the same moved over and over and frankley is very boring. Also, the beginner phase is too difficult for a true beginner"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout","review":"This workout video is one of my favorites: combines yoga moves w/ repitiions, stretching, breathing excercises, and some humor. It can be intense. The more you put into, the more you'll get out of it. I have had back issues, two children, and scoliosis. The moves, if done correctly can help strengthen your core and your surrounding muscles. It's very centering and stress reducing. And it's not too time demanding. Check it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":".Awesome","review":"I love this DVD! Jillian Michaels is amazing and her yoga routine kicks butt. The DVD arrived very quickly and in great condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great total body workout","review":"I'll admit, it's not really true \\"yoga\\", but this video was great. I felt EVERY muscle group the next day (in a good way). This video is definitely difficult (I couldn't complete Level 1 without taking breaks), but it's given me something to aspire to. Definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not appropriate for beginners - dangerous","review":"I am a yoga novice. I read the reviews before I bought this DVD. It is not, in my opinion, an appropriate workout for a beginner. It is too fast paced. There is too little guidance. I think it is actually irresponsible of Jillian to have put this DVD out on the market without a huge disclaimer for beginners attempting these workouts. I love Jillian. Have tried the 30 Day Shred and thought it was great. This DVD left me with a strained neck (from trying to watch the TV to see what she was talking about)for 2 days and a sore upper back.I wrote a full review here: [...] I am not sharing the link to gain anything for the website, but I was able to go into more detail for anyone interested in reading an honest review.I would caution anyone wanting to buy the Yoga Meltdown to be very careful not to strain your body too much to actually get into the poses she has you doing AND listen to your body."},{"rating":"2","title":"Workout 1 is great!","review":"I am a Jillian fan, but critical because I am a personal trainer and fitness instructor. The dvd has two workouts. The Level 2 workout does not have a sufficient warm up, and the poses do not flow. Luckily, I teach yoga, so I knew how to modify. HOWEVER, Level 1 workout is AWESOME!! It moves in and out of the poses fairly quickly but you still get a good stretch with each pose because Jillian holds each pose for 15-20 seconds. Eventhough the workout was tough, I felt strong as well as stretched out at the end. Workout 1 is the one I will continue to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout w/o intimidating Yoga","review":"I've been working out w/Jillian five days/week for several months now using two of her other DVD's and decided to add some Yoga into the mix. This is my first Yoga workout of any kind and I LOVE it. I consider myself to be in pretty decent shape, but some of the poses are really challenging-which they should be! Some I am able to do in a level 2 or 3, others as a beginner. Jillian has a great was of incorporating Yoga and cardio into two workouts. This one will make you sweat, be sore the next day, but feel really invigorated at the same time. If her Cardio DVD kills you, I highly recommend trying this DVD. If you already work out regularly, I highly recommend adding this DVD to the mix."},{"rating":"1","title":"This isn't yoga","review":"This isn't a yoga video. I'm a big fan of Jillian's workouts and this is a great workout. But this is not a yoga practice. Jillian has taken a few yoga poses and bastardized them into reps, so that you break a sweat in 30 minutes. But there is no semblance of yoga in this. It is an aerobic workout using yoga poses as the basis for the moves. So if you're looking for an actual yoga practice, this isn't it. But like her other workouts, you will break a sweat and do so in 30 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Results","review":"I've done yoga in the past, but never *felt* it afterward like I did with this video, and that was just the beginner portion. It will be quite some time before I can work myself up to the advanced (if ever). This is a very good toning video. I have used hand weights and done bicep and tricep work several times a week with little to no noticeable results. I was resigned to thinking I'd just always have squishy arms. After ONE workout with this video, I felt a difference and actually think I can see a difference in my arms. After even as little as 2 weeks, I think most people will really notice a change in their bodies, and after a month, really see and feel the difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't be picky,","review":"Look at all these bad \\"this isn't yoga\\" reviews! Let's be real: It's not traditional yoga. It's Jillian Michaels!With that said, this DVD is great for people who have done 30 Day Shred or maybe have recently started a weight loss journey. Level two is tough. This DVD does wonders for balance, stability and flexibility. I doubt you'll actually lost 5lbs a week, but you will see results. Happy exercising!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"I like Jillian's other videos but I have to say nobody should do Yoga at home from a DVD without at least going to take some classes. You need an instructor to correct your posture and poses to make sure you are doing them correctly and make sure you do not get hurt."},{"rating":"1","title":"power yoga, but not so great","review":"I wanted a power yoga, but its way to obvious yoga is not J.M. favorite form of exercise since she rushes through the moves WAY to much with an uninterested expression and adds moves in that arent yoga... ok, but inot my fave video from her. She needs to stick to the \\"SHRED\\" style videos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yoga CD","review":"The quality of the CD was terrible - can't even use it.

I have other Jillian Michaels videos that I like but this isn't one of them. I've taken yoga classes before and this isn't yoga. This is Jillian's take on it. Yoga is about strengthening and stretching out the body. You never \\"jump\\" into the pose nor do you incorperate aerobics.If you want a workout video for burning calories, I suggest 30 day shredIf you want the strengthening, there's shred it with weightsIf you want yoga, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"This DVD is not your traditional relaxation or meditation yoga, obviously because meltdown is in the title and Jillian is the trainer :). This yoga exercise has traditional poses but focuses more on raising your heartrate doing those poses (instead of concentrating on breathing etc). It is exactly what I was looking for, I actually broke a sweat and can feel muscles working that I have a hard time getting to in the gym. Jillian is also very good in this DVD and is not pushy. The only con I see is that there isn't a lot of instruction for beginners so if you haven't learned the poses prior you may have to watch the DVD through once or twice. You can also do a preview before you purchase :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"tough workout","review":"After using this twice a week for a couple of weeks, I could see a noticeable improvement in my ab muscles, not to mention overall muscle strength. It's fun but tough, and level two has given me a few exercises to work towards. Using this (alternating with another Jillian Michaels DVD) has resulted in some weight loss, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pain, oh yes","review":"Exactly what I was looking for. I just love her. Funny, but hard. Now I never done Yoga before but this DVD is definately a motivation. I'm running 3-4 times a week abround 30-40 km/week. Winter time I was regurarly visiting my fitness studio (6-8 hours/week) But after doing this DVD whereas each part isn't 30 minutes but at least 40 minutes, I had 'some' muscle pain. For beginners I'm very sorry cause they're going to die...:-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a workout","review":"I have only tried workout 1, but what a great workout!

And this Yoga Meltdown DVD does not disappoint at all, not that I thought it would! I have a lot of strength, cardio, kickboxing and pilates workouts in my rotation, and wanted to add a Yoga workout as well. I get pretty bored doing traditional Yoga, but Jillian's Yoga Meltdown combines a cardio component to the body weight training in this Yoga DVD which eliminates any boredom for me. When I am done with this workout, I know I've worked every muscle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great video","review":"I did the first workout two months after a c-section, and was quite sore for two days following. It was a great workout, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really yoga","review":"I bought this to supplement the yoga classes I was already taking. Jillian uses terminology incorrectly and her breathing is out of sync (she instructs you to inhale when you should be exhaling, and vice versa). I think she just jumped on the popularity yoga was having at the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun workout","review":"I own a couple of Jillian Michaels dvd because it's a good workout and her dvds are so affordable. I really like yoga so I decided to buy her dvd. According to some other reviews it's not considered the traditional yoga, but I like it anyways. The first time I tried it I was so surprised how much I broke out in sweat because usually yoga dvds do not do that for me. However, when I did the 2nd time, 3rd and so on I didn't break out in sweat. But it was fun anyways. On the second level, I think the crow position is hard to do and I'm kind of afraid to try it because I think Jillian could have given a better explanation. Also there is a segment doing back bends and I personally don't have a problem doing the back bends, but the way she instructs us to get out of it and get back into it so quickly seems kind of dangerous to me too. Besides those 2 areas, I think this dvd is fun and doable for most people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great body workout, but...","review":"I live in Asia, so I get to do yoga a lot. I've had some amazing yoga classes in Taiwan and in Thailand. JM's yoga meltdown is a good workout, but if you do it often, you might get bored pretty soon. I take turns doing \\"No more trouble zones\\", \\"30 days shred\\" and then, \\"Yoga meltdown\\". These workouts are fantastic for ALL of my muscles. I feel great! I never get tired no more!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh My Shakti..not even close to yoga!!!","review":"This is not even close to being yoga. Jillian basically just takes a beautiful yoga asana, which should be held for at least five breaths, and \\"reps it out\\". Yoga blasphemy! The beauty of yoga is all in the breath and the transition between asanas. Jillian basically just bulldozes over those parts with her reps. If you want a beautiful form of exercise that will change your body and life forever, get a REAL yoga DVD. If you just want a workout before you head to the gym, get this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yoga Meltdown","review":"I really like Jillian Michaels' dvds in general and have several, but this one did not do it for me at all. The flow felt weird, and her voice and the music were very distracting. It just wasn't what I was personally looking for. I plan to give it another try, but overall, this is my least favorite of her work outs."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good workout","review":"Purchased this so I could amp up my yoga routine - falls somewhere between a \\"workout\\" and \\"traditional yoga.\\" The moves are fast-paced and can be challenging. Good video."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST! THERES NOTHING ELSE LIKE IT!","review":"I absolutely LOVE jillian micheals! She is so so so so so inspiring and encouraging because she had weight issues in highschool (175 lbs and 5 feet tall!) but totally changed her life around and helped other people do the same....I would recommend this to EVERYONE! Not only is Jillian micheals amazing, but this yoga will get you so fit and felling great! hope this helped :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes....not the Jillian I know who usually delivers!","review":"I really, really tried to love this one as much as I do all her other workout dvd's. I stuck with it for a week and just could not do it anymore. It's horrible yoga....clearly not her strong point. It's hard to take direction and follow someone who isn't flexible and that is creating a \\"Yoga\\" workout that isn't quite yoga. I had to give this one 1 star because it's just not good I can honestly say I hated it. Didn't feel much either when I was finished or the following day. Usually when I start a new workout of Jillians I definitely feel it the next day as my body gets used to using new muscles. That's not the case with this one. I had to give it away as I knew I would never use it again. Not to worry her dvd's that came out post this one are definitely worth buying and using. Jillian brings it back with those but falls flat on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fat Burner and Yoga Poses","review":"I love love love this DVD. I wish she had more. She gives variety and no matter how many times I do it the routines never drag. They seem to go by quick so I do both routines! The only thing is that she talks too much at times and Im holding the pose for longer than 15 secs!!! Other than that its great. Plus I LOVE Basheerah...im aspiring to be on her level!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough but Manageable Workout","review":"I was enjoying the toughness of 30 day shred but it was too hard on my knees so I switched to yoga meltdown. My primary concern was that it wouldn't have the same heart rate raising toughness of 30 day shred. Boy was I wrong. An added bonus is I'm fixing to travel to Belgium and I was trying to figure out how to get weights in my suitcase with everything else I have to bring. Alas, with yoga meltdown, all you really need is your body. Because I workout in my house and my workout room is carpeted with a significant amount of padding I don't use a yoga mat, hence the dolphin portion of the routine has led to some pretty nasty rugburn. After a few rounds, threw a sweatshirt under my arms and not a problem anymore. Jillian makes this yoga challenging but doable (for a beginner) and I'm excited to see what three weeks of 5 days with this routine does for me!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense Yoga, but not for Beginners","review":"I've never been a fan of Yoga, but I was given this DVD last year for Christmas. I never even opened it until recently when I had injured my back. I was advised to do some kind of stretching or yoga. Since I already had the DVD, I gave it a try. I have to say this isn't the yoga that I have seen on TV programs as Jillian Michaels has added her own twists that is meant to make you burn calories. There are two workouts on this DVD, but so far I have only tried Level 1 and let me tell you it is a pain in the neck to get through it. I was literally covered in sweat at the end of the workout. The good news is that it did help my back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense Workout!","review":"I'm in pretty good shape, and wanted to add something new to my routine. I couldn't complete the Level 1 workout- it was that challenging! I will keep 'practicing' in good yoga fashion. A word, though, if you have neck and shoulder problems- this workout requires a great deal of plank or push-up type movements. If there had been a variation for those of us with neck and shoulder problems I would have given the video five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short workout, hardly yoga.","review":"Only a 30 minute workout (each - there are 2 levels, each 30 minutes long) that moves at a very rapid pace. The exercises are taken from traditional yoga (downward dog, triangle, balancing twist) but are done in quick repetition form with a short hold at the end, making it more of an aerobic workout than true yoga. To make it even less 'yoga-like' is Jillian's way of teaching, as well as the abysmal soundtrack - I don't expect every yoga video to have a zen like eastern background track, but this is intolerably bad during some exercises. And as for Jillian, who at one point starts yelling \\"Do it! Do it! Do it Baby!\\" like some sort of drill instructor to one of the background cast...phew. A little distracting and annoying!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yoga Meltdown is Tough!","review":"I am a daily cardio exerciser and I walk 5 miles a day with some jogging. I have never done yoga but thought it would be a nice mix to my daily workout. All I can say is wow! For a beginner in yoga this is very tough!! I proboly should have started with a beginners dvd but I bought it and I can feel how it works my body so I will stay dedicated to it. I am without a doubt going to recieve results with this. Until I can master this I just take it slow and I am still on level 1 and I do this 3 times a week. Its a good start until I can build strenghth and learn the moves. I think with time I will master this and then I will go on to level 2. We are all beginners at something until we start doing it so I will stick with this yoga meltdown and do what I can do. I cant wait to see the results and benefits I will get with adding this yoga dvd in my exercise routine."},{"rating":"2","title":"fast paced, energetic, fitness yoga","review":"Of the many work-out, challenging fitness yoga dvds i've purchased recently, this one is definitely one of the best. motivating (and not annoying or boring) instructor, good yoga moves that really work you out. 30 minute passes by really fast! :) i'm going to look into other jillian products now. highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"I'm not a yogi or anything, but I have 20+ yoga dvd's in my collection, as well as several well-loved Jillian Michaels dvd's. This is the WORST yoga workout ever! The pace is ridiculously fast, to the point where you will probably hurt yourself. And (because she's not a yoga teacher I suppose) Jillian can't give any of the helpful comments during a pose that can improve your practice. The is the worst workout DVD I've ever bought, bar none."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not yoga","review":"I've been doing yoga for about a decade now and really enjoy the practice. I also enjoy all of Jillian's exercise DVD's...except for this one. Jillian does \\"reps\\" of traditional yoga poses. This is not only painful, but dangerous. If you want a strength training workout, then there are better videos. If you are looking for yoga, look somewhere else. I was really disappointed with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT for beginners!!","review":"I have been taking a yogalates(yoga/Pilates) class for a month or two now and wanted some power yoga and Pilates videos to do at home. I recognized Jillian Michaels and thought I'd give this one a try. I decided to start with the beginners workout on this video since I haven't been doing yoga or Pilates for very long. I started doing the moves and it was really intense but I decided to keep going. After about 10 minutes I had to quit. She has you doing these ridiculously difficult moves with pretty quick, wide range of motion type movements(for yoga). I'm sure that someone who is pretty strong that does yoga all the time would be fine with this but for a beginner like me it just seemed kind of dangerous. It was difficult to hold my form and I was concerned about injuring myself because of that. Bottom line...newbies beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jillian keeps it fresh","review":"I love Yoga and although this DVD is not a traditional yoga workout I like how Jillian incorporates Yoga into her style of training. I also respect her for bringing in a yoga expert to consult on the DVD's workouts with her. I think this will be good for beginners who are looking to get a taste of yoga and find out what it's all about. And, for the more advanced athlete, if you are thinking this is going to be a zen workout think again. I was drenched in sweat after doing level 2. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yoga strain...","review":"I love Jillian Michaels' workouts. Except this one. I enjoy switching up my work out routine and have been practicing yoga for over 10 years. But this is the worst yoga dvd I have seen in awhile. Michaels is a fantastic motivator and fitness guru, but I get the feeling that she was just jumping on the yoga dvd bandwagon, because she doesn't seem to have any natural feeling when it comes to the practice. Many of the moves she includes in the workout are done in such a way that you strain yourself and some of the the moves are just plain dangerous! I love and regularly use her other dvds, but please, for your own safety, skip this one. There are so many wonderful yoga dvds out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done","review":"I AM a yoga practitioner and I have to hand it to Jillian for doing a darn good job at introducing people to yoga. While this is not even remotely a traditional yoga workout she doesn't profess it to be. Jillian has created a great workout while borrowing from yoga to create her platform. I commend her for working with a certified yoga instructor in putting these workouts together and I appreciate that she is bringing many people who haven't tried yoga before into the practice. As a good yoga teacher you can't tell your students what to get out of their practice. You just want them to get something out of it. End of story. With Yoga Meltdown you will get a great workout and a fun introduction to a new form of exercise that deserves exploring."},{"rating":"2","title":"a nice new twist on yoga","review":"I was skeptical about trying this dvd, mainly because i have tried yoga many times in the past and just could not get into it. I am a huge fan of Jillian's other dvd's and have lost 50lbs over the past year integrating jillian's workouts into my regular exercise routine, for this reason i gave this dvd a chance and i am really glad i did. It gives a new spin on yoga using jillian's signature style of circuits. There are 2 levels and like on all her other dvds 2 girls to follow weather you would like a easier or harder versions of the moves. I would highly recommend this dvd if you are a fan of her other dvds, but if you are looking for a serious yoga dvd look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Beginners!","review":"I tried this workout once and really messed up my right leg it still is hurting after 3 days plus my stomach was sore the day after.

However, it is not yoga and it is most certainly NOT for yoga beginners.My concern is that people new to yoga will hurt themselves if they use this video to learn yoga.

Small Steps was a great album too, it seems a bit more personal than this one, but they are both great albums. I think they get less funky with each album, which isn't a bad thing, but it shows how groups can change from album to album.

At the same time I experienced some sexual disfunction to eventually full erectile disfunction. I gave my doctor a call and he told me that there is a very small 2 percent chance this can happen, which is why he never told me when he recomended I used Minoxidil for my hair loss. I immediately stopped using this product and guess what, cold sweats became less prominent and my manhood returned.

I never have had this before in my life and it is localized solely on the area of application. I have got head and shoulders and this has fixed the problem. But you should be prepared.

So I bought this product and have been using this religiously for almost 4 months. I restrained myself from looking at my crown in the mirror or take a photo of it for these 4 months as I only wanted to look at the results after 4 months (the product info asks you to use it for 4 months at least and stop if no results are seen). To my disappointment, the hair loss seems like it worsened. The crown looks balder than ever.Well, the product does say that the results are not the same for all men, and so I will keep using it for another 2 months or so till I finish the bottles. I hear stories of guys saying this product has worked so well for them but I guess I am not one of them.

However, I had to stop using it after 2 months because of blurred vision which is a rare, reported side effect of minoxidil. This was most obvious when I looked at a traffic light 1 or 2 blocks away. I would get 2 or 3 images of the light which would merge as I got closer. The blurring occurs because these 2 or 3 images get superimposed on each other. I stopped using the minoxidil for a week and my vision is almost back to normal. I will try it again, but only using having the recommended dosage. By the way, no hair growth yet.

Socioecomonic status and race had little impact on reading achievment over the summer especially compared to going to the public library on a regular basis.Given the impact on reading and education that public libraries have, it is odd that politicians are cutting library budgets at the very time that they are demanding an improvement in reading scores.

In fact, Ornish's theories have been proven wrong. When you don't eat a moderate amount of healthy fats (olive oil, EFA's, etc.), the bile produced by your liver sits in your gall bladder instead of being used to digest fats. It becomes increasingly concentrated, until the cholesterol in the bile forms into...gallstones. This = extremely painful attacks and either surgery or very intense cleansing diets. Ornish's diet does NOT include enough fats; it is too extreme and based on faulty assumptions. Watch out! Unfortunately, I had to have my gall bladder removed because I meticulously followed his diet, only to learn later that this was a common experience for many people.

It is the 1956 one-hour documentary narrated by Alexander Scoursby.Done in the same style as \\"Victory At Sea\\", it must have been good for its time. Still, much of the short hour was spent showing Americans partying on their way to the war and partying on their way back home. Very little was spent on the causes of the war and nothing was said of the Versailles Treaty.If you are interested in WW-I, I suggest you wait for PBS to issue its 1996 6-hour series of the same name. When it does, I'll buy their DVD and donate this one to the local library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well done","review":"This is not a long documentary (just under 1 hour) but is very good.

The main character aimed at being a bright, humorous modern Boston woman - - AND MISSED! Oh, how they missed! Chloe Carter has an inheritance from her uncle only if she enters a graduate degree and is so directionless that she basically tosses a coin. She's a shallow, vapid, vain, manipulative, sometime mean, bimbo and basically is not worth reading about. The food topic angle is the only plus. There is another title in the series, but I intend to avoid it. I can't believe that Susan Conant put her name on this writing.

Expectations for writing process in my elementary school have changed in the last few years. Our primary students are expected to write with more conventions and with ever-increasing assessments. This book is full of strategies and ideas to help the primary teacher meet their student's drive to write and draw their stories as well as satisfy the administration's need for more \\"accountability\\" with skills. I loved the examples from classrooms using new and familiar techniques and the frank discussions of what to expect from student writers. It is the kind of book one can pick up for an idea to use tomorrow as well as read cover to cover to learn more about writing in the primary classroom. It is easy to read, well researched and realistic for classroom use. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughtful and thought-provoking....a must-read.","review":"A big fan of Spandel's Creating Writers, I wasn't sure Creating Young Writers would speak to my third graders, after all, it was billed as K-3; maybe the target would be too young.

One of my favorite parts is her simple suggestions for what to say to a writer during a conference, but I also love her minilesson suggestions (so far, \\"Voice as Metaphor\\" is my favorite), and her insightful look at the way writers write and how we can help them along their writing journey.

I had a friend who worked at a record store who was also a fan and everytime her new CD came out he would call me and let me know that it was in. I can't wait to see what she is going to come out with this year. I hope that is in the recording studio because its been over a year now since her last CD.

In this collection a good sampling of her diversity can be found, and her brilliant song writing ability is also evident. Her songs have already been covered by a wide range of artists (listen to the scintillating Janis Siegel's version of Invisible War). Will she ever receive the recognition due to her? Doubtful, but for those of us who enjoy the mellow Diana Krall (and I do), we know the secret- there is real modern jazz-- and Julia is creating it.

I am a big fan of music and listen to a huge variety of genres (rock, soft rock, jazz, classical, folk, easy listening, etc) so I think I know good music. I really do not even know how to describe most of the music on this CD. Other than 2 versions of \\"Happy Ever After\\" - which is a very good song - the other songs are mostly just really bad. Ok, one other song - Where Does The Time Go? - is average. But it is hard to listen to the other songs without feeling a strong urge to hit the next button.I would give this zero stars - or better yet, negative stars - if I could do so."},{"rating":"2","title":"A genuinely impressive account","review":"I worked with Stu Eizenstat when I was Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights in the Clinton Administration. Although I did not know him before, except by reputation, I soon came to know him as an inspired diplomat and public servant. The work he did in bringing a resolution to the Holocaust Assets dispute was a remarkable display of ability, imagination, persistence, and conscience. This book not only tells Eizenstat's story in a compelling way, and from a profoundly human perspective, but also captures the rare decency and commitment of the author to what many considered an impossible cause. As a modern human rights memoir, it ranks with Aryeh Neier's Taking Liberties and Jeri Laber's The Courage of Strangers. This is a memoir of conscience that anyone who wants to make human rights real should read, and remember."},{"rating":"1","title":"The victims are again mistreated","review":"This book should not have been about Stuart Eisenstat as we come away believing after reading it. Mr. Eisenstat is accomplished and clever and the more reason for him to have secured for the victims a fair shake. Instead his activities, as described in this book, are benefiting the German and Swiss Companies and deprive the victims of proper copensation. Only the Hungarian Government offered less compensation to the victims then what Mr. Eisenstat has arranged. The Hungarian Government offered each person whos relative was murdered during WW2 (aproximately)[$$] for a parent and [$$] for a brother or sister. This book is a depressing tale of personal ambition, misguided values and lack of remorse by a high ranking former official of the US Government.

Why, you might ask? The answer is simple. I cannot read this prose.There are no quotations around the dialogue.The tense and point of view switch almost whimsically.The writer has such a very strange style. I'm sure that she did this on purpose, to heighten the overall mood of the book. I simply didn't want to put that much effort into reading it.If you're a pedestrian reader, like me, this is probably not your cup of tea.(*)>"},{"rating":"1","title":"The interesting aspects of this story are overshadowed by superfluous lewdness","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book when I read the other reviews. However, the parts of this story which make it interesting- the descriptions of life during the war, survival, and the discovery of the main character's history - take a backseat to the authors apparent need to repeatedly dive into repeated graphic rape and sex scenes. This happens even at times when the story is focused on non-sexual events. The events which occupy most of the author's summary actually occur within the very beginning and very end of this book, almost appearing to be an afterthought. The middle 80% is occupied by a broken record of disturbing and unproductive sex scenes where nothing really happens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Those Who Save Us","review":"Good idea for a book although poorly executed.

First, the lack of quotation marks makes it hard to decipher who exactly is talking, and whether or not someone is actually talking or if it's just thoughts/narration going on. Next, the switching back and forth between 1996 and 1940 usually does not bother me, but the 1996 story was soooooo trite and boring I just wanted to skip over it to the 1940s part. The way the author describes college students is horrid! As a graduate student myself, I know for a fact that most college students do not say the word \\"like\\" multiple times throughout every sentence. \\"Hi Professor, can I like, talk to you, like, for a minute? I am having some trouble, like, understanding the material.\\" Uggghh, that is when I stopped reading. Also, the characters are really under developed. This book is not to be tossed aside lightly, it should be thrown across the room with great force."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking in every way","review":"First of all, the writing style for this book can, at best, be described as sophomoric. I also had problems with the lack of quotation marks, but that would have been fine if the book wasn't so poorly written. Blum uses hackneyed expressions and metaphors throughout the book.The story was implausible and relied on some pretty inconceivable coincidences to make it work.The characters were flat and unlikeable. I have a difficult time thinking that all college students are uninterested drones, all Minnesotans are xenophobes, and all Germans are neat. Even the main characters, Trudy and Anna, are pretty unbelievable.Save your money and time and skip this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought-Provoking AND Entertaining","review":"It has been a while since I have read a book that is as entertaining and interesting as Those Who Save Us. Too often, I have to choose between an 'easy' page turner that I will find entertaining and forget immediately, and an 'interesting' book that will make me think but won't make me want to stay home all day to read. This is the kind of book that makes me remember why reading is my favorite hobby. And weeks after reading it I am still thinking about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Those Who Save Us","review":"I thought the experiences of the characters were probably based on some fact. The story depicted to me the right to survive and persist during the most trying time in world history. Judgement of the main character could be harsh if one has never experienced a life threatening situation for themselves or their love ones. The guilt of surviving and how it was accomplished haunts the woman who had to do what she did to protect her loved one. The author kept my interest througout the book and at times I felt deeply for the woman and how she submitted herself to survive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Those who save us -","review":"Creatively written, I enjoyed the way she took us from past to present and then merged the two.

To say too much about the plot gives too much away, so I won't. What I will say is that I read this entire novel in one day - I literally could not put it down. The novel alternates between Nazi-torn Germany in the harrows of WW2 and the relatively boredom of present-day university in America. Blum provides beautiful and excellently-written dual viewpoints, and a unique perspective that is seldom seen in literature about this period. Seldom do we explore life from a the inside the mind and body of a German citizen, to see how one's ability to \\"make a difference\\" can be so severely inhibited. And seldom are we able to survey the complexities of \\"survivor's guilt\\" on such a personal level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and Heroic Story","review":"This was a beautifully told story of human courage, love, and endurance in a horribly cruel chapter of history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I loved this book.

The subject matter was handled in an intelligent non sentimental way. Anna and Trudie are portrayed as women with depth. They make decisions and live with the consequenses, good or bad. I apppreciated a book where women are complex people, not superficial representations of either the madonna or a postitute.This book gives a glimpse of Germany during the war, but it is seen from different angles.

I spent my entire Spring Break glued to this book. Every spare minute I was scrambling to see what would happen next. There were some graphic scenes in the book which really added to the drama and horror of this era in history and made the story even more compelling. I would recommend this book to everyone...men, women, young adults, senior citizens, etc. I think there are a lot of important lessons to be learned from reading Those Who Save Us. I can't impress upon you how wonderful this book is. Buy it today...I guarantee you'll love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting and Disturbing!","review":"This is the most disgusting and disturbing book I have ever read. At least 50% of the book is explicit descriptions of the rape and sexual abuse of a Nazi soldier to a German mom. The sex and rape is described over and over in the most unnecessarily detailed descriptions. It will leave you feeling violated and disturbed. The unending focus on sex was way over the top and totally unnecessary!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Words cannot describe how much I love this book!","review":"I am an avid reader of WWII history, and generally try to stay away from fictional stories about this time period - but I really cannot find words to express how much I love this book, how immersed in it I became, how it lingered with me, and I believe always will..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convincing","review":"Like so many books, whether fiction or non-fiction, this one reminds you that our so-called modern world can be at least as savage as what we call the the Dark Ages. The author's fictional devices on the whole work, and the main characters are convincing. Making one of the protagonists a professor of German history in order to reveal some of the horrors appeared somewhat forced and synthetic. This is more than compensated for by the overall feel of historical truth. The story remains in the mind - the ultimate test of a good book in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kinda slow at first...","review":"This book arrived quickly and in great shape, as per the usual from Amazon.com :) However, it was a little slow-going at first. Very satisfying and interesting read :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Implausible but great read","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Eloquently written and hard to put down. Not sure how possible this might be, but still a wonderful story. Would recommend to anyone interested in the holocaust/WWII or otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruined","review":"I thought this book was an interesting slant on Holocaust life. I almost did NOT read it due to the totally unnecessary graphic sexual details. The book would have been much better without that garbage. Many people were caught in the middle and had to survive however they could. There are still those who cannot talk about it. My heart goes out to the Jews who suffered the most, but also to many Germans who had no choice but to obey or be killed. In my opinion, there are much better books to read that are real stories, not fabricated, pieced together half-truths."},{"rating":"1","title":"Compelling, but contrived","review":"It's a captivating Holocaust story, a page-turner. Ultimately not really believeable, with too many coincidences. If my book group proposes it, I'm going to vote against it; I certainly don't want to read it again. If you read it and feel dirty afterward, remember that you were warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST READ","review":"One of the best books I've ever read and everyone I'ver recommended it to says the same thing. Could not put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"This author has never lived in Minnesota!","review":"This book was heartily recommended to me by a fellow traveler on an airplane to Minneapolis, of all places!! I eagerly anticipated its arrival and read it in an afternoon--stretched into late evening. Once I'd read the part describing the funeral in Minnesota, I really couldn't believe much about the rest of the book. I know it's a work of fiction, but if the facts with which I am familiar are so far out in left field, why should I think the rest of the book is based on the fact that it purports to be based on the Holocaust? Minnesota people are, to a fault, polite. The book did have a lot of promise and was well written, but the writer has an over-active imagination...or neglected to do even the most basic of research. I could probably write an equally good Holocaust novel, and I'm a baby boomer from Canada!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disturbing sex content:","review":"I read the whole book. The story was very strong, sad and heartwarming, but I think the Author could of toned down the violent sex between Anna and the SS officer. That really turned me off on really liking the book. I would not recommend this book to someone with a sensitive stomach to buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugggggggggggggg!","review":"Okay seriously, how much is the author compensating the reviewers to report positively about what any reasonable person would deem a complete waste of time.

Thank god I borrowed this from a friend, if only I could have the hours of my life back that were stolen from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not well written","review":"Interesting story we have heard before. Annoyingly written, and really needs editing. Inaccuracies regarding certain facts related to Holocaust."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Exceptional Holocaust Story- Worth the Investment","review":"Dark, crisp well plotted, well drawn characters. 2 stories told at once. Even though the mystery is open to the reader it keeps up the pace throughout the book. Yes it is graphic but reads true and not in a gratuitous manner. I have read close to 30 Holocaust novels this is truly one of the best. An Exceptional book. Money well spent at twice the price and I dont give many 5 star ratings"},{"rating":"2","title":"HIGHLY recommend!","review":"Blum is an excellent storyteller - I highly recommend this historical novel chosen by my book group for its fall selection. Each character became lifelike and it was hard to put the book down as I quickly read chapter after chapter. The reader is given the civilian German's look at the Nazi era. If Ms. Blum continues to write novels, I will continue to read them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"to violent for me","review":"The kindle sample was intriguing enough for me to buy the book.Thirty pages later, I had to remove it from my kindle. The graphic descriptions of assorted sexual assaults were too much for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, but poorly executed","review":"I had trouble getting through this book--not because of the subject matter, which is heavy and could be too much for some--but because of the writing. It's so awkward. The character development is poor, the dialogue is weak, and the sex--not just between Anna and the officer, but throughout the book--is overkill. Such heavy material requires better writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creepy Unrealistic over-detailed rape scenes","review":"The character in the book has a forced sexual relationship with a Nazi soldier who is an abusive creep. Yet, despite the fact that this guy killed her best friend, AND he is raping her on a regular basis, she is unable to stop herself from having orgasms and moaning in uncontrollable pleasure? Really? It reads more like a rape fantasy fiction in some magazine rather than a novel. If the author wanted to somehow convey that this woman who had a controlling emotionally abusive father can only love a man who is also abusive, you can certainly convey that point without having multiple very detailed rape scenes where the rape victim is (are we supposed to believe this is even possible?) having orgasms in spite of not wanting to. Please don't foist rape fantasy fiction on unsuspecting readers when they thought they were just going to be reading a regular novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"muted heartbreak","review":"Those Who Save Us is set in Germany during the Holocaust, but is told from an unusual perspective; that of a young Aryan girl, Anna, as she does what she must to keep her daughter Trudy alive. Interspersed with Anna's story is the story of Trudy as an adult. The reader is introduced to Anna through Trudy's eyes, and it is not a sympathetic view. Anna's story is revealed to the reader long before Trudy reaches the same knowledge, and so Anna gradually becomes the more sympathetic character. This is not an easy book; Anna's story is heartbreaking, and as with any book dealing with the Holocaust, the subject matter is deeply disturbing. However, there is something about the style of Jenna Blum's writing that gives this book a dreamlike quality, affording the reader a bit of distance from the horror and heartbreak."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"This historical novel does an excellent job presenting the social conditions during WW2. We should take from this a better understanding on a personal level of a nation at war. We have to have a set of values within each of us that can not be pushed to the side by a government authority. Government does have to be kept in check and questioned before we take the lemming approach of follow the leader off the cliff! I vote this to become a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoking","review":"This book is unusual for a Holocaust book, because none of the protagonists are wholly good or entirely bad. The villain is capable of love, and the female lead character is unable to love. Good men are damaged goods, and even the innocent next generation is disabled. It definitely is worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A moving, perfect book","review":"Oh. My. God. This novel moves you, makes you want to know the characters, and makes you sad when it ends. It is a perfect book. It's meaningful, moving and courageous. But most of all, meaningful. If you are thinking of reading this book, do! You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking","review":"Awesome. Breathtaking. Inspiring. Thought provoking. We must all make choices in our lives. While it is easy for others to judge, it is also true they have never walked in our shoes (as the old adage goes.) I will never forget the impact this novel has had upon me. The characters were so well-developed and so very real to me. I can still see them in my minds-eye. Anna was a hero. I do, however, understand her silence. To have seen what she saw. To have lived during that time. To have been rejected by others for the life-saving choices she made. I realize she isn't \\"real,\\" but found myself wishing she would find happiness and joy for the rest of her days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting and page-turning","review":"A book that you will not want to put down till you've finished it. Excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute Perfection","review":"As so many have already said, I could not put this book down. I thought of it at work and couldn't wait to get home, I read way past my bedtime and then got up early just so I could read more before leaving for work. It is a book you will not forget. The characters are so real, the storyline enthralling. I thought it was interesting to look at the Holocaust from a different angle than is usually portrayed. This book was loaned to me but I will be buying a copy for myself just so I can read it over and over. Jenna Blum you must surely be writing more books. I for one can't wait!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"The book was wonderfully written and I thoroughly enjoyed it. There are so many Holocaust books written but his one had a great viewpoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing story","review":"This turned out to be one amazing story and told exactly how it happened. The only problem I found was that the author didn't complete the story to my satisfaction. I would have wanted to know what happened with Trudy's life and with Anna's....going further than the author carried it...but in all, it was truly a page turner and there was so much truth and validicity to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read!","review":"It's surprising that this is Jenna Blum's first novel. It will be a hard act to follow for her. From storyline, style and use of vocabularly this book is a winner. It is a first rate page turner that I have recommended to many people & all have thanked me."},{"rating":"2","title":"What we do is not always what others see","review":"This book causes the reader to evaluate previously held opinions of who is \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\" during challenging circumstances. We think of collaborators as individuals who chose the \\"other side\\" to support. Sometimes there is either no choice as to how one has to live if others are depending on you for survival, or if you see making a choice you would not do under other circumstances would allow your being able to be effective in other ways. The question of who is the other comes up over and over again. The novel raises the question of whether we are currently doing judgmental living now as well. I loved the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story, bad writing","review":"This book suffers from a general problem with today's fiction writing: too much time spent at writing workshops. I could not get past the overworked prose to enjoy the excellent story to it fullest. The writing is very stilted and inorganic and causes one to ask the writer to put down the gosh darn thesaurus and just let it flow! David Wroblewski's Edgar Sawtelle suffers from this illness, too: a great story marred by strained writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing and lacking","review":"Lacking. The lack of quotations around the dialogue wasn't the only thing missing. Missing from this book were characters behaving in accordance with their character. The biggest character inconsistency being Max. Max would not have gotten Anna pregnant nor would he have hidden in her stairwell and put her in danger.Depressing. I can honestly say that this is the most depressing book I have ever read. What a sad and miserable life for Anna. She prostituted herself for her and her daughter to live (first with the Nazi and then the farmer) and for all her sacrifice, her daughter doesn't even love/know/understand/want to spend time with her. It's a sad and miserable life for Trudie as well. Fifty years old and pretty much alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing, but not without its flaws","review":"I found \\"Those Who Save Us\\" an engrossing book that was not easy to put down. I disagree with the reader or critic who said that the author's prose style was \\"mechanical,\\" but I did find it troubling that the author made some basic historical mistakes, such as referring to fleeing German Jews going to \\"Israel.\\" Written from that time-period (1939-40), Jews would have called it \\"Palestine.\\" There was no \\"Israel,\\" and Jews emigrating there would not have referred to it as such."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful and admirable","review":"To say I greatly enjoyed \\"Those Who Save Us\\" seems wrong because of the horrific subject matter. But Jenna Blum created two strong female characters who, from the start, I felt compelled to follow along in their journey of discovery and survival. I loved how the two timelines were woven together and how the daughter's dreams echoed what she was starting to remember about her childhood. The Obersturmfubrer was one of the scariest characters I've ever encountered and, given all the research Blum did beforehand, I'm certain he is representative of some of the monsters of that time.The writing is beautiful. One example: \\"She embroiders and rehearses overheard conversations for Max, hoping to be rewarded by his barking laugh; she lays anecdotes at his feet like treasure.\\"Marie Estorgeauthor of CONFESSIONS OF A BI-POLAR MARDI GRAS QUEENand STORKBITES: A MEMOIR"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Novel","review":"I read most of this in one day. It's extremely well written and very intriguing.Some of the other reviewers have mentioned that it is a different take on the Holocaust, and as someone who has read a plethora of Holocaust literature, I can truly say that it is.Instead of taking the Jewish perspective, our primary characters are Germans who are forced to deal with the struggles of war and shortages. While the Jewish plight is addressed as well through the first love of Anna, most of the work addresses how hard life was for the people of Germany during WWII.One of the major themes is what mothers are willing to do for their families. Anna knows what the German army is doing to some extent, yet she lets herself become entangled with a German officer to ensure the safety of herself and, more importantly, her daughter.This is a must read novel, a truly wonderful piece of literature and it ranks as one of my favorite novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"A moving, powerful story! My MUST read of 2008!","review":"This is by far my favorite book of 2008!!! This story will grab you in the first chapter and hold you until you sorry it ends.

Easy to read but yet nice historical facts mixed with fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"The premise of this book sounded intriguing - the things that people will do to survive - but the delivery falls short. The story was difficult to follow, and as others have mentioned, failed to keep my interest. I wish that I would have checked this book out from the library rather than paying for it on the Kindle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wounds that do not heal . . .","review":"Those Who Save Us is an outstanding novel. No more need be said.Rarely have I encountered a character better drawn than Anna. My heart bleeds for her.I felt the only weakness in the book was the character of Mr. Pfeiffer toward the very end of the book. Obviously the author needed some device to reveal the truth to Trudy since Anna simply could not do it, but I found Mr. Pfeiffer too rich and not nearly remorseful enough for his own \\"sins\\" of profit when helping Jews escape the Nazi's. Personally, I would have preferred this character, rather than being wealthy and with the past he had, to have been simply a prisoner who escaped with his life from the camp. This book, however, is so good I happily overlooked what I consider a minor flaw, all things considered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quotation marks please!","review":"I have to say that I agree with what all the other reviewers of this book had to say. It was a great book and well researched. I have conducted oral history interviews myself and you can tell in the reading that she had done this herself and knew what she was talking about. I found it very compelling and had a hard time putting the book down to do unimportant things, like eating and sleeping.The one thing I didn't like about the book, that drove me absolutely nuts, is the fact that she didn't use quotation marks to show when a character was speaking. For me this made the dialogue lose the emotional impact it would have had otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Echo the sentiments: Wow! Best book ever!","review":"Though not a prolific novel reader I have to say this is probably the best novel I have ever read. At least no novel has ever moved me as much as \\"Those Who Save Us\\" has. To me is was not just an engrossing workof fiction but a book about spirituality - the spirituality that each of us as a member of the human race searches for to give meaning to our exis-tence. And what an appropriate title! One can learn from this story how we are all in some ways instrumental in each others healing and that our \\"salvation\\" - literally the healing of our woundedness, our human brokenness - is only achieved through others.What also made the story particularly personal to me was that I am of German ancestry and my wife was born in Germany and lived though the Nazi times as a teenager and that I have visited Weimar,the Buchenwald camps and several other venues mentioned in the book.Ron Dale Warren, MI"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful new perspective of the holocaust","review":"This book is fantastic! The story of a German woman during WWII doing all she must to keep herself and her daughter alive, and her daughter as an adult searching for answers to the past. It takes another look at the question \\"How could the German citizens let that happen to their neighbors?\\" You'll have to read it to understand, but suffice to say that the answer is deeply complex. The book's position is that even the regular German people were oppressed and subject to the whims and cruelty of the Nazi party - falling just short of the systematic destruction of their race.Not for the faint of heart!! While there are thankfully few, several scenes are so brutal they left me shocked and horrified for days. It certainly doesn't gloss over anything.Fascinating perspective not usually seen in Holocaust-era books. It left me wanting to read more about this era."},{"rating":"2","title":"Those Who Save Us","review":"This was one of the best books I read in a long time, to think some people want to say this never happened.

In Madwand (and Changeling, the prequel) he introduces the idea that all the fireworks and fanfare is really an illusion over base telekinetic abilities. The idea that each adept has a deeply personal 'system' of perceiving the works and effects of magic around them is quite intriguing.Pol Detson (the protagonist) was born with a keen natural 'magic' ability. Since he was not trained in the traditional sense, he is considered a 'madwand' by the establishment. Madwands are noted for their raw power, but most become quite insane when they attempt to tune their abilities. The story has some of the most detailed magical conflicts I've read and is quite interesting.Like many of Zelazny's works, I'm left wanting the story to continue indefinitely. I wish he had time to write a sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow.

More often than not, the author, Rene Chartrande goes into obscure detail that adds little to the text. Like many of his other works, Chartrande does not reveal enough useful sources. Photographs of exhisting uniforms and equipment are helpful, but if these were in color v.s. black and white, it would enhance these books. Chartrande cranks out numerous books for Osprey, but it's looking more like he's going for quantity over quality. Chartrande should go back to the style and depth of his older works."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read easy introduction to brain function.","review":"Dowling has written a superb, easy to read introduction to brain structure and function. The book is well set out and has lots of figures which really complement the text and help to clarify the concepts that are being explained. Dowling uses lots of examples throughout the book and even though I got the idea that this book was an up to date report on the latest research and findings of neuroscience, the book reads more like a novel than a scientific text."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Please read all label information ON DELIVERY\\"?...Why wait?","review":"I suspect that the phrase mentioned in the title of my review (which I saw in the description of the product) was Amazon's idea since most (if not all) of the label information is easily found on Nature Made's own website www.NatureMade.com.There you will find that several of the components are synthetic (not necessarily bad, but I like to know), and also that Amazon is near the top in selling price of the 6 listed online retailers for this particular product.Ain't it just amazing what the web can teach you?

It's a good album for folks like me who search for certain songs. However, about 40 to 50% of the songs on there are very forgettable and some (like the one they chose from The Wedding Singer) aren't even the best or major song that one would associate with that movie.

I have seen other pictures of his, and the ones in this calander are fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cute book, great for puppie lovers","review":"I picked up this book the other day, and It is by far the cutest out of all the Wegman books. You always see the full grown dogs in his prints, but this book puts together the puppies. There is a touching/nice story to follow from page to page, that gives meaning on to why he chose dogs to photograph, and how much they mean to him. The photo's are very cute, and it is a simple book, nice for children. I love Wegman's work, and this one is just plain cute, a change from his fashion prints with all the costumes, this book just takes a look at the puppies, plain and simple. ^^The only thing I wish, is that there was a bigger showcase of pictures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good product bad shipping and handling service","review":"I really like the calendar and the photos are great.However, the company shipped the calendar in a manila paper envelop, this cause the the corners of the calendar got badly damaged.At the end you get a bittersweet feeling because you like the photos and the calendar format but it's really annoying to have its corners damaged, especially because they are charging you shipping and handling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much of One Puppy","review":"I love puppies, don't get me wrong. But I am so glad I got to see every month of this calendar before I bought it. If you see the picture on the front of the calendar (which is adorable) you might as well turn out the light and go home. Its the same puppy throughout the calendar! A few months have what looks like a whole litter, but they all look exactly the same. An adult dog is in one picture, but it just looks like a bigger version of the same puppy. I would be bored stiff with this calendar by May or June.These puppies are cute, but please give me a little variety over a 12-month period."},{"rating":"2","title":"creative,good story","review":"I think this book is quite interesting to look at and read. William Wegman's photographs are very nicely arranged; no one else would have thought of photographing dogs like he does. I never really cared for Weimaraners until I saw some of his work. This is also a good biography on his career and the lives of his dogs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't read the dates from a distance","review":"I received this calendar as a gift, although I have been purchasing it myself for many years. In 2009 they changed the design of the calendar and made the print on the calendar portion much lighter than in previous years. The problem is that the layout and design, combined with the light pastel color ink, makes the calendar unreadable from more than two or three feet away. I have to put on my glasses and get within two feet of the calendar in order to read the date. The calendar is in a well-lit location.If you just want this calendar for the pictures, you will be pleased. If you want to see the date, you may want to consider a different calendar.I will not purchase this calendar again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still waiting for my Calandar....","review":"I am still waiting for my calandar to arrive.

The content is completely immersive and thought provoking. I love this show.My only criticism: the case was broken upon receipt. The design is well thought out to conserve space but the construction could be stronger (or a different layout). Specifically, the single middle leaf holds several disks and is too heavy for the thickness of the plastic clips holding it into the case. So I'm guessing the jostling around in shipping broke one of the clips resulting in the leaf now loosely flopping from one clip inside the case. I'd call it a fluke except that I received GITS:SAC in exactly the same case design - also broken in shipping in the same way (two different shipments)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!!!

I was preparing a Harmony course merging Schönberg with Kostka/Payne, and I was looking for something practical and rich of examples; so the title kept my attention. Then I was called outside in a hurry, and without thinking very much, I bought the volume. What a mistake! First of all it is full of errors: from real ones (a major sixth doesn't have 8 semitones) to typographical (almost all the headnotes are wrong). Moreover terms and rules are absolutely non-standard. And, as a cherry on the cake, when, in the appendix, he tries to explain some \\"Fundamentals of Acoustic, he reveals a great deal of ignorance, defining a logarithm base 10 (where he needed a logarithm base 2), confusing energy with amplitude, and giving vague explanations of the length of an instrument.

He also shows a strong bias towards cognitive science, but that is understandable since it is he field of study. He uses cognitive science to try to explain things which don't need explaining, because most people already understand what he terms, \\"Theological Incorrectness\\". He brings no new information to the discussion, and adds a number of misunderstandings and falsehoods, and I think that this book is a hinderance to the very field of study which it was meant to benefit."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE: Quality has changed","review":"I bought these color cases at my retail workplace for the last couple years and most were pretty good.

This reader had hoped the premise of a less than perfect heroine, and a hero who finds her beauty in non-traditional ways would be fresh and a satisfying read. Instead, Melissa, the heroine, comes off as niave and standoff-ish instead of sympathetic with strength mixed in. She goes very quickly from hating anyone from the \\"outside\\" world to hopping into bed with the hero and hoping that one time will get her pregnant. Which is a disturbing thought, with the heroine already having borderline mental illness or social phobia at best. The Hero is the strongest point of this book, not breaking his word to a friend to protect the heroine and putting up with her behavior far beyond what most men would endure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"Don't waste your money!There are more tips and better directions in basic quilling books ...

No mention of the best type of scissors for this, the ease of bulldog clips, or commercial fringers.Those are the things beginners need to know!It shows shapes, but most of the directions are in the individual projects. Beginners would find it much more helpful to see all basic shapes and how to make them.Five pages are wasted on a \\"Children's Gallery\\", comprised of colored photos of shapes made by kids.

After checking out as many Java books as the library systems in our surrounding three counties had to offer, I believe that this one was the most readable and understandable for a beginner like myself.

I've read Deitel & Deitel's book on Java2, and while it is thorough, it seems like they try to make you feel inadequate. They ask questions in such a way that by the time I'm done answering it I'm frustrated and feeling like \\"Am I ever gonna get this?\\". Mr. Schildt asks the questions in his \\"1-minute drill\\" and \\"Mastery Check\\" sections in such a way that not only can you answer it correctly, but in a way that when you think about your answer you've also remembered it in such a way that it sticks.

This is a sextet date that features a group that includes students from his legendary Lennox School days. One of the students here, David Baker, ended up being a leading jazz educator himself.Russell's sextet records from the early to mid '60s feature a level of creativity that is almost unmatched to this day in the jazz world. Forget the usual melody-solos-melody routine, all of his work from the era has tightly focused yet intricate compostion that merits and rewards repeated listening. He always finds soloists with unique voices to light up the improvisational sections, as you will find here.So here's a rare chance to pick up some great work from an artist that still has not had anywhere near the recognition he deserves."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like Ezz-thetic and Outer View, this is for you.","review":"If you like George Russell in his 50's/60's sextet format, you will enjoy this record. His Lydian Chromatic mode is on full display on this record. And although Outer View and Ezz-thetics are his really classic contributions to that period in jazz, and Steve Swallow and Eric Dolphy are absent during this session, the album has the swing and harmonic approach of the aforementioned records. This is partially due to the presence of David Baker on trombone and the bass of Chuck Israels. And by the way, this does not sound like a show that was recorded live at the Five Spot - there are no audience sounds or applause. So keep that in mind if you're looking for a \\"live\\" George Russell recording.

The source material include Gurdjieff, Sufism and Carlos Castaneda to mention a few and are corroborated by the author's own experiments into Superluminal Communication.The book is up to date with a big discussion of COINTELPRO - Counter Intelligence Programs - the very mechanism put in place to keep humanity from waking up from it's sleep. To this end the New Age Movement was set up and heavily promoted as it ensured that people remained asleep while thinking that they were waking up.

However, I am using it in a Parallel pen for drawing, and I have filled the barrel of the pen with the ink. In order to fill the barrel of the pen, I have to put a slight coating of silicone sealer around the threads of the pen barrel, so the ink doesn't leak out. This works with most inks, but with this ink, it manages to leak out of the barrel through the threads. Since my sister has also had the same problem, we think there is something in the ink that eats through the silicone sealer. Other inks we have used in these pens do not eat through the sealer. If you are using this ink in a different pen, or you fill a cartridge with it, you might be happier, because the color is wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honigman's essays on higher education are widely appreciated","review":"\\"I appreciate your guest columns and have been running them regularly in The South End's Commentary Section.

Amazon wouldn't help with the problem until the delivery window quoted by Northern Tool had passed (although it was clear the item had been lost, as all records showed it to have been shipped concurrent with the compressor).Finally, a month after delivery of the compressor (sans start-up kit) my claim with Amazon resulted in a credit for the kit.

Just thought I'd point that out.On to the product itself, well, as the title suggests, it's an amazing journal, should you choose to use it that way. I also ordered Varsity fountain pens to use while writing in this thing, and let me say, it's amazing. By the time I'm done writing, I have ink all over my fingers. It makes me feel almost like an old-fashioned writer. The pages aren't thick, but they aren't thin enough to where the ink from my pen will bleed through the other side and garble whatever I was writing previously. I also use a straight razor to slit the paper on some pages where I want to keep Polaroid pictures.This works extremely well for me.

I have found little to like on this album and I don't doubt that many who have bought this album will eventually come around to a similar conclusion. Let me put it this way, listening to this album is like having a very tedious and opinionated dinner guest who insists on ranting and raving about their 'significant other' during all three courses and desert.

There is no apparent order in this collection of essays, and I found that the first one or two were not very engaging, but I enjoyed the collection quite a lot after I got into a bit more.This work contains a lot that explains how places got their names, how and why maps evolved during the age of exploration, and why some adventurers are household names now while others are virtually unheard of.

The uniform is nice, and so are the weapons, but if you want to buy this for a youth, then most of the accessories will be laying around on the floor after fifteen minutes of play. 21st Century is a contradiction in toys.

I know, I am a technical magazine editor and work with about 10 contributed technical articles a month. I just wish contributing writers would read this book. It lays out how to clearly write about very complex topics. And it does so in a very logical and structured manner. It even provides block diagrams to show how to put things together (for you engineers out there). Dr Williams did a fine job. This is not a simple book, nor a quick read.

Here's why.- Low power consumption. No need to find the USB port on the back of a G4 anymore, plugs directly into the keyboard USB port without problems.- Compatibility. Complete compatibility between PCs and Macs. No unnecessary 'security' software preinstalled that may compromise compatibility.- Professsional looking.- Low profile: For hard to reach USB ports.- Ejection time. When you eject the mounted drive and the icon dissapears from the desktop you can pull out the USB drive immediately. With other vendors, even if the icon has disappeared the USB drive has not unmounted.- No cap problems. Unless you lose it...Cons:- Speed. Slow transfer speeds compared to the 100X model.- Need even lower profile.

While some plays thrive on their simplicity, I felt it spoiled this play. With no scenes or acts, this play relies on fade-outs and a heavy imagination. We see a 20-year span involving homes, cars, and people aging all on one stage. Because we only get a taste of the people through this 20-year span, I could not warm up to and get to know the three characters in this play. By the end, I know that Miss Daisy and Hoke are close, but I only know this because they've known each other for 20-years; I did not see the closeness emerge for myself. I had truly hoped for more concerning Miss Daisy teaching Hoke to read and write - this would have added great character interaction. The screenwriter's had to work hard to make this 39-page play into a 99-minute movie involving scenes and actual time spans. I hope the movie is better.

For Christianity and western civilization in general he shows nothing but contempt. Whatever.This book's title and promotion promise something entirely different from this book. I wanted to read about the flying: How he read the weather, how he assessed whether a particular lake was adequate for landing. Is it possible to land in a lake that's too short to take off from? What other flying has this author done? Why did he take this trip? Why was he alone?Well, I did find the answer to that last question: He's a sophist and a bore."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a book about flying","review":"Despite what the cover and title may lead you to believe, this book is not about flying.

Like an overbearing professor, he tosses in disjointed lectures which are meant to impress me as much as educate me. Rarely the subject matter related to his trip. Often they were horribly ill-fitted lessons of Galileo or Vasco. Who cares?Furthermore, I was led to dislike Erickson. As a pilot, it seems, he is marginal. However, this tree hugging, earth worshipping, religion hater is a gifted writer.

While it does list each model produced by the various companies and offer a valuation, it fails to describe the models in any detail. Therefore, a prospective collector has virtually no useful information to go on. It doesn't even tell you the various colours the models have been released in, or any details which might differenciate one model from another.As for photos.

This is software that can be used to \\"drag and drop\\" any file (music or non-music) to burn a CD. It turned out to be a nightmare. CDs were not able to be finalized.

After about a year, they announced (very discretely!) that the program could cause problems with various operating systems and that it should be uninstalled immediately. There was no offer to compensate those that paid for this software. Even after that debacle, the tech support has not improved. If you want to talk by phone, for most it is your long distance call, and the wait time is long. In some cases you may end up paying more for the long distance call than you paid for the software.

I refuse to pay for long distance. I also refuse to buy any more Roxio products, at any price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be pulled off the shelves!!","review":"After reading the reviews, it is easy to see that I'm NOT the only one having all sorts of problems. Roxio \\"Easy\\" (LOL) CD/DVD Creator came bundled with my new TDK DVD burner. It has got to be the sorriest software I've ever attempted to install, with the exception of some freeware. It exposed hidden partitions, only partially installed, and I'm seeing the dreaded BSOD, telling me that there is a software or hardware conflict. Version 5 came with my computer, so I had to go back to using it. Also, ever since I TRIED to install version 6, ACDSee tries to act as Windows Explorer. I would advise any and everyone who is even thinking about purschasing this software NOT to. It's looking like I'm going to have to wipe my HD and start all over."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD Creator 6 installation disasters","review":"I'm both relieved and bummed to find so many others have experienced the same catastrophe I did in installing this product. It came bundled with a DVD burner from one of THE top names in the industry, and it shuffled my folders across my partitioned hard drive like a drunken poker player. Windows even lost all sight of a 60gig external hard drive -- it would dutifully \\"beep\\" in hardware recognition when I unplugged and replugged the drive into its firewire port, but the drive itself might as well have been in the Phantom Zone. Until Roxio makes clear -- In. No. Uncertain.

I tend to go for updates of a product when I'm happy it. So, I ordered Easy CD Creator CD & DVD Creator 6 Platinum at an excellent price from Amazon.Big mistake! I find that it is unstable -- sometimes working, other times freezing my system (Microsoft XP Home). The worst thing about it, however, is that it refuses to read CD-RW disks that were written with Creator 5 and read absolutely FINE with Creator 5. That was the last straw!I do have something positive to say about the Easy CD Creator CD & DVD 6 Platinum. It uninstalls well. Now excuse me while I get back to using my reliable, if not as capable, Creator 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Exploring...","review":"I installed Roxio Easy CD & DVD Creator 6 on my PC yesterday and so far, I love it. Installation and registration were a snap. I am still exploring all the extra goodies and features. With two small children, the PhotoSuite feature, will come in handy. I was able to edit the quality of a photo, as well as, add a fun caption. I was so proud of my own photo creation, that I wanted to share it. So, I did. I was able to select send e-mail directly from the command bar. Too cool... I also had fun editing my audio tracks. I'm certainly not a Disc Jockey, but with the AudioCentral I can mix and edit my music, to my style. I look forward to finding new projects to create with my Creator 6. I am only rating this product 4 stars, because I have not seen it all. This product is exactly what I was looking for, and I didn't even know it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Next time I'll believe the bad reviews","review":"I put in an order for this (I had version 5 on a prior PC) so that I'd have some decent DVD software on my new PC.

So far, it has completely prevented XP from restarting (giving me a message that Windows can no longer figure out whether I have a valid license or not -- trust me, I do; and then on another reinstall hungup half-way through copying files. For something as basic as disk copying you shouldn't have to deal with the kind of problems that bleeding-edge games or other exotic software present.

They took away most of the functionality of v5 and called it an upgrade. I have uninstalled this \\"upgrade\\" and went back to v5. I recommend you buy ANYTHING ELSE rather than waste $ on this. Their tech support was basically useless to try to answer any of my questions - they weren't even aware of the features in v5.

I read many reviews on the Vers. 6 Basic and Platinum and was not willing to take a chance on purchasing. I purchased a DVD burner which included the Basic Version EZ CD & DVD Creator 6. I installed the thing and it could not see my drives; not even the drive it came with. I turned off Drag and Drop and still nothing. I went to Roxio site and there was no real answer to resolve the problem. I tried reinstalling and nothing. I tried working with the registry and removing the filters they suggested I remove and still nothing. After approx. 3 to 4 hours of this I decided to uninstall and reinstall Version 5 Platinum. Everything works fine. It is truly a shame that a company with such a good reputation has allowed this software on the shelves for sale. The consumer needs protection from companies that sell faulty software to unsuspecting consumers. Shame on you Roxio."},{"rating":"1","title":"I despise this product with the heat of 1,000 suns.","review":"This is the single most frustrating software package I have ever had the displeasure of grappling with -- and in this day and age, that is truly saying something. After spending approximately 15 hours, I have been unable to finish burning a complete disc (sessions stall; discs that are readable one minute are declared unreadable or even non-existent the next; even the smallest error can cause the process to start over as late as 90% into completion, etc.). The so-called help files are utterly useless. My system is supposedly compatible, but clearly it makes no difference: \\"Easy CD Creator\\" is none of those things -- neither easy nor capable of creating a CD. I will never buy another Roxio product, and hope to dissaude anyone from handing over a red cent to Roxio. It's enough to make me go back to analog recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"A few warnings","review":"The maker neglects to mention that the CD inserts prepared and saved with Easy CD Creator 5 will not be formatted the correctly in this new version: you'll have to recreate any jewel case inserts you have on hand. No fix planned, according to their customer support. Also, the memory leak problem from version 5 is still present in version 6. (At least, I assume that's what it is: after burning several CDs, open programs start to malfunction just as if there was insufficient memory, and sometimes I get an insufficient memory message.) I've asked about this, but get no answer. Also, in the Label Creator, when you copy a picture object, apparently it's copied to a clipboard within the program, rather than the system clipboard, so you can't paste it into (for example) MS Word. This is a pain as you try to recreate your label inserts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Screws up your Hard Drive","review":"I haven't used the program too much yet, but the one dvd backup I did make worked fine.My major qualm with the program is that upon installation, it seems to have partitioned my hard drive without asking me and for no apparent reason.

I was unable to burn a DVD with this software, but at least the software prevented me from even trying to burn the DVD, so I didn't waste the DVD. That being said, if you can get it to work, it's very extensive. You can also burn audio CD's from .wav and .mp3 files, with CD-text, and then import the track information to the label-maker. Pinnacle's Instant CD+DVD might be more suitable for you. They have a trial version so you can make sure it works on your computer before you buy.

The program obviously planted something in my registry or my Windows folder that can't be removed on un-install. Now I'll probably have to re-format my C: drive and re-install everything.

I tried calling the tech. support number and the area code had changed. They have no phone number that you can call without a credit crd number being used. There is no mailing address, save their legal department. I just wish I had been happy with version 5 which came installed on my new computer. The web site support is very lacking in assistance.

The show looks great in the preview in Roxio - but the DVD will not play in the computer nor the stand alone DVD player. This thing is buggy too. Shows do not run the entire length of songs and transitions are buggy. Who beta-tested this software - someone from Microsoft.Before anyone spends hours creating a slideshow that you cant port anywhere else - think again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Back to the drawing board","review":"This is without a doubt the worst program, in any category, that I have ever used. It frankly does not work let alone work as advertised. It consistently stops burning and displays error messages. There is no way to correct them. I have tried burning at speeds from 40x down to 8x. Nothing works. I've tried different media and Roxio's \\"smart burn.\\" Same results. The same applies to disc copying. I've trashed at least 2 doz or more perfectly good CDs trying to get this thing to work. I was able to burn 1 CD. It took almost 7 hours and left off the last 2.5 tracks. Tech support is worse than useless, they don't even respond to email questions. Save your money and don't bother with this program. It is a total waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT Buy This Product!","review":"Roxio is known for having bugs, but this program is the world class bug infested software of all time. I don't even know where to start. But suffice to say that I allowed the program to be updated last night and now the thing can't even format a CD-RW. It won't even print labels, even ones created with earlier versions of this product, and the label maker was traditionally the only bug-free part of the suite.I have never seen a more blantant disregard for customer satisfaction.Uninstalling it was one of the highlights of my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"no support and they don't care","review":"Product does not remove previous edition, and does not load. when calling the support center you may have to wait up to an hour to talk to someone. then you are put on hold again, to talk to a service rep/tech which means another 30 to 40 minute wait. And then the problem is still not resolved. Undoubtedly, this company does not care about customer support or service. Additionally, it would appear that the company is sending out a beta version of the program as a 'tested' version, because the first update is is over 6 meg in size."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy CD Creator Trouble Free","review":"I have installed this software version on a minimum of four desktop and one laptop running Windows XP Home Edition and one desktop running Windows 98. Three I did the install directly over a previous version of Roxio's product, the other three were clean installs. I have experienced absolutely no problems. My main use is for writing CDs. It does that with no problem.Don't purchase it with unrealistic expectations. It cannot circumvent copy protection of DVDs and if that is your expectation, you will be disappointed. I have made music CDs from it and they work beautifully. It automatically can determine the speed for recording. That is a definite improvement of previous versions where it would ruin many cds until you figured out there was a problem with the record speed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, something on the PC to rival Apple","review":"Being a longtime Mac user, I was constantly frustrated by the lack of functionality that PC apps had. To get comparable features, one had to cobble together about 10 pieces of software. Roxio has it right by putting together all of the functionality in one reliable software app. It's about time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Easily Overated","review":"My problem is with the sound editor function. There is absolutely no help in the user's manual. There is not a single illustration of the very complex screen (I do not mean the waveform). No help with the moving cursors. No instructions on how to select a part of the material and piece together with other parts for recording. The email support is meaningless. There is plenty of help for the kids who want to make labels, and I think that is the feature most people are raving about. I would return the package if I could. Wayne is my name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crashed a lot and isn't compatible with newer hardware or operating systems.","review":"Crashed a lot and isn't compatible with newer hardware or operating systems.

I purchase Easy CD & DVD Creator because it seemed to have all the features I wanted, and none of the features I didn't want. I wanted a simple video capturing utility, a simple video editing tool, and the ability to create menus on my DVDs. I am able to easily download my video from my camera (via Firewire), edit my scenes, and create a Themed Menu very easily. I recently came back from a family vacation and had over two hours of video and nearly 200 digital pictures. I used Easy CD & DVD to create a DVD that not only included my edited video, but a slide show of my pictures set to music. The quality was excellent, and I am very happy with the results."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bugfilled XP Product","review":"I wholeheartedly agree with every negative article related to this product - if you use windows XP. As an example the Label maker does not refresh properly so the graphics bleed into one another. Tech support almosts laughs at people with their standard comments - oh its going to be fixed on the next upgrade. I'm not sure how they let this product out the door. It's too bad becuase their earlier versions did its job relatively seemlessly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Opinion from a PC tech: Don't buy version 6 at any price","review":"I've used every version of Roxio's CD software - back to when it was from Adaptec and I really liked every version - until this one. It is rediculously buggy. Sometimes things work, then the next time they lock up the PC, then they work again. This is the only software on my PC that does this - and that was after all updates were applied for windows XP Pro SP1 and all updates from Roxio. This version from Roxio has made me not trust Roxio's products anymore. I never agreed to be their beta tester.This is the first time I have ever written a negative review and it was because of how bad I feel this is that I felt compelled to warn others. Version 7 may be better, but I'm not willing to take that chance. I feel Roxio should be giving V7 away to the people that bought version 6."},{"rating":"1","title":"BLOATED and complicated","review":"VERY disappointed.

Two days, 12 reboots, tech support from Roxio with instructions on how to fix it that didn't help ...and back to the store I went for money back which I got with no problem and a sly smile from the clerk. H'mmm......Avoid this product at all costs....I find it hard to believe that Roxio released this piece of junk with more bugs than a street light in August."},{"rating":"1","title":"Want marginal customer support? Buy any Roxio product!","review":"I purchased the Easy CD & DVD Creator 6 Platinum Edition in November 2004, after Microsoft's SP2 for Windows XP made my Basic 5 version unusable. I've been exchanging emails with Roxio Technical Support ever since. I can burn a data CD only to a CDR (for some reason ECDC 6 does not recognize my CDRWs). I cannot copy a CD using the Disc Copier function. For some reason the ECDC 6 recognizes my burner only through the Creator Classic function.What is wrong with companies these days? They grab the money and run. Never mind whether the customer gets the functionality they are paying for.I'll be looking into Nero or Sonic, which I've heard positive comments from live users.Amazon.com, on the other hand, is one customer-oriented company!"},{"rating":"1","title":"lost spin doctor","review":"This version has Audio Central which does not have near the functionality of the old spin doctor.

This product is nowhere near worth the price they are asking."},{"rating":"1","title":"After installing made a complete mess of my Sony Software.","review":"This software in not a measureable improvement on their Basic Roxio 5.After installing Roxio 6, I experienced so many problems with my installed software that I had no choice but to abandon the Roxio 6. To those out there who have Sony software installed, DO NOT ATTEMPT the installation of Roxio 6.Reading their incompatible guide at their Web site, I'm amazed that Roxio will run in tandem with any comparable software.I award one star, 'cause the system will not allow a lower rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Total Rip-off","review":"Nothing but problems, bugs, freeze-ups, and counterproductive slop.

When my husband and I decided to reload our OS I figured we'd try the next step up. What a mistake! Version 6 takes forever to install, caused my pc to take forever to perform restarts, and won't even open. After uninstalling and reinstalling I still had the same problem. I plan on demanding my money back from Roxio and sticking to good old version 5. I definitely do not recommend this product. I only wish I had read the reviews here at Amazon and on Roxio's own website before wasting my time on this software."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy it - Verification Errors","review":"I've been using version 5 and bought 6 on a year-end sale. Every CD and DVD I've written with it have ended up with \\"verify\\" errors (what is written does not match the source file(s). In one case it was only one mp3 file that was being written, and I did a binary comparison of the original versus cd version. 11 bytes were changed in two different places. I tried again, and the exact same bytes were changed again - certainly not a random error! With the DVD's I've tried, same thing - the copies don't match the originals. I went back to version 5, which works fine with exactly the same CD and DVD writers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might be ok if it would work","review":"After installing the program on my pc running windows xp professional, start up screen would appear but none of the options would run.

For a duplex printer it is very compact and doesn't need access around it or behind it. It prints duplex flawlessly and has a great feature that shrinks the pages down to 4 pages on a side or with the duplex 8 pages total on each page. It's a great way to save paper to review rough drafts. I did have an initially bad start when the printer was jamming all the time with 28lb laser paper; but after switching to cheaper 20lb copy paper it hasn't jammed once. A great value (I considered the cheapest HP duplex printer but it was almost twice as much and a lot bigger in size and I don't think it has the great shrink-down-to-4-pages-on-a-side feature)."},{"rating":"2","title":"texas review","review":"God bless texas is right.

Then he gifts us a \\"reggae\\" version of one of his favourite hits of all his career: \\"Said I Loved You... But I Lied\\".However, Bolton really shines with all his strengh on the second part of the album, with live performances. All of them, from beginning to end, are simply amazing.

It has peppy, infectious songs like The Dandy Warhols TV Theme Song or The Coffee and Tea Wrecks, it has really well written, rockin' songs like (Tony, this song is called) Lou Weed, slower songs like Genius and Not Your Bottle. I think its coolest part is the three-part It's A Fast Driving Rave Up With the Dandy Warhols Sixteen Minutes. It gets into a loopig groove that's almost hypnotic. In fact, most of the album has a cool, stoner sound. It comes across with a looping, subtle sound that you can just get completely cought up in and immerse yourself for however long you want to loop the CD.

His treatment is solidly grounded in the main historical sources- Arrian, Curtius Rufus, and Diodorus- as well as his own life's work. Alexander is one of the most controversial historical figures and has attracted a wide range of authors; from the brilliant to the sentimental (Peter Green) to the narcissitic (Michael Wood). Caveat lector! While often lumped in with Alexander's apologists (Tarn et al), Hammond's work is generally insightful, evenhanded, and readable, and this is no exception. The book is rather slim and general, but well-referenced (and details are in Arrian if you want them)."},{"rating":"2","title":"An insightful book on a military genius","review":"Hammond's book is the first book I have read on Alexander and I think it is a great book to read if you know at least some detail about Alexander. From his early day's with Philip to Alexander's brilliant conquest of Persia to his early death, this book is absolutely great. The book is fairly brief, but it incorporates good research.

Pitiful!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"Can somebody tell me why I spent $14.00 to be bored to death? This album bored me so much, I felt like smacking someone.

Why?","review":"Oh my god... how can be possible that such a talented composer had to fall in such deep nonsense, remaking a whole bunch of old tunes to end up like something much worse than even Muzak? This is the music you'll hear again and again at the supermarket, just sufficiently engineered to num the brain.Kiss of Life is the only light of hope (and that's why this CD gets 1 star - otherwise should be zero, or even negative!) but that's only because I love Sade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressive at all!!!!","review":"I love the sound of Rick Braun but this new album doesn't display much originality. All songs are remakes, so what happened to his own music. He plays with class and sytle but it was not worth the money. Who wants to here remakes? Come on Rick, the last two albums are just weak. I suggest saving your money on this one. What is happening with the smooth jazz artist of today? Sounds like they are not spending enough time and money to get good material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Move over, Lunesta","review":"There's less than 42 minutes of music on this CD, and it is best described as insipid.

The next CD may be favorites from the hymnal..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rick Braun is Great","review":"At one time in my life I made my living playing jazz music. Although, was never good enough to even think of making it big time. Guys like Rick Braun who play with such SOUL take music to an emotional high that can't be \\"manufactured\\" by wanna be musicians. The fact is that he has it. He could play anything at all and the soul would come through. I heard the Shining Star cut off this album on the radio and almost had to pull the car over. I really love the way he plays with such understatement. And, I especially appreciate the fact that he is not trying to perform the mindless jazz gymnastics that so many tasteless wanna be's try to do.This is great music played by an outstanding musician."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Be Fooled!","review":"Wish I have read some reviewers comments before buying it.

This is honest, pure, heartfelt, and fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than rephlex","review":"Lusine has had several albums, but this is his first for Ghostly. The title is very telling, as Lusine dabbles in different styles throughout the album, such as techno, hip-hop, and ambient. Some of the tracks jump out at you right away, while others gently fade into the background and become the soundtrack to your life. But there are no jarring switches, it is all done with finesse and flow. Lusine knows a thing or two about craftsmanship. Very intricate stuff. You might have heard some of it if you watch \\"CSI\\" on TV. The more times you listen to this CD, the more things you notice. Recommended if you like Aphex Twin, Boards of Canada, Luomo, Prefuse 73, or Sutekh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lusine - Serial Hodgepodge","review":"Abstract and proud, Lusine's SERIAL HODGEPODGE wears its credentials on its sleeve, from the torn-up female vocals and melodic underpinnings on \\"Ask You\\" to the crispness of \\"Slur.\\" \\"Drip\\" sounds like a lost Tim Hecker track, however, while \\"The Drop\\" edges into Akufen-like house rhythms. And, as if just to prove he could do it, he moves to downtempo on the gentle \\"Everything Under the Sun.\\" Though the tracks show sharp production values, they can be sterile at times; for instance, \\"Falling In\\" is smart and danceable, but also cold. \\"Auto Pilot\\" is slightly warmer, while \\"Figment\\" is slightly choppier. The final track, \\"Payne's Gray,\\" takes a completely abstract route, with a cello cutting in and out. Doubtless, there's an eclectic quality to these tracks, showing a great range of imagination and ability. But a more concrete vision to link the tracks together as an album would also be welcome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"This doll is beautiful...full of bling!!

My sister has one and had the same problem. her husband takes theres apart and fixes it everytime which I don't have the know how to do. Amazon took back the second one and refunded me, so it was worth the risk. Hopefully the company will fix the glitch and then I will try again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoddy buggy battery eater","review":"This worked great when I got it-- it does save a lot of water when it works.But mine has a tendency to occasionally flick itself on and off once quickly when there's nothing in the sink. I came home one day to find it switching the faucet on and off every few seconds-- great.And when the batteries died the first time after a few weeks, I started to wonder. Then the second set died after another few weeks, and I just had to laugh-- having water is great, but tossing a few dozen batteries to run it is going the wrong way.I've wired mine up with a DC adapter and a switch plugged into a GFCI outlet, so it's only on when I'm at the sink. It works great, but I don't appreciate having to mod something just to make it work.Another company needs to get in on this-- EZ-Faucets are not ready for prime time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty Faucet","review":"We purchased a few of these for use in our lab here in Ann Arbor. They worked fantastic for a few weeks, but then they began to fail one by one until we lost use of all 3 of them.

Second one worked fine with only one battery change for one year then died. Current one worked for two weeks and then drained the batteries. New batteries were placed in and were also drained within two weeks (they claim batteries should last 1.5 years). I am trying to exchange the item under warranty but it seems their customer service is intent on trying to convince people otherwise. They need to release their patent rights and allow other companies to improve on their design. This is the only product I know of in this price range, but $50 wasted is too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"After reading a few reviews online, I was wondering if this was the right choice. But after getting a $600 quote from a plumber to do the same thing, I thought the price was right, so I went with it. And I'm glad I did! It works perfectly. I'm using it in my restaurant kitchen's hand washing sink where we have about six people using the sink at all times. Its great for sanitation purposes. Nobody has to touch the faucet handles to turn on the water! Its great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what it says","review":"Easy to install and works like a charm. So easy to wash hands as water turns on instantly and then turns off as soon as hands are removed. It is rather cheap looking, being plated plastic but the cost is low. Improved over earlier models as batteries easier to change.Now more than a year later, both units work well. Only disadvantage I can find is the tendency to put hands under other taps in the house and expect them to also turn on."},{"rating":"1","title":"I loved it while it worked","review":"The expression \\"Too good to be true\\" fits here. Why are commercial motion-activated faucets $300-400 and this little gadget is 1/10th the price? Quality. Yes, it works very well out of the box and I thought it was great. After 5 months passed then it just stopped working. New batteries didn't help, cleaning it didn't help. Bought a second one and had similar results, although it made it to 6 months this time.Great idea, poor quality. Quite a shame as I would have purchased more of them if they lasted longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bummed!","review":"I was so excited to see an inexpensive way to make hand washing more fun and healthy for my kids. Hubby and I tried for 45 minutes to make it work someway, but the faucet continued to drip after several attempts at installation. Not a lot, but enough that we couldn't leave it on. I was very frustrated. From the other reviews, it sounds like others had a better experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but not durable","review":"This product worked quite well for about 3 months. As others have reported, it then became somewhat more difficult to get the sensor to detect the hands, slightly annoying but still working. And then the sensor became quite difficult. Cleaning the faucet and changing the batteries did not fix these issues. Finally, the faucet turned itself on and stayed on - that would be scary if it happened when no one was home. That was the trigger for me to remove it from the sink and seek a warranty repair. However, be aware that EZFaucet charges a big $15 fee for shipping and handling (plus your return postage costs) for a warranty replacement/repair. I'd recommend this faucet for short-term (three month or less) use. But over say a year, it will cost you $15 every three months, and that starts to become an expensive appliance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta have it!","review":"I have been using the Touchless EZ faucet for over 4 years. Although I am now on my third one, we love it. With an inhome childcare, it is a necessity for all the dirty little hands.

It has a button for constant flow too, which can be handy at times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Doesn't work","review":"I was very surprised to find that both of the units I ordered simply do not work.

The connection between the faucet and the gadget leaked constantly. We tried tweaking and adjusting but it still leaked. At one point of adjustment, it sprayed water everywhere.

But to me, his strongest performance to me is his solo hit \\"Hearts\\" from 1981. Heard it a lot when I was on summer vacation in Atlanta back in '81. Passionate, emotional, and gorgeous, he sounded so superb vocally on that song. I heard another compilation of Marty's songs, but it had 10 on it, and that's when I first heard Atlanta Lady, which has grown on me a lot.

I've spent 4 hours in 'live chat' with their technical support to make this thing work. And it won't do what I need it to do. First, be careful -- it must be plugged directly into the wall socket(it won't work plugged into a power strip) and it needs a main USB port in the back of your computer unit (front, side, or alternate USB ports won't work -- less power to alternate USB ports they said). And the you have to download a 'PRO' version of the software hidden on their website in order to back-up your entire computer system. Be careful of folders within folders. Selecting individual files is very cumbersome and doesn't always capture the folders within folders. And, if you need to back-up another computer across a network -- this won't do it.

He finally recorded a version of his song that made Linda Ronstadt a star, \\"Different Drum\\". The album was not a hit, but it should have been. For Pretty Much Your Standard Ranch Stash, he is again backed by a full band and although it is a different sound, it is still a great record. Again he does a version of a song that Linda Ronstadt recorded (but was a country hit for The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band), the stellar \\"Some Of Shelly's Blues\\". \\"Back Porch & A Fruit Jar Of Ice Tea\\" is a great song as \\"Winonah\\".

It decides it has a paper jam when it does'nt, goes offline when the monitor says it's online & ready. You have to keep opening the thing up re-seating the toner etc and re-printing only to find it has 'jammed' again. There are some XP issues sharing via the usb port on a network, although these seem to have been ironed out. Buy an H/P Laserjet or an entry level Brother, but not this RUBBISH!!

Called tech support (toll-free number refers you to a toll line) and they said it \\"has issues\\" with Windows 2000 SP4 and it doesn't work with Windows print sharing. They advised me to return it.

This printer is awsome!","review":"I don't know what everyone is talking about when they say the printer jams or can't be shared. Mine is shared and only jammed once.

I have gone through a whole box of paper on this thing thats 10 reams or 5000 peices of paper. I have used it over a year now and love it. I will have to replace the toner soon because the light is flashing but have found the toner for around 50 bucks on the net. Like I said before don't listen to these people that have had it a day and complain cause they don't know enough about what they are doing to hook it up.

Somebody bought 7 of them for our office - big mistake. They constantly jam, and the printer is to reliant on the software that comes with it (not the driver) that it constantly has to be removed and re-installed. Also, 4 of the printers have had their drums go bad in the first 6 months. When I called tech support, their answer was that the drum that it ships with isn't a very good quality, and that if you buy a new one it shouldn't wear out as quickly (yet still the drum warranty is only for 90 days)!! They're sending you inferior merchandise and they know it.The toner cartridges are cheap and leak, jamming the printer and drum with toner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can NOT be Networked/Shared","review":"I got one of these.

While some of the concepts may be challenging to some readers, I think they reach their goal of readability for a non-scientific readership. From the outset, they get right to the heart of their subject. They explain, \\"Uni-directional time, in fact, comes to appear as simply an illusion created in our minds. Frequently scientists who investigate this problem refer to our everyday sense of the flow of time, rather sneeringly as 'psychological time' or 'subjective time'\\" (p. 23).

But after the UK was hit by the 7/7 suicide bombers, some of the truth emerged. Having looked the other way since 1989 as Islamic groups put down roots in the UK, Britain has become a hub for Islamic terror throughout Europe and beyond. In Londonistan, Melanie Philips reveals herself as that typical breed of journalist/reporter who can identify the problem in great detail, but with an (also typical of many reporters) inability to identify the root cause of the problem - namely Third World immigration from Islamic countries.This flaw aside, \\"Londonistan\\" gives a very revealing insight into the Islamic threat facing Britain - and the British political establishment's refusal to face up to this threat and deal with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wake up call for America","review":"The writer explains in detail the results of appeasement of militant Islam.

Seller did not offer refund, but was very helpful trying to figure out why there were no instructions or why this was not pink."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product for manual or automatic","review":"This is a great buy considering other sites alone sell this product for $40.00-$80.00 not including S&H. its a strong well built knob, the metal seems to be steel and the top portion on some sites was said to be crystal or glass, thus its all solid dense material and feels perfect. The Glass/Crystal itself is a much darker red than the photo shows and it lights up bright to accent other lights you may have installed but not enough to blind you while driving. Another great feature is it has no wire its runs on a watch battery you can replace under the glass. To install is has plastic adapter caps to fit over your shifter, however the caps are a flimsy no friction plastic that breaks easily. Lucky for me I had some old rubber caps I used which held it in place firmly even without the 3 screws, though Id keep them on for saftey reasons.

The motivation and adventure of reading and the comfort of a book are extolled, and Quindlen reflects on her history as a lover of the written word. My only grievance was in her discussion of technology and its eventual submission of the physical book. Written in 1998, it is a bit out dated, as electronic reading technology has evolved tremendously in the last 11 years. However, I was extremely pleased that Quindlen included a few Top 10 book lists in the back, knowing readers well enough to fulfill their appetite for reading lists."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Reading Changed Myt Life","review":"Not edition as shown, unappealing library edition.

The mistakes McKenna makes with regards to the military are horrible. One reviewer already mentioned that she got the ranks wrong, but it goes way beyond there. There's a ton of mistakes with regards to uniforms, and decorum, even things as basic as the main character not having her hair up off her collar. I kept trying to get past it, and just when I thought I could get back into the swing of the story, up would pop another mistake. Maybe some someone who only read military themed books because they're exciting could get past it. But I'm ex-Army myself and every five pages I wanted to knock my head against the wall. I would have actually given it One Star, but I gave Ms. McKenna the benefit of the doubt and decided on two, since I couldn't get past the glaring errors into the actual plot of the book.

O'Nan answers this question with no. Jacob reverts to appalling habits, both during the diptheria outbreak and during the war, in an attempt to appear in control. O'Nan gives the readers a horrifying portrayal of human nature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jakob Hansen faces evil or the hand of God in Friendly,Wis.","review":"Jakob Hansen is sheriff, preacher and undertaker to the town of Friendly, Wisconsin. His idyllic life is shattered by an outbreak of diptheria. Who to save becomes, how to save and finally when to save, as the epidemic rages like a nearby wild prairie fire. Brilliantly written in the second person, 'A Prayer for the Dying' is not for the squeamish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shattering story","review":"A PRAYER FOR THE DYING is possibly the most emotionally-shattering novel I've ever read. O'Nan knows the way to quickly lure the reader into the lives of his characters and then skewer you with trauma. In this one, Yellow Fever strikes down a small midwest town shortly after the civil war had ended and we watch as its preacher/sheriff goes mad from his ineffectualism and heartbreak. Love it or hate it, this is one novel you'll never forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"At least eight stars!","review":"Stewart O'Nan never fails to impress me. He tackles different themes, different eras, different everything in each book. This one, slim and incisive, is a masterpiece of understatement. The tale of Jacob Hansen's life and losses soon after the Civil War, when the town of Friendship is stricken by both a diphtheria epidemic and a raging forest fire, is exquisitely simple but remarkably powerful. I haven't stopped thinking about this book since I finished reading it. I marvel at how much O'Nan manages to convey without ever being explicit. Love, tragic loss, and survival against all odds are the interwoven strands of the theme. Life lessons compressed into one short book. This is a very special novel, written by a wonderfully gifted writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing, morbid novel about love and death","review":"This engrossing tale quickly draws you into the life of a small town after the Civil War. One quickly finds oneself feeling a strong kinship with the kind, gentle narrator who guides us through his town, his family and his life. The reader is left almost breathless as one tragedy after another befalls this good man and the town in which he lives. As his world crumbles around him, we watch as this man reexamines and is tested concerning his faith, his beliefs in mankind, and his sense of responsibility to his family and his neighbors. Before you know it, the book is over. This is a very fast read, and at the end you'll find yourself wishing that you had more time with the narrator, more time to figure out what he does next and how he continues on after the events that have befallen him. Great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A visceral experience","review":"Although this novel is unrelentingly depressing, it remains vivid two weeks after I finished it and have moved on to other books. Why? O'Nan's use of the second person point of view is the primary reason, but his stark, descriptive prose is also memorable. Because \\"you\\" are the main character in this unusual novel, the reader finds himself or herself immediately involved in Jacob Hansen's fight against diphtheria, fire, self-doubt, and fear. Through Hansen's eyes, \\"you\\" see the disintegration of Friendship, both as the Wisconsin town he loves and as the loss of companionship and trust inherent in true friendship. Many of the events and desriptions are gut-wrenching, truly visceral, and made more so because they happen to \\"you.\\" Beautiful prose makes even the more sickening scenes powerful. If the true worth of a book is the effect it has on its readers, then \\"A Prayer for the Dying\\" is indeed a worthy novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Prayer For The Dying","review":"Here goes, yes O'Nan did a superb job of writing this novel in second person, yes I was compelled to read it quickly, however, I was very discouraged, well even outraged when I finished it. I know life is NOT a bed of roses and no I don't expect all novels to be uplifting...as a matter of fact, I don't read many that are, but I was totally disappointed when I closed the book. I expected at least one good thing to happen in this town or to Jacob. I was particulary put off by the things that went on with his wife and baby (not to give the story away I won't say). I found it grotesque and offensive. I'm sorry I spent three hours reading this book when I could have read something more enjoyable, \\"A Morticians Guide To Embalming\\" for instance. I dropped the book in a puddle (it was an accident) but as I bent to pick it up and looked at it lying there like a bloated swollen corpse, I realized it was appropriate and left it there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting!!!","review":"Since finishing this book it has haunted me. The 2nd Person Singular Present point of view hits the reader right off the bat as unusual but O'Nan's writing is so incredible it quickly feels natural. Then the characters and plot take over, grab you by the throat and won't let go all the way through the powerful, devastating conclusion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lyrical Nightmares","review":"As mentioned before, the narrative style is at first disconcerting but eventually seems eternally familiar.Jacob, undertaker, constable, and deacon, is a small town savior; fancies himself to be anyhow. When diptheria seeps into the Midwestern way of life, it's the job of the sheriff and the doc to reign in the ensuing chaos. The novel builds rapidly-- it's the written version of a wheel turning faster and faster.O'Nan wisely interrupts the haunting passages of death and sickness with lilting, sweet moments depicting Jacob as a true family man, enraptured with the happiness his wife and daughter bring him.The concurrent plot line brings a rushing wildfire into the quarantined town. Jacob is given the final decision between who lives and dies in this little place called Friendship, full of people who are no more and no less than a family to him.I fear this book has provided me with a set of delicate, beautiful nightmares tonight."},{"rating":"1","title":"grrrrrrrr...annoying","review":"I felt this book was writtern in a detached manner. Every time you felt you wanted to be part of the narrative it sort of warped you around. There was no emotional ties with the main characters. In fact all you wanted was for everyone to die and the book to end! If you feel you must read this book, take it out of the library and do yourself a favor!"},{"rating":"2","title":"horror from a different time","review":"Overall, this is a great book. However, one should know that the narrative is in the second or fifth person where when you read its like you do this and then you do that, which throws me off whenever a book is written like that, which is the only reason i am giving this book four stars. its about a plague, in the civil war era, and a fire, and one mans struggle to do what is right while at the same time losing his marbles...check it out, its a good read...if you prefer a more modern horror approach and have to read stewart o'nan, try the night country instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, please","review":"After everything O'Nan's done for us, this is easily his most insincere. I never believed the ethical battles, I never bought the slight insanity and I certainly couldn't figure the point. Darkness for darkness' sake is, well, just dark. It's as if Stewart was just looking for a new setting to ply his trade, rather than flexing his literary muscles, as he has in the past. I don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I finished it because a friend recommended it, but had she not, I would have quit after page 20. I wasn't interested in the story or writing. I didn't find the story grotesque; I've read a lot worse dealing with the various topics in this book, but I just didn't find the protagonist very interesting. He went a bit nutty at the end and it is understandable given the situation. We learn about why he had to stick so tenaciously to his religious beliefs, to redeem himself. His actions didn't seem out of line, either during the war or during the plague, given his dire predicament and previous behaviors and experiences. I know this is a great example of a book written in second person, and perhaps for that it is worth reading. I wouldn't pick it up for enjoyment or leisure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Right Idea, Wrong Format","review":"I found O'Nan's book a very difficult read. Writing in the 2nd Person format made the book hard to follow and boring. O'Nan had a good story plot, but should have used the 1st or 3rd Person Format to make the book more enjoyable and exciting read. The plot had the potential to be a page-turner. So much more could have been done with the story. This is the first book of O'nan's that I have read. If this book is considered his best, then I will not be reading any of his others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth a quick read","review":"I did enjoy reading this short novel, but after I finished I did return it to the bookstore. Mr. O'Nan's writing is clear and sharp, and his use of the third person is not only original but highly appropriate to the story. The reader really gets a sense for the situation facing the protagonist. However, by the end I felt that Mr. O'Nan had trivialized evil, the theme that dominates the novel. In fact evil is the only interesting character in the book, imposing its will on the helpless characters. Other readers may not have a problem with Mr. O'Nan's characterization, but I certainly did. The book is worth a read and can be tackled in an afternoon, but I don't think its good enough to own. See if you can find it at the library instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"another O'Nan imitation of literature","review":"This is a writer deeply convinced that he will sooner or later get it right, so he writes books of wildly disparate tone and style, hoping to find the voice to which the market will respond. With this novel, he has finally guessed right, and for that he is to be congratulated. It's a great imitation of literature. But O'Nan is ultimately not the real thing. This is a novel that contains some excellent writing, sentence to sentence, but it has no heart. Deep down, this novel is shallow, and no amount of skilled writing can make up for that. It's easier to be moved by this book if you haven't read anything else by this writer. If you loved this book, then you probably shouldn't plan on reading anything else by him or you'll be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prayer for the Dying","review":"Just a strange book----but so strange and somehow so real, I could not put it down, nor skip over passages, as I do with some books I'm bored with. I cannot really recommend this book unless the reader is into psychic horror, and likes that sort of thing. I was glad I was done with it and yet I have one more book by this author, that no doubt I will read one day."},{"rating":"2","title":"An elegant, unnerving novel","review":"Stewart O'Nan has constructed a miniature world with A PRAYER FOR THE DYING, and he peoples it and describes it so vividly that you nearly feel you are a part of it. This effect is all the more chilling when that world starts to implode.A diptheria epidemic--something virtually unknown in modern times--is stealthily, then openly, decimating a small Wisconsin town. Jacob Hansen, who serves as a combination sheriff, undertaker and minister, is doing his level best to deal with his combination of duties in the face of the epidemic. He is a strong and silent type, a Civil War veteran, and he does what has to be done as many of the townspeople are stricken. By the time O'Nan reveals the subtle, horrifying breadth of the epidemic, he had me so involved that it nearly took my breath away.This is an outstandingly fine novel--elegantly made, profound in its implications, and still reverberating in my mind weeks after I finished it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book that could have been","review":"First, you should understand that literally half this book is taken up by the text of RFC's that you can already get on the Internet. The rest is taken up by brief introductions to tools such as nmap and Ethereal that are too brief to be really useful.

I couldn't tell if it was missing a decimal or what the problem was. Even if that was the carbs per recipe rather than per serving, when you divided it by the # of servings it still ended up being more carbs than most diabetics should eat at a meal).In addition, the majority of the recipes were for desserts - which doesn't make a complete meal in my diet!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A nutritional disaster...","review":"I'm a recently diagnosed type 2 diabetic and I picked up this cookbook.

Writing on the box stated it contained a \\"kit\\". This kit is to replace a sealed beam, light producing headlamp. Being a \\"kit\\", implies that it has the necessary parts to replace the sealed beam unit and produce light when energized. The \\"kit\\" did not have H4 bulbs or wire harness. The wire harness is necessary because the H4 bulb and the sealed beam have different location of the contact blades, ie; you can't just plug the vehicle wire harness onto the H4 bulb. There was no mention, by Amazon, at anytime, that H4 bulb's and wire harness were not included.

I wanted to run it through my car so that I could see my Zen's screen on my DVD player's screen, but it's only 3 feet long, so that was disappointing.

I.e., both Left and Right channels are extracted and outputted, not simply the Left channel with audio mixed down to mono. Also, it works on some computers, too!On the minus side, I haven't gotten it to work on the television. In order to do so, you also have to buy the adapter for the Creative Zen player.I bought this so my Creative Sleek Photo would be compatible with an X-Rocker chair with built in speakers, and found that CD players and many other audio units became compatible, too.

Need I say any more?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This was supposed to be a contemporary?","review":"I had to keep telling myself that it was a contemporary story. I just wasn't buying that fact that a supposedly street smart girl, like Maggy, would let anyone, let alone Lyle do what he did to her. Smack her around, turn her child against him, let his brother in law do what he did. My gosh, Maggy wake up and smell the coffee!!! She should not have had to turn to Nick for saving. She should have been able to save herself . . . . 12 years before. She should have had more back bone given the childhood she endured. Nick, hhhmmm, he should have been able to locate her a long time before the 12 years had passed especially if he cared so much about her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea","review":"I'm not sure, but I think it had something to do with Lyle's satan-like behavior that turned me off to this one. I liked the storyline, however, 'I'm pregnant and the real father doesn't find out for 15 years', but the atrocious and dreadful circumstances that Maggie endures just to protect the secret...and then finally reveals the truth in the end...is just not my idea of romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid Silly Characters","review":"Again, Karen Robards has disappointed me. I used to be a fan but after the terrible \\"Senator's Wife\\" and now this, I'm going to avoid her. This book is so aggravating. I really can't muster sympathy for a woman who lets herself get physically tortured by a monster. She's a mother who should have been far more responsible. She's also a wimp when it comes to Nick, who just barges into her life and orders her around, almost like Lyle. And what was the deal about Nick blackmailing her with photographs from her past? You'd fall in love with a blackmailer? And Nick's character is a bland formless male being with no personality or charm. No, I'm sorry but again, Karen Robards has greated a romance story with truly odious lead characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool stuff, just like A.D.D. from Chicago","review":"I like the CD a lot......there's a band from here in Chicago called A.D.D. that are similar except that the female sings 100%.

Where are the guitars? You only get a few seconds worth of guitar in any given song. The rest is just boring, repetitive mellow music that would put you to sleep if not for Heather's painfully horrible vocals. I just can't understand why a great label like Nuclear Blast would sign such a lackluster artist to their artist roster. It's not gothic, it's not metal, and it sure as hell is not beautiful. And why all the freaking programming? Use guitars, people! They were created so that humans could create music that has more complexity than what rapper apes can produce.

I can certainly hear the Goth genra in it but it's remarkably generic. There is nothing outstanding or original about it. All the way through the album I was waiting for it to get started, to really shine or give me something that I hadn't heard a thousand times before. It was all just so...bland. At times I could almost believe I'm listening to a Goth remixed Avril Lavigne album (*shudder*).Despite my dislike of the generic style of this band, I don't think the musicians untalented. In fact I can say that they seem to know their business and they play together well. The album is also well balanced. It's just so unremarkable it's painful.

And because it won't stay put against the ear, it's not loud enough. Well, in a quiet room it's OK, but the way I use it, at airports, in the car, at trade shows, etc., forget it.It also constantly loses the connection from my Treo 680.I really can't understand why companies come out with products like this - doesn't anyone market test them?

It then flickered out a few seconds later. I called Motorola, not the seller on here, and they had me plug it into my car charger. Same result. Motorola sent a new one 4 days later and the same thing happened. Now I am waiting on shipping labels to return both headsets to Motorola.

I have contacted the 1 800 number on the back of the units and FIRST ALERTS answer is to contact their battery supplier. The batteries are the problem and FIRST ALERT does not stand by their \\"long life 10-year\\" batteries. FIRST ALERT inflated the price of an existing detector and included a lemon of a power source.

I am really sick and tired of having to wade through 500+ channels to reset the custom program list (the only way to navigate so many signals), only to find it gone the next day. And the remote control doesn't work unless you are directly in front of, and close to, the unit.

Non-hidden channels are placed in a \\"custom\\" list. Unfortunately, the custom list is accessed by pressing guide (showing all channels) then scrolling down a list to select custom - each and every time you press guide on the remote! What genius thought of this? You can't delete any channel and guide always selects all channels so your kids can get to everything. There is a lock option to password protect channels but you can't lock a hidden channel! Very bad design. There's plenty more but you get the idea.Don't buy this thing.

The transfer speed of the Media Reader, with most media brands/types and using iPod software version 2.1, is 300-320KBps. This results in a transfer time of between five and six minutes for a full 128MB card.Funny that they used the word \\"Optimized\\". My USB 1.1 Zio reader and G4 Powerbook transfers twice as fast.

The Firewire port is used but the transfer is really at USB1 (or less) speeds. Since both the reader and iPod must run on batteries, the slow speed and rapid battery drain can become an issue--quickly. The 5-6 minute download for 128MB may be tolerable; the 20-25 minutes for 500MB probably isn't. Brian VanHarlingen, Sr. Technology Manager for Belkin acknowledges this slow speed (see Belkin FAQs or other review sites). Unfortunately, there are currently no alternatives for transferring from camera to iPod (w/o computer)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as fast as they claim","review":"Though the concept is great, and the controls are straight forward and easy to use, the Belkin Reader falls short of usability.While out on a location, I was away from a power source and thought the Belkin reader would be a great alternative to lugging a laptop around for file transfers. Trying to transfer 1000 pics off a 1GB CF card wasimpossible. The reader would drain a fully charged ipod and still not finish the transfer. Though it claims firewire transfer speeds, I did some tests from home and found otherwise:100 compressed 2K pics transferred via:USB1 card reader to computer 1 min 20 sec.PCMCIA card reader in laptop 45 seconds.Belkin Media reader 6 min. 45 secThis was just a simple example.

I consider myself fortunate to have had the opportunity to witness certain of these techniques demonstrated by Larry Lachman. I also found the bereavement section quite informative since I amost lost my dog last year to coronary heart disease.I highly recommend this book to anyone who has a dog, anyone who is contemplating getting a dog as well as anyone who would like to better understand other people's dogs."},{"rating":"1","title":"The fallacies that are presented","review":"the fallacies that this individual presents are a great concern as if these breeds are not having enough problems because of \\"bad\\" owners.

As a Catholic, I highly recommend it to other Catholics. As a Christian, I highly recommend it to other Christians. And as a human being, I highly recommend it to all.Witness to Integrity is a story told with the heart and the mind. A factual account that reflects, as it unfolds, the exceptional, intelligent love and the intellectual, emotional and spiritual honesty, and the courage, not only of Dr. Caspary, but above all of the community of religious women she was chosen to represent and to lead through those trying times. A story that needed telling, Witness to Integrity will inspire all who read it to live and work to their higher ideals."},{"rating":"1","title":"A work of fiction, not fact.","review":"I compared to what I read in this work with the biographies of Cardinals McIntyre and Manning by Msgr. Francis Weber.It appears that Anita Caspary has attempted to write something that would absolve her and her accomplices of the guilt associated with killing the California arm of a once important Catholic order. Sadly it's fiction. And the practical proof is in the pudding as they say.While the Immaculate Heart Society (the lay, non-Catholic group) led by Caspary has dwindled significantly since their splitting from the Church, other female religious orders are now prospering strongly.I wish Ms. Caspary has the integrity and the resolve to issue an apology for all the pain and confusion she and he accomplices have caused."},{"rating":"1","title":"One sided and unrealible","review":"This book cannot be considered a reliable look at the history of the IHM within the Archdiocese of Los Angeles. This book is a truly one-sided argument that attempts to justify the past actions of many members of the IHM and their confrontations with the archbishop of Los Angeles.Most of these actions took place during the horribly polluted period following Vatican Council II. While the LETTER of Vatican II is of prime benefit to the Church, the \\"SPIRIT\\" of Vatican II is nothing more than a justifying slogan to place oneself ahead of God.This book is a product of this so-called \\"SPIRIT of Vatican II\\" A Spirit that is subcumbing to Catholic Christian orthodoxy after taking a horrible toll on the church for the past 30+ years.A."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fairytale of a novel","review":"This book is nothing but bitter fantasy.If you want the facts on how the IHM fell, check out Msgr.

Forty years later, as I read Witness to Integrity, I am struck in a much fuller way by this poignant story. I hung on to every word as I read how Anita Caspary led her sisters through this difficult time, and how they responded to this call to Integrity. Through her account, I clearly see that Anita Caspary's leadership was born of an inner obedience to God, her sisters, and the directives of Vatican II. In the face of heirarchical power gone awry, Anita's soul and spirit expanded in courage, strenght,compassion and eqanimity enabling her to be an example for us all as we seek to live our lives in Truth and Integrity."},{"rating":"1","title":"The real betrayal","review":"The real betrayal here is that a group of women abandonned their solemn commitments to follow the psycho-babble path to personal fulfilment.

These \\"Vino Vino\\" glasses are rather thick and poorly balanced and do not bring out the true qualities of the wine. They do not direct the correct flavors to the precise areas of the tongue. Breakage is not an issue as the responsibility for cleaning and sanitizing goes to our housekeepers. If they break a glass, they pay for it.I suppose these are acceptable for under $200 wines for beginners, but for us they simply will not do, as we do not touch any bottle of wine under $1000."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product, Amazing price","review":"Purchase was to replace earlier model Speigelau Red Wine glasses that had broken over the 15 years which we had used them.

I would recommend that the next book you read be The True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Hands On This Book: A Sure Must!","review":"Our seventh grade class read The True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle by Avi. Here are our thoughts on the book. The first few chapters seemed humdrum and interminable, but were very informative. As we progressed through the book, it took a grueling spin. The captain of the Seahawk, Captain Jaggery, at first seemed friendly towards Charlotte. Then Zachariah, a crew member, tells her the captain is malignant towards the crew and gives Charlotte a weapon to defend herself with from any harm in the future. You would never guess how cruel he truly was. He even accused Charlotte of committing a murder during a catastrophic storm that caused a lot of havoc. The True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle is abound with counterfeit accusations and suspense. It will keep you vigilant all through the night. It would be a misdemeanor not to read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"My class are reading this book and man I didn't lay my eye off this book!

She had to [board] the Seahawk alone without the 2 families that were suppose to ride with her. And so, the journey began and she met Zachariah, Mr.Keetch, and a very pleasent gentleman, Captain Jaggery. In her mind, the captain was the only person who had the same standard as her, a rich and well-mannered girl. The following scene would really interets me more.

I could just imagine Charlotte donning her sailor's garb and climbing the rigging! I love how she started out prim and proper, then she became Captain of the ship! I too am a Captain, and this story (although fiction) is a great role model for young girls today. I especially loved the ending where she leaves her stuffy life behind, arrives at the dock and the boat \\"sails with the morning tide\\".

It looked so boring and the plot sounded so [bad]. But after I read the 4th chapter I sank into her world. I understood her emotions. The middle was exciting how she took a HUGE turn in what she was doing and decided to become part of the crew. She battled hurricanes, and did exactly what all the other men did. But in the storm there was a murder and she was acussed of it becuase the man was murdered with a dirk she owned. From there on, it's a suspense i shall not spoil for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle, read it or not?","review":"I read the book The True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle.

I found the characterisations flat, the twists of the plot unbelivable, and the violence excessive and gratuitous. Worst of all, the book promotes a Marxist/radical-feminist agenda all the way to its surprise ending. The one positive thing I can say about it is that it gives a better description of how a sailing ship works than any other historical novel I know of.

I must say also that I enjoy older literature, and enjoy historical fiction. But, this story is very hard to believe, unrealistic, contrived. The characterization is shallow and forced. An (1830's) 13-year-old girl, who was educated in England, belonging to a wealthy American merchant family would never talk, act or think the way this lass does! A native African sailor would also not speak the way the Zachariah character does. The scenes at the end with the girls family make a normal, average seventeenth century family from New England seem positively wicked! The plot has a lot of tension and action, but is so far-fetched as to be laughable. Poor choice if you are looking for historical fiction.The True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugghh","review":"This book was boring.

I'm all for books about women shirking the rule of oppressive men and learning to be independent. But I felt the book shallow. Where is the source of reason and the rationality for a girl's search for independence? I didn't find it here because the antagonist is so unrealistically evil. I know this is fiction, and a children's book to boot, which explains why everything is so obviously black and white, but Captain Jaggery is so uninterestingly evil. He's more like a scratching post that you automatically have to hate. Good way to encourage directionless angst. Besides that though, I did find it suspenseful at times, so I give it a 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy, Happy, Happy","review":"This was the first time I have ever purchased a book online.

I'm not sure how old I was...somewhere between between 10 and 12 (I'm now 24). I probably got it at a Scholastic Book Fair or through a Scholastic order. This was one of the first true novels that I ever read.I'm sorry to say that I can't remember much about the book other than the main character, Charlotte, a wealthy young girl, becomes a working crew member on a ship. I think she disguises herself as a boy. I thought it was fascinating as she learned the workings of the ship and became a true sailor.

I read The True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle which is about a 13 year old girl in 1832 who is telling what happened while she was on a ship called the Seahawk to Providence, Rhode Island. While she is on the ship there are problems between the captain and the crew. There even was a storm that was a big problem that causes everything to go bad for charlotte.I liked this book because it's a well thought mystery. I love the part where Charlotte changed. And the ending was a big twist I don't think anyone saw it coming. So if you want a book to read this book would be a great choice because I sure did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story","review":"I loved this book because it drew you into the 19th century lifestyle at sea.Charlotte Doyle is put on a ship heading to America from England. She is a very prim and proper girl and doesn't enjoy the company of the dirty, rude crew. The story makes an interesting twist when Charlotte is accused of killing a crew member. From then on, it spirals into a gripping story of mystery and murder at sea.I would rate The True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle five stars, but I felt that it was a bit slow in the beginning and difficult to absorb. I also thought that the story rambled a little bit, and that a few parts could be cut shorter.All in all, I thought this book was a worthwhile read. Charlotte is a very clever character and she tells her tale well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good book","review":"This book was by far the best boot that I have ever read. In this story Charlotte went through alot of stress and did all she could to survive. This story is off the edge of your seat suspenseful. In this story she also had to be strong and try to hold in all her hurt and pain because she was the only girl on board. She was running out of clothes and her health wasn't all that good either. This story was so realistic it make you think about how your life would be if you lived in colonal times. This story was full of love ,compassion,hope and the confessions of a little girl with big dreams."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick Read, Big Adventure","review":"Avi seems to have done his research in this thriller-at-sea.

This book is a little bloody at times, but nevertheless, it will leave you hanging at the end of every chapter. It is about sailing, and ships, in the 1800's, but this book is for both boys and girls. The parts most girls will like, is the main character is female, and it has parts about her going to a girls school in England. The boys will love the excitement, and gore, but personally, I loved the violent parts too, and at sometimes, more.

The ledge is thick enough to hold thick books, and there are clips to hold sheets in place(or prevent pages from turning). Overall, this performs as well as much more expensive stands.

It is a tough read because of the poor punctuation and sentence structure. There is also a lot of unnecessary repetition.

Not very well researched it seems to throw everything into the pot without regards to veracity. Nothing is footnoted: not quotes, assertations or newspaper articles. So if you want to follow up on or verify something you read here, good luck because you are on your own. The structure of the book follows no logical flow either- just pick and choose from the table of contents and read whatever you want that day.

The fact that any of this is construed as what actually happened in the assassination of Kennedy is laughable. It's an good story when framed in the light that it is a creative work of fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gatekeeper","review":"Jim Marrs is a gatekeeper pure and simple. If you want to know the truth then watch Oliver Stone's, 'JFK'. The assassination WAS a Washington conspiracy. Oswald most certainly was a dupe and a patsy. I have read this book and it keeps you away from the true facts.As I said, a Gatekeeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book that was worse than the movie.","review":"I purchased this book as part of a graduate school course in history. Though centered on the JFK assassination, the course dealt with how historians are to use evidence to reach logical conclusions. Marrs' book is an example how not to infere evidence. Marrs often takes incredible leaps of fantasy to declare the presence of a conspiracy or manufactures out right lies to present his case. Marrs using various theories to attempt to disprove the Warren Commission findings that Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone assassin. But Marrs knowingly presents half-truths and omits critical parts of witness testimony and forensic evidence. \\"Crossfire\\" is one of many books that trumpet the presence of a conspiracy of government officials and mobsters to kill President Kennedy; like the others, Marrs' work is no better than a supermarket tabloid. If you must read this book, you should also read Posner's \\"Case Closed\\", a reasonable counter to Marrs' wild allegations."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good introduction to JFK assassination","review":"Jim Marrs presents a cogent synthesis of several conspiracy theories in \\"Crossfire.\\" It's an easy to read introduction to JFK's murder and he mostly avoids most of the less believable theories.

Not surprisingly, he concludes that the assassination of Kennedy was the result of a conspiracy, although he concedes that the plotters covered their tracks very well. The assumption is that the Federal government was in on it in some way, shape, or form, because of the obvious coverup taking place.

I highly recomend his book, 'Crossfire,' to anyone who would like a more complete picture of what happened to John F. Kennedy in Dallas Texas and why. We all know now the Warren Report, all 27 volumes, where less than the whole truth. So in my opinion; after 24 years of research, Mr. Marrs, while not filling all the gaps in the truth, at least relates a more complete picture of the whole truth than did the Warren Commission."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book.......","review":"I think Jim Marrs, though very long-winded, has written a very well thoughtout book.

Though this dvd has many different workouts and is helpful to beginners and intermmediate, it is lacking in some aspects. The instructor (with Shelly) gets confused and forgets to mention important tips to keep from hurting yourself accidentally. The dvd goes in and out of the work out, such as going blank or focusing on some boat or the house behind them, instead of focusing on the pilates move being shown. There is also a lack of stretching before most of the workouts, which is terrible if you don't want to hurt yourself. When first showing the pilates move, the camera pans in to the work out instructors' faces instead of panning out to show the full move."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money!!","review":"I wish I had done my homework. This DVD is awful!! I agree with the others. The worst part is I couldn't get my money back because I had broke the seal! In CA, we are not allowed to return DVDs that have a broken seal. Maybe I can use it as a door stop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I bought this dvd from Target since it was the only Pilates dvd they had and I've wanted to try Pilates. I thought that if it was run like any other basic workout dvd then I could deal with it. First of all the dvd starts out showing monkeys because they are in Barbados so of course the viewer wants to see the monkeys. The cameraman showed the monkeys so long that the women started their workout already with no instruction so once he did switch the view to them you had to catch up. There were several awkward cuts where the viewer could not see the moves exactly and the instruction was pretty poor overall. (I'm used to the Jillian Michaels dvds where she is always on point and always helping as well as motivating her viewers.) This dvd fell completely short of what I expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for Most Particpants","review":"I have followed both Jenn and Shelly for years on FitTV and they are excellent hosts. Their workouts are challenging but not over the top. Perfect for me as a regular fitness participant. The Barbados locations are a beautiful escape and change to the normal studio setups and the production values far exceed most programs of this kind too. These videos are a most peaceful way to start my day but with the benefits of a good workout. I recommend them to all but those wishing to jolt their body's to life with a high intensity workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too low budge","review":"The lowest quality workout DVD I have ever seen. Instructors get flustered, mix words, and occasionally will do a move on one side but forget to do the other. While I'm sure all the women in these videos are very nice people, they do not provide a good workout. In purchasing pilates dvd's, I wanted to work my core, specifically, my abs. My legs would be kind of sore, but never my abs. Video quality is super low, and poor camera work. Videos are edited to cut to close ups of instructors faces, abs, etc. when they should be focusing on how to do the moves. Videos will begin in the middle of the instructors doing moves; forget about getting yourself ready! Scenes will end, the camera will pan away to some \\"beauty\\" shot, and the instructors will be switching moves. Absolutely horrible. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had trouble giving even one star!","review":"TERRIBLE!I would most likely be repeating other reviews here, they are wonderfully written with great detail and thought. This is the worst work out dvd I've ever seen!!!

At first I thought it was me, but I've done it several times now. Also, I am brand new to Pilates and have no idea where to start with these dvd's to build myself up without causing injury, and no where in this set are there any how to instructions.I have used other excercise dvd's and had no problem following along a great instructor.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY LIKE I DID!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Happy with DVD","review":"This DVD is lacking many things. In most of the workouts, Shelly isn't the instructor, her partner is. The camera keeps panning in and out of the workout so you can't see everything they are doing. There is more stretching than an actual workout. Shelly seems confused on some of the workouts and she tends to digress in many of the scenes. I was not happy with this DVD at all. All of the pictures on the DVD for each CD don't even apply to the type of workout you are doing. I wouldn't recommend this DVD to anyone. You are not getting what you see at all. If I could return this DVD from Target, I would, but unfortunately I don't think there are any stores that will take back a DVD if it's been open already. Do not by this DVD.

Otherwise, there is no flow between segments, making it difficult to follow. Often, the segments begin with the camera focusing on the background and not the instructors, and when the camera finally pans in on the instructors, they are in the middle of the move and offer no guidance on how to achieve their form. The workouts are punctuated by distracted comments from the instructors (\\"is it raining?\\"). My advise: do not waste your money or your time. I have done my share of Pilates and this is a complete disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"This pilates workout is perfect...","review":"1) If you're psychic and can follow the absurd edits that jump from move to move with no warning.2) If you can see through time and space to overcome the camera being cropped on the instructors faces when you really need to see what their legs are doing.3) If you have $17 you desperately need to get rid of on something that you under no circumstances are allowed to enjoy.In all fairness, I liked the instructors.

Now that I am approaching fifty, I have come to realize they were far, far better than I gave them credit for. Not only do they seriously rock, but their lyrics reflect a depth of thought and insight that is rare for a band in any genre.I'd recommend Civil Rights as a must buy from this very underrated and unappreciated band.

Those songs have been replaced with the songs of Robert Johnson, Son House, Woody Guthrie, Willie Dixon and Memphis Minnie. Approximately 14 different musicians collaborate on the various tunes bringing with them everything from National guitars to washboard and Kazoo to put an authentic traditional feel to the songs. This is a traditional folk/blues oriented CD plain and simple. The CD contains 12 covers with two of the songs, \\"Diamond Joe\\" and \\"To Washington\\" containing traditional arrangement but with new lyrics. This is not the best John Mellencamp you will ever hear but, for what it is, it is well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon PowerShot SD1000","review":"Great camera! I have an SD600 Canon that takes very clear pictures and is very easy to use and wanted to get my daughter the same one. However, it is no longer available and I believe the SD1000 is the newer version. I purchased this camera as a gift to my daughter, who never takes pictures and never wanted a camera, but a wedding and a trip to Rome seemed to warrant this purchase. She has said it takes wonderful pictures and is thrilled to have it! To pay further tribute to the SD1000, the professional wedding photographer asked for a copy of one of my daughter's pictures! The 2GB accessory kit was a must! It allowed her to shoot an almost endless amount of pictures.

And the you have to download a 'PRO' version of the software hidden on their website in order to back-up your entire computer system. Be careful of folders within folders. Selecting individual files is very cumbersome and doesn't always capture the folders within folders. And, if you need to back-up another computer across a network -- this won't do it.

I'm not disappointed however and this is something you have to concentrate on reading. The wit and humor is there and probably the story I like best is Shillaber's 'Partingtonian Patchwork' with its interesting and witty Spoonerisms (if thats the correct phrase) there is also poetry if that is your fancy. I did enjoy reading it and I think its one of those books that will need a second reading before it sinks in. The book is fine, its just me that needs re-tuning.

Both the front and back covers are textured (but the back is all black). It's also held shut by a thin magnetic strap. The pages are lined.

This book shows the utopian side of the Philippines, but didnt really get into the details that while this is tropicana in its finest, the country is dangerous to visit as of late, and the lack of political history in the book is a bit dissapointing. I also have gotten weary of pictures showing Filipinos in their religious festivities garb, and the famous self-flogging during All Souls Day (seriously, Filipinos in middle of nowhere only do practice this) which I have seen on television, and was miffed to see this RARE scene in the book.

As a parent trying to see through my kids eyes I did the first thing a kid at this age reading level would do. I looked at the pictures first. We have a boy playing in the dirt NAKED burying his little brother up to his chin, a little boy lying on his back NAKED with his private part covered by an exclamation point from the text, and a little girl holding the front of her dress up for the 5 year old reader to view her girly little underpants.

It will go straight in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not crazy about it","review":"I was so excited when I found out that Jamie Lee was coming out with a new book, but I have to say that I'm a little disappointed. We have all the other books and I LOVE them! However, I felt this one was not as well written as the others. Not that the idea wasn't good. It's a great topic and I do like several phrases in the book, but it just doesn't flow very well. There are some sentences that just don't sound quite right and they don't read well.

It pegged them perfectly! The important thing is that this book helps the child see that ALL five year olds feel similar to how they are feeling, and experience the same struggles. Yet, it teaches this in such a FUN way! The pictures are great...I would especially suggest this book for one-on-one reading, because of the detail on the pages, but it worked very well for my circle time as well.

This is not a book about the men who make important decisions but about the trickle down effect those decisions have on other men. Schroder's story allows the reader to see what doors are opened by the arrogance of those in power.

We purchased ours last night and it is the first game I bought for the GBA. I was very disappointed because of two things: visibility of game screen and lack of save. The visibility is horrible. You have to be in just the right light to be able to see and then usually by that time you are either at a weird angle or fighting a glare off the screen. The screen and graphics are so dark that it is very hard to see them. I tried playing for about a half hour or so and had a head ache from straining. The game save is an obvious one, it is a very large game and unless you sit for long periods of time to play you will never beat it.

(FAAN is a wonderful resource, everyone dealing with food allergies should join.)Unfortunately, I think that this cookbook leaves a lot to be desired. We found ourselves disappointed by many of the recipes we tried in here; particularly, the wheat-free recipes often came out with very poor texture.For baked goods and especially desserts, I'd recommend Cindy Moseley's \\"Great Foods Without Worry\\" over this one. We also routinely use some of the recipes from the \\"Gluten Free Gourmet\\". This might be a good third or fourth book if you're looking for more ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for corn allergics","review":"This book has many good recipes, but it does not include any info about corn allergy. And, many of the recipes contain ingredients that are sources of hidden corn. This would not be a good cookbook for anyone that has been recently diagnosed with corn allergy. But recipes can be adapted to be corn-free, by people who know how to do it. Some recipes call for ingredients that contain sulfites. So people who are sulfite sensitive should use caution, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks variety","review":"I was looking for a real cookbook with a VARIETY of ideas including NEW meal ideas. The back of the book states \\"A full range of menu ideas . . .\\" Not true. Of the 300 recipes in the book, about 250 are for cookies, cakes, pies, sweet breads, muffins and other dessert type items. There are only 50 recipes in the \\"Main Meals\\" chapter and it looks like they were stretching to fill the chapter. About 10 of the recipes in \\"Main Meals\\" are made of potatoes such as \\"Potato Fans\\": slice a potato, sprinkle with salt and bake. Wow. I can barely contain myself. Four of the recipes were for more breads like corn bread and then the all-to-creative Chicken & Rice and Pizza --which is what I'm trying to get away from. I wanted was some NEW creative ideas for meals or side dishes. I will keep looking for a better book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cookbook even for people without foode allergies!","review":"This cookbook has very imaginative, easy recipes that are better tasting than what you find in many standard cookbooks. While I agree with the reader who calls it a \\"dessert cookbook\\", preparing main courses for someone with food allergies is much easier, ie I don't cook fish dishes because my daughter has a fish allergy.

Did the United States military secretly experiment with mind-altering EM pulses emitted from a radar installation on Montauk Point? It's possible (Dr. Michael A. Percinger of Laurentian University has proved the concept in a lab environment)...but time tunnels, psychically created monsters, spontaneously materializing buildings?Please.Books like this give legitimate UFO, psychic, and conspiracy researchers a bad name. Save your money and look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Factual errors contained in this book","review":"This book is a complete fantasy. Without wasting any more time writing a review, I'd like to point of one huge error of fact contained in this book. In Chapter 10, pg. 65, the author claims that \\"In the 1950's, ITT developed sensor technology that could literally display what a person was thinking.\\" Later on this same page and on page 67, he claims that a Cray 1 computer was used \\"...interfaced with an IBM 360...\\". The problem here was that the IBM 360 was introduced in 1964 and the Cray 1 was not introduced until 1976, so having this \\"developed technology\\" in the 1950s as described was impossible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Science-Fiction","review":"The author has a very good fantasy.

What I have read sounds like interesting SCIENCE-FICTION, not a trustful report of the reality.No person can consciously live without his higher cortex. And white noise is definitely not \\"being 50% of everything\\" as mentioned, but a combination of all frequencies at the same time. The book contains numerous impressing statements about well known scientist and the author gives the impression to be an expert on various disciplines. In the book is an order form for other books and a subscription for a magazine \\"The Montauk Pulse TM\\". All very well organised and highly commercial. But is it true ?

I went out to a Barnes and Noble one night and luckily, they had one copy left in the whole store, so I bought it. I was going to read it at home, but I decided to sit down and read the first few pages in the store. It was about 8:00 P.M. when I started reading. All of a sudden, they were announcing that the store would be closing in 15 minutes. I looked at my watch and it was 11:45 P.M. I got so into the book, that I couldn't put it down. It was the most amazing book I had ever read, to date. I paid for it and I raced home as fast as I could, so I could finish reading it.

I read up until the point when the author started taking about the \\"hairy monster-beast,\\" and that was it for me. Psycho-babble rubbish if you ask me. Sounds like the author had a bad dream (or perhaps a bad acid trip), and decided to write a book a la a repressed memory tome.

The author starts on an interesting path but then totally discredits himself by making wildish and unsupported claims about alien involvement. The author claims to have been part of the project years ago, but then mentions at the end of the book that he's just writing this to get others to come forward with the truth. If he was part of this project then HE should be the one to tell the story. I have some knowledge of electronics and the descriptions in this book are nothing more than a collection of terms thrown together.

I have always liked the whole Montauk Project story and its ties to so many other theories.This book serves as a good intro to the whole Montauk legend. It is not referenced in the slightest so the reader must take everything at face value and a really should do with more than a grain of salt.The story itself is facinating. Time travel, ties to WWII, future gold horses and the age old favorite of nazis (these guys are always great villians).This book is actually the first in a series but the following books by Nichols and his co-author are all enjoyable but somehow lack the page turning fun this volume presents.My deepest regret was that there is no way to source any of this info and/or learn more about what they touch upon.

I liked this book very much. Especially chapter fourteen - Mission to Mars. In this chapter they talk about opening a time vortex to gain entrance into the D&M Pyramid on the planet mars in the Cydonia reagon. If you like this kind of stuff I recomend this book.

Now, I'm game for a good conspiracy theory as much as anyone, but this book is downright preposterous. Nothing can be proven (outside the fact that there is indeed a military base in Montauk). Very little in the book even makes any sense - and the fact that the authors are tragically inept writers that can barely construct a sentence doesn't help matters. Content aside, I have NEVER read a book outside of children's literature that was so poorly and elementally written.After finishing, I had to find out what kind of company would actually publish something like this... and, lo and behold, sky books turns out to be owned by the author.How they manage to keep releasing MORE books is beyond me. My recommendation: avoid this at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Fiction","review":"The book supposed to be non-fiction. I suspected there would be some wrong interpretations - but this book goes beyond interpreting facts in light of conspiracy theory. It's down-right lying rubbish. After the first few chapters, I was treating it as a work of fiction and reading it for entertainment, but as the story progressed it became too hard to pretend it was real (like you do when you read fiction), it was just too ridiculous and was full of technical errors. Not recommended to be read as fiction - particularly if you have an engineering background - because it will insult intelligence continually. Go read Harry Potter - it's more believable. Certainly not recommended to be read as non-fiction!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad science fiction and bad attempt at non-fiction","review":"I was given this book to read on a vacation. Reading quickly I was able to find circular illogic, assertions that were just factually an impossibility(color x-rays), completely dubious facts and found the technical aspect of the book to be pure rubish with convoluted machinations on the actual events and methods to produce the. However, the author was able to wax on about the technical aspects of the machines used by the conspiritors to no end, all while conveying no real information. This is a poor representation of the classic conspiracy book - make wild and waving gestures with one hand to the wide eyed audience while picking their pocket with the other. In short, this book is filled with infotainment, unfortunately to little info and to little entertainment.

Still, they give you a very good taste of what made him popular, and the recordings are outstanding. Most of the big hits are there, but if you're a fan of his later work, you'll be disappointed. That's why I'm not giving it 5 stars. \\"Garden Party\\" and \\"She Belongs to Me\\" are the only Stone Canyon Band era songs on this collection. Nonetheless, it's a good introduction if you want to become familar with an artist whose reputation is growing more and more each year after his untimely death.

My feet get cold easily and I've been trying to find some good warm socks. So when I see a sock called \\"40 Below\\" I assume they are going to be warm. Here's what's wrong with them:1. The part of the sock that covers your foot is actually not that thick. This is the part that needs to be thick! The leg portion is very thick, but that's why I have thermals and pants. I need coverage for my foot! Needless to say, my feet still get cold when wearing these. I'd rather not need to buy thermal lined boots to keep my feet warm in the winter. I had hoped these socks would do the trick.2. They stretch out immediately and from day one they have been too loose. I have size 12 feet. They are normal sized feet. The socks were supposed to be good for size 9-12 (The large). I find they get bunched up because of the extra material floating around in my shoe and they fall down my calf."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW warm","review":"These are best socks i have had.

I am a physician, have always been extremely interested in nutrition and a vegetarian eater for 15 years, who became a vegan eater 3 years ago. I am in excellent health and a huge advocate of the life style. This documentary is superb: factual, informative, without drama or political innuendo. It provides the facts on all fronts: personal health, societal impact and global effects of an animal based diet vs a plant based diet. Of great value are also the bibliographic resources at the end of the program.Bravo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Knowledge helps make smart choices","review":"It is nice to have someone like Mike Anderson make a CD to help us make wise choices. This CD called \\"Eating\\" is very informative. I had a back injury two years ago and gained alot of weight from not being able to function the same. After a year, I realized, I had to lose my weight from watching what I ate. I lost 15 lbs. quickly, just from removing beef and pork from my diet. And from watching this CD, I\`m glad I did. I was eating chicken and fish, but now I\`ve gone vegan. I have lost 43 lbs total. I feel great, have energy, no more constipation. The \\"Eating\\" CD has helped me make wise choices on what I eat. To know how the animals are raised and treated, and sent to our grocery stores to be eaten, really sickens me. Thank you Mike Anderson for opening my eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Information We ALL Should Have","review":"This video approaches what is wrong with our animal-based diet from all aspects: health, environmental, and political. The information is comprehensive and compelling. The production values, however, were not top-notch. A more dynamic narrator would make the film more interesting to listen to. In addition the film often was obviously cut multiple times, often in the middle of interviews. Smoother transitions would have made the film more professional appearing. That being said, this is information every American should have. We've all been duped from early childhood, and we continue to dupe our children and lead them down an unsustainable path."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"This dvd is a real eye opener. It will definitely change your opinions on eating styles and habits. It also has some political overtones that will make you think differently as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"This will change your life","review":"If you don't change the way you eat after watching this DVD then it is doubtful you anything will ever have much influence on your behavior. The data presented is so compelling and simple that you already know what they are going to say....but are too hardheaded to do anything about what's wrong with the way you eat. You will have to get past the \\"friends of animals\\" crap towards the end, but if you can do that and think about the message and about the way we eat in the 21st century then you, like me, will change the way you eat. And probably live a heathier life. Good Luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"An very interesting viewing","review":"I highly recommend viewing of this DVD. It is a real insight into our daily diet that most of us know about, talk about and read about, but very few of us really understand the in's and out of.

Definitely purchase this film and pass the message on to your friends and family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Message For Good Health","review":"I've watched this DVD several times and its message is presented clearly and effectively.

It is repetative and put me to sleep. Many of the claims, although i believe to be true, are not backed up in enough depth for the new person. It makes a vegan or vegetarian diet look like something that will cure what ails you.. no more than a snake oil salesman. It just goes too far and is poorly made.To top it off i even agree that vegan or vegetarian is the way to go. You can look at other of my reviews. I don't think i have ever given something so low as a review as i have this. Don't bother buying it. It is not at all what I expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I expected to have a focus more on the positive, what to eat, and did not expect not a long drawn out video of sickening photos of animals and dying and use of water and natural resourced to feed the animals that in turn hurt humans when they eat them. Had I known what this was I would NOT have bought it and regret that I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"This film has transformed so many friends!","review":"As a long time vegan who feels marvelous, I have found this film to be more eloquent than I am in transforming friends. I show it for everyone who visits, with excellent results.My favorite was a 19-year old who lives in a rooming house in Brooklyn with several moms of small children. She insisted I sell her my copy so she wouldn't have to wait for it! And then she held a seminar in the house to teach the mothers how to feed their children well!It deserves more than 5 stars because it is a real public service. And unlike others who've made good films on the health benefits of the vegan diet, Mike Anderson charges a very reasonable price.Being raw vegan, I'd suggest that makes the vegan diet even better. I've been doing this for 35 years and feel great. And perhaps the biggest plus is that your mind shifts into a peaceful place."},{"rating":"1","title":"it took three sittings to listen to it - that bad","review":"Let me put it like this. I collect EVERYTHING by guitarist Al Pitrelli - I might just be the only Pitrelli collector. I've certainly not many anyone with my collection. A track he co-wrote with Joe Lynn Turner is on this compilation so I had to get it. Now, I do listen to everything. This hour long album took me three sittings to get through. It wasn't that I didn't have the time. My brain and ears were melting from anguish. Ballads are great, but too many overstuffed, overemotive ballads is not great. These musicians might have made you good but in this context that greatness is totally weakened. Let alone, these aren't necessarily their best work.

I would be ashamed if I were selling these to unsuspecting customers--apparently they are not. SP should be the industry standard.

Looking at her life is a wonderful way to examine this pivotal period in English history as she was a pivotal person, herself, during this period. Sometimes she was a pawn in the plans of others but often she created her own destiny, while all the time remaining a creature of politics and a survivor at a time when very many did not. The authors have done their research well and provide a very detailed account. Often the financial details can be very revealing and occasionally monotonous to the casual historian but always important.

The text of the forward, while mildly informative, has random unnecessary page-breaks as well, more noticable on larger viewing areas.After each poem/rhyme there's a page that's blank except for the page number. I expect there's supposed to be an illustration on the blank pages, but that didn't end up on the kindle, and instead it just takes longer to get around in the book.The page numbers (as you can probably guess) are left in the text, and there's no table of contents or illustrations.There's plenty of other Mother Goose books for free on the kindle, and I'd suggest you go find one of those rather than wasting time with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!","review":"This edition is a cheap photocopy of the text only of the \\"Original Volland Edition\\" and does not contain any illustrations!

Nevins has crafted an incredible weapon of Biblical truth. It is a powerful refutation to the silly, and sometimes outrageous misrepresentations hurled at the Catholic faith. This book asks and answers questions most Protestants never bother to contemplate... Who decided on the 26 books of the New Testament? And when? What did the Church do before the Bible was assembled?

For starters, Father Nevins starts with a concept of Fundamentalism which would leave most self-described Protestant Fundamentalists scratching their heads! Nevins proceeds to \\"answer\\" a number of Protestant arguments, some of which would never be posed by any serious Fundamentalist or Evangelical apologist. Nevins also commits a variety of informal logical fallacies. (At one point, he even appeals to 20th century usage of an English word to determine 1st century usage of a Greek word!) In the interest of fairness, we should point out that we are not at all sympathetic to Nevins' cause, but we believe that the works of Catholic apologist Karl Keating are far more useful for both Catholics and Fundamentalists. With no animosity for the author himself, we do not believe Nevins' book was worth the brief time required to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Hope He Makes Me- Quaker","review":"You are encouraged to seek out Quaker- those are the English fundamentalsts as in Quaker Oats. I had and knew too teachers who were Quaker. He covers: the Bible, tradition, sacraments, purgatory, Mary, the Inquisition, papacy and infallibility. I thought it was witty and well written, which the Quakers were known for not really being successful, but witty. I was baptized and confirmed in the Lutheran denomination after I accepted Jesus as my savior, the Bible as God's word to his people, the creation theory in Genesis and the American fundamentalists who still own the Consitution. To compare this Quaker argument to my own denomination and beliefs, it is similar to what is laid down in Luther's catechism. They both are fundamentalists who worship God, and are saying in these books that most of yesterday's supposed \\"Christians\\" are missing the whole point; when you convert to a religion the goal is to get the person so that they're not such a geek."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Catholics only","review":"This book is not at all what I expected!

The only bad thing about this bag is that it's a bit huge. I was expecting a little bit smaller when saw the pic on amazon.

And the one and only reason I went for this particular pair of nippers and didn't buy a pair at the local Lowe's (because they peddle a lot of this Chinese crap also) is because the words \\"Made in USA\\" was right there in plain English in this product's description. I honestly can't go as far as to say that I was a victim of the ol' bait-n-switch because what I got was a pair of nippers whose item number and bar code both matched the numbers 32015.

This shorter version killed the appeal of the whole CD for me. I hoped someday they would re-release \\"Rio\\" as \\"the original vinyl version.\\" I thought that day came this past July 3rd, 2001. I was let down again. The same short version of \\"Hungry Like the Wolf\\", but now remastered. Sad! Would anyone like to take this lame CD off my hands AGAIN? Never mind, I'll go trade it for something else somewhere. The closest we're going to get to the original vinyl version of \\"Hungry Like the Wolf\\" is on the \\"Night Versions\\" collection. Not exactly the same, but close. Since Capitol created this confusion back then, why didn't they just feature the alternate tracks as \\"bonus tracks\\" to make everyone happy?"},{"rating":"1","title":"not the original recordings","review":"I have the original \\"Rio\\" on vinyl from '82 and it is a tremendous pop-rock album. Unfortunately, someone decided to butcher these songs when they put them on cd. Why did they shorten the songs? It's like audio cliff notes. Am i the only person who notices this? Who even cares? I've bought two different versions of this recording on cd and both feature shortened\\\\edited songs. Someone lied; this is not the original recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Duran Duran at it's best","review":"This CD is pop music masterpiece. I've been a fan since the early 80s and Duran have put out a lot of music since then. However, RIO still reigns as my all-time favorite. There isn't one bad song on this album-- don't skip over any of the unfamiliar tracks or you WILL miss out! Don't delay- buy it NOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic album. Nice to have it finally remastered!","review":"Now, when will they release a DVD of their early videos? Especially \\"The Chauffeur\\"? Regardless, this is a fine album. I had not listened to it for a long time, because I only had it on vinyl and my has been in storage for a long time (not by choice).Also, ignore the pointless bad rating because the reviewer could not figure out how to install Quicktime software on his Windows system. Giving this ALBUM a bad rating because of his technical ineptitude is wrong. Do not hesitate to get this, especially if you are a fan. Nice job."},{"rating":"1","title":"The remastering is awful","review":"Don't buy this remastered version because it will make you sick!I have the original USA 82 release on CD. Yes, it's a 16bit recording, but it sounds 400x better than this remastered version.The remastered offering is over filtered on the high band, so it sounds like AM radio \\"low to mid-range sound\\".The sound engineer really dropped the ball on this CD.I recommend buying the \\"unmastered\\" version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Video Glitch for Win2000 & WinMe","review":"If you are running Win2000 or WinMe and you do not have QuickTime installed on your computer, DO NOT follow the link provided on the enhanced portion of this CD. If you do, you will be downloading an older version of QuickTime that is compatible only through Win98. The result could be severe audio breakup. Instead, go to Apple's site and download the current version of QuickTime [v.5.0.2] which is compatible with Win2000 & WinMe and follow the installation instructions. Then get ready to be disappointed with the notecard-sized videos. As for the CD audio...mastered much too bright. As for the failure to use the ALBUM MASTER to cut the CD...shame on EMI/Capitol. Very amateurish. This disc is a great disappointment.

The vinyl version released in North America when this came out had remixed versions of Rio, Lonely in your Nightmare, Save a Prayer, Hold Back the Rain, Hungry Like the Wolf, and My Own Way. If you listen to the vinyl version and this cd, you can tell, some of the differences are pretty obvious, others are more subtle. My understanding is the band themselves preferred the remixed versions to the originals that this CD has.Unfortunately, Capitol didn't give us the remixed versions, so those of us who grew up in the 80's loving the vinyl/cassette versions of Rio will have to settle for our vinyl copies until Capitol records gets off their butts and issues them remastered...something that they should have done in the first place!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of early Duran.","review":"That's right. Almost every song on this disc is worth a listen, even those overkilled on radio and MTV (\\"Hungry Like the Wolf,\\" \\"Rio\\"). This original version of \\"Save a Prayer\\" is a quite lovely ballad (I mean it!) and is much more worthy than its Arena album (dreadful) live version. \\"Lonely in Your Nightmare\\" is a moving semi-ballad; \\"New Religion\\" changes its focus from atmospheric to total butt-kicking jam; and \\"The Chauffeur\\" is wonderfully eclectic. If you only ever buy one Duran LP, this is the one to get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rio! A Little Slice of Paradise!","review":"Rio is one of the greatest recordings ever relrased! Each song a magical masterpiece. When I first heard Hungry Like The Wolf, I got chills all over! What a wonderfully orchestrated piece of music.

Vivian McAlexander"},{"rating":"1","title":"Indeed, this record is not what you think it is","review":"Other reviewers have correctly pointed out that this CD was made from the original UK release, not the version remixed by David Kershenbaum that was released later in the US, and that most US listeners consider to be the \\"official\\" release.Even casual listeners will notice the differences. I know that some folks will always say that the original versions are better by virtue of being first, but in this case, I think the record company got it right --- the US mixes are considerably more punchy and poppy. The UK mixes are comparatively dull-edged.Unfortunately, the only way to hear the US mix of Rio is to get a vinyl copy (they are widely available wherever used vinyl is sold)This seems like such a comical oversight in an era where every remix, alternate version etc is available on CD somewhere. Some lawyer must have screwed up in 1982 and nobody has the rights to the US version. Or something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who's living in the 80s?","review":"Rush - Live In Rio? Now, who's the one stuck in the 80s - or 70s for that matter. I don't think anyone would but this CD if they weren't a fan of 80s music. If so, this is a must have. Not only are the hits (Rio, Hungry Like The Wolf & Save a Prayer) solid, but there really isn't a weak song on here. My other favorites are The Chauffeur and Hold Back the Rain.Anyway, I'm a Rush fan, but I consider them to be more dated than Duran Duran. The day is coming soon when someone will remake a Duran Duran song and it will be a hit just like No Doubt with It's My Life from Talk Talk, and other similar remake hits as of late."},{"rating":"2","title":"An honest refiew,not in French or by a prude.","review":"I'm a Christian husband that has been married for 24 years.

My husband said it made my hair feel like straw, he loved the smell of the product but it is extremely drying, by the time I had finished combing my hair my hair was one big frizz ball with broken snapped ends. Two hours later I actually got my hairbrush stuck in my hair which has never happened before, it was like I had put stuff on my hair to tangle it instead of untangle.

We have to use it daily, so I am glad to see a good price on Amazon and availability so that I can order it frequently.My youngest two children have fine soft hair with big curls. This product leaves their hair detangled, deodorized, and shiny.All of us and everyone that is around us regularly love the smell of this product, but we don't like the pump and bottle. A higher quality pump would make it easier to apply and would prevent us from inhaling the product.

I really like the Black Vanilla conditioner. It moisturizes my hair, but doesn't weigh it down. I also like the smell of it (unlike Khoret Amen leave-in conditioner), which is important to me.

The liquid in mine stays liquid, no matter how long it is kept in the freezer. It didn't come with any explanation as to how it works or if the liquid is to become fairly solid when frozen.

She has many books and articles on the disease and \\"Shaking up Parkinson Disease\\" is one of the best because the author has clearly identified those critical symptoms that make the disease what it is.Those who have Parkinson's will find confirmation of and detailed descriptions of those symptoms one tends to question about the disease.Highly recommended for new and old Parkinson's suffers and their caregivers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Content","review":"I found this book to be pretty much a rerun of previous editions. The primary reason I bought this \\"Linux 7.1 Bible\\" is that by the name I thought it would cover this Linux release including all new additions. The main thing I was looking for was a good explantion of iptables and how to correctly use them since this is supposed to replace ipchains and be much more powerful. What I found was the author mentions that iptables is the newest firewall configuration tool and is to replace ipchains and here's the website for the How To (which I had already visited) and in this book we'll explain once again how to setup ipchains (which he just said was being replaced).

Aside from a couple of good essays in it, this is one of the worst books I have ever read. In the name of protecting Christianity from frauds, Horton goes way beyond that to subtly undermine any trust in the Bible at all. He shreds miracle and despises the Scientific Creationists. When he is done you wouldn't dare trust ANYTHING about Christianity! Read this book only if you like pious-sounding frauds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinks","review":"Most of the contributors to this book should spend more time in earnest research instead they seem to only take excerpts from different writings of the men they are judging or grading. These contributors take a few words from the material and then twist it or mold it into something totally different from what was actually said. They only publish the negative and don't look at the positive. Kinda like giving a child a sucker stick without the candy. It is a shame when so called religious leaders stop leading and begin to slander others. Seems they are going against the teachings of Christ who they profess to be their leader.In summary if you are not getting enough negative material this book is for you, however; you may want to find something more uplifting to read.This book actually dosn't deserve the one star, but that is the lowest rating given for this review. Oh, what the heck I rate it a Zero."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beware, Church","review":"Michael Horton and others carefully documents some of the modern heresies in the church, and it is highly recommended for those who are unaware of the stuff which spews itself off as theology.

Original quotes and sources from the Charismatic leaders themselves demonstrate common denials of basic Christian doctrines, such as the deity of Christ. Horton also offers a compassionate but accurate critique and corrective to these destructive false teachers in the Church.

I think that's the message of this book, along with some politically important points. [Like that it is neither fair nor wise to add unpleasant or dangerous land uses to neighborhoods that are already struggling to stay healthy.] I think you'll find it worth your time. I read it from cover to cover, though I thought I'd only browse."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Disappointing Ending","review":"I had such high expectations for this third book after reading the first two, that I felt as though I was let down, just grasping for more...The first gripe that I have for this book is that the hero and the heroine do not meet each other until past page 60. Until then, the book is filled with excess hype, and the reader is left to wonder, \\"When are they finally going to meet? Get on with the Love Story!\\"Secondly, there is no passion, no umph to their romance, like in the first two books.And Thirdly, the last 50 pages of this book is just awful! It's predictable, especially the courtroom scene, and it just drags on and on.

The matter involves Kerry (our heroine). Coincidentally the two meet without realizing who the other is and of course proceed to fall in love.This story had potential, but falls short. I found our heroine Kerry to be completely lackluster, especially towards the end. She is portrayed as a responsible person all through the beginning and then after one incident (I won't go into detail because I don't want to spoil it for anyone who does read the book) she just pretty much walks away from everything, including herself. Very odd. I wasn't particularly fond of Arthur either - I found him to be a bit heavy handed.All in all the book was filled with coincidences and cliches.

It does have very good graphics.It was my first GameBoy Advance i got and was I was amazed by the graphics. When i started the game i figured out how hard it was. It very challenging (You just have to practice ive only had this for two days) ,but in a way that is good because it lasts for a long time. It has 7 stages and a boss after every stage. Every time you beat a boss it gives you a password so you dont have to level 1 after you already beat it. The down side is however much life you had after you beat the boss is how much you have after you put in the password. So you have to do the whole game with only 5 lives (plus about three you get from killing guys) It is a great game but a little too challenging for me because im HORRIBLE at video games but i still like them. If you very bad at video games i suggest you buy a game like MarioKart Advance when it comes out. I think this game is worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great graphics do not make a good game","review":"The first time I laid eyes on Iridion for the GBA, my mouth watered when I saw the gorgous graphics and surprisingly realistic explosions. When I played it though, the experience became quite a different one. There are a lot of times when your ship blocks your view of what your shooting, and even when you can see what your shooting at you can't judge the distance, and with so much on screen action at once you will suffer a lot of cheap deaths. The control is awkward as well, and there are times when the game is just plain unforgiving.

And yes, it does have good graphics, however, no matter how good they are (and I've seen much better), it doesn't make up for the high price, terrible play control, and ultra-simplistic gameplay (even though they added in two extra buttons for the GBA, the only button you use the entire game is the A button). The game is also only one-player, which all in all, leaves it a game for sheer boredom.

The final one, no less prosaic than the other multi-part riffs, \\"Yellow Kitchen Gloves,\\" jottings on a demonstration in Washington, D.

It just is not a captivating performance, and it is far too untraditional for my taste. Surely a much better version of this opera will come along on DVD.

It is disturbing to say the least and it does nothing to enhance our understanding of Mozart or this opera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying - Bad Singing","review":"To see all the characters played by TWO people is truly annoying. For example, there are always two constanzes on stage, two blonchens, and two everyone...The singing is average, the stage is modern...it does not reflect traditional mozart style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elegant","review":"Made of high quality materials, looks & feels beautiful, a wonderful addition to our historic home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Light duty constructtion","review":"For the price of this feeder I was expecting at least medium duty construction. This feeder is not very sturdy at all. The bottom is not braced or reinforced which is the main problem. If that was done, the light duty construction for the rest would be okay. I have this feeder in with goats and my guardian dog, and feel it's not going to hold up that well. The feeder arrived with a bent bottom, and the seller was very fair in issuing me a partial refund, but the design needs to be tweeked for the bottom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring DVD!","review":"We have the spiral-bound workbook, and my son actually loves the stories, and they have helped him remember multiplication facts. I thought the DVD would help to reinforce the stories by animating them, but no. It's just a voice reading (verrry slowwwly) the tales from the workbook as the drawings appear on the screen. The slowwww voice is maddening to both of us! Then come the quizzes. A DVD of quizzes, whee. I wish I hadn't spend the extra money on the DVD. The workbook alone is plenty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart Matters","review":"This is a fun story that would be great for kids.
