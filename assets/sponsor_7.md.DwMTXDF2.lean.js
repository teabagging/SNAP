They should just give you one or two plastic swabs and more of the cloth tips pre-cut. Giving you several plastic wands with the fabric on them is stupid.

They do work but they need to re-think their marketing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes the problem worse","review":"The problem is streaking. The swabs leave streaks of residue on my sensor (a Nikon D3), which is in my opinion worse than the spots that are removed. It's not difficult to fix spotting on images, but the streaks are a larger problem. The streaks are not always evident, but they are very noticeable in images having light sky, and if you do any HDR work the problem is magnified quite a bit.

Imagine a surreal, poetic, cinematic grand vision not unlike The Godfather movies and infuse it with stunning visuals, pithy dialogues, gut-wrenchingly real characters and a crackling plot. What you get is the beginning of this graphic novel work of art.The story is deceptively simple. Retired Hitman for the Mafia has to take to the gun again as his dear son, who followed in his footsteps, is killed by the very men who employed him. But through stunning Duotone graphics (blue & shades of grey) Igort paints a masterful series of pictures that drive this fast plot ahead.Although i am not much of a graphic novel fan, i would definitely be addicted to them if each one was as beautiful and stunning as this one is.

I liked the comic book style intro of \\"the greatest swordsmen in history\\", however they should have used that more.

And my, has Kate Bosworth grown up! Geoffrey Rush adds a one off touch as the town drunk with unique skills. Lots of explosions and slow-mo sequences help make this one go by pretty quickly.

The book provides some useful information but nothing of great value to the network engineer that can't found in the RFC for free.

The thing that you have to remember about Tiger is that his short game becomes moot because his long game makes it all possible.

I find the entire concept to be patently ridiculous.It's thinly disguised political commentary, manipulated by braindead libertarians--creating a universe that is black and white--how convenient for the this political mindset. The lefties in this universe have to be dissuaded from empathizing with these monsters.

I bought the book within a month after it was released, and because I'm near hardcore Weber reader, I didnt put it down for two days, and finished it.For those who also read it, and paid attention, the Bugs had managed to conceal a nearby system, on a planet, though with a fairly hostile enviroment, with a pre-industrialized civilization. It is inferred that they survive, and it does a real job on the imagination.The book itself i thought was a bit rushed, and wouldve given it a 4 1/2 star if i could.

This same general scenario is then repeated over and over and yet, over again. Some character development but this is overwhelmed by all the descriptive and enumerative detail about warships and weapons. Alien races are only sketched in a rather cartoonish way. The book needed to be much tighter, focused much more on character development, and in depth treatments of the aliens in the coalition against the Bugs and less on endless lists of combatant machinery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paid By the Word","review":"...

It was as difficult and unplesant to read as getting a root canal. Weber goes into infinite detail about the numbers of ships in each battle and on and on and on.Part way through the book I realized that it was actually boring. Not much character development. Not even much of a storyline. Just battle after battle and numbers and numbers.I considered not finishing the book, but set it as a challenge for myself. I will finish this book. I did finish it. Now I'm ready to make an appointment for that root canal."},{"rating":"2","title":"New to this series","review":"After reading the comments of several other reviewers of The Shiva Option I feel fortunate that this is the first of the Weber-White \\"bug war\\" series I've read. Obviously, I now need to read In Death Ground to compare them for myself.I found the story satisfactorily complex for a good yarn and the action reasonably fast and realistic on the military side. My major complaint was the purpose of the first two pages of map \\"Operating Area for the 2nd CAW\\". Their value to the story line was vague as most of the action related to the second two pages. I never did find the Anderson planets on any of the map pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious sequel to In Death Ground","review":"I waited eagerly for The Shiva Option. When I got it, I actually went back and re-read In Death Ground first. I'm sorry to say the book turned out to be, dare I say it, monotonous. It's just bug battle after bug battle without the story and character development I've come to enjoy so much. Even the system maps in the front appear to be a careless afterthought. Between the undefined symbology and no cross references to the terms used in the story (try to find Anderson 3) it's a disappointment. This is the first (and please the last) David Weber book I actually had to plow through. Let's all hope the upcoming War of Honor is up to the usual Weber standards!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have used more action instead of battle reports","review":"I know this book could have been half the size. It's too bad because I anticipated much more in terms of action. I would have liked to have read more about the fighters in battle. Like Starship Troopers, the bugs and their habitat could have more of a background story. Instead we get a lot of battle reports and behind the scenes detail that do not make for an exciting story. It was a letdown for me because I have read both authors work. The Honor series by Weber and the prequels for this series were far more involving. When reading a book of this size, the reader expects more in terms of adventure and action. I just wish the cover image matched the excitment in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"After the incredibly tense \\"In death ground\\" I waited for this book with great anticipation.The plot device used against the bugs is ridiculously simplistic and would have, in my opinion,prevented them from ever becoming the terrifying, nightmarish, force were in \\"In death ground\\".I really enjoyed \\"In death ground\\" , one of the few books I've read more than once, butunimaginative conclusion of \\"The shiva option\\" was a big let down for this reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Hard Choices","review":"THE SHIVA OPTION conludes the story begun in IN DEATH GROUND. The story and the options are just as horrific and the consequences are just as bad.Humanity and its allies face a war to the end with a race that will either eat every race it comes across or die trying. They cannot be negotiated with. They can either be killed or allowed to win. Killing them is not easy because they don't care about their own casualties. They have only a hunger and nothing can assuage it.The space battles are well though out as is the strategy presented. They should appeal to fans of space battle. Like the predecessor, however, the real story concerns the hard choices of the leaders.This is not a fun book to read but it is interesting and worthwhile. It also leaves open the possibility that more bugs will appear in later volumes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapoinment after a long wait","review":"After the multi-readings of \\"In Death Ground\\" and a huge collection of the authors' books, I was waiting with bated breath for the finish.

No new characters, no plot twists, nothing but a slogging to finish the story.\\" I'm disapointed, this sucker isn't worth a second read and I had a hard time finishing it.

If I had first heard him this way, I wouldn't have given him a second thought. Everything about this album, each song, the cover of the cd, all are clearly packaged to sell him as the next big pop star, around for a few weeks, never to be heard from again.In concert, he's clearly passionate about the music. Even with some subpar material, he clearly digs in, his vocals are good, and he plays piano and violin excellently. There is almost nothing noteworthy on the cd, and I clearly saw plenty to be interested in at his show. His excellent cover of Wicked Little Town is striped of emotion on the cd.If Ben Jelen is able to escape the claws of his record label, he might be able to release a much more interesting album.

Unless, of course, you're masochistic enough to need every last side-long cut of the 1960s (and if \\"Break Song\\" isn't the most exasperatingly punishing of the lot, I don't know what else to say), or sadistic enough to need evidence that the only thing Vanilla Fudge really had in common with Cream was a name suggesting cool summertime treats.

Not only was this book disappointing it reads like a sales brochure. The authors gives you a tid-bit of information and then wants you to go to his website which bounces you to other affiliate sites where he stands to make a buck. The information is very general and I mean very general no original thoughts that I can give credit to this author. He does a good job of listing all the real gurus in this business and quoting from their material and dropping links to their material. This is the first book I felt compelled to send back to Amazon!

I've worked in the field for a while, so there was not much new material for me. Nevertheless, I still found it a useful read. It presents a coherent and comprehensive conceptual framework for thinking about the many of issues and tradeoffs in the field. The book's layout, format, and style make it readable and useful. It has a reasonable index, bibliography, and glossary. The beginning and ends of each chapter clearly summarize the material. The book's stated goal was to give the reader a fundamental understanding of essential issues rather than a barrage of incidental technical details. I believe it succeeded. I wish I had this book five years ago when I was new to the field of OO applied to business applications."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent performances of Rach's piano trios","review":"In my opinion, these are the best recorded versions of Rachmaninov's two Trio Elegiaques available today. The Bekova Sisters give us superlative performances of these two challenging pieces, providing an expertly balanced interplay between violin, cello, and piano that is filled with great nuance and heartfelt passion. For those who think Rachmaninov only wrote melody-laden piano concertos, these trios are further proof of his genius at composing great chamber music. Check out his cello sonata for further proof."},{"rating":"1","title":"PULLING IS RUBBISH","review":"This series from England is total rubbish and I am sorry that I ordered the second season without having reviewed the first season.

But I am not happy that US Forge shorts the package by more than one rod and then rounds up.US Forge claims that this part number delivers 1 pound of rods (on their web site under \\"Electrodes\\") so I was wondering why Amazon lists the weight as 0.8. I received 11 rods that weigh 7/8 of a pound (0.88 lbs). My appreciation for the way Amazon treats its customers increases every time I deal with them.

The book itself is 300 pages long with a nice glossy cover and a table of contents that promises to get into all sorts of interesting things. The book did not measure up, however, to my expectations.Well over half of the book is devoted to a series of appendices with outdated information that appears to be taken out of old directories or websites. And the insights contained in the body of the book are few and far between. Most of the suggestions are fairly superficial and obvious (e.g., establish networks).I won't buy this book again, nor would I recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I bought the book thinking that it would provide useful guides in international environmental consultancy. But the book contained very little useful information, plenty of outdated information, and large chunks of the text are superficial that anyone already in the consulting business would already know.

Installing it was a little bit of a pain; it takes some work to get the clips positioned just right. On the upside, the ability to change the position of the clips means that it's possible to fit it on motherboard that don't have the holes in standard positions.Now that it's installed, it's working great.

Comparing it to Planet, it really lacks in any ability to clean anything at all. We can seriously dilute Planet and it still works really well where as Dishmate at full strength lacks in any ability to clean anything. It does smell great and we use it as a hand soap instead.I would suggest you buy a single bottle if you wish to try it out instead of investing in a case.

You would think after 100 or so years of reviewing, they could at least be honest.I stopped at about page 169 after a complete mish-mash of bad character development: Plant engaging in fairy tales with pre-teen booksellers, some other forgettable character droning on about someone called 'Sweetie,' and the thing with Poe (??) - forget this one, it's even worse than 'Rainbow's End,' which was pretty sad in its own right (at least the Jury/Sante Fe side of the book) and move on to 'The Lamorna Wink' - now that's 'entrancing' (The Orlando Sentinel)."},{"rating":"1","title":"KEEP JURY IN ENGLAND","review":"I COULD NOT FINISH THIS BOOK.

However, this one had me confused from the beginning. The plot made no sense even when the events were solved. In addition it continued to be confusing that the story kept going back to England for no apparent reason. Everyone is entitled to swing and miss now and then, hopefully this is an isolated case. In any event if this is the first Richard Jury mystery you have read and were disappointed, take another shot, I'm sure you will be happier with the result."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"This is the first Martha Grimes book I have read. I like mysteries and living very near Baltimore and being a fan of E.A. Poe this book was recommended to me by a friend. If it had not been a friend who recommended it I would have bailed out at about page 100. Since I did read it all the way through I can say with certainty it is as bad as I thought it was going to be. The author is using a Baltimore setting for the mystery, using the local color, scenery, and history to set the field of action and part to the plot line. There are too many authors in the this book, there are excerpts from 3 different characters (Ellen, Melrose, and Poe) as well as Ms. Grimes herself; the different styles are confusing and uninteresting. This is a failed attempt that should have not been published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Style, not story holds this title together.","review":"THE HORSE YOU CAME IN ON by Martha Grimes is my least favorite of her Jury/Plant novels.

That's why I picked it up -- love an English mystery. However, it is so much more than that. There are murders, detecting, excellent characterization, humor and great dialogue but even better are all the stories within this story. There is a novel being painfully torn from one characters' soul and we get to read not only parts of her novel, but also parts of someone else's who has tweeked it a bit but obviously plagerizing her prior novel.Someone discovers a long lost manuscript of E.A. Poe's (or is it?) And we get to read that too. There are verbal stories told, and dreams.

They were so wrong. I made myself finish the book - assuming that there had to be some clever tie-up of all these stories. But there isn't one. The murders and the solution are merely minor storylines in this book. And all the rest is annoying characters and talk, talk, talk. There are about 3 chapters AFTER you find out who the murderer is (an obvious murderer) and they serve no purpose except for more talk, talk, talk.

I still have no idea who half the people in this book are or why they were in it, or how they relate to anyone else. The book is horribly hard to follow and therefore lost my interest far too often.

This is one of the very few books that I threw in the trashcan. The book started off okay, but when it got to the trial it got very bad. I didn't watch the media circus of the simpson trial and I'm sure not going to read about it. I have tolerated an author's personal crusades slipped in to a story for a page or two. However this author's crusades fills several chapters and probably covers several more. I don't know because I got feed up at chapter 18 and threw the book out. I feel that I should sue the author for defrauding me by claming that the book is science fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little over done. Not very refreshing","review":"I must say I was very disappointed in this book. I can't understand why all those supposed expert reviewers raved about it. What started off as a decent plot idea, putting an alien on trial, devolved into a poorly written and horribly contrived alien invasion story. Too bad. I would have liked to see a little more research and accuracy concerning California law and also some better developed characters and story line. Sometimes authors tend to lose focus when they start to preach. As a Canadian, Mr. Sawyer probably shouldn't be so critical of someone else's legal system. At least without being a little better informed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best","review":"This book is social commentary thinly disguised as science-fiction/mystery. There's nothing wrong with that per se; combining sci-fi with social-political views goes back at least to H.G. Wells, to a lesser extent to Jules Verne, and for all I know even before that. There's a catch, though: the sci-fi story must be good enough to stand on its own, without the political trappings. Such was the case with \\"War of the Worlds\\", \\"The Time Machine\\", etc. Such is not the case with \\"Illegal Alien\\". The reader is subjected to a steady stream of the author's liberal political and social views, along with a wearying succession of pop culture references. In short, if you're a left-wing kind of person -- to the extent that you'll put up with a mediocre sci-fi yarn just to get your dose of liberal politics -- then this may be the book for you. All others, steer clear. And maybe re-acquaint yourself with a real writer like Wells."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alien OJ trial shows us human society's best and worst","review":"Robert J. Sawyer has created some fascinating science fiction over the years and ILLEGAL ALIEN is some of his best writing to date. The science fiction aspects are overshadowed by courtroom procedures and random (but fun) pokes at the US judicial system -- and yet they are at the very core of the mystery being played out. One of the best aspects of Sawyer's books to date is using the \\"alien\\" to expose the human condition -- and show us how our society is as bizarre as any alien society could be. That is shown here in profound and sometimes humorous ways that can be read between the lines of the story. An enjoyable read, sometimes contradictory, yet still worthy of note. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two genres collide wonderfully","review":"If you're reading this review, you probably like science-fiction. But do you like mystery and court room drama too? Then you will very much enjoy \\"Illegal Alien.\\" Sawyer takes a science-fiction concept and mingles it with a courtroom case. This Canadian author has done his research on the US Justice system. I felt that I was reading the transcripts from any one of the thousands of US court cases that occurs every day. The book holds your interest and twists just enough at the end to satisfy your desire for a good whodunnit. Highly recomemnded for both sci-fi and mystery fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspiring/Unbelievable Tale with a Catchy Title","review":"I found ILLEGAL ALIEN(1997) to be unfinishable - mainly due to the fact that it is a contemporary SciFi story that was written ten years ago - so it simply doesn't hold up to time, and there are far too many anachronisms and idosynchrocies to wade thru... the straw that broke the camel's back for me was the part where F-14 fighters are escorting the Alien Craft - it is impossible for me to \\"suspend disbelief\\" in this case, as the last F-14 was decommissioned this year..., and since no aliens have shown up yet, this situation couldn't have ever happened, and never will happen.After encountering a similar fiasco (but for different reasons - way too liberal politics and science) with MINDSCAN (2005), I'm definately steering away from any more books by Robert J. Sawyer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suceeds both as SF *and* mystery.","review":"Sawyer gave a reading at our local library, and I was intrigued, so I bought the book. It's great! The kind of SF I used to enjoy, with social comment and real issues. I liked crafty lawyer Dale Rice much better than the attornies in recent Grisham works, and the aliens really are the best since Niven's Puppeteers (as one of the reviews on the book says). Great SF, and (from someone who reads a lot of mystery, too) great mystery, as well. Five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Creative ideas for every shape and size of garden\\"","review":"If you like gardening, this book is great! Thousands of excellent-quality color photos, guides to choosing the right plant for different types of soil and climate, ideas for planning your garden, seasonal tips, indoor gardening...what more could anyone want from a gardening book?

I'm adventurous and quite the opposite of picky when it comes to foods so I thought, \\"how bad could this really be?\\" Well, I'll just say this: If you're looking forward to this tasting like the traditional style creamy colored potato leek soup, look elsewhere.I debated whether to give this ONE star because I know I won't ever get this again, but in all fairness, it IS edible... And if I hadn't been looking forward to this tasting even remotely like the Eating Right brand's potato leek soup cup, I might have given this three stars.

The first symphony contains a multitude of musical ideas and bristles with wonderful clear counterpoint. If there is a weakness to it, that would be the second movement, which is a set of variations on a ground bass, and I never seem to know where it is going. About the piano concerto, I have no reservations. The first movement is a prolonged, poetic rhapsody on a group of related musical themes. In the second movement the piano plays restless figuration as melodies slowly unfold in the wind instruments, until the process is interrupted by a bright string theme. The final movement is a lively rondo in which the orchestra develop contrasting themes. Lots of wonderful melodies and sonorities.The audio engineering is superb here, and conductor, orchestra and soloist perform brilliantly"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart, engaging, fun film","review":"I'm a big fan of the horror genre and I thought Donner Pass was quite good.

If you never read another book on diet, health, happiness and our future of life on Earth this would be the one to read. Robbins details how he turned away from the family fortune (Baskin Robbins) and reveals the truth on how our diet truly defines how happy and healthy we are. After reading this great book, I was left speechless and am sure you will be left the same.. This book offers us all hope for a better future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diet for a New America changed my life","review":"This is probably the most important book I have ever read. The day I finished reading this book, I vowed never to eat animal products again. That was 16 years ago. I have been a vegan ever since. The reasons for becoming a vegan that are outlined in this book have only become more compelling in the intervening years. Though some of the statistics and research may now be a bit dated, for the most part, the newest research continues to support the basic premise of this book. When you choose a more compassionate diet, you improve your health, the health of the planet, and the condition of animals."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book made me totally change my diet","review":"Before I read Diet For A New America I ate any and every peice of meat that I could get my hands on. Now that I know about the cruelty that goes on in the factory farms it sickens me to think about eating meat.

Plus the vegetarian diet is a lot healthier for me too."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book changed my life....literally.","review":"I think John Robbins is so wonderful for writing this book and for showing his readers how incredibly lovable and extraodinary the creatures are that share this planet with us. The sad part is so many people don't realize that simple fact. The animals have as much right as we do to be here and be treated humanely. I cried over how INhumanely they are treated.

This book talks about our choices in our diet and how they affect our planet. He talks about humane, heathlier ways we can choose our food, including meat products. He mentions several examples if you must eat meat.This book is about being aware of our choices, aware of what we don't know and what they don't tell us. Also is not about being a vegetarian or vegan, but about making the best choices we can for our planet. Is better to do some changes, than none at all. No one is perfect in this world."},{"rating":"2","title":"changed my whole way of thinking about food","review":"This book changed my lifestyle.

Do not trust anyone that hands you this piece of veal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caution! -- Very Biased presentation","review":"Although I've been a vegetarian nearly all my life, and read Robbin's book when it first came out, I must warn potential readers that it is highly slanted and biased, having chosen or ignored evidence that fits which his thesis, to present what is really a somewhat dishonest book of half-truths. For example: he'll never mention that primitive meat-eating tribes around the world, or archeological evidence of past tribes, reveals that they never had cavities, teeth problems, or osteoporosis, - but when tribes changed to a farming culture, they suddenly began to the same teeth and bone problems that we can today.

Naturally raised meat is the best source of protein around and is designed for our systems. And GRAZING animals are better for the environment than plowed up crop land. The author should have delved into this aspect more, as he apparently doesn't appreciate the huge groundswelling of humanely raised meat animals. However, this book is obviously a 'feel good' for the vegetarians out there. I wish he'd expose how much of the fruits, vegetables and grains are grown in this country. One would be horrified as to how many farmers basically sterilize the land for their crops. I suggest looking at the site Eatwild.com.

Reading this book though was very emotional. It angers me to know that people are unaware of what it takes to make their food, and this book covers it all. If I were to write a book against the animal-based diet it would be exactly like this one; taking apart the American diet and exposing every truth about it. Robbins is compassionate about teaching America about their food and it shows through in his writing. I am going to buy a few more copies of this book and lend them out to my non-vegan friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a book for the open-minded","review":"I read this entire book about a month ago -- forced myself through it out of respect for the friend who insisted I read it. It was a terrible waste of my time. Robbins writes as if he were an expert on every imaginable academic discipline, when all I could detect was pompous, suburban ignorance. He clearly has no understanding of farming or any of the natural sciences. He indicates himself what a sheltered rich boy's life he's lived, completely detached from the workings of the real world. He has done extensive book research that I'm sure will satisfy the insular vegetarian looking for an excuse to feel good about himself, but this book lacks the least hint of scientific objectivity. It seems he trumpets every argument in favor of vegetarianism with no discernment because he's too unqualified to judge anything himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"A must have Reference Book for every home!","review":"I went total vegan the day I started the book and have never waivered.

Then I read the quotes from luminaries on the back cover, and I figured they were just friends of the author and hadn't bothered to read the book.Well.This is a short book, but it's amazingly complete on the subject. I don't agree 100% with all of the policy advice he gives, but it's fascinating to read the real-life password analyses he's done. If you are just someone who wants to pick better passwords for yourself, you *might* like this book. If you are an admin trying to figure out a sensible password policy for your bailiwick, I *strongly recommend* this book to you. It won't take you long to read it, and you are almost certainly going to get some insights even if you are pretty experienced already.

His tips are easy to follow and can help in defining password policies for your enterprise (That was my main goal for reading this book). Even in 2011 the majority of people are using very weak password. If you can't come up with something other then Summer123 or qwerty as a password, this book is for you.

The price was decent but first thing I noticed is that it did not come with vacuum lines which sucks because I now have to find & pay for some @ an auto parts store. Wouldn't have been too bad if I hadn't purchased an Edelbrock Intake from here that was also missing parts & came with the wrong gasket. I wish these products told you what they DON'T come with rather than what they include because sometimes even if we know what we're doing we can over look a small part."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"First, it came packed horribly and I almost declined accepting the shipment because the box was so beat up. Product came in a sealed box inside that packing box, but when opened, the heater had no less than a dozen dents and dings on it. It didn't look refurbished, it looked used.

It did smell the first time or two, but I expected that; after that, no smell. The price was excellent and free shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total failure and complete waste of time","review":"What a complete failure and total waste of time. I was sucked in by the low price ($50), thinking that with Amazon I'd still get a quality product even if the item was reconditioned. The Amazon box that arrived on my doorstep was barely held together by a limited amount of packaging tape. The unit had obviously been jostled heavily during shipment. The heater had two small dents on the body and obvious wear on the top, which I think occurred prior to shipment. The heater's power-indicator light didn't blink 'on' when the unit was plugged in, and the 'start' button all but fell off when I tried to start the unit. I can't believe this unit passed any type of quality-control check at the manufacturer, as you'd expect from a reconditioned product. The only thing that worked were the caster wheels. Hopefully the return process won't prove itself to be a second nightmare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damaged!

The heater was completely broken (dented, broken LCD, paint scratched off, box with oil leak marks). But the box looked OK, so could it be that the \\"factory reconditioning\\" consisted of reboxing? I'm very disappointed. Don't know if it's Amazon's fault or Delonghi's..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damaged Goods","review":"I was a bit nervous ordering a \\"factory reconditioned\\" model, but was reassured by Amazon's liberal return policy that I had nothing to lose for trying. I ordered the item and it arrived 2 days later. Upon opening the box I noticed that the little protective plastic cover that fits over the thermostatic display was detached and broken. I thought that I could \\"live\\" with this, but upon further examination I discovered that the bottom of the unit was bent so much that the paint was coming off and that it would be impossible to attach the wheels. This damage DID NOT occur at the hands of UPS (The styrofoam protecting the unit was intact). Delonghi has a very dissapointing quality control over the outbound \\"Factory Serviced\\" units. Not recommended. Just buy the cheaper model and figure out what dial setting works for you. They all work the same way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unit didn't even turn on when it arrived","review":"Amazon is taking the return, which is the good news. The bad news is that in spite of the bad reviews some have given here, I was optimistic in believing that usually only the motivated and disatisfied write most reviews.For what it's worth, my recommendation is that you shop for a different unit. The quality control at DeLonghi doesn't seem all that great. Every computer I've ever purchased has been factory refurbished, and most stereo equipment too. In short, I'm not someone shy of chancing it w/ refurbished/reconditioned electronics. Unfortunately, this is the first time I've been disappointed.Thanks to Amazon for having such a great return policy (by the way, the unit comes w/ a big sticker that says \\"Factory Reconditioned: no returns\\". So, perhaps DeLonghi unloads these things and legitimate distributors get played for suckers.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A VERY BAD EXPERIENCE","review":"I ordered this as a birthday gift for my daughter. It arrived dented, no instructions, no wheels or mounting hardware. Without the wheels, the heater has nothing to stand on, so it's pretty much useless.

Still a very disappointing purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good product, bad packaging","review":"I ordered 2 of these heaters and arrived today in the most beat up boxes I've ever seen. I was skeptical of ordering after reading the many bad reviews here, but I did anyways. I fault Amazon and the way they packaged the product to be shipped. First of all Amazon is shipping these heaters in shipping boxes 3 times larger than the product and amazon added very little packaging material to secure the product from shifting. As a result both boxes arrived smashed to bits, the little air filled packaging material was lost somewhere during shipping, along with my paperwork and while I had one heater survive the trip the other heater looked like it had been in a head on collision and I am in the process of returning this item to amazon.

My factory-reconditioned unit was clean and well packed, but the LCD did have a big scratch on it -- so don't expect it to be new-item clean.This thing puts out an enormous amount of heat, even at the lower settings. It definitely gets hot to the touch, so if you have kids or pets be careful. One major thing to keep in mind with all radiator heaters is that they take time to work; I usually turn mine on and come back to the big room it's in an hour later. But if you want quick heat, you might be better off with a fan heater.This unit does have a digital timer, but as other reviewers have noted it only turns on for a maximum of 4 hours at a time on that setting.One last note -- it heats a room much more efficiently if you put it under a drafty window or in front of a fan. Otherwise, the heat just goes up and doesn't circulate nearly as effectively."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine toy, Feels Cheap","review":"This toy is fine, but all of the pieces are cheaply made. The larger viewing enclosure with a magnifier on the top and bottom is fun, and sturdier than the other items, but comes apart too easily -- frustrating for younger children. This is an adequate toy for one's own children, but due to the poor quality, I'd never give it as a gift. Once the novelty wears off (which didn't take long for my five year old), it's not much better than a magnifying glass and a jelly jar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This game is incredible and does a wonderful job of recreating ancient Egypt in all its splendor.

Highlights include a great sitar version of Chris Farlowe's superb \\"Moanin'\\", The Fleur de Lys' \\"So Come On\\" and P.P. Arnold's \\"Angel of the Morning\\" that beats the heck out of any version recorded of it since. Add to that plenty of cuts from label stars The Small Faces, and the then-pop idols Amen Corner, and you've got yourself a great afternoon of listening pleasure.The only drawback to this collection is the complete lack of liner notes.

Investigations into the nature of the disease in 1894 culminated in a contest between two early microbiologists, Kitasato and Yersin, a tale with obvious modern parallels. This historical footnote is one of the major themes of the book, but the author then follows the spread of Plague from Hong Kong to India and on to America.

His characters are vivid, real and detailed - and whether likable or not, you feel like you know them. But most of the characters ARE likeable - foilbles and flaws and all.

The majority of the book is told from the first person of the youngest of the generations. The oldest generation is told from a diary. I found the story from the diary disconnected to the other stories, other than the fact that the women was the mother of the middle generation woman. The middle generation, who is elderly and suffering from Alzheimer's, has just one or two chapters from first person perspective, which I found uneven. Either don't bother to use first person for her perspective or give her equal treatment with the other two stories. The writing was fine and the story of the youngest generation woman was fine and times very good. But overall, did not blend well enough for me to recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"excelent product and good seller","review":"Excellent product and easy installation, was sent on time and packaged very well recommend it is very good quality and have not had any problems since the day of its installation and first use"},{"rating":"2","title":"mig welder","review":"Awesome machine does take practice to get the wire to go through properly but does the job you need it to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanksgiving fact filled book","review":"This book got here fast and in great condition.

It was often over his head but there was enough interesting information that he learned a good bit about life in Plymouth. The book doesn't entirely shy away from the Christian aspects of Pilgrim life (and there were some faintly unacceptable overtones on a page or two). My son was usually able to tell his father something he learned from the book and I even learned something myself!

They have named this album \\"Big Iron World\\" which comes from the lyrics to 'Let It Alone\\" which they have recorded and listed as \\"traditional\\" . \\"Let It Alone\\" is not a traditional song it was a popular tune in 1906 and written by Alex Rogers (lyrics) and Bert Williams (music).

The opener, Down Home Girl starts the listener on the road that one does not want to end. OCMS you have one of the finest CDs out there.

My fave OCMS yet (they are all great), and I think I have them all. This has a bit of a 20s jug band feel, though as a modern recording. The song \\"I hear them all\\" is a very nice tune. I like this on the David Rawlings recording as well, though I really like the OCMS harp treatment. It is refreshing to hear Zion, Noah, Judah, Buddah, Elijah, and the old Paiute Wovoka \\"take their places at the table when they're called\\".

Backed by a nice combo led by guitar legend Mel Brown, he storms through a set of mostly original's that showcase his fine singing and heavily amplified harp playing perfectly. There are a few covers of lesser known blues song's including Robert Lockwood's \\"My Daily Wish\\" and Otis Spann's \\"Burning Fire\\". Pick up this cd if you like rough and lowdown blues.

I've managed to work a fairly good-sized dent out of a fender on my project car.

Carrying case could be better, very cheap and poorly constructed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't beat the price!","review":"Not a professional set by far but for the price coupled with free shipping this set would be tough to beat. The dolly surfaces needed some minor touch up to get things smoothed out, radius was okay on one plane, the other had some cupping, nothing a ceramic belt won't clean up in 5 minutes or less. I can imagine the factory dude in China grinding away for his 5 cents to get these done quick. The hammers also needed some minor work, inconsistent radiuses on the head, but again for the price, and a little work, these will match up with those high end sets for triple the money. I like at least one hammer without a crown, these hammers are definitely NOT machine ground, just a guy at grinding wheel so you won't have well machined surfaces. That being said, they are not very far off from getting them just right. Nice plastic case as well. Well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"HQ DVDs","review":"These DVDs are Excellent! They have the DataLifePlus feature which protects against Solar UV Rays that Burn Through the recording dye, and other types of damage to the physical optical disc that would make the data unreadable. In the old days if you exposed a CD to direct sunlight the suns rays would re-burn the disc and ruin the data stored in the recording dye, thus ruining the entire CD. DVDs are more dense, they pack the pits that store that binary 1s and 0s more tightly together, thus requiring different software and possibly a smaller red laser to read the disc. Blu ray is one step up from DVD and can store up to 7 times as much as a DVD, but a BD-R requires a much denser smaller laser (measured in nano meters) to be able to read the disc). Overall I give this product a 10/10."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away From This One!","review":"This collection was an incredible disappointment. I gave it one star because the selection was interesting. Unfortunately the recording quality and the volume variability are abominable. Whoever mastered this has ears of corn.I was especially interested to get, and disappointed to not hear, Dooley Wilson's \\"As Time Goes By,\\" from Casablanca. The sounds are so fuzzy AND muffled, I could barely recognize them as music, let alone the song itself.The songs' volume levels also vary wildly and unnecessarily.

The vocal range within this foursome is phenomenal, with Let Me Die In My Footsteps truly inspiring. The Eternal Circle is superb, and in Lay Down Your Weary Tune an unbeatable version.There is genuinely not a bad track on this 13 track C.D.I know it is hard to come by, but living in the US now, I managed to get this on C.D. imported from Australia of all places, two years ago.Honestly it's worth the price and the 30 year wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Christmas gift","review":"Got this book from the library, read it and then ordered copies for each of my three grown kids.

The Beatles, Jimi, Pink Floyd, The Clash and yes Swervedriver have made modern music much more interesting. Anyone reading this that hasn't listened to Swervedriver should at least give this or any album a try. For Swervie fans, there are many unreleased gems to find to get you humming new songs.

This 'ignorant' miller's daughter suffered so much in the flesh and was so persecuted at first for her strong faith by the older more educated people who just didn't understand that the reason the Blessed Mother would appear to her, a mere uneducated child, was because Mary herself was a pure simple girl also. To read about Bernadette is to live and walk in her path of holiness. This is by far the best account I have found of her life and the events that happened at Lourdes.

We ended up returning it and he is in the market for a different scent. I don't know if they've changed the formula or the manufacturing company has changed the procedures used to make it but whatever it is - the change was definitely not for the better.

These compilations really make no sense though, because a lot of people who like rock hate rap, and vice versa. Why combine the two genres on a CD? Anyway, I gave up on NOW CDs when I chose to have a seven song limit of good songs on a CD for me to buy it. This CD has um; two! It's pathetic. Compilations annoy me unless they're non-album tracks.

Mr. Allen would have a Catholicism where everyone thinks and does as they please, and still be in good terms with the Church. However, I still managed to finish the book and to leave it with an increased admiration for the current pope. On the plus side, Mr. Allen does provide useful summaries of the theological views of those whom then-Cardinal Ratzinger opposed, as well as some of his reasons for doing so. But the way he finishes the section on Other Religions (\\"What is at stake\\"), implies that Ratzinger's views have contributed to the civil wars that- like Kosovo and Northern Ireland- are fought under the disguise of being religiously motivated. Suggesting that Ratzinger's work has contributed to those conflicts is completelely over the top and inflammatory, not to say untrue."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Somewhat Wandering Account","review":"I purchased this book in the hope that I would obtain a clearer understanding of Cardinal Ratzinger in terms of his role and significance during the last twenty years. However I have to say that while there is lots of information in this book along with stories and anecdotes, it fails to deliver in terms of a substantive analysis of the church since vatican II and where the church will be as we move further into this the 21st century. At the conclusion of the book Allen hinges his critical description of the Cardinal in terms of the next conclave including a list of reasons why Ratzinger will not be Pope. If that is not enough he then goes further to sujest that in the event that he is wrong and Ratzinger does become Pope all of the difficulties he would envisage with such a papacy. The issues which he attampts to examine are far to complex in nature to be benchmarked of nothing other than his own futuristic and prophetic beliefs.

The writing is clear and crisp, and covers all aspects of the Dead Sea Scrolls, and how much of the research concerning them has been mismanaged in the past.

It was an excellent read, and definitely opened my eyes to the Dead Scrolls and their significance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting to a novice, but who knows","review":"I enjoyed the book, but have little to draw upon for critique. Like any other conspiracy book, the authors could easily be manipulating the facts or leaving some out to cause me to believe their thesis. I chose this book as the first book on the subject matter and now feel the need to read more books on the scrolls to verify for myself whether the book is just good reading or an accurate account. I expected nothing more from it as I don't take anything at face value. It definitely got my attention and made me want to explore more books on the subject. For that, I would give it an A+, but back off on the fifth star until I can confirm its accuracy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big buildup then a whimper...","review":"I've read other books by Baigent and Leigh, they are typically quite interesting and thought provoking (their minds work in twists and turns that are intriguing to me). But this book left me flat. I read a different version of this book, I think the second printing of it. They built up a lengthy story of how the scrolls were suppressed and hidden and how there were undoubtedly amazing secrets within which we were being wilfully denies access to. Then in the very last page they announce that in fact a University in California has the complete scrolls and are publishing them all. So much for the secret pact to prevent us from knowing the truth. The book is interesting for the historical perspective and of course for the intrigues and twists Baigent and Leigh always toss in, but it left me pretty flat with that revelation (Saved for the absolute end, no less)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dead Sea Scrolls Deception","review":"Highly recommended but can take time to read. It involves so much information so make sure you read in it in a quiet and non-invasive environment to get full benefit from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly argued","review":"I found the first part of this book OK, but then Baigent and Leigh went all over the place with their theory of a Vatican conspiracy. For starters, over 80% of the Scrolls had been published by the time the book went to press, hoiwever, they tell us that only 25% have been published. Secondly, if there is such a Vatican conspiracy over alternative explanations of the DSS, why does a Vatican publishing house publish Eisenmann's books? Oh dear, there goes the conspiracy theory. The authors date the dfall of Masada in AD 73, 74 and 75 (depending which part of the book you read). Lastly, there is indeed a lot of speculation as to whetrher the Zealot Party existed before AD66, the majority view is that it didnt (see for example JD Crossan). However we read no justification for these assumptions, as page after page, the Gospel of St Eisenmann is called upon.Oh well, theres my tuppence worth"},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-Catholic Hate Literature","review":"Written in the popular tradition of those who, being inferior scholars themselves and unable to attain academic honors, decide to write sensationalist hit pieces for the gullible public.This book is about as plausible and well-meaning as \\"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion\\". Any anti-Catholic bigot or prejudice is given full credence by these \\"researchers\\" who never even make a show of getting the other side's perspective.If wild-eyed conspiracy literature is the kind of reading which helps you forget that you're unemployed and living in your parent's basement, by all means buy this book.

Though I dislike the use of \\"Deception\\" in the title--too tabloid-like--I can't really disagree with it, finally. Whereas in some of his books (I'm thinking especially of \\"The Jesus Papers,\\" toward the end) Biagent seems all too easily to build inference on speculation upon dubious interpretation, I find little of that sort here. I recommend the book to anyone interested in the histories of pre and post-Temple Judaism and Christianity and the history of the scrolls themselves over the past sixty years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not history and not bible scholarship","review":"This book is not history and it isn't bible scholarship either. Baigent and Leigh are known for several books, including this one, that are on the edge between history and off the wall unreasonable conjecture.There is a time for books like this one. Some of the time they are fun to read, and one of the other books by this pair did make a good premise for someone else's novel. But it would be best not to think you are reading history when you read this.There is plenty of real amazing stuff in the Dead Sea Scrolls, and now that the scholars have had a decade to sift through the fragments that had been hidden from them for decades, we ought to be seeing popular books on what they have found.But this is not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"for the gullible and simple-minded","review":"Since this book has been published the entirety of the DSS has been published, with the exception of some non-religious scrolls, which are nevertheless readily available to anyone curious. If you want to see what the hubbub is about, check out Vermes' _Complete Dead Sea Scrolls in English_. Not exactly controversial stuff, since almost all the scrolls date before Christ.It's amazing that people still want to believe the Vatican was involved in some kind of cover-up, and the authors will distort facts or lie to make it look like lots of Catholics were in on the DSS research, or that much of the research was done under the \\"watchful eye\\" of the Vatican.

As I turned it down nothing happened until it was all the way down, then it suddenly dropped to 1250 RPM. There is nothing in between. And if I shake or touch the button with it all the way down the fan speed will jump to 2250. It just does not work as it should, I finally got it to stay at 1250 but if it gets bumped it will jump back to 2250. I would not recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly Brilliant","review":"This is by far the best production of Hamlet I have seen. Tennant is a powerful actor. Here he is at once full of wit, driven mad, angry and frightening and yet so vulnerable. The use of cameras and mirrored surfaces, the costuming and modern constructs that frame that beautiful Shakespearean language, giving it new life. Excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate Hamlet","review":"The Tenth Doctor plus Captain Picard give us Shakespeare at his FINEST. Absolute excellence in every look and every line. There is no question that this cast is talented, and the performances don't just do Hamlet justice - they make this work come ALIVE.Tennant steals the show for sure with his performance, but every moment gives me chills. This is Shakespeare's classic how it was meant to be: a poignant, emotional, beautiful journey into human psychology. Brilliant beyond measure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hamlet (2009)","review":"David Tennant's Hamlet is very moving to me ,because he bring so much of his heart in the role of Hamlet. You know the end of the play ,but that matter ,because you want to see more of how David Tennant's Hamlet deals with his mother.David Tennant brings so much a his feelings to the role of Hamlet. All of people didn't think David Tennant couldn't play Hamlet ,because he was in 'Doctor Who' well they where wrong. David Tennant ,has done many roles then just the 10th Doctor in 'Doctor Who'. He is wonderful in 'Secret Smile' ,that came out in (2005). Then he was in 'Casanova' by Masterpiece Theatre as Casanova.The cast is wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr. Who No More","review":"David Tennant is nothing short of fabulous in the part of Hamlet. His rendition of the \\"To Be or Not to Be\\" speech is flawless. I have to confess that I have not watched Hamlet in its entirety because it is long and you really have to be in the mood for it, and what's annoying is that every time I go back to my Library to continue it, it starts all over from the beginning and I have to hunt for where I left off. Also, some of the other actors are not as engaging as Tennant, particularly Ophelia, who is too whiney and in my opinion not attractive enough for the part. I will always dislike Shakespeare in modern dress, but unfortunately it is now the way of the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"mailbox flag","review":"This mailbox flag was much better then I expected.

Most of the book is nothing but filler. I found myself skipping pages of uninteresting details--the same stuff over and over. The plot was weak and boring, and the ending non-compelling. Grafton readers should skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wild ride ...","review":"Thoroughly enjoyable reading. This was a good story, though not much of a mystery per se. There was one big surprise at the end which I never expected. Grafton's descriptive talents are best put to use in this book ... you can really taste and feel Kinsey's surroundings and the danger she is in. Good summer reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weakest of the 10 I've Read","review":"I finally gave Grafton's \\"alphabet\\" series featuring Kinsey Millhone a try with \\"P Is For Peril\\" a year or two ago, when it was the newest of the series. I liked \\"P\\", and I've since been working my way through the rest, starting with \\"A\\" -- I've now reached \\"I.\\"I think \\"H Is For Homicide\\" is the weakest I've read. Much of the book has Kinsey undercover, living with some crooks and auto insurance fraud artists in Los Angeles. The plot doesn't seem to advance very quickly in these segments, and Kinsey's acerbic observations begin to pall. We're left with a generally static narrative of fairly pointless minor incidents among uninteresting, vaguely threatening people. Kinsey's better when she's rushing around among a variety of mainly middle class specimens, observing their tastes and foibles, in my opinion.The good news is that \\"I Is For Innocent\\" was a welcome return to form."},{"rating":"1","title":"H is for Homicide","review":"I have read all of the series up to \\"N\\". I loved all of them except for \\"H\\". All she seemed to do was go to the bar with them or hang out in their apartment (and describe it. No action as in other books. I, J, K, L, M and N were great. Don't judge the series by this one. I started with M and went back to A and read on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grafton's Worst","review":"I have read all of Sue Grafton's Kinsey Milhone books, and I've enjoyed all of them, except this one. For a private eye novel, there is no detection or mystery in this one. It's as if Grafton had to turn in a book and had writer's block when she wrote this one. A mystery novel without a plot is no good. Don't start with this one or you'll likely write off the entire series, which is much, much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Book About An Insurance Scam","review":"This is a boring book about an insurance scam that is conducted by a Hispanic sociopath with Tourette's Syndrome.

Along with \\"C\\", \\"H is for Homicide\\" is one of my favorites.

This is typical Grafton work with Kinsey getting personally affected by false insurance claims."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written, but a snore of a plot","review":"My first Sue Grafton book, probably my last. I'd read the reviews noting the realism of her heroine, etc. and I liked the character. But does Grafton ever deliver with a little excitement in her plots? This thing goes on and on and not once was I absorbed. I like a little tension in a mystery. Even the dangerous dog is of course quickly revealed to be a pussy cat. Yawn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Disappointed","review":"I am new to this series of books and am reading them in order. I really enjoyed A through G, but H is a real disappointment. I simply do not like Kinsey in this one. She comes across as a bit stupid here. I'm surprised at her willingness to break the law. For example, she hits the female cop since this will get her arrested and she'll be able to stay close to Bibianna. What?! Or how about when she's with Raymond looking for potential accidents and she VOLUNTEERS to drive at one point. Then when she causes her first accident she feels a \\"thrill.\\" Who is this person? What I really found ridiculous was the chapter with Dolan and Santos filling Kinsey in on what's going on and what they want her to do, and then low and behold, she inexplicably gets bailed out before she's supposed to. I hope the next books in this series that I read are a whole lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Link in a Great Series","review":"I read A is for Alibi years ago and did not get pulled into the series. Years later I read S is for Silence and was hooked. I started to read the series--backwards at first and then jumped to the beginning. I have really enjoyed the books and felt a connection to the heroine (and forgiven Ms. Grafton for making her weigh 118 lbs on her 5'6\\" frame). However, I agree with the other readers who feel like this is not Grafton at her best. You just can't believe that Kinsey would put herself in these ridiculous positions---belting a police officer to endear herself to a woman she is investigating, remaining in an incredibly (and unbelievable) dangerous situation, to name a few. The dialogue is weak,the sexual situations seem gratutitous, and there is a fair amount of stereotyping of hispanics. But even with these issues, I did finish the book. Grafton at her low point is still a good read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"'H' for Homicide falls flat!","review":"I am a devoted Sue Grafton fan, but, unfortunately, I don't agree with the majority of reviewers on this effort. 'H' for Homicide is, in my humble opinion, the worst of the alphabet series. It rambles aimlessly before it comes to a frustrating and disappointing end. Readers know who the perpetrator is no less than 100 pages into the tale. This is a wasted, poorly advised writing by Miss Grafton."},{"rating":"1","title":"H is for Ho-Hum","review":"Bang! This Millhone series novel starts off almost immediately with the murder. Ms. Millhone is more a hostage with the bad guys than a PI in this one. With all the cops available in the police department, they recruit her to go undercover. Oh, please.The murder turns out to be part of a large auto insurance fraud scheme.Not much at all is developed from the initial murder. There's also a chapter in the beginning wherein California Fidelity has a new local boss. Millhone bucks heads with him. The matter doesn't come up again until the very last sentence of the book.The novel is boring, tedious, & ridiculous. It's easy to put down, which I almost did twice. It seems Sue Grafton tried a new avenue in this story. Unfortunately it fails terribly. I've read a good dozen in this series. I liked the series until this one came along.Do yourselves a favor, go from \\"G\\" straight to \\"I\\". This book just fails to come together"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner","review":"It's been a while since I read one of her books, but they're just as great as I remember. I don't recall her others being quite so violent as this, but the violence was necessary to the story. As an added bonus, but one that applies solely to this reader, I once had what I thought was a great idea for an antagonist in a thriller but was horribly unable to write the thing. Sue Grafton used a similar idea quite successfully here. I hate to see great ideas go to waste, so I'm happy she did that. As a fine and final endorsement of this novel, I'm going to read another one. Next week, unfortunately. Tough editing schedule."},{"rating":"2","title":"H is for Homicide","review":"This is great as well.

It is rapturous, loving and beautifully crafted. Complaints that Dyson lacks real substance and staying power are baffling. In fact, the concerto takes on greater depth with each listening. The sheer integrity, intelligence and depth of Dyson's art is represented here. He's a composer without artifice -- one who simply and effectively conveys the sincerest expression of human yearning. In short, a Romantic lost in a world of Angst and bitterness. The Children's Suite is a delightful make-weight of such extraordinary skill and understated inspiration that some may completely miss its obvious charm. Performances from all on this disc are nothing short of world-class. The engineering is excellent. Give it a try and be surprised and how great this man's music is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Pocket Dictionary for Students","review":"This dictionary has been an essential tool in my Arabic studies.

I also like the movie, so it makes it fun, too.\\" My review would be: it's fun, it's easy to assemble (Dads), and it teaches your child how to judge timing and hand-eye co-ordination. All in all, a blast."},{"rating":"1","title":"needs work","review":"pros: Easy to assemble.Some parts work fine.cons: When using the car launcher ramps, seldom does the car make it onto the acceledrome.

Then getting 2 onto the track at the same time is even more of a hassle.Then to top it off the child has to using the same perfect timing to get the cars out of the loops and up the final ramp.

Problem was, he ran it so much that we ran through batteries like there was no tomorrow. It was fun, once he figured out the schematics of the whole thing, he wouldn't leave it alone. It was noisy, but that didn't bother him. Setting up the 'globe' to knock down became too much of a hassle for him, as he couldn't figure out how to get it together, so he gave up on that but still adored the thing. Unfortunately, it took up too much space in his small room and had to be given up to make room for other stuff. Poor kid. Once we took it apart, we could never find every piece for it again. Thankfully he was happy with the fact that he got to keep the cool cars. I'd definitely recommend this toy, though, to anyone with the space for it. Pretty cool.

The best part is that after reading this book, I have started to look at some of my \\"problem\\" students in a completely new way. Attwood not only explains why they are the way they are, but also gives expert advice about how to best cope with children (and adults) who are not easy to cope with. I say this last sentence deliberately, as Attwood points out that we must cope with them, as they are the way they are and they do not change. The condition is genetic, lifelong and stable. The book is a treasure trove of information and helpful ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kaput!","review":"Another cheaply made, quickly edited, and poorly designed book.

An editor would have helped cut out all the giddy and silly actions and slutty reasonings this book-if you'd call it that- produces.

Guinevere was just as pitiful as ever, and Arthur was a dummy in this book. Mckenzie writes an easy and simple tale of the king/queen saga that can be found anywhere else. The book was huge, which made it worse to read. Get MISTS OF THE AVALONS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"I disagree with most of the other reviews, this book was a cheap rip off of Mist of the Avalons. It was so boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"mildly entertaining","review":"The book was somewhat entertaining, but the story was not told particularly well. Guinevere, Lancelot and Arthur seem to be the personification of ideal people in a Medieval European setting. They do not come alive. The characters seem buffeted by fate with very little will of their own. Their complete perfection in the face of other's complete cruelty create a story not tragic, but pathetic. If it is a good tale of Arthur you seek, try Marion Zimmer Bradley or T.H. White."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet and simple.","review":"I enjoyed reading this book, as I enjoy most stories based on the Arthurian legends. I didn't find it much like The Mists of Avalon at all, and I enjoyed the fresh twist given to Elaine, who has usually come off as rather dull in most other versions I've read. I don't quite understand why people seem so worried about it being a copy of Mists... after all, they all originated from the same legend anyhow! I recommend this to anyone who loves Camelot."},{"rating":"2","title":"So entrancing that 60 minutes on treadmill went by too fast","review":"Wonderful tale of Guinevere.

I found The Forestwife much more enjoyable. the foreign words and old English dialect, it felt like I was in their age and time, unlike this book)."},{"rating":"1","title":"FLY SWATTER HITS DOWN ESSENTIAL POINTS TO A GOOD BOOK","review":"A dull trite novel with not enough details for emotions and surroundings. In creating a lasting loved book, one needs to let the reader feel and understand and also become perplexed with the character and story itself. Mckenzie has picked up a fly swatter and hit all of those essential points for a good read down in a toilet. Though, for an amateur writer, The Child Queen is pretty original... if not bad. What else is there to say about this pointless book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"oh please!!!","review":"THE CHILD QUEEN HAS TO BE ONE OF THE MOST OVERRATED FICTIONS I HAVE EVER COME ACROSS. An average book on the average dumb-headed female of the chivalry age. There are much more entertaining novels out there for teens with female point of views.

Nothing much to say, everyone know the story of Arthur and his cheating wife, Guinevere. The only thing that made this book stand out from other Arthur books is that it was his unforgiving wife Guinevere telling the story. The Child Queen isn't really a book worth reading, but it's cheap. So get Child Queen if you're on a tight budget- if you aren't, I suggest THE FORESTWIFE by THERESA TOMLINSON (lots of childhood hate turned into love), ZEL by DONNA JO NAPOLI (rupenzel, with a beautiful twist, such a gorgeous book to read)."},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointed...should have chose another book","review":"From all the rave reviews, I decided to buy this corny looking book to see what all the screaming was about...then became deeply disapointed. The High Queen lacks many elements of a good book. She had no character at all. Whatever Guinevere did, you couldn't tell her personality, how she was as a person, if she was sweet or rude. The only voice I could hear in my head, were the quoted lines which she spoke, and those failed to move me also."},{"rating":"1","title":"SO American English","review":"This is such a dull-in-the-doldrums book.

It was so hard to hate her, as much as I wanted to. I loved the book as a book but it was nothing I expected it to be. Perhaps that's a good thing, maybe not. It's excellent as a piece of fiction, but . . . Gwen is bad, bad, BAD! BAD GWEN! Heh. I still hate Lancelot, okay? Nothing you say or do will change that. The book lacked the lyrical prose that I enjoy in most other fantasy titles. As a romance it did farely well.

The characters were too perfect, not one of them I can mention has a fault at all, which makes it seem like they were all mechanical animals or robots instead of human \\"beings\\". Another thing was that the situations given were highly unbelieveable, I mean, come on, is Arthur THAT nice? Everything was so artificial, like they were all faking it and grinning like a barrel of idiots at the pathetic weakling who weeped and whined through out the whole novel.For a first rate fantasy, you may want to try the well known \\"The Mist of the Avalons\\" or even \\"Court Duel\\"...at least in those two, reality and magic is in place and setting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Your female aimed teenage trash of a book","review":"The typical average ho-hum female falls for king story.

This isn't the TRUE fantasy type of reading most fantasy readers would enjoy. There wasn't the highly anticipated war or the round table. Many of the key elements that have been in the King Arthur tales have been left out of this novel, a big mistake. If some light research was done, the writer could have added very much needed details in that would have had readers think, \\" Hey, this is a pretty well-rounded novel.\\" There was the occasional romance, but Child Queen was more of an emphasis on the love between Lancelot and Guinevere, not King Arthur."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"Worked well but was a bit of a challenge to get the old one off.

Let me tell you first of all the Ultra Light rod is very very very light, I was kind of disapointed how light it was but it has not broke yet handling up to a 2.5lb bass on it which means it must be pretty good quality. If I was going to buy another it would be the 6ft med which is still a very good deal in the hopes that it would be more rigid.

When? Also Morrison states that there were no Christians living then who observed the Sabbath day? Mr Morrison, did you forget about Lydia?

Honestly, if I pick up a book about 'Gothiques' and Poe, I dont wish to be reading about drug trafficing and hits on the Baltimore gangs.His development of local color is sad too, mindlessly throwing around locations and names and such.Also, the authors lack of research really shows when he brings up Anton Lavey. He not only spells his name wrong, but brings up animal sacrifice, which is NOT an Anton Lavey/Satanic practice.If you wish to read something good in the way of The Crow or horror, check out Poppy Z.

I wasn't torn or upset or even concerned for our newest Crow incarnation at all during the course of the book. Sadly, I found it dry and slightly corny in areas. Edgar Allen Poe was an interesting idea but again was somewhat lacking in the big picture. If you are an avid Crow fan such as I, You will undoubtedly buy and read all things 'Crow' and will not regret shelling out the money for the books.

The hooks (they are not clips) that connect them to the top of the rack are small and at least one comes off nearly every time I ride. Sometimes when that happens, the pannier wears against my spokes. After less than a year of use, small holes are appearing due to that wear. The bungee cords that hook onto the lower part of the rack are not sufficiently taut to keep the bags in place, so I looped them around one of the plastic loops that it travels through before hooking them onto the lower part of the rack.All told, you're better off buying a nicer and more expensive pair of panniers that have a decent and reliable way of hooking the panniers onto the bike.

It hasn't shoot the car out that can harm my son but mother and grandma is very worried. Also the hand of the gorilla suppose to hit a lever and hummer the car into a car cage.

We kept it put together in his room because he could manually push the car around the loop but the Gorilla's arm kept falling off and the track would crumble with the slightest touch.

I put it together exactly according to the instructions, and the first time we attempted to put the car through the track it flew off and hit my son. He wasn't hurt, just startled...but still. After tweaking the track for a very long time, we eventually got it to work. My kids were frustrated that only a handful of their very large Hotwheels collection would actually work with this toy. The toy's track soon got out of the very precise alignment it apparently has to be in, and the cars started flying off again. The gorilla's fist stopped hitting the lever in the right place, so the cage portion didn't work right. My kids must have decided that the aggravation wasn't worth it, so now its sitting in their room, unplayed with for months. Now, I'm realizing that its going to be a big pain to dissasemble and store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"We bought this toy for our [...] old because the display was so cute in the store. I should have known something wasn't right when the display was not working. It talked but the cars didn't go. We got it home and set-up went okay (we used the animated instructions online), but realized the toy wasn't what we thought when we tried to use it. The car kept hitting the \\"lane switcher\\" and flying off the track. That problem could only be fixed temporarily. Another problem was that if the track wasn't set up precisely, the car would fly off the track. After a few laps it would move a little and have to be re-adjusted. The gorilla kept having to be re-adjusted as well... we never got it to do exactly what it was supposed to. I was under the impression that it said stuff as well (from the store display), but it never did. Anyway, after lots of annoyance with it, we decided to take it back and and we bought some legos instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly designed","review":"My 5 yr old son thinks this toy is great, but after only 30 minutes of play the force of the Gorilla falling over backward had pulled the base apart to a point where the Gorilla only works now if I sit beside it and hold the base together while my son plays with it. He also got a set of strait Hotwheels track for Xmas like I had when I was a kid. He has alot more fun with that: putting books under it to make jumps; seeing how many cars can go down the track at once, etc... More entertaining, more imaginative, more durable. Sometimes simpler is better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If it worked, it would be GREAT","review":"This was No. 1 on the christmas list and it has proven to be a disappointment. He still wants it to work and we fiddled with it for days... trying the suggestions here to no avail. We can't get the switch on the back of the gorilla to even move to automatic. It will go back today, but my 5 year old still says if we could have one that works he would like to replace it. It is a hard decision to take this toy back because he really loves the \\"concept.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid,mean,and STUPID!","review":"First of all,THE GAME IS ABOUT KILLING A GORILLA!It makes gorillas look mean wich they aren't!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Gorillas are already endangered,so they don't need help being even MORE endangered!"},{"rating":"1","title":"broken in 40 minutes","review":"My son got this as an early Christmas gift and although he seemed to enjoy playing with it, the gorilla head broke after 40 minutes of play. The latch on it somehow doesn't work now and so the gorilla head won't shut and therefore the toy is useless. I will see if amazon.com will take it back but this was a big disappointment, to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a racket Mattel has going!!!","review":"It's an overpriced piece of crap, as most Hot Wheels products seem to be, but my 5-year-old begged relentlessly for it for months. Santa brought it yesterday, and it was fairly easy to set up, but you really have to fiddle with it to get it to work properly. I still can't get the gorilla's fist to smash down on the lever, but most of the rest of it seems to work. My son LOVES it.We bought last year's contraption, Slimecano, after months of similar begging. It was a huge disappointment, and we ended up returning it to Toys-R-Us after the couple of weeks it took to convince my son that it was junk. Even he eventually agreed and we took it back and exchanged it for something else.Still think it's way overpriced for a plastic pile of crap, but Hot Wheels seems to be able to convince the kids they need to ask for it for Christmas. What a racket they have going!"},{"rating":"1","title":"why Santa, why.","review":"After watching the commercial many times, my then 4 year old asked for this for Christmas. I reminded him that commercials often make a toy seem \\"cooler\\" than they sometimes are. I suppose I am very skeptical. Figuring I had avoided the pitfalls of another crappy toy I was as surprised as my son when Santa came through with the goods. Assembly wasn't too bad, about half an hour. Adjusting the track and gorilla took another 30 minutes. By that time I had to install fresh batteries since the toy had lost just a little zip which was too much to overcome the forces of gravity. Of course the now 5 year old had lost interest and gone on to a better alternative. Santa and his elves should be ashamed to have wasted all this cheap plastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritated!!!","review":"We bought the Gorilla Attack for our grandson.

Hard to put together and shoddy construction. The most annoying thing is that no Hot Wheels cars work on the track. We tried TWO bins of Hot Wheels cars and none of them would go around the track succesfully. It makes loud noise, sucks up batteries and (obviously) has ZERO educational value. Skip this one! Shame on you Hot Wheels!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too loud.","review":"My son does really like this toy and once we got it working right it was fun, but it's way too loud when the cars get launched. My son is very sensitive to loud sounds and holds his ears every time he plays with this, but he does enjoy watching it and playing with it. It could be a bit more sturdy than it is, but we don't really have a stable playing area. Plus, this thing is huge, why does it have to be so big and cumbersome? It takes up a lot of room in my sons bedroom. He has only played with it on for about a week, but he now just plays with it manually and likes to have the gorilla eat the cars and put them in the cage. I know he's played with it, but not with the launch function. Overall, don't expect too much out of this toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Read","review":"I agree completely with the reviewer below. This is a thoroughly enjoyable collection, gripping at times, the social and political issues never forced or didactic (and certainly never manichean), but integrated critically and astutely into the fabric of the stories themselves.

The Philharmonia Orchestra in this recording of a piece not found on many recordings, gives an exciting reading throughout. The brass section particularly sounds robust and to the front of the ensemble. Being a horn player, I can never turn down another recording of the Gliere Concerto, and this one definitely does not dissappoint. Richard Watkins is at his best here, Singing the beautiful phrases and using his technical mastery to astound and amaze. Many horn players shy from this piece for reasons of endurance, so hearing a recorded version is quite better than a live performance as far as fewer missed notes. If you do not own a recording of this concerto, buy this one, and then get the Hermann Baumann recording and compare two great artists!"},{"rating":"1","title":"metro faucet corkscrew","review":"Cheap construction, cutter doesnt work well, I gave up trying to use it.

I have read most of his books, and enjoyed all of them. That ends with this one. The book is repetitive in the extreme. It also includes a number of cheap shots at people that Feinstein apparently has an issue with. His attacks on people like John Madden and Dennis Miller demean the book, without adding anything of value.Another issue is that he doesn't tell us some of the things we said was the purpose of the book, such as why someone was seen as a better draft choice over another, while at the same time telling us in great detail about things that I doubt anyone cares about, such as the religious battles between the team chaplain and Peter Bouldware/Matt Stover.

It takes you through a year with the Ravens. You get a front row seat on the passing parade of people that passes by in an NFL season. I particularly enjoyed the stories of the fringe players, the long snappers and fill in punters trying to get some time in and just hold on for another chance. The management from club president all the way down to assistant coaches and scouts come across as decent types. One thing I noted was that Feinstein took the players devotion to their religious faiths at face value. I have always assumed that all the pointing at the sky and mentioning of the Lord was used by ethically challanged thugs as a cover for their hedonistic lives. The author takes their public religious professions without questioning how/if it informs their daily lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadfully Tedious","review":"How Feinstein managed to take an intriguing team (the Ravens) and an exciting subject (football), and turn it into an absolute snoozefest is a complete mystery.

Avoid at all costs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"with this book Feinstein disappoints","review":"Sadly, John Feinstein swapped his integrity for access to an NFL team to write this book. Feinstein has written far better books on other topics than this. Other authors have written far better books on this topic than Feinstein did here. His failure to research the players and the team owners deeply results in simplistic, misleading and often false explanations of the very events that people read an insider book to get. The problem is consist throughout the work. I suggest The Education of a Coach by Halberstam instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Housing leaking, no service","review":"I purchased SeaLife Reef Master DC500 and went to my diving trip to Egypt.

The narrative revolves around four friends who started together at a major accounting firm and are still close friends 24 years later. The story is dramatic, it looks at how perceptions can vary from the inside and the outside of a corporate scandal, and it shows how good people can get caught up a scandal through no fault of their own.This is a good story for any reader, but I would especially recommend it for accounting or business students because it provides another perspective on some of the topics that can be pretty dry in the academic setting. It also puts a human face on the issue of white collar crime."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Iron Horse Club: A real page turner!","review":"The Iron Horse Club is fast-paced and full of edge-of-your-seat page turning!

Rode mics use superb capsules mounted in machined housings you could drive a truck over, and the NT1 is a great mic for male vocals. The guy at the store suggested the NT1000. I recorded myself on both, and there wasn't much difference, but the 1000 just sounded a little smoother. But, the NT1 had a painted finish (may have changed since), made out of aluminum. When you screw the mount on it feels rough, like screwing in a light bulb with an aluminum base. The NT1000, though, feels rich and expensive, a nickel-steel finish (I guess) more like the expensive Neumanns. And when you screw the parts together they feel precise and elegant. It was a hundred bucks more than the NT1, but with the slightly nicer sound, and the much nicer look and handling feel, it seemed worth it.The only problem I've had with it is weight. It's fairly heavy, and can't be extended very far on my boom stand without falling over.Great dynamic range, low noise, very detailed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible received broken!","review":"As soon as I got my microphone I was excited to finally record I never bought anything that expensive on Amazon and there's something shaking on the top part of the microphone as soon as I received the item the box was also ripped looks like someone used it the microphone doesn't even work biggest disappointment ever the worst experience I ever had on Amazon now I'm stuck here not able to record"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Mind Games","review":"These are fun games with multiple levels.

And since I would be using this product merely once a week, I didn't want to fork out my life's pension for, say... a porter cable. The unit is compact enough to polish the tight space-confining places on a bike. It's orbital action is fine. 10-feet of cord is a plus. Only thing I dislike about the unit is the elastic-style pads that are shipped. And, the applicator pad is foam. Yuk. Then again... it's Black and Decker. Need I say more?Been using the product for about 3 weeks now. No malfunction problems so far. However, something tells me the switch will be the first to go.

The best that he could do was have them ordered, which cost a ridiculous amount of money.

It's easy to hold when working on the side of the car and easy to extend one handed on the roof. The problem I had is that when I tried to remove the pad (a cotton pad with elastic ring) from the machine, the rubber piece peeled right off the machine. The rubber pad is just glued onto the plastic part of the spindle.Rather than try to send it back, I've re-attached the rubber pad using Gorilla Glue. So far it's working.

Tippett's theme is the futility of choice and the nature of the impact of choice on humanity in the micro-sphere of the individual and the macro-sphere of the community and history. Tippett's unusual yet perfectly conceived recasting of the Iliad from the Trojan persepctive does more than summarize plot, but pauses to comment on the universal human potential implicit therein.

I have long hair and when I got out of the shower it was in a huge rats nest, even after I brushed it before getting in the shower. I sprayed tons of leave in conditioner on it and still hard a hard time getting a brush through it. After it dried it was limp and gross feeling. Do not recommend at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smells Great, not quite hydrating enough.","review":"I love love this shampoo/ conditioner set. Note: I've never used the hydrating treatment. My hair is medium length and fine.These products smell absolutely delish, in a minty- chocolate way that actually stays in your hair (My bf even noticed the difference).Now I know that its winter, and that might be contributing to the one problem I'm having. The \\"hydrating\\" claim didn't really come through for me. I've noticed a ton more flyaways and static in my hair over the past week. It smells and looks great, but I actually feel like a should rub a dryer sheet on my head. Sometimes my hair clings to my face and its never done that before. Overall four stars.I think I'm going to try the hydrating treatment to try to fix this, cause I love the smell too much to give up easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Great Smell","review":"It smelled wonderful, but it completely dried out my hair. Gave me the worst dandruff I ever experienced in my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dried and Damaged Hair","review":"I indulged myself with this shampoo thinking that it would be good for my hair to get some t&t after being stressed. I don't blow dry my hair or use a flat iron but this shampoo dried out my hair beyond belief. After less than a month my boyfriend wouldn't put his arm around me because my hair was to rough, whenever I wore it down it frizzed out, and I couldn't stop itching my head, I've never had such a problem with my hair before. Eventually I had to cut off 5\\" because it was to damaged to be saved. I changed to another shampoo for dry and damaged hair to help save it so I didn't have to cut off more, it worked, but eventually I did have to cut off the rest of the damaged part of my hair, luckily it's grown out now. I gave it to my boyfriends dad to use on the dog. Definitely not worth the hassle or the pain for 5 minutes of fancy smelling hair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed At All","review":"Still trying to figure out how a product containing coconut milk, coconut oil and egg white proteins can leave hair dry. You would think that with those ingredients it would leave your hair on the oily side. Not so with this product.Color treated hair comes out dry and in desperate need of a leave in conditioner. Even after using the matching conditioner, you will still need to seek out a leave in variety just so you can comb through and style.A product that I do not think I will be using again.Back to BioInfusion Hydrating Shampoo a great product for softness, shine and volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smells Heavenly, Leaves Hair Like Silk","review":"I was somewhat sceptical of this product, due to the fact that it contains the word \\"silk.\\" Getting my hair to look like silk is next to impossible. However, I tried this after having good results with the Coconut version and it seems to add a lot of smoothness and shine. I did notice that my hair was slightly dry, but it might have been because I used a clarifying shampoo first. However, the smell of this alone is heavenly and it works really well, all without sulfate which can weigh your hair down. All in all, I love the Organix products and the matching conditioner is excellent too. Great stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"It smells good...","review":"but that's about it. I love the smell of tea tea and that is what attracted me to this shampoo, but it doesn't actually hydrate my hair at all. It actually makes my hair feel slightly dry and almost as if it has been washed with water. The gorgeous smell only lasts for about 10 minutes as well. I even got my friend to smell my hair this morning after I used this shampoo and she said it doesn't smell like tea tree at all. The same goes for all of the Organix shampoos I guess because she has the same in lavender and her hair doesn't smell like lavender :/ Sorry but don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drying, not hydrating!","review":"I have normal hair with slightly dry ends, and this may be the worst \\"hydrating\\" shampoo and conditioner I have ever used. The shampoo was slightly better than the conditioner in that it didn't leave my hair any worse off than it started. The conditioner, on the other hand, did not moisturize or detangle at all. I'm not joking. When I combed it through my hair it didn't even feel different than using water. The smell is inoffensive though, which is why I tried it in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta love coconut","review":"This conditioner is great and, since it's sulfate free, my hair color lasts longer. I would recommend this to my friends and I will by this again in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smells Grrrrrreat!","review":"This seems to be a good clarifying shampoo. It doesn't lather well, but I find that it gets my hair extremely clean without using extra product despite the lack of lather. The smell is wooooooonderful, but the scent goes away after you rinse. The conditioner, however, leaves behind the scent and detangles my hair without weighing it down. My hair ends up feeling clean and smooth (my hair is super straight), and I find myself sniffing my hair all day long. I think you really need to use conditioner each time you shampoo, otherwise your hair will be a tangled mess without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My new shampoo","review":"Usually use salon products,but saw this.

It will actually break your hair. I have untreated hair slightly on the dry side and I was looking for a cruelty-free, conditioning shampoo, and this coconut shampoo made my hair extremely dry. I couldn't even run my comb through it even after using a deep conditioner. I would recommend this shampoo for someone with short and very oily hair. It'll make your hair squeaky clean. I will use it once a month to get the build up out. It does lather well and smells like light pure coconut. I also checked it on the EWG website and was not pleased with the ratings.

I've tried four of Organix's shampoos, and this is the only one I've been dissapointed with.Instead of making my hair soft, it felt hard, like I had just sprayed a lot of hair spray on. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because it does smell good, which is the only good thing about this shampoo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I have been using this shampoo and conditioner, paired with the anti-breakage serum, for about a week now. I have naturally wavy/straight hair, and it's normally pretty dry so I use lots of moisturizing treatments. Some reviews say this shampoo has dried their hair out, but I have to disagree, personally. This line has done wonders for my hair! It actually styles much easier now with a flat iron, and the style stays straight all day, which NEVER happens normally. Plus, no frizz! My hair looks and feels so healthy. I'm impressed. I'm usually fighting a losing battle with my hair, and I think so far this has been a solution.I also tried the 14 day straight treatment, which was the reason I bought the shampoo/conditioner. Do NOT use the straightening treatment. Such a waste. It makes your hair super greasy and it smells bad. The shampoo, however, makes your hair soft and straight, as promised!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I have thick, curly hair that is horribly frizzy. Nothing I have ever tried has work on my hair. EVER. I have only used this shampoo and conditioner once but I already love it!

It left my hair (which is pretty thick and straightish with a wave, and color treated) feeling DRY of all things! I was really surprised.

It cleans my hair decently, but doesn't leave it especially soft."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, lasting smell and okay feel.","review":"The coconut smell lasts a really long time!--the main reason I gave this four stars. I washed my hair twice with Pantene Pro-V shampoo/conditioner (on separate days) after using this shampoo, and I could still smell the coconut with each wash!NOTE: I have wavy, semi-frizzy past-shoulder-length hair.The feel is just okay. It doesn't leave your hair soft and silky, but it doesn't leave it horribly dry, either. It does leave it feeling a little stringy--i.e. more prone to static and tangles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very drying, not at all happy with this shampoo","review":"I bought this shampoo because it was on sale and I thought it might be good. Boy was I wrong! For months, I was having a terrible case of dry scalp and I thought it was due to stress or other things. Now that I changed shampoos and have not been using it for a few weeks, my scalp is back to normal. Thank goodness. It is great in principal--the ingredients seem good--but it did not work for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I tried this product after reading a good review of the Coconut Shampoo and Conditioner on YouTube. I was very pleased with the results. Make sure your hair is really wet before adding the shampoo. I only washed it once. Just use a little because if you use too much the result will not be what you desire. My hair had a little conditioner in it before I washed it, and I followed the wash and conditioner with a leave-in conditioner and anti-frizz crème. The secret is to use just a little."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST Shampoo Ever!","review":"I bought this shampoo as a last ditch effort. I've been a disgruntled consumer of shampoos for a while now, and let me say, I've bought them all. From Kerastase, to Biolage, to Redken, Rusk, Garnier, Tigi, Pantene - you name it. Some were so-so, while many were so full of sulfate-based ingredients, leaving me with rashes on my scalp and hives (I'm allergic). Organix was the first shampoo I've ever noticed to actually say, \\"Sulfate Free\\" on its packaging. After one use, I was totally amazed - my normally dry and course hair was silky soft and shiny. This will be the only shampoo I'll ever use, and I encourage others to give it a try - they're currently offering a FULL rebate, so what do you have to lose?!?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not perform","review":"I purchased the Vanilla shampoo and conditioner because it smelled great. That's where the products performance ends. The conditioner is useless if you actually need it to soften your hair. I have long straight hair - so honestly- it does not take much. I cannot get a brush through my hair after using this conditioner. The shampoo further drys my \\"normal\\" hair type which you can feel when washing in the shower. The only thing that is soft & silky are the words on the bottle. Girls, the product smells nice, but it does not work, which is unfortunate. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made my hair like straw","review":"I bought this shampoo, (and the complimentary conditioner) after reading tons of reviews on various sites raving about this product.

Dollar shampoos work better.I got no real lather from the shampoo and the conditioner left my hair so dry I had to use my Biolage after. Do not waste your' money on this brand, the only reason any magazine suggests to try this is because Vogue is in control of the brand and the Vogue name carries a huge amount of weight and puts pressure on the industry to advertise for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"My experience with this shampoo and conditioner","review":"I have been using the Organix Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy 13. oz shampoo as well as the matching conditioner. The shampoo does a good job in making my hair feel very clean and getting nice and foamy. However it feels like it dries my hair out a little bit and that the conditioner doesn't leave my hair very soft. The products smell very coconut like but after using this product for 2 weeks just to get my money's worth , I wouldn't continue buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No real lavender scent","review":"When I bought this product, I expected it to have the scent of the essential oil, lavender.

I ended up adding my own essential lavender oil, but I won't buy this product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two stars only because it smells pretty good.","review":"I was attracted to this shampoo because it smelled pretty good, and I've heard really good things about using a sulfate-free shampoo. The shampoo made me hair smell great, and it worked well the first couple of times. Over the last two months or so, it seems like my hair has gotten weaker and dryer. It seems like I've been shedding A LOT. Once I switched to a different shampoo, my hair feels so much better.For reference, I have coarse, thick, wavy hair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this Stuff","review":"I recently developed psoriasis and after using a few different products I used Tea Tree oil directly on my head. Well, it STANK to high heaven but it helped my scalp for about 4 days. Thus began my search for a Tea Tree oil shampoo that doesn't stink. I came across this beauty at Wal-Mart and OMG do I love it. It smells wonderful, it's cooling and soothing on my scalp and it leaves my hair soft, tangle free and very manageable. I have fine hair that requires conditioning otherwise I can't comb it. It tends to be oily but it is always healthy unless I chemically treat it. So far this shampoo has been great to it and to me. I would highly recommend for someone with psoriasis or who just likes nice and not overly chemically smelling hair. I use both the shampoo and the conditioner, btw"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great smell, but it dried out my hair","review":"To be fair, I tried this product after years of using Matrix Biolage (a REALLY good product used in salons), so chances are I wouldn't have liked most other shampoos. But I wanted to try something different and save money, and this product smells so good that I gave it a try.Never again. Like other reviewers with straight, fine hair, I found that my hair feels like straw after using the Coconut Milk shampoo just two times. I didn't use a conditioner because I haven't for years. Also, I air-dry my hair, don't use curling irons and my hair isn't colored or permed.I thought this shampoo would be less expensive than Biolage, too, but it's not. The 13-oz. bottle of Organix cost just under $7 locally, and a 33.8-oz. bottle of Biolage is around $20. The Biolage is concentrated so I use less and I don't need a conditioner. Lesson learned!"},{"rating":"2","title":"natural alternative to hard water stain?! this was my experience","review":"first off I bought this shampoo because of NO Animal Testing.

I poured some out and sure enough the orange stain was gone . I can not stand harsh chemicals so I just leave the build up. Ugly orange tub is now splattered with pure white.

I had always liked the smell, but hated the idea of spending 7 dollars on a small bottle of shampoo.First, the scent you smell in the bottle doesn't stay in your hair at all. Sure, you can smell it when your hair is still wet, but once it's dry, there is almost NO SMELL.Second, this shampoo barely produces any lather. You have to use a large amount, which ends up weighing your hair down, and making it look greasy. This is WITHOUT using the conditioner!Honestly.....using this shampoo makes your hair look, feel, and smell like you haven't washed it at all. Complete waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get This Stuff!","review":"After using the shampoo and conditioner, I noticed my hair was softer right away.

So I bought this shampoo, having had one of the pink organix shampoo/conditions before and it worked out great. Anyway, this Tea Tree Mint shampoo actually seems to ADD grease to my hair. It looks fine for about 6 hours and after that it's grease city! If I shower at night, it's dirty by the morning. Absolutely awful. I really wanted it to work, but unfortunately it just doesn't.

What's not to love?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Smells Good, Wasn't a fan of the product though","review":"I've been going through a coconut obsessed phase, so I decided to try this product when I came across it in the store. The product smells amazing, but that was the only thing that kept me using it. I have thick wavy hair, its usually very soft. While washing my hair with this it made my hair feel like it had a ton of tangles in it, and off course after getting out out of the shower it did have A LOT of tangles in it. My hair has never been prone to tangles so it was quite weird. Since I have switched to another shampoo and conditioner of the organix brand, the brazilian keratin treatment one and I love it and no longer have the problems with the tangles :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother trying this product.","review":"I wanted to try something new so I bought the Organix coconut shampoo, conditioner, and the leave in split ends meander. The first time I used the shampoo and conditioner. My hair was literally in knots as it dried which forced me to get a nice haircut. The shampoo makes my hair really hard, dry, and rough. It really feels like straw. The conditioner makes my hair somewhat softer. These products smell great but its drying out my hair. I've only used it twice but do not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great smell, but not so great product","review":"I bought this shampoo and the matching conditioner, because it said it provided weightless moisturizers. While the shampoo has an amazing smell, and it did provide the moisturizers they were not weightless by any means. My hair felt heavier and incredibly greasy after using it, I did continue to use it for about two weeks to see if it would improve but it did not. So overall I would not recommend buying this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great scent, but doesn't pass on to your hair after..","review":"I really liked the smell of this one above all other Organix hair products, but sadly the amazing scent never passed on once out of the bottle. Just FYI"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like bad hair days, you'll love this product.","review":"Shortly after I began using this shampoo and conditioner duo, I wondered why my hair looked so bad. Normally my hair looks great after just wash and go. I've always had healthy, shiny hair with lots of natural body. But shortly after I began using this shampoo, I was embarrassed at how it made my hair look. It was so bad it affected my self-esteem at work. My hair felt like dirty straw and looked unkempt. So I tossed it in the cabinet and grabbed my emergency bottle of cheap shampoo, and WA LA, my hair was back to it's beautiful healthy self again in no time at all. It's a shame because this stuff smells wonderful, but it just ruins my hair, so, as for me, I'll never buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chocolate pudding for your hair","review":"I love the smell of this shampoo--it's very chocolate pudding! My hair feels extremely soft, without being heavy or overly-conditioned. It's shiny, too, and is left with a subtle cocoa scent (definitely less intense than the pudding smell in the shower, not that I would mind)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget It","review":"I consider myself to be shampoo agnostic and will even use the stuff in the dispenser at the gym, but this stuff left my long, highlighted hair feeling like tangled straw.I shouldn't need a heavy, intensive conditioner after a shampoo unless it's a clarifier, and this isn't.The only thing to recommend it is the scent. It does smell like a sweet, freshly cracked coconut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Organix is NOT Organic!!!","review":"Organix portrays itself as an natural shampoo. Well, it does have about 3-4 natural and safe ingredients. All the rest is a toxic mess, including petrochemcials and preservatives linked to cancer and disease.

I was attracted to the bottle. It smelled good in the bottle. That is where the good things stopped. This shampoo makes my hair feel like a bundle of hay, even while still in the shower. I use extra conditioner on my hair and still have a hard time trying to comb my fingers through my hair in the shower. When I get out of the shower and try to comb my hair, it is still very tangled and dry. I have used this shampoo/conditioned for about a week. My scalp has begun to itch. I cant say for sure that its related to this product but I did not have any issues before I started using it. Normally I would give away a product that I was not fond of to someone else who might enjoy it, but this product is going straight into the trash. Save your money and your hair.. Keep on walking by this product and buy something different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recommended","review":"This is the worst tea tree shampoo I have ever used. There was no refreshing feeling when using it as with other tea tree shampoos. The shampoo had the strangest scent, which can only be described as an old library smell. The conditioner was nothing special. It did not detangle all that well. I have untreated hair which is almost down to my waist. The shampoo and conditioner left it feeling dry. I would not buy this again. For a good tea tree shampoo, use Paul Mitchell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caused more than average hair loss","review":"I started using Organix & fell in love instantly with it. I absolutely love the way it smells & made my hair feel. However, after about 3 months I realized that my pattern of hair loss had drastically changed & the amount of hair coming out when I showered & combed it was alarming. I would literally have clumps come out while I was showering, when I combed my hair & all day long. I decided to switch to Treseme & within days noticed an improvement. Now when I shower it's just a few strands or sometimes nothing comes out. I haven't figured out why Organix was causing my hair to fall out, but I would like to find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Dried out my hair, did not leave it straight.

The fragrance is awesome and it stays in your hair upto 24 hours after washing.Its all natural and makes your hair smoother, softer, more bouncier and the best part is, your hair don't get frizzy at all!I absolutely adore it. The only problem I had was that after washing, when I blow dried my hair, it got all sticky for a couple minutes, but later it was fine.I suggest towel drying, just in case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed...","review":"I bought both the shampoo & conditioner because a) they smelled good & b) they were on sale. My hair felt very dry after just one use. I've used the products a few more times and am throwing them in the trash - so much for \\"saving money with the sale\\". I'll just stick to Biolage, my usual brand. It is worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommend for oily scalp.","review":"I bought this shampoo to help with my oily scalp - which recently began to have an unpleasant smell. My hair becomes oily after 24 hours and becomes oilier every minute after that.This shampoo has helped with that problem. I can get away with washing my hair every other day. After that I notice it begins to look oily again, but it's a slow progression and there is no smell.At first it wouldn't lather up much for me (which is to be expected with this type of shampoo), something you have to get used to and figure out how you want to go about using it. I can say that the more you use it (consecutive days), the more it will lather.A great purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"good idea up not keep up with the past","review":"I got this DVD though Amazon.

You can get a sub. to this dvd magazine off each dvd. The plus to a sub is that it will sent to you at home without having to check when the next will come out.

There does not seem to be a lot of information about the dogs themselves; the closest thing to that is a short history of each breed.

The day after reading the first 130 pages, I resolved to play without fear, not be upset by bad shots, and enjoy my playing partners.With OB left, trees to the right, I striped my drive on the 440 yd par 4, followed by a 5 iron to 8 feet, and drained the putt. What a great book!Four hours later I found myself in the clubhouse having shot a 90 for the first time in over 20 years, with four OBs and five 3 putts.It's a good thing that \\"looking good\\" was no longer important to me, as I endured the ribbing, jabs and outright taunts of several of my fellow players.I'll finish the book. But most likely you'll find it listed on the Used Books here very shortly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun.. getting out of our own way...","review":"Extraordinary Golf is the best publication on self coaching that I have ever discovered.I remember Tiger Woods crediting his success with his ability to 'get out of his own way'. Fred Shoemaker, and Extraordinary Golf provide each of us the path to letting go of the mechanics, and the expectations of performance in golf, and letting our inner passion for the fun and enjoyment of competition take over.After years of struggling to recover the game of my youth as a scratch handicapper, Fred's wisdom helped me to understand that my own power came from having fun as a kid.. I am young again !I learned from Fred that in golf, there is a ball, a target, and me. The only variable in the game.. is me.. and Extraordinary Golf provided me with the power.. to be me.You have to read this book.. it will change your game, and your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Contemptuos Golf","review":"A journey into the mind of a golfer. Dangerous stuff! Fred Shoemaker delves into areas that most don't consider when striking the ball. However, with this line of thought, there is a hidden mind set of contempt. Generally in order to escape the \\"ego\\" of golf, you must first rise above all of your surroundings and distractions ie. Your boss(in the foursome), the girls sitting on the patio watching you tee-off, and you friends heckling you in the background etc. This procedure, I see as comtemptous. The ability to block these distractions out is quite difficult, if not impossible. A better way to approach the idea is to become better than the distractions. The only thing that will stop you from hitting the shots of your life is DOUBT, and picking your head up of course! All in all, read the book. It contains great ideas and some excellent tips."},{"rating":"2","title":"Changed my outlook on golf","review":"Fred writes to those of us who are high handicappers who have lost our way. If you think you can be better by tinkering with your swing, read this book. Enjoy the day, feel your swing, and you will either get better or at least enjoy golf as it should be enjoyed. What a great way to spend a morning or afternoon...walking and seeing a beautiful golf course in all of its natural glory."},{"rating":"2","title":"fabulous","review":"I loved this book. I hadn't played golf in 10 years, went out after reading this book and had sooooo much more fun and consequently, played sooo much better. I am amazed that my game can improve so much just from reading a book. I loved the philosophy it puts forth and have even tried applying it just to daily life. I have given this book as a gift to most everyone I know that plays golf."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real eye and mind opener that can help any golfer.","review":"There is much more to golf than mechanics and the author does a very good job of getting his views across. After I read the book I hit more 'great' shots in my next 4 rounds I than I had in the previous 5 years. It won't get the weekend warrior onto the PGA tour, but it could certainly help keep his wallet in his pocket at the 19th hole. It also helps the reader enjoy golf on another level entirely, despite how he(she) plays. You'll probably save the cost of the book in a couple of months simply by avoiding having to replace so many lost balls."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinary golf instruction book.

The Big Book of... series tends to be hit-and-miss. This one's a miss. There seems to be a shortage of actual games, and a lot more ideas for how to get a good healthy discussion about Topic X. If that's all you need, this may be a good one. I was looking for actual games and activities...found a lot of them in Miller's Quick Teambuilding Activites for Busy Managers. But all the activities in that book are short, so if you need anything to last more than 15-20 minutes, try Ukens' All Together Now--some of them are longer (for retreats and other long meetings)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all what was expected","review":"The book contains nothing that will be of value to our organization.

It works much better than I had expected and it comes in very handy to prune tree limbs and to cut up small logs. I also have the battery-operated chain saw for larger logs. My rationale for going with all Firestorm power tools is that I now have multiple batteries and multiple chargers so that I always have a fresh battery when one runs out. That way I am never without power. The included bag comes in handy for storing and carrying multiple tools at one time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat Disappointing","review":"My first adventure in investigative journalism, I was immediately captivated by the beginning: cast of characters, general overviews, and the excitement that, based on the overview of how the book was to go, it was worth reading. The material was well written in that Mr. Moldea went into fine and captivating detail asto what the investigators were thinking, what EVERYONE was thinking. I was a little suspicious of the passage where he describes visiting with Sirhan Sirhan, and given the result of the encounter, maybe made the author a little biased asto how his investigation would lead to. The ending left me in a completely different place, where I believe the author's evidence lead me to. His conclusions were not anything I had agreed with. I feel he made the evidence ultimately fit the official version of the tragic downfall of RFK that fateful June evening in 1968."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted Time","review":"Moldea writes 304 pages explaining the problems such as coroners finding that RFK was shot from the right rear, more shots fired than Sirhan's gun held, etc., etc.Then in the last chapter he concludes that Sirhan acted alone and fired the shots that killed RFK. He doesn't give any new evidence to support this claim. Oh, he charges the LAPD with botching every aspect of the case but says they got it right for the wrong reasons.Don't waste your time on this book. If you support the original findings you won't like the charges of incompetence. If you are looking for a book to support a second gunman theory this isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time and money!","review":"This book begins as a fascinating look at the serious inconsistensies in the investigation of a horrific crime. Then, it's as if the writer goes blind in the light of potential discovery.. A very confusing conclusion considering the early questions and concerns brought to light.The writer certainly has a right to his own opinion. However, if he had nothing new to contribute, why not just publish a short editorial stating that he believes that the investigations and conclusions of the past were spot-on and save the reader both time and money!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Builds up to NOTHING!","review":"Basically he painstakingly makes you go through a tremendous amount of information just to discover that Sirhan-Sirhan is guilty. The gunpowder burns that the coroner says could only have happened if someone shot right up against the Senator is explained very creatively. It's like reading a tiny Warren Commision and having to buy into the single bullet theory again. Really a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely the wrong conclusion","review":"The author has done his homework but then asks the reader to accept what he believes really happened. The book contains a lot of evidence. It also mentions missing physical evidence, tape recordings and reports. But the reader is asked to join the author in assuming that Robert Kennedy was somehow pushed forward, putting him into the point-blank range required to match the powder burn evidence to his jacket and head. He decides to dismiss photographs and at least one credible statement of two additional bullets being found in the pantry center divider. The former is an imagined scenario, the latter is assigned to a mistake, a misinterpretation. I would have given this book zero stars if I could.The book to get is The Assassination of Robert Kennedy by Philip Melanson. The conclusions drawn in that book are based on the evidence, and do not include wishful thinking."},{"rating":"1","title":"FIRMLY BOUND","review":"Although I found this book a fascinating account of the assassination of Robert Kennedy, I did feel that the author was so bound and determined to make all answers fit the questions regarding the Senator's death regardless of the presentation. In reading this account, one gets the feeling that the author is so firmly bound to his view that he has narrowed his vision to only one path."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks solid evidence to support claims.","review":"Although the book made for interesting reading, I found it quite repetitive - as if arguing to convince reader of author's convictions. Lacked substantial evidence to confirm theories. Total lack of cooperation by LAPD and Federal agencies certainly adds to confidence in conspiracy theories as this book puts forward. Sirhan being a \\"Manchurian Candidate\\" seems to be more valid than multiple guns and/or assasins."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard Plastic Hard to cut and use","review":"I returned this as soon as I got it due to how useless it is.

If you thought that their last effort was weak (no pun intended), this album will not rekindle the fire of Despised, Weak, Four, or any of their ep's (Measure was a gem). This band may be suffering from a major label hangover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tangled up in blue","review":"Although Seaweed used to spawn three-minute anthems like a busy chicken in heat, Actions and Indications' stand-out tracks seem unnatural, as if they were born by cesarean. New drummer Alan Cage (Quicksand) pummels the daylights out of \\"Red Tape Parade,\\" but its half-hearted, spoken verses and uninspired chorus celebrate nothing but blandness. Only \\"Warsaw\\" hints at the balls-out riff-rock of the band's glory days - a point puzzlingly reached by a Joy Division cover from Ian Curtis' insipid neo-Nazi period. \\"In the Middle\\" and \\"Let Go\\" close the album with a glimpse of hope, the former building its foundation on a mere three phrases. In this line of work, less is more. When it's done right, Seaweed's brand of artsy punk is gleefully adolescent and transparent with enough of a dark side to keep the kids thinking. Betraying its audience with an equally transparent self-righteousness, Seaweed offers little more than a view into its newly dug grave."},{"rating":"1","title":"Applications of Case Study Second Edition","review":"I am a clinical psych. grad. trying to finish a case study dissertation.

I've had mine for a year or so and have had no problems with it. During a long power outage we used the smaller light on it for several hours to light a large room and it was very bright. The spotlight has helped me countless times. I bring it on every trip because not only is it a very bright light it's also a power outlet. I've used the power output on it several times.

After using this light for 3-4 months, the trigger would stop working. Granted, a spot light on my ranch gets somewhat abused in how I use them, they are hanging out the window of a truck in -10 weather, but that should not affect the trigger.3 million candle power is getting to be \\"small\\" these days. There are many other products out there well above 3 million.I have switched to this spotlight:Black and Decker 20 Million Power Series 3335 Lumens Spotlight #VEC192- they seem to have fixed the switch problem (it's a Vector light rebranded) - at least it has not failed on me after more usage than the Vector light listed here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something wrong with switches","review":"The spotlight only works when plugged in but unplugged only the base light works and it does not even flash. Only worked properly for about 2 months or 4 Ten minute uses. Too much money for this light and only 3 million candlepower. Especially, when you can buy 15 million candlepower rechargeables for half the price. I must have just gotten a lemon, because I own other products made by Vector.

I was not a big Lonestar fan until I recently heard their new release ,\\"My Front Porch Looking In\\". They are what I believe is true talent. Their rendition of ,\\"Walking in Memphis\\", is better than the original! Dean Sams defines what a talented and excellent pianist truly is.

It is one of the few CD's that I could listen to non-stop without getting sick of it. When I first listened to \\"I'm Already There\\" with the messages in it, I cried. I don't know anyone over seas, but just listening to that song made me realize how hard it is for the people who do have loved ones in the armed forces. The other songs on this CD won't make you cry, but rather make you smile. The songs are very easy going and very easy to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"A CD that wil NEVER get old","review":"I think that this Cd is awesome. It is a CD that I got months ago and still listen to very often. The great thing about it is because there are so many songs,you never get tired of any. The songs on this CD are sentimental and true. Lonestar's lyrics really make you feel touched and can easily lighten your mood. If you are looking for a CD that is worth your money, this is definetly one to buy. Songs like \\"Tell Her\\", \\"Come Crying to Me\\", and \\"Smile\\" are songs written from the heart. Songs like \\"What About Now \\" and \\"When Your With Me\\" are upbeat songs that are fun and easy to sing along to. Whether you are listening to cheer up or just to have fun, this is the Cd for you. I recommend it to anyone who likes light country. It is definetly worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome CD","review":"I love this CD! I like Lonestar in general but this CD is one of my favorites. I have been listening to it nonstop on a daily basis and have yet to tire of it at all. There is not even one song on it that I don't like, which is rare. The very last track, I'm already there (message from home) is impossible to listen to without crying. What I love about these guys is their values, and that those values show up in their music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done","review":"This album reminds me of how good Lonestar USED to be. The strength of the album, aside from the new songs, is the stuff off their first 3 records. Back when they were real cowboys, they were one kicking band. \\"Amazed\\" gave them the idea that loading up records with power ballads would make them a gazillion dollars, and let them crossover more I guess. Ever since they got all GQ'd out, it's been downhill, in my opinion.However, the new songs suggest that maybe they've figured that out. \\"Front Porch Looking In\\" is a dynamite uptempo hit, circa \\"Runnin Away with My Heart\\" days. \\"I Pray\\" is a decent ballad, nothing more, but certainly nothing less. The remake of Mark Cohn's \\"Walking in Memphis\\" is stunning. It may be the best cover I've EVER heard. I knew I vaguely recognized the lyrics, but they've countrified it, and it sounds great.One piece of advice re: the last song - not everyone who loves your music thinks George Bush is doing the right thing..."},{"rating":"1","title":"from here to there","review":"This is the first time I have had a problem with the quality of an amazon order.

Guitarist Paul \\"Tonka\\" Chapman went on to be iN UFO. With incredible musicianship and stunning production by Roy Thomas Baker (Queen's then producer) and Gary Lyons (RTBs assistant) Lone Star were destined for great things. It is disingenuous when modern day acts re-use names (or use very similar names as is the case here) from the past. The recent Nirvana was not the first, and this is more of the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lone star for Lonestar","review":"Looking at the track list for this album, I was surprised to find \\"No News,\\" a song I liked enough when it came out to pick up the single, but which I had forgotten was Lonestar. A forgivable lapse, since they have since become the Kings of Country Schmaltz (and if I never hear \\"Amazed\\" again it will be too soon). What is not forgivable, however, is the band's destruction of Marc Cohn's \\"Walking In Memphis.\\" Pick up Cohn's self titled album instead, and you'll not only have a vastly superior version of that song, but a vastly superior album in every respect. With regards to this album, we shall have to hope that Lonestar figures out how to bore a hole in their music and let some of the sap out before they get around to releasing Greatest Hits Volume II."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay we need a stricted definition of the word Great","review":"It is a little difficult to put together a \\"Greatest Hit\\" album from a band who hasn't had any great songs. It should be called one good song, a couple mindless songs a a whole slew of soul sucking ballads. The one good song is \\"Tequilla Talking\\" the rest is sluck. And there should be laws against what they did to Mark Cohn's \\"Walking In Memphis.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The new Country","review":"Soulful lyrics. Great songs to slow dance with your lady. Lonestar is a great representation of the current Country superstars.

As I recall there's a blurb on the cover comparing this work with Greil Marcus' brilliant Mystery Train....well, hardly, not even in the same league. Here's a rule of thumb for books on various genre's of music, as you read the volume do you seek out the recordings or performances discussed by the author?

There is also a very coherent message in the book, not just a really credible account of the whole situation.

The good thingabout this cd is bands like Mirzadeh, Noctuary, Wehrwolfe, Born of thorns,Willow Wisp and especially Kekal, who did their respective covers andnot only sounded almost as good as the original, but they added somethingslightly different to make things absorbing.

Rhetorical enthusiasms and historical justifications aside -- although they are difficult to place aside in this book as they appear again and again, ad nauseum -- a reader will have to search to find keys that inspire.So good luck, reader; but remember this: the weight of this volume may prevent you from carrying it with you when awake or asleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stains most fabrics!!","review":"WARNING!

The bad thing is that the replacement cartridge is shorter, the pencil only can contain one lead and to refill you can only load one lead by unscrewing the pencil tip (a step back from the auto feed pencils we are used to now) The stylus did not really work well on my ipod, ipad, or iphone so it was pretty useless. The black ink has run out with moderate usage in about 3 months and the chambers jams occasionally. So whats the upside. well if you don't know that by rotating the pen to different positions will access the pen, or pencil, it seems like magic.

Placing the rear wheel of an adult bike into the stand may damage rear cassette and/or derailer. Would work ok for naked tired, 26\\" and above bikes. Slots are too close together to avoid side-by-side bikes from rubbing against each other.

Most of the pieces were scratched as well.Once I started putting it together I realized that I had two left U's. Flipping over one of the U's works, but the screws will no longer be recessed like they should be. It works, but I am not the only person to have this problem.

To my relief, the pieces were all enclosed, all the correct sizes and shapes, holes lined up, screws fit and the bike fit the stand. I did opt for the free-shipping option so saved more than I had hoped. I was very happy to get what I paid for, with one exception: the rubber caps for the base don't seem to want to stay in place.

No More ADHD examines the ADHD diagnosis and rips it to shreds with facts from the FDA, DEA and other sources. But most importantly, the author takes an unflinching look at the all too real and frightening dangers of the drugs that doctors give children who are labeled ADHD. The psychotic and cardiac symptoms alone should send up big red flags! But the book has answers.

However, the intimate portrayal of Grant in this short book was very interesting to me, and earned the book 4 stars in my mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grant and Twain through Amazon's books","review":"Admittedly I am very fond of Ulysses Grant. He loved and married one of my great great aunts. And I am pretty nuts about Twain too. So it was a wonderful surprise that this book was very interesting, well written, and a wonderful read.

Unfortunately, because of the design of the case, the DVD player couldn't open wide enough for them to see it. It only allowed the player to open about 2/3 of the way to 90 degrees, so the video screen was pointing at the floor. I wound up taking the case that came with the player, that was designed to go over the back of one seat, and rigged a sling to hold it in the middle. Probably a perfectly fine case to carry the thing around with, but awful for using in the car."},{"rating":"1","title":"EXP Power SYNC v USB Cable","review":"I never could get it to work with my computer running Vista.

I recently visted Long Branch, NJ and it got me thinking about the boss again, so I picked it up. I agree with most of the other reviews, the CD itself is not much of an improvement over the original, but the 1975 concert shows Bruce at the top of his game. I wasn't just impressed, I was utterly blown away. Bruce and the band rocked for 2 straight hours. It was one of the tightest, most entertaining shows, I have ever seen. It gave me an even greater respect and appreciation for the man and his legacy.

Don't believe the negative reviews here. These people are angry or even bitter for the wrong reasons. Who cares if it's Sony, the bottom line is this is Bruce Springsteen and he is the greatest live performer in the history of music. Just watch the DVD. He also happens to be one of the greatest songwriters of all time. He still to this day puts all his heart and sould into his music. Save the negative reviews for those who deserve it.

Terrible quality, muddy and inferior to my own mp3's. Sorry I got it. I've had this problem with other Amazon downloads so it might be them but I'll go back to creating my own mp3's if I need them. Too bad, because it kind of PITA.."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't care if you own 10 copies of Born to Run","review":"This is it!!! The release that shows the power of the E Street Band. Seeing them live in 75 is like a dream come true. Amazing from start to finish. If you have recordings of E Street shows from 75, the loose feeling that's usually there is gone. This is a band looking to prove something. They are working to overpower this crowd and they kick it with all cylinders firing. I am talking (of course) about the London Show.If I need to convince anyone that one of the greatest albums ever recorded needs to be heard, I'll give up without bothering. The only question should be is the Box set worth it.ABSOLUTELY!!!Give any old copies of Born to Run to anyone you know who doesn't get it yet, but buy this set.How else can we convince Bruuuuce to give us more of the same?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great record, horrible sound","review":"I am not really a hifi-enthusiast, but there certainly is something wrong with the compression on this remaster.The harmonica in the opening is screeching. And the Boss is hissing all his s'es. I get a headache from listening to the entire record.I thought it was just the way the record sounded originally until I got hold of a second hand copy of the album.

Brian and his band are wonderfully hip and musically eccentric in the rocking tradition of Louis Prima & The Witnesses (\\"Jump, Jive & Wail\\").If you've enjoyed Brian's Christmas renditions in movies like \\"Jingle All The Way\\", or on the Tonight Show, you won't be disappointed. This is one of the most spirited Christmas music presentations to hit DVD in a long time.The entertainment industry is strewn with performers who in later years were never able to duplicate their early success.

I, as well as the other two reviewers of this book, am amazed that such a detailed history of a cultural icon is out of print. This book starts with Burrough's Grandfather and ends with him in his life in Lawrence Kansas. In between, you will find a life that few people could claim to have led, and still be alive well into their 80's. The book also goes into great detail about the lives of the other Beat icons such as Kerouac, Ginsburg, and Cassady. This book is fairly graphic and does not paint a pretty picture of thier lives. If I had read \\"On the Road\\" after reading this book, I might have looked at it in a whole different way. If you can find it, I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average at Best","review":"A very ordinary mystery.

It covers many areas, including writer's block, style, content, tools of the trade, personal and professional writing skills and getting your work published. It is packed full of helpful information taken from the author's own teaching and writing experiences. It's a very readable book, showing that Jan Yager writes as she advises us to. I was particularly interested in her chapter on writer's block, where Jan Yager debunks several myths that keep writers from writing. It is then followed up by several solutions in the form of exercises.

On the good side, the directions were clear and the suggestion for a camo pattern gave this plane a great look.

The savings however was gone after receiving my confirmation e-mail showing I was paying $7.98 to ship controller! This was not shown anywhere before placing my order! Amazon shipped two other items for under $6.00, maybe they need to check their 3rd party vendor's shipping rates before selling their products. You also can't cancel orders with 3rd party vendors!!!

Conlon is a master of free-form verse, and uses it to distill the essence of this heinous event, and build the lives of the main players, to devastating and inspiring effect. Amazingly, what comes through again and again is the ability of humans in the most abject and dire circumstances to experience the bright side of humanity -- joy, pleasure, love, devotion... amidst the Hell that is their lot in life.Conlon is an author who can do no wrong. I'm in awe his prose and his free-verse. No one has engaged my intellect and emotions in quite the way that he has.

I suppose one day I'll stick it in the dvd player again and finish it, but it looks like a home movie/high school play that someone taped at home. Plot isn't much either, I understand they didn't have money, but I kept waiting for something to happen, instead of seeing that fact reiterated over and over again. My favorite xmas movies are White Christmas and the old version of Miracle on 34th street, so I was really hoping this would be something similiar. I was wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice story, painful acting","review":"This story, with its nostalgia-evoking setting and charming premise, could make a holiday staple, but the level of acting will not allow that. To be sure, there is a valid point in the assertion of the \\"A for Effort\\" reviewer, but on the other hand, no amount of allowance for production constraints can gloss over the reality that the actors cannot convince the viewer of anything more than the fact that they are reciting their lines.It's a nice story and the costumes and sets are commendable, but it can't sincerely deliver its message when the acting leaves the characters devoid of authenticity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the purchase","review":"This movie is obviously done by a local town theater.

Sobell's book doesn't cover everything, but the topics he does cover are well presented, clearly written and often cross-referenced in the text itself, which save a lot of frantic paging around to find a forgotten detail.Sobell focuses on basic Linux programming and development, rather than installation, setup, hardware, etc., so his book makes a good companion volume to the \\"sysadmin\\" handbooks on the market, which often come up short on details about the OS language and utilities."},{"rating":"1","title":"only for beginners","review":"This book offers very little hard data for anyone serious about training. It's OK for someone that knows little and is just getting started, but how many people spend $100 for a HR monitor and the book and aren't serious? It offers no workout training schedules, no max heart rate testing, and no sport specific information. It doesn't even use resting heart rate to calculate training zones. I got the feeling that most case studies were on friends and neighbors. No research articles are cited. No alternate viewponts were offered. Even simple concepts such as taking your resting heart rate in the morning are not elaborated on (HOW do you take it in the morning - do you wear your HR monitor all night? Manually count it? It's not as simple as it seems.)It's very friendly and folksey, and would be an OK book to give to your sedendary mother, but isn't for the more serious minded exercizer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miss Adbertised Product","review":"The product was advertised for a 10 - 14 cup coffee maker, it is ONLY a 10 cup - TOO SMALL for 14 cup maker had to take the filter out of the unit and use the OLD filter holder.

I panicked and went to trust Amazon and lo and behold there it was for $13 and change. Bought it and have started using it happily again. Wonderful device when you need to countersink and screw a lot on the same job. Got the original one to help Dad when he was building a wooden sailboat.

It was missing a part (one of the slider blocks) actually instead of two front and two back I had 3 of one and only 1 of another. A phone call to the support line resulted in a replacement a few days later, and I finished assembling my WorkMate. I'd had another B&D WorkMate which I bought probably 30 years ago which ended up with my son. I wish I had the old one back. It wasn't the chintzy piece of crap this one is. The new one is flimsy, hard to crank in and out, and the crank handles won't stay in. It's difficult to fold shut and to open. Every time I used it I have to fight with it.

I had one of these about 15 years ago, and it was great. Hardwood top, well-designed quality parts, worked like a charm and I loved it and used it until I wore it out. But this new version? The top is made of pressed and laminated bamboo instead of hardwood, and it split the moment I attached it to the frame. Right out of the box the frame is bent, and the screw rods are bent so the clamp will not open or close as it should. I could go on and on but the bottom line is, don't waste your money or your time on this cheap Chinese-made piece of junk. If I were Black & Decker, I'd be ashamed to put my name on it much less sell it. I'm returning it as soon as I finish this review.

The whole thing was out of whack and when I tried to bend it so the legs would all touch the ground, (I didn't get them all to touch at the same time) the table was twisted so one side was leaning. Trying to make the table straight and the legs were all out of sorts. The cross braces have two holes for bolts on each side. One fit ok. The second, one side I could only fit one bolt through. There was no way the second was going to fit unless I drilled a hole. It was about an inch off. I thought I would manage with one bolt on that side of the brace, But after getting the thing put together and not getting it to set right I returned it. No money loss, but a lot of my time.

I do agree with the other reviewers here that assembly was complicated. Although the instructions were pretty well written and illustrated, some detailed color photos would have helped. Some of the parts should be labeled to identify the part letter, left, right, top, etc. Also, please supply Philips head screws rather than the 8 slotted screws! It is quite tricky to balance the leg assemblies while attaching the front and rear brackets while simultaneously having to deal with a flat blade screwdriver that easily slips out of the screw slots.After assembly though I am happy.

The holes of the metal supports that hold the legs together (which you'll have to bolt to the legs yourself) did not line up with the holes of the legs! I had to hammer, bend them, and then reverse the direction you insert the bolts to get them in. After all was said and done, as I was installing the handles (which come in two pieces), I realized one of the handles was broken and a piece was missing.Very frustrating to say the least.

It was purchased to replace one the dog punctured in the foot, which had made it unable to hold water. I wanted to get the exact same doll...but there was no size listed on the sale page and I didn't know they came in more than one size since the first one was a gift. I ended up getting the larger one by accident but grandma had a smaller one so now my daughter has 2, a big one and a small one. It would have been nice to know they come in different sizes prior to purchasing and some mention from the seller's listing about which size I was buying would have been nice, too. They're both well loved but beware, they weigh a ton when filled with water! They are also somewhat difficult to fill with water and can be quite messy while filling (you need 3 hands for the job)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommend","review":"All you need to know to plan, buy, install & Maintain your own spa or hot tub.

I hate the boring briefcases and the pseudo professional and ugly totes that most sites bring up when you enter \\"briefcases for women.\\" I decided I needed something practical AND stylish. This bag is just that.While the color is not as bright as in the pictures (more of a dark bone as opposed to bright bone) and the bag is a lot bigger than I thought, the bag is BEAUTIFUL! I have received lots of compliments on the bag, and this is just my first day with it!!I would recommend buying this bag if you're looking for something a little bigger, practical, beautiful, and stylish.

I, however, got a few pages in and found I had no use for it, even though I generally go for just this sort of story. The authors of \\"Great Heart\\" use a novelistic narrative style, filling in from their imagination all manner of little details that they obviously could have no way of knowing. I'm apparently enough of a purist that I want my narratives based on reliable source material, not imagination. When an author begins to fictionalize, how can one ever know where the boundary between fact and fiction lies? This doesn't seem to have bothered most of the reviewers, but you might want to stay away from the book if you're similarly picky."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely the worst stand-up video I've ever seen!","review":"I am a comedy junky and I could not even watch half of this video.

It was reminiscent of the old saw about Oakland. I kept wondering why such an intelligent guy would place himself and his family in harms way in such a godforsaken climate when a person of such obvious talent and connections has almost any location in the world available to him as a place to live.

This book is unfortunately neither of these. The translation is very poor (I assume that it is accurate - it is only the English prose that is poor.) There is virtually no documentation. And the book does not address the history of prostitution per se, only episodes, some of which are more convincing than others.I can only assume most historians are squeamish about this subject, so all credit to Mr. Ringdal for trying.I recommend that readers seeking to learn about the impact of or reaction to prostitution look to more defined histories.

It was the first ballet I danced in as an amateur. But the new version lacks most of the melodic charm that conductor Maxim Shostakovich brought, in his now-out-of-print LP album. This new version is sorta nice, but not at all sparkling. Every ballet teacher in America wanted to have the music.

Then all the suspense and mystery about the hidden files, old secrets, and murder, and who is on the list next, keep us reading on until the finish. There we find an unexpected ending.

As a French person, I really rediscover the place i leave in (it takes place in the Marais). And the characters are so true!

If you like pushing buttons this may be the model for you. I've bought the Garmin c330 unit since (after I returned the ViaMichelin model) and that is working much better for me...much more user friendly and intuitive. I've paid $125 more the entry level Garmin unit but I'm much happier...you do get what you pay for sometimes. The Garmin unit processes faster and does not tell me to take U-turns (which are illegal in my state). For me ViaMichelin=Frown and Garmin=Smile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but not great","review":"The price is right for this little unit and if you are looking for an on-board navigation system this unit is for you. The voice is loud and clear, and the unit is easy to setup and start using quickly.On the downside is that this unit goes to sleep if it is not \\"working\\" for you, so if you just want to see the GPS coordinates change as you drive, pay attention because it will suddenly turn off.Also this unit does not update frequently enough to make it useful in pedestrian mode. Anyone heard of Geo caching? This is not the unit for you if you are looking for a geocaching GPS.The last disappointment of this unit is the cumbersome search for any POI. WalMart should be listed as a POI, and I have yet to find one listed. WalMart and gas stations...what else does anyone need?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Free Range Option","review":"Jsut Got this great Little GPS system and love it!

Hence, we are unable to obtain continuous use in a North South direction.Although the product seems to be satisfactory around Seattle, it is unsatisfactory when driving to and around Vancouver BC.For people living in southern California, it cannot be used in Mexico.Overall, we were disappointed with our purchase.As Michelin, have always, been noted for their travel guides this is a major let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy something more reliable!","review":"This is the WORST GPS unit I've ever seen or used.

My husband has a Magellan system and it is 1000% better than this one! I only wish I had sent the dumb thing back sooner! Do yourself a favor.

I also could not ever get any of the upgrades from their website to load. It wasted a lot of my time, monkeying with it. The fact it was unusable in such a short time, rates it as junk with me. Save yourself from this GPS. It also lacked POI's, did not work well in rural areas, and is not good for any RV uses either. The volume buttons also did not do anything.

Got it overnight with their free shipping (ships from Pennsylvania). I have been using a TomTom GPS for two years, this one is for my wife.Pros: Price, reliability, ease of use. You can place it anywhere in your car (and in my bedroom) and still gets the signal, even under bridges (did not say tunnels). Uses Michelin database, a world leader in travel charts. A big plus is that if you turn it off once you reach the highway, it remembers where you are trying to get to after turning it on again and will resume the directions from where you are now.Cons: A bit slow to calculate and recalculate routes (remember, it is looking at the whole country's map unlike the TomTom that looks just at a region).I was reluctant at first for the price (really) but now it is a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Shooping for One.","review":"Why is it that you can read review after review of GPS street locators, and virtually NO ONE answers the main question: how and where do you obtain map updates for the product, and at what price?After all, it's all about the maps!If you want reviewers to address this matter, you need to say this review helps!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad product, bad support","review":"Pros: light weightCons:1. Map is very outdated (at least 2 years old). Many errors in the area I live (San Jose, CA). It told me to take a U turn where it was prohibited. It also once told me to take a left turn against the traffic on a divided street.2. Some address could not be saved. It always showed up as another address when you tried to navigate to it.3. Guidance is especially confusing when entering and exiting highway. For example, on a two-lane highway exit, one for straight and left turn, and the other to the right. It showed right turn on display, but said \\"continue straight ahead\\".4. Slow re-routing.Bottom line: this kit should be used with caution and good judgement due to the inaccurate map and sometime confusing voice guidance.Update: after serval months of use, I would change my rating to 1 star if I can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great GPS for the Money!","review":"Have been using this GPS for about a month now. I really love it. The first week, it helped me navigate my way around D.C while on a business trip. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 was that it doesn't calculate the route until you start driving. But, this may be the case with others as well, as this is the only navigation system I've used.

(I studied it at college in England.) In saying that, it is a very accurate, exhaustive and intense description of SSADM and makes for difficult understanding if you're starting from scratch learning design methodologies. I found it very difficult to apply the methods to real-life situations. For those of you out there with at least some experience in a 'real' development environment, you'll probably absorb this book readily.

Singer and writer Jorge Villamiz honed his vocal technique. Sinverguenza takes Bacilos to a new level of music-making. Some songs on this album offer social commentary, others are about human relationships. No two songs are alike. It is impossible to determine which will be radio hits, as all offer something unique. This album is a leap forward for Bacilos in music making. This is a much better, mature, and talented group than in their previous album. If you liked their previous album, or if you just like great modern latin music, buy this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Step Backwards","review":"I think Bacilos would be well-served to go back to the drawing board. This album sounds like they did not put the work in to write some excellent songs; the music's sound is not very memorable, the lyrics aren't very memorable, and it's almost as if they just changed the words from bad songs from their previous albums to make this one. I saw them in concert in Virginia, and unfortunately they were so caught up in promoting their albums that they played two of their most famous songs two or three times, and alienated a number of fans there who were previously Bacilos-lovers (and emerged as more impressed with upstarts such as CABAS). So, I agree with the other reviewer that rated this CD a bust. Save your money for emerging latin rock stars such as Locos Por Juana, rather than a Bacilos that is not putting its best effort forwards."},{"rating":"1","title":"MUY MAL CD!!!","review":"Nada nuevo ofrece el grupo BACILOS.

I bought one for hunting purposes and frankly was disappointed in the insulating ability of this cap. In my experience, the wind was able to penetrate the cap fairly easily making my head feel cold. Doing some research, I found that 100% acrylic caps are great for ACTIVE outdoor use, because they wick perspiration from the scalp and hair. However, in terms of insulating quality, these pale in comparison to a blended wool or 100% wool cap. Wool is a great insulator, so if maximum warmth is required for stationary activities outdoors, this is NOT the cap you want to purchase. Go for a (highgram) thinsulate or 100% wool stocking cap instead.

Their new security measures have changed me from a repeat customer to someone who's going to buy a competitive product without microsofts customer unfriendly security measures.

After that I realized that I needed the product key that came with the software. Activating the MSN Direct Receiver is also problematic telling me that the version of the software doesn't support it. (Huh? They came in the same box!) Online subscription-ware is something that makes life difficult for me. I rely on the GPS capability when traveling and if I have to reinstall on the road this is going to be problematic. Plus, I simply don't like 'activation'.

Jackson and Morgan Freeman, Bogle takes us on an wonderfully detailed journey that chronicles the contributions of Black actors/actresses in film. Of course, Bogle's book includes those well-known films from the bygone era, but he also notes those little known films that featured Blacks playing roles that, in most instances, were the stereotypical tom and mammy, but allowed Blacks to at least get a foot in the door to make inroads to the current day Hollywood.

It makes no sense to me why Linksys would take the feature away in the RV Series routers."},{"rating":"2","title":"When Entry-Level Routers Won't Do Anymore...","review":"We bought this to combine two different ISP feeds - from the telco and cable company. The router was easy to set up and works fine. Installation and configuration were quick and easy to understand. There are also more routing, IP control and traffic filtering options than in lower-end routers.This is too much router for use in the average home with a handful of people.

The dual WAN, IPSec VPN, firewall and price were the features that sold me and as a relatively savvy VPN user, I figured I could tough it out. Boy was I wrong. This device delivers decent router performance but I couldn't get the QuickVPN software to work at all with Vista clients. The documentation is incomplete and is especially not useful for those who're new to VPN administration. Even after hours of research online and numerous tech support calls I still couldn't get the QuickVPN working, so I gave up on it and switched to another, more configurable IPSec VPN application. This did get the VPN going, and it seems stable so far, but it's annoying and disappointing that it wouldn't work right out of the box."},{"rating":"1","title":"RV082 Versions are Misleading","review":"I purchased a brand new RV082 yesterday and set it up. Once it was online I went to the Cisco website to download the latest firmware but when I went to install the firmware I kept getting connection errors. After digging through some forums it turns out that the version of the RV082 that I ended up with was V2 rather than the newer V3 so apparently the new firmware cannot be installed on my router. The ONLY way to figure out if you have a V2 or V3 router is by looking at the sticker on the device so you actually need to purchase it and open it before you would ever know. Now I am stuck with a brand new router that will no longer have supported firmware. This is highly misleading."},{"rating":"1","title":"QuickVPN doesn't work","review":"I bought this router to replace my Netgeart FVS318 that was fried when we got hit by lightning. The VPN utility that came with that was too hard for the average user to configure, so the Linksys and QuickVPN utility looked good. Unfortunately the QuickVPN doesn't work, and spent quit a lot of time with Linksys tech support and still no luck. So if you're looking at this for the ease of VPN with QuickVPN, you may want to consider something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont buy this one","review":"several other reviews on different websites concur, this router is no good. it drops off the internet, you end up resetting it every time you want to login, firmware doesn't fix the problem and many frustrating hours later we sent it back. the best thing about this router is if you buy it from amazon, they are the best at returns and being helpful. bravo amazon.. booo cisco."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this product if you have 2 DSL lines from the same broadband supplier","review":"I ordered this network router for my home office.

I have discovered that Cisco/Linksys who made this product have falsely advrtised this product and I am requesting return and refund. They advertise that this VPN router can load balance two DSL lines. It cannot do that from the same DSL provider which they do not document anywhere.

However, do be aware that the case doesn't provide for an external strobe of any sort (not that the S330 works with one anyway), which means you'll need good lighting to get decent photos.I also do recommend very strictly following its instructions for use to prevent leaks, including testing out in a bucket or shallow water and immediately rinsing / cleaning the case after a swim or dive.

There will be some redundancy and it is time consuming but your brain will handle it all better. If you already can read Hebrew letters, then you can skip step #1. This is a well constructed book with passages from the book of Ruth as well as old children's fairy tales translated into hebrew for your learning pleasure.

Most of the ones I looked up were correct.-The text is not consistant with using accent marks. The primer tells you about accents and when introducing words it will show a accent mark but from then on there is no accent mark.

It was VALIDATING to read about just how much other guys (and gals) like me, feel the way I do. It was also inspiring to know that 'guys like me' who aren't supposed to get their hearts broken (you know... studs :-)), are the most prone to suicide. Whether this is true or not... didn't matter. the point is I was validated for feeling aweful and feeling ashamed of myself on top of that. The book really takes a dive after about chapter two. The techniques here are out of date, old-fashioned, and hurtful to both parties. I never did get 'over' the person involved; not with this book anyway. Try out 'how to survive the loss of a love' instead by Bloomfield: Much better stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Letting Go","review":"It seemed tangenial and non-specific bit not as good and detailed as the other books I have read on this subject for my group.

It didn't help but I would not part with the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shocking and Necessary","review":"It's hard to believe that companies and individuals can still get away with this extraordinarily misogynist behavior, but Murphy and Graff have done the legwork and the math to prove not only that they do, but how they do it and how we can begin to put an end to it. This book should be mandatory reading for anyone who is or loves a woman or girl and believes that women should be treated with basic human decency (and paid that way, too)."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Important Book","review":"Smart, provocative, well-researched and wonderfully written, this book is completely persuasive.

If you cry baby girls want to make money than don't have babies, don't get into a relationship that doesn't allow you to travel, work long hours, and relocate. I'm sick of women who want it all then complain about it to everyone who don't care.

This is undisputedly the greatest AOR album of all time. For hours after the first listen, I was trying to figure out how a godly masterpiece like this was made by mere mortals . Credit to Ron Nevision Too! . It is unfortunate that Icon didnt have more albums or never made it big but I'm glad that I got to experience the greatness of their Masterpiece \\"Night of the Crime\\".P.S: SCR3W The H8rs"},{"rating":"1","title":"Still Lame Over 20 Years Later","review":"This album is terrible. Cheesy songs! \\"Naked Eyes\\", \\"Hungry for Love\\"... hello? WTF -- I remember how we all anticipated this follow up to their self-titled debut. Complete shock when Night of the Crime\\" came out. Icon sold out big time on their sophomore release and it didn't work. Radio completely ingnored it. I think I heard \\"Whites of Their Eyes\\" on KUPD once. And that was it for this stinker of an album. It was quickly forgotten.Their self-titled debut,Icon, rocked! It was one of my faves from 1984. But Night of the Crime is a bore. Save your money unless you're a diehard 80's rock collector."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame, sell-out sophomore effort","review":"Their debut release, ICON, was a straight-forward rocker, with tons of talent and possibilities... Night of the Crime sees Icon totally trying to get air time on the radio waves, which proved disastrous for them. Not only did they sell-out to mainstream pressure, they sucked at it!!!I highly recommend getting their first release, but stay away from this one as well as their next, Straight Between the Eyes, which is even worse!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entelligent Hard Rock at its Best","review":"Icon's debut album showcased the band's talent and knack for writing in a style similar to Dokken, but <u>Night of the Crime</u> is their pinnacle of creativity. It is a concept album(except for two songs) that tells a story of murder and love played out in strong, well-crafted songs. The music maybe more pop-oriented than their debut, but one doesn't mind after hearing tracks like \\"Danger Calling\\" or \\"Out for Blood.\\" The vocals sound not unlike that of Paul Stanley and the music is out of this world! It is hard to believe that this album and band did not become huge in the 80's, because Night of the Crime is one hell of a hard rock album. Trust me. There are not very many CD's that I would rate five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Hard rock releases from the 80's","review":"This album is a little more polished than the debut. But it still rocks. The band matures on \\"Night of the Crime\\". Their songwriting vastly improves. Every song on this Cd is great, trust me. From the opening track, Naked Eyes, you see that the sound of the production is wonderful and the band uses more keyboards this time around. But the guitar work is better than ever and vocals are big and powerful. Dan Wexler was one of the most underrated guitarists of the 80's. The best songs on the CD are all of them.....but my favorites are Naked eyes, Danger calling, Shot at my heart, Frozen tears and Hungry for love. If you like great songwriting, great production and power rock...then pick up this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"the first act","review":"the history of the first act of the Ypres battle is well narrated .

I've given it a few weeks now and come to the conclusion that the scent is way too weak. No one ever notices it so it's impossible to get a compliment. And I even have a hard time smelling it on myself after an hour or so. I've even tested with friends and they can't smell it on me without sticking their nose in my neck. Since the sole purpose of cologne is to make you smell good to others for a while, I'd say Canali is a FAIL in this respect. I've since bought some other cologne and am thinking donating this stuff or throwing it away. If you're looking for a stronger really good scent, try Pasha de Cartier for Men or Bvlgari Man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liked enough to order a second time!","review":"I usually become sort of bored with a scent over time and want to try something else. This is the first time I have wanted to replace with the same scent.

Thanks and we appreciate free shipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fragrance without being overbearing","review":"I'm not a guy who wears cologne or after shave on a daily basis. Usually my wife will hope that I'll splash some on when we go on a big date. But that only happens once or twice a year (just joking honey). But seriously, my wife brought me home one of those tiny sample tubes of Canali and I really enjoyed the scent. So did she. Win-Win. I ordered some shortly thereafter.To put things in perspective, my last bottle of eau de toilette was Calvin Klein One that I bought about 6 years ago. I -just- used it up recently. So when I say I'm not a huge user of men's fragrances, I mean it. But the Canali I do like and will venture to say I'll use it more often than I've used other colognes in the past.It's a well-balanced scent, not too sweet, not too spicy.It smells great, comes in a cool looking bottle and isn't priced in the stratosphere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"The product description said this book would have \\"Potions for all purposes\\".

Jarvi has solid, colorful, and full-bodied sound and a closely-knit, disciplined orchestral ensemble> His powerful, organic performance is one that holds up very well. It's true that Bernstein's slightly broader and more expansive recording is overall even better; by comparison Jarvi seems just a bit stiff and overly driven.

I searched the internet for something to cover my camera for our outdoor Alaska shots. I couldn't find anything to fit with my longer lens. The Tenba RC-18 is very thin for $40. It is probably about $5 worth of material. It has a few velcro closures but of course NO instructions on how to best adapt it to your camera. I've already had to break out my sewing machine to stitch more velcro on the nylon fabric to seal it up more. I would not recommened the Tenba product because of its' oversized, thin, poorly constructed material. The picture shown of this item is probably custom fit from a professional. Definitely not something that you can use right out of the box!

It came in a flimsy padded envelope, without the usual Skagen watch box. When I opened it, the watch had obvious defects in the strap (the leather was wrinkled and discolored). It was advertised as a new in the box product, not used or defective. I have requested a return authorization # as per their instructions, and because it was not my fault, I asked for a UPS prepaid label to return it to them. Also, I now notice that the company only offers replacements, if it is defective. That's not fair. So far, no response from customer service, though. I probably will never order from them and tell my friends and family not to either...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Travel Book Ever!!!","review":"This book is amazing.

Although I did not need them there seem very few words for some of the Asian languages. Dondero needs to get this proofed by native speakers. You will be mostly understood but do as I say and get a friendly local to correct their section. Your book will come away from your trip as changed as you are!Good on Dondero for trying, it's a fabulous concept that seems to have simply been rushed to the publisher too soon.Maria"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bare without the essentials","review":"I found this book to be more of a guideline to have a chatty conversation with a stranger rather than a necessity for travel.

Unless you are going to devote your time seriously to learn to the brim of fluency you will be wasting your time. Learning a foreign language takes time and dedication.

I became more clear in my directions to my mare and she began understanding what I actually wanted. She became more confident and successful with every exercise I did. I don't have training help, so this book pretty much saved me from turning this mare into a broodmare. She now enjoys the tasks I ask of her, and is a joy to ride. Over the winter, I taught her and her pasture mate how to play with a large blue rubber ball.

It has not disappointed. Stephen brings reggae into the \\"new\\" millennium. The beats are just fantastic. His lyrics are heartfelt. What's so funny to me is that I'm not even a die-hard reggae fan. Nor do I purchase a lot of reggae. But this album seems to modernize reggae while still maintaining the dancehall/roots flavors without feeling/sounding out-dated. It shouldn't be surprising that in a couple of songs he does sound like his dad, but he has that right. But the rest of the album is just Stephen coming through. He also doesn't overdo it with too many \\"guests\\". I was never a Ziggy fan. I think Stephen's style is better than Ziggy. With proper marketing, Stephen could quite possibly introduce another whole generation of people to reggae. If you like a little reggae, you'll love this album.

How did they live? In what ways were they trending towards our definition of human? Instead, this book is about the various field researchers, how they found the earliest fossils of our hominid ancestors, and their petty squabbles. It's a bit depressing and ironic: Here we are, trying to solve the mystery of our origins and money, fame, and ego inform the whole thing. It's been 6+ million years and we're still big apes in suits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scientists showing their dark sides....","review":"Ann Gibbons has given us a well-written presentation of the dubious doings of some of the big names in modern anthropology, shown in their efforts to out-do one another in the race to discover (and exploit) the fossils of man's oldest ancestors.

A highly-recommended read."},{"rating":"1","title":"What About The Hominids?","review":"This book centers entirely too much on the anthropologists themselves. Its mostly about their perils, hardships, personalities, and petty squabbles. What about the hominids. It jumps all over the place and never gives any real overview. Also, its too expensive. It was a HUGE disappointment. I read over half of it before I came to the conclusion that it was never really going to discuss the subject matter indicated by the title.

What is philosophy? What is the specific object of that human science?2. There is so many theories, so many thinkers... who is wrong, who is not?3. Is there any theory of phylosophy? A philosophy of philosophy (or: a metaphilosophy)?And one day you read Hegel's Phenomenology (it is not SO hard to understand!), but the answers for those questions are there. And if you understand this book, then you will need the Science of Logic.PS. Plato is Hegel's master here. Do you know the \\"Parmenides\\"? This is the main key!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A dubious landmark","review":"Before you get overawed by his reputation, its worth remembering that a healthy portion of philosophers, especially in the English speaking world, think that Hegel wrote a lot of nonsense, and its historical influence, in my opinion, is not overwhelmingly positive. I've been suspicious of it ever sense I wrote what I thought was a fairly dubious paper on its first section and yet still got an A on it. A lot of the prose reads like some sort of Burroughs-esque prank. Most contemporary analytic philosophy thinks early philosophers were too ambitious in gaining elaborate knowledge through reason alone, but Hegel seems to think they basically weren't ambitious enough. Essentially, if you channeled the rationalists through a megalomaniac, you might get something like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phenomenal Arrogance","review":"This book stands as the ne plus ultra of western philosophical arrogance.The basic problem that philosophers of Hegel's ilk can't accept is very simple-the world just cannot be analysed!! especially in neat little parcels like absolute spirit and absolute will etc.I mean if you even take something as basic as quantum physics-this tells us that with all the greatest apparatus at our disposal the very basic blocks of matter are unknowable in any absolute sense and that the defining fact of the universe if any is actually Chaos!Forget this book and read someone much more aware like Nietzche or even some Zen Buddhist tracts which revel in the beauty of man's inability to know anything rational and therfore celebrate his beautiful irrationality and spirit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turgid Translation of Classic Text","review":"It's too bad the translater was drunk when he wrote this book. Poor spelling, grammatical errors, and American idioms, i.e., \\"... which let the cat out of the bag...\\", unnecessarily cloud the shimmering beauty of Hegel's poetry.

Much of what Hegel is attempting to accomplish in this piece is break down Kantian categories and give them new dimensionality. In the German, for instance, Hegel uses the word \\"sein\\" (being) in various constructions brilliantly woven together to help the reader pick at the different linguistic formulations of what it means \\"to be\\". Unfortunately, Miller has given no clues to the reader to get to Hegel's meaning in the German, and instead often come across as bizarre instead of piercing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take my pulse, please","review":"Phenomenology of Spirit is not a book to be tossed aside lightly; it should be hurled with great force.

Horowitz's principal trait, as former student Byron Janis so aptly puts it, is his \\"divine inconsistency\\" - the gift of total nervous control at the keyboard wedded with a prismatic tonal palette. The mercurial soundscapes of Scriabin's etudes mesh perfectly with Horowitz's own flightiness. He whips the \\"Affannato\\" Op. 42., No.5 into a storm, the siren line of the arioso borne over volutes of seething bass notes. Amazing!The second half of the recital is dominated by the blockbuster Rachmaninoff Sonata #2, recorded live in Carnegie hall.The sound is very good. Essential fare for inveterate romantics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horowitz at his most masterful and tasteful","review":"This is a must-have CD for anyone who loves the great writers of Russian romantic piano pieces. Horowitz's thunderous rendition of Rachmaninoff's incredible and difficult B-flat Sonata, done at the peak of his powers in the 1960s, is in my opinion virtually without peer in the realm of virtuoso pianism. It follows and contrasts nicely with the delicate and beautiful Medtner \\"Fairy Tale\\", a song which I had never even heard of prior to buying this CD; now it's one of my favorites as well.

Have the guts to print less that gushing reviews!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!!","review":"I am a technical writer and webmaster and it's my job to help people in our department with web pages and cgi scripts. Many of them have asked for a recommendation on what book would be helpful. I reviewed this book for that purpose and was amazed at how poorly written it is!! They are obviously NOT writers and honestly must have thrown this together over a weekend. Unless you already know what they're talking about,this will make matters worse. And if you already know what they're talking about, you don't need it. So far, my favorite intro book is \\"Perl and CGI for the World Wide Web\\" by Elizabeth Castro. Several on our staff are now using it and finding it very helpful, straightforward, not too much detail...etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Examples need proofreading","review":"I bought this book for an online course. If I were trying to use it on my own, without input from other people in the course, I don't think I'd be able to use it. The examples vary from the explanations in the book; for example, in Chapter 5, Figure 5.3 tells you, when editing the $cntfile line of the configuration block of the vcount.cgi script, to \\"Be sure to enclose all of this in *single* quotation marks....\\" However, the example on the CD has everything in that line in *double* quotation marks. I'm not a programmer, and don't know whether this actually makes a difference (the script tests out fine in Telnet, but I have yet to make it work on a page), but this isn't the first discrepancy I've found in the examples, and it's very confusing.Also (and this is a minor thing), the plastic CD pocket in the back of the book was glued in backwards so I had to cut the CD out of it with a razor blade. Altogether, I'm finding this book to be more of an annoyance than it's worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing for those who want to learn anything...","review":"I purchased the book for a CGI class I had taken - the code that it includes does definitely work, and the book is well written. However, if you want to learn anything about actually writing CGI code, this will not help at all. It includes multiple scrips that you can modify, and teaches how to modify, but doesn't say anything on how it works or how to re-create any of the processes in the scripts. For those who don't know how to write CGI, and don't want to learn, this is great...but for those who want to learn how to create the code, this book's not for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Coffee Maker","review":"This coffee maker was great, the first two or three times we used it. What could be better than having two travel mugs that you can make at the same time? Well, if you look at the design, the spouts come out each side, and they're connected by a bubble, which is lower than the spouts. So of course after a couple times using it, the coffee no longer went into the cups, but instead started dripping to the bubble, and right down in between the two cups. We deal with that by only brewing one cup at a time now.Our problem now? The mugs are plastic lined with Stainless Shells. There is a small notch in the bottom of the plastic, which is glued into the base of the Stainless area. After it's been heated up and cooled down a few times during brewing, the glue melts, and the liners start popping out of the shell. Then when trying to push them back in, the glue breaks and makes the problem worse. I would definitely recommend getting a different coffee maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strangely poor quality","review":"Garden Boy And Girl Bench This garden statue is coated with what appears to be cheap yellowish latex paint, which started to peel off after only a few days outside.

I just cannot imagine the leader of a homicide investigation sending a newspaper reporter along with one of her detectives to another town to look at the first real clue to the killer's identity. And she told him about it herself! And to not report to the team when she received what were obviously personal threats at her home. Really!The main character is not well drawn, I did not find a woman who was so weak in her personal life believable as a top homicide detective. Some of the other characters were quite cliched, with no real depth drawn to them.The physical scenes were well drawn and described, but I feel Ms Prospero needs to do a lot more work on her plotlines and characters in future.

A glance at the illustrations would lead one to believe it was a book for young children, however the text, though brief, utilizes vocabulary (intersect, aggressive) and concepts, like ratios, more suitable for older children or adults. I intend to use the book as a quick introduction/ illustration for design concepts with middle school and high school students and think it will work well for that, but if one is looking for in depth discussion, for older students, or suitable vocabulary for younger, this might not be your best bet."},{"rating":"2","title":"doesn't wash","review":"Can't believe a high powered woman exec would give up all to move to the wilderness - all for good sex"},{"rating":"2","title":"Whitewater Fun!","review":"I have been a Kim Baldwin fan from the begining and Whitewater is just another reason to enjoy this excellent writer!

Opeth's signer Mikael Akerfeldt shows his ability to grow like the devil and change it to a anglelic like voice filled with emotion and without flaw! also the guitars are beautiful, so are the lyrics, and the drums are pretty well structured. to be more accurate, the whole band is well structured. if you love melodic death metal, good acoustics, and harmonizing voices, then definently check out this band, with this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the best","review":"ever sence I discovered opeth ive been dazed with there works mixing jazz, classical, and of course tradtional black and death metal to form a great style all there own.

The general consensus seems to be that most people like this one best. I love this cd but there are certain things that strike me funny. For me the vocals in some of the songs are way to proggy for my taste (some of the chorasus like on \\"the moor\\" and \\"godhead's lament\\"). Still an awesome album my favorite song are \\"face of melinda\\" and Serenity painted death."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just a cd, an experience.","review":"Wow this cd is awesome. It's fine classical guitar segments are nice and humble. Then it explodes into its full rock session. These guys are truely incredible musicians. They play ferociously and press onforth. The moor is one of the single-handedly most awesome tracks I have ever heard. The rest of the cd is great, but you should buy this cd alone just for the first track. Number three is also a standout, just in its differences between the rest of the cd. Beautiful song. Get this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warning! If you're trying to be cool, you won't like Opeth.","review":"Another good album by one of my favorite bands. Although there is some debate on how to catagorize them I'll try to sum it up: Black Metal w/ some Death Metal vocals, some Thrash/Speed Metal drums & guitar work (amongst other styles). The softer side is slightly Spanish influenced/Old World acoustic with hauntingly beautiful vocals. Most songs start out in one genre but shift to between 2 to 4 different styles. Some long songs.. up to 10 or 11 minutes. Great music for the rock enthusist that has at least 1/2 a brain, a heart and one good ear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just listen!","review":"I'm not going to list 100 reasons why you should buy this album (though I could) nor will I tell you what each song sounds like and is about. Just listen and you will understand. This album (for right now anyway) is my favorite Opeth album, but that changes more than I change my underwear. The only thing I didn't like is the pauses that were placed between the tracks. One of the songs (I can't remember which) was supposed to start immediately after the other, but they put that damn pause which makes the transition kind of awkward. That being said, you still shouldn't sleep on the special edition with the DVD the 5.1 surround makes it all worth while."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfection","review":"In my opinion. Opeth's best album hands down which is hard to say since all of their albums are amazing, but there is something different about this album. Not only are all the songs catchy but the entire album tells a story. a \\"Concept Album\\" if you will. I'm not gonna go into details and make this review two pages long. But the story telling lyrics added to the songs is just mind boggling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular, but not without flaws","review":"Well, hit with another stellar album from these guys. I'd like to mention Opeth has progressed incredibly with each album. What they lacked in structure and flow with albums such as Orchid and Morningrise, is no longer apparent with Still Life. Everything on this album flows pretty well, aside from some shoddy production. The lyrics are highly poetic and the vocals are incredible. Mikael Arkfeldt definitely has one of the most hypnotizing voices I've heard. Unfortunately, flaws do exist. First of all, Opeth's tendency to draw things out is once again present. Long songs are not necessarily bad, but with this album, Opeth takes too long to make a statement. Aside from that, the bass parts are lacking (at least in comparison to Morningrise), and Benighted is quite possibly one of the worst Opeth songs I've heard. For a treat, I recommend \\"Face of Melinda\\" (Killer riffs in this tune) and \\"White Cluster\\". I'd also like to mention Opeth is not for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"A beautiful album, with mind-bending riffs, and a stunning combination of clean and death vocals.

These drops didn't make his eyes worse but not any better either. They may have provided a little lubrication for his eyes but his cataracts are still advancing because he is almost 13 years old. I know that we all hope that these eye drops which costs about $100 would take the place of eye surgery which runs into the thousands but you might have better results than me. I have used the drops for over 3 weeks. The bottle when shaken drips on its top and is a little messy and you waste valuable liquid. They need to design a better bottle."},{"rating":"2","title":"An alternative to surgery","review":"We have a 13 year old lab who had developed serious vision problems. She wouldn't even play with the other dogs in the woods on our hikes anymore as she stayed very close so that she could keep sight of her owners. After about a month of using ocluvet, her sight was improved to a degree that she was again able to run in the woods with the other dogs without the fear of losing sight of the pack. It really did change her life.If she was younger we would probably go ahead and get the surgery. But she is nearing the end of her life and we don't want to do invasive surgery at her advanced age. Ocluvet gave her that little bit boost she needed to end her time in relative comfort, and we are thankful for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad bottle design, isn't working","review":"First off, it's as if the makers designed this bottle to waste as many drops as possible. With the pricethey're charging, that's a major problem. Every time I shake it (with the top on) drops STILL come out the top and dribble down the bottle. I wonder how much $ I just wasted. When I try to put the drops in my dogs eyes, more drops come out and dribble down the bottle or squirt on to their faces. No, I'm not squeezing hard or anything, I'm just holding the bottle upside down. I was using Petvision, which has a good bottle that measure out a drop at a time. My dog was starting to see things (she had gone completely blind). We were both excited! Thinking Ocluvet must be better because it had studies backing it, and was more expensive, I switched. In just three days she's back to bumping into everything and walking around with that dazed look.

I used the whole bottle, as directed, (oh, and by the way, the bottle leaks like crazy) and my dog is still blind as a bat. This product may work, but not for my dog.

However they misrepresent themselves as fact, which they are not.Both stories are, in the literal sense, incredible. They have been thoughroughly debunked as highly embellished accounts of the actual events by a number of reliable sources, including Peter Radcliffe - the Regimental Sergeant Major of 22 SAS at the time of the first Gulf war (1991). In Ratcliffe's book 'The Eye of The Storm' - written under his own name - he points out a number of 'issues' with both books, and the fact that neither concurr in a number of important areas with the very detailed de-brief of the men after the operation.If you want fact not fiction, buy Radcliff's book, as well as 'SAS Operation Oman' by Colonel Tony Jeapes former SAS Commanding Officer during the Oman campaign of the early to mid 1970s."},{"rating":"1","title":"ultimate praise for men like Ryan.","review":"tough man, and great fortitude, which is not discovered by 'selection' alone.orienteering and navigational experience saved Ryan's life, without which he would probably not have survived this conflict, although judging from my chair that is a harsh opinion.He did make some bad decisions, especially trying to avoid the goat herder, he and the dentist should have grabbed the situation by the root canal,but you couldn't hear me whilst i was reading it 7 years later!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sour Grapes","review":"Can you say sour grapes?

I wasn't expecting Shakespeare, but Mr. Ryan should have been edited a little more thoroughly.It is, however, a truly amazing story. And I'm impressed and happy that Mr. Ryan survived his ordeal; but he should have stuck with the whole truth, warts and all, instead of engaging in that truth-twisting style that we all used with our parents when were 13 or 14: you leave out the bits that make you sound bad and you expand on the bits that make you sound good.At the end of the day reading this book is like meeting Mr. Ryan in a pub at 1 in the morning: he doesn't express himself very clearly, he slurs every now and then and he exagerates like a fisherman telling the tale of the \\"one that got away.\\" How appropriate!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An example of human survival at extreme conditions.","review":"I simply got hooked to his text. Not because it would've been written to be action-paced or filled with excitement, but because it gives quite clear picture of how you feel and suffer when you're left alone in the desert with inappropriate equipment and information.I didn't notice any misplaced quilt accusations, what would've not been correct. Chris blamed himself as he blamed the others.A must read for people who're interested in true stories of SAS warfare and hows it handled, but this time not so correctly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fact or fiction","review":"Fact or fiction,in my opinion lots of fiction. Who am I to tell,well I had some questions after having read, The One That Got Away ,as well as B2Z by McNab.The questions have all been answered by,The Real B2Z(Asher),Eye of the Storm(Ratcliffe) and finally in the very good SOLDIER FIVE by Mike Coburn, the fifth surviving member of the patrol."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEAUTIFUL","review":"This is a beautiful item. It makes a wonderful gift or if you want something nice for yourself. The price is right.Thank you Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"fast paced and action packed thriller","review":"This book is awesome! I highly recommend this fast paced, action packed series for older children and adults alike. The series includes a total of 6 books and I could not put them down once I started. This book belonged to my son and I just happened to pick it up one day and started reading it. After reading book 1, I had to finish the entire series. This book is about two teenage siblings on the run from the FBI and some \\"other\\" bad guys to prove the innocence of their parents. The brother and sister break out of an orphanage and the excitement begins. They show bravery and determination and will not stop until they get answers. They must get their parents out of prison for a crime they did not commit before it is too late. After reading this, Korman has become one of my most favorite children's authors. There are several very good books by Korman including the \\"Everest\\" series and \\"39 Clues\\". Happy reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seemed really stupid to me...","review":"Take this advice from a kid- This book stinks. The whole thing is just... stupid. I didn't like the constant third-person complaining. To be honest, a lot of people have it worse than just having their parents in jail!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Teacher's comment","review":"This book disappeared off my classroom library shelf last year. I tell my students that the book is really boring until about chapter 13 (really it's closer to 17, but anything to keep them reading), then it gets really edge of your seat exciting. Then I watch. It generally takes them 1 week to read the 1st book then 1 week to read the next 5. Some will even read the next series \\"Kidnapped\\" that continues the story one year later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chasing The Falconer","review":"Gordon Korman was born October 23, 1963 in Montreal, Ouebec in Canada. He wrote his first book, This Can't be Happening at Macdonald Hall when he was 12. Since then he has published more than 20 books. Also, he has won several awards of young adult titles for his books.I think this is a good book, because I can understand what is happening in the plot and I can almost predict what will happen next. This book is talking about Aidan and Meg running away from the Falconer and trying to find Uncle Frank. This book is interesting and exciting and I would recommend it to anyone who likes mysteries and adventures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Following the falconers","review":"After Darcy Quinlin finds out her mother has breast cancer, she is deeply saddened and in disbelief. She is also loosing her sister, Adel, to Barry Sorensen, a soldier in Vietnam. Above all that, there is J.T. who pushes her around especially when she falls hard for Pastor Jim's brother-in-law, Jason, who just moved to Connors. Darcy needs comfort and someone to talk to about boys, feelings, and school problems and her mother can't be that person. Neither can Adel because she is moving far away with Barry. Her mother did leave a beautiful garden that Darcy takes care of and it helps her through her many situations now and to come.I liked this book because it was different from other Lurlene McDaniel books. In this book the girl doesn't have cancer, like in many other books, it's her mother. Also, this book is set in the 1970's during the Vietnam War.I would recommend this book to teenage girls who like sad, loving stories or like other Lurlene McDaniel books."},{"rating":"2","title":"On the Run","review":"This is a fast paced story that will keep readers wanting to turn pages. Some background knowledge is required in the beginning. The vivid verbs used by Korman create a video in your head for many of the scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome rockabilly!!!!","review":"This is one of my all-time favorite CDs!Johnny Dollar recorded some of the wildest rockabilly of the '50's.(Favorite song-\\"Green Eyed Cat\\")If you love rockabilly,do not hesitate to order this disc.You won't be disappointed.Highly reccommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Case Study","review":"Both books that I have received that are written by Robert Yin helped me immensely in re-writing my methods section in my dissertation. Since I was new to case study research and this section was the major flaw in my dissertation, it helped me complete an intelligible and methodologically correct research design and methods section. Excellent compliment to all of the case study research books by Robert Yin."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sun Ra Orchestra: Pringtime in Chicago","review":"Stay away from this production. The performances are uninspired and the sound quality is dismal. A total dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't what I was looking for...","review":"This book was not what I was looking for. The first third of the book rehashes the benefits of natural living and offers information that is of little value to anyone who has even a cursory knowledge of such things. The actual method for detoxing was broken into three levels which would seem easy to follow, but the book is terribly disorganized. There were three types of detox: body, mind, spirit. It would be much more helpful to systematically organize the book using the levels rather than the different types of detox.I did appreciate some of the advice offered in the \\"Mind Detox\\" section, but would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"I have read \\"Blue Moon\\" and \\"Stone Heart\\" by Luanne Rice and found \\"Home Fires\\" just as interesting. I loved following the relationship between Tom & Anne. I love how Luanne Rice writes about romance but also about family. Her books are interesting and hard to put down. I am currently reading \\"Cloud Nine\\" and look forward to finding some of her out-of-print titles. If you are looking for a good read on a cool night, on the beach or a rainy day I suggest \\"Home Fires\\" or any other Luanne Rice book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rebuilding","review":"Anne, a successful jet-setting artist, returns to her family home after the tragic death of her young daughter and the demise of her marriage. There she meets Thomas, a local fire fighter, who has also been scarred by the death of a wife that he loved. Together they explore their grief and loss, sharing their wounds.The local community have their opinions on their attachment to each other, Anne's sister Gabrielle and her husband have their own problems with their marriage and their rebellious daughter.Finally Anne realises she has more to offer than her loss and rebuilds her strong ties to her sister, her niece and when her husband realises that he wants her back, Anne begins to see the world and her place in it in a different light."},{"rating":"2","title":"Page turner","review":"This is a page turner. My third Luanne Rice book...I can't get enough of her! She is a gem! After I've read all of Danielle Steel, and Oprah's books...she's a breath of fresh air.So much fun to read. And as much as I enjoy Ms. Steel, her books are slowly declining in content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Curl up with this....and fall asleep....","review":"After reading Ms.Rice's \\"Cloud Nine\\" and \\"Blue Moon\\", I was disappointed in this novel. I found the characters uninteresting and the plot slow and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had to skip parts just to get through it.","review":"The book has a very intriguing premise--two people who suffered horrible loss finding each other. I tried hard to like it because I admire people who endure hardship without becoming bitter, but I never felt drawn into the story. For me, the author does too much telling in describing her characters, repeating facts again and again, without much showing of the characters' natures. It seemed as if the author was forcing the story instead of allowing it to unfold for the reader, which left me \\"uninvested\\" in their plights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book!","review":"Luanne Rice has clearly and touchingly depicted two scarred people, Dev, literally and Anne, figuratively. Their coming together was fiercely romantic and satisfying. The ending (I don't want to give it away) is finely wrought and you feel for all of the protagonists. Better than 4 stars - I would give it nearly 5 if that option were available!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this","review":"I hated this music and sent it back.

It is very misleading to show a photo of the group and not just one ball. Regardless of what the description says--the photo is a misrepresentation of what you are selling. And with the cost of shipping, I think it would be safe to simply assume that it was a set of balls.I also must say that one of the reviews had a very rude comment back from the seller. Way to go--you've managed to be not only ignorant yourself, but also immature and. What's the expression? \\"the customer is always right?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"DON'T BUY","review":"This ad is extremely misleading.

Instead of having 75 classic movies from the Fox library, we get at least 50 classics and 25 mediocre movies just to fill the set.

In addition, the cream smells awesome. Each time the jar is opened it smells as good as the first time. However I doubt it reduces or removes wrinkles. I have been using this for over six months. I guess by keeping the skin moist, it prevents dryness and hence the appearance of wrinkles. Overall a good moisturizing product."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Hoot!","review":"This is a thouroughly enjoyable book! I frequently found myself laughing out loud.

The romance doesn't hurt either! Way to go Sandra! Just keep them coming and yes, you can still keep writing about the Vikings and Navy Seals...there are many more we look forward to, as in young Jaimie, the off spring of Rurik,The Blue Viking and Maire.

This story starts out where the movie left off, but soon flashes back to reveal the life of Dr. Brackish Okun, and how he came to head the research at Area 51. Although this book lacks the thrills of the original Independence Day, it more than makes up for it with the new and briliant theories about our alien \\"friends.\\" If you are at all interested in UFO technology and/or the association between alien visitation and natural occurences, then this story is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The prequel that never was....","review":"The book Slient Zone by Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich attempted to relive the past of the reality created in Independence Day, the smash-hit movie. The action in this title was somewhat lacking after the thrills we all experienced while watching the movie, but it shows the originating ideas behind the movie and throws in a few spicy twists. Building on the Roswell incident some time ago, this book expanded on the ideas present in our minds of what really happened in Roswell. It also showed a \\"history\\" of why the aliens came to earth in the first place, and what their goals actually were. This book was a little bit expensive for my tastes, but it proved to be one of the best books I've read in a long while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Piecing the clues together","review":"\\"Silent Zone\\" is an entertaining story of how a small group of scientists pieced together clues about alien plans to invade the Earth. I didn't expect much from the story, because, well, everyone knows how it ends. But the authors take some well known UFO folklore and they weave a good story using some interesting characters. Part of the reason this book works for me is I kept picturing \\"Data\\" as the funky lead character Dr. Okun.If you like good \\"alien visits/attacks earth\\" themes, try the \\"Rama\\" series by Arthur C. Clarke, \\"The Other End of Time\\" by Frederik Pohl (sequel due out in November) or the classic \\"Ender's Game\\" series by Orson Scott Card"},{"rating":"2","title":"OK, but not what I expected.","review":"ID4: Silent Zone was a very good novel, but the action was a bit lacking.

We've all seen the movie, but I was curious to find out how it all started.The book centers around Dr. Okun, and how he became involved with Area 51, and the trials he goes through finding the clues to the alien invaders.This book is a nice addition to the movie, and can't wait the read \\"War in the desert.\\"If anyone has a used hardcover of the book Independence Day: War in the Desert, they can sell me, please email me at rking@king7.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"Book gives honest look at real life","review":"This book is a great show of how American people are in reality. Reading this book has been enjoyable as well as informative. As a journalist, I cannot imagine the amount of effort it must have taken to get the types of interviews done in this book accomplished. I feel like I know the person after I read their chapter. It is definitely worth the time and money. Gig is one of my most valuable books."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Interesting Look at Jobs You'll Never Have","review":"This book is basically a collection of stories told about certain jobs, told by people that work them. The individual stories are translated into a monologue and give you a sense of someone telling you how it is without a filter.I found it pretty neat to read about certain aspects of jobs -- how people find gratification in what might otherwise be a demeaning job or the complexity and stress involved in different jobs. It kind of gives you an idea of what your bus driver or customer service rep may go through. In some cases, you wish for a followup to see if people attained the goals they mention in the book.It's good to read in short bursts. All in all, the story of the American workplace can be a compelling one, but like all jobs it can be a little boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read!","review":"People from every walk of life talk about their jobs, their lives. The pieces read like very short - short stories - but they're true! Funny, sad, wonderful, heartening. I really enjoyed this book!I find myself going back to re-read the interviews. This is really a fantastic book. Great reading for bedtime, on the plane, or anytime at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"An insightful inside look at a variety of jobs","review":"Gig consists of over 125 chapters of Americans talking about their jobs. Gig covers a wide spread of jobs, from McDonald's Crew Member to CEO. Each chapter is about 3-5 pages long, and is written in the first-person exactly as it was told to the editors. Each person shares how they got into their job, what their daily routine consists of, how they feel about their job, and some juicy inside information. This is a great book for anyone who is looking to begin a career, make a career change, or anyone who thinks their job sucks. Gig gives you honest insight to almost any job you could think of. After reading the story of a Slaughterhouse Human Resources Director (\\"I hire them and they leave\\"), you might not think your job is so bad after all. The short chapters make the book easy to open up to any spot and just start reading, but they also make the book hard to put down.

Many facts are simply wrong, the least of which is the discussion about the rituals of Hinduism.Anyone who reads any of Franklin Graham's books must not take a single word of the discussion of other religions seriously, for his books are filled from cover to cover with blatant and gratuitous religious intolerance.Instead of this book, I recommend reading Voltaire's Treatise on Tolerance, ISBN: 0521649692"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring Biography","review":"This biography by Franklin Graham is inspirational and interesting.Graham, who is the son of Billy Graham and Ruth Bell Graham, grew up as a bit of a rebel. This is the story of how his life turned around and he began serving God after years of running from him.Although his rebellion was pretty tame by today's standards (smoking, drinking, and defying authority primarily), it was pretty significant for the eldest son of the world's most famous evangelist.Franklin Graham matured to become a significant force for good in his own right - and in a different way from his famous father. Franklin has been the head of Samaritan's Purse, a Christian relief organization, for many years.I would recommmend this biography for anyone who is interested in an inspiring story of a fine Christian man."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"God Room?\\"","review":"Skittish about reaching out to claim others for Christ? Rebel With A Cause, by Franklin Graham, son of Billy Graham, appeared to be an out-and-out rebel. However, his mother and father never ceased praying for him. It's not easy to grow up being the offspring of a famoes person, especially a famoes evangelist.Franklin's redeeming character trait, his craving adventure, led him into helping others before he had any desire to follow Christ. Thanks to the individuals who mentored his life, his Lord and Savior wooed him to His side, and he became a mighty power for God.When he questioned a friend concerning a seemingly impossible undertaking, the friend counseled him to go ahead and do it. Bewildered, he asked, How?The friend replied, \\"God room.\\"As a result, an incredible number of \\"impossible\\" endeavors were accomplished, including getting Bibles and tracts, written in Arabic, into Saudi Arabia, a definite no-no, all because of \\"God room.\\"How about trying \\"God room\\" yourself?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for teens ESPECIALLY!!!","review":"This book is about the life of Franklin Graham and the struggles he went through being the son of the world's greatest evangelist billy graham.

What bothers me is what it failed to deliver. From the title, I expected the character to have been powerfully affected by his intimate and personal relationship with Anne, and for it to be discussed more. The character, however, spends more time talking about his solitary sexual experiences than the affection he supposededly shared with the girl in the title. Instead of being a story of lost love, it is a basic and general holocaust survivor story, and we already have plenty of those in fiction, and even more in non-fiction. I never once had the impression while reading the book that this Peter really loved Anne."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left out the things that I thought would have made this book worth reading,","review":"such as what did Peter experience in the camps, more insight to his struggles before and after liberation.

This copy came from Amazon at list price at the time. The distortion at even minimum volumes is I believe intolerable. It's not there in the original LP.

How about Poulenc reading from his own sheet music?! - he doesn't know his own piano concerto by heart! Don't you wish you could have hung out with him?

His mentioning and warnings about fundamentalism are indeed important as not only are we fighting Islamic fundamentalists, but Christian ones in our own country who want to degrade public education, oppress certain minorities and restrict freedom of the press and speech.Martin Gardner is still a national treasure and will be sorely missed when he passes on.

In this articulate, logical, and compelling book, Johnson moves past the arguments of the Jesus Movement and demonstrates how a divinely inspired New Testament focuses on a risen, living Christ. Johnson's book is a dynamic blueprint for understanding Christian living in the twenty-first century. In flowing prose, he shows us the diversity and richness of the gospels that have been seen one-dimensionally for such a long time. Johnson's scholarship is of the highest caliber and is used here to show what is truly at the heart of the Christian tradition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Living Jesus steps outside the Icon","review":"LIVING JESUS is both timely and pertinent to the times we live in. Johnson has provided a book that asks questions outside of the historical mileu. Like Patton's inspiring \\"THE Autobiography\\", Johnson accepts the viewpoint that Jesus had and has relevance outside of the classic Religious Icon. Although less direct than the \\"THE Autobiography\\", Living Jesus addresses the present consciousness and asks how we can live with the presence of Jesus in the twentieth century. Although some points are labored, the essence of this text is stimulating and emminently readable.

Can we find out who the real murderer was. The book was a good read, it got better toward the end. Paulette was a monster, she knew all the tricks and trades of being a gold digger. I do think Paulette and her mother was due some money from the will, but it's sad that Paulette had to steal to get the money. And Max was out for his self, he didnt love anyone but his self, so I hope in part two, he get what he deserves. Now Chris, our downlow brother, why wont brothers like him just say they are gay, stop screwing women and men at the same time. Nasty just plain nasty. Im glad Reese woke up and realized that she had a son who loved her. Lauren finally found true love and Gillian finally became a star.

I recommend it to anyone looking for an easy to read, but still intersesting adventure book. THE BIG PROBLEM; I'm 10 years old, and it took me a few hours to finish. I bought it at a bookstore in the mall and spent the rest of my time there trying to read and walk at the same time.The characters are smart, funny, fairly realistic people. I say \\"fairly realistic\\" because 11 year old Meg recurrently uses phrases such as \\"Lets blow this popsicle stand\\" and \\"Bro\\", which I doubt any 11 yearold girl would say to her older brother. This I know, as I have one myself (and I'm a girl). I have already preordered Now You See Them Now You Don't, #3.I am also very interested in Harry Potter an Lemony Snicket's books.

Unfortunately it falls into the 'glad it wasn't expensive' category. It's a nice interest book to add to a collection given the name of the author, but I was expecting some fairly efficient self defense techniques. I found the ones in the book weren't that. In most cases if you could implement the technique shown there'd be a lot quicker ways to have got the same result."},{"rating":"2","title":"A CLASSIC","review":"Great WW2 CQB from the great Jack Dempsey!

The fact that Hawaiians got screwed out of most of their country, is ignored, as is the massive genocide of Californian Native Americans.What's most striking to me, though, is the utter lack of vision- McDougall utterly doesn't anticipate the rapid rise of China, (who \\"always slays itself\\") nor the torpor of present day Japan.McDougall's also quite ignorant about how things haven't really changed in Japan (the power centers are still pretty much what they were during the war, only now, they're just not militarisitc.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loving the Past","review":"Ever since I first watched this movie over 45 years ago I have loved the music.

I found Lesley Warren to be an excellent Cinderella, although she lacked the depth and range of Julie Andrews. Stuart Damon as the prince is tops,and I found the haunting \\"Loneliness of evening\\". It is too bad that the technology we have today and have had since the 60's wasnt around when the original was done... all that remains other than the recordings are some fuzzy clips of Andrew's production.

The orchestrations by Johnny Green based on orchestrations by R. Bennett put Richard Rodgers' sentimental tunes to best advantage with a full overture, a waltz for the ball and more. The \\"South Pacific\\" rejected tune \\"Loneliness of Evening\\" is dusted off and works beautifully as a song for the Prince (Stuart Damon). Lesley Ann Warren is the perfect fragile heroine.

Some of the songs here were played on the two beautiful music stations in Chicago, which my father played daily.King of Kings is a good addition to add value to the CD.My favorites are:Theme From 'Elvira Madigan', Theme From 'The Mercenaries', This Is My Song From 'A Countess From Hong Kong', I Will Wait For You From 'The Umbrellas Of Cherbourg', Irina From 'Shalako',A Man And A Woman, and Love Theme From 'Ben Hur'.I am grateful that Dutton Vocalion brought these recordings back.

Mathews is also the same guy who insulted Al Gore, who's done so much for the environment.

Golly, I didn't even know the difference between perimenopause, menopause, and postmenopause let alone all the symptoms that I have (and will) experience. I was surprised in the review by razzjones who said it didn't answer any of her questions. She must not have read this book because it answered ALL my questions and then some.

It never makes it from one summer to the next without black mold -- you can see it though the vinyl.After a short time, it also begins to leak throught the stopper.It's a shame because I am still looking a solution for both human and critter to this problem of being hot while sleeping in the hot summer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great, but leaks eventually","review":"I have purchased at least 3 or 4 of these for my dog.

The laser is easily visible in daylight from 50ft (I didn't try further, but I'm sure it would be fine at 100ft).Even though the instructions are only a single page, they are easily understood. They include a simple chart to match O-rings to calibers.One thing to pay attention to is the need for oiling the o-rings before inserting the boresighter. The o-rings are a tight fit (which is good), so the oil ensures better insertion / removal (giggity).My two complaints are that the 1.77 (air gun) shaft doesn't quite fit tight, and that the container tube they include doesn't fit all the parts in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seemed like it was too good to be true and it was.","review":"Great concept.

SCOTT PECK, MD. EASY READ, BUT REDUNDANT THROUGHOUT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big problems","review":"I am a fan of Scott Peck's work - however there is a problem with this book: he leans on the writings of Malachi Martin. Since the publication of the memoir by Time magazine's Robert Blair Kaiser (\\"Clerical Error: A True Story\\", Continuum International Publishing Group, 2002) there are good reasons to doubt much of what was previously believed to be known about the lifelong liar Malachi Martin, and certainly to be suspicious of his \\"factual\\" writings (see a useful comment below for more).So as a result \\"Glimpses of the Devil\\" is a very flawed book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very little Exorcism, Too much about Dr. Peck","review":"There is very little about the two exorcisms Dr Peck has preformed. Also, the book is centered entirely around himself and his role in very aspect of theraphy and exorcisms. In the first chapter, Dr Peck explains his often long distance relationship to Malachi Martin- to whom introduced Peck into Exorcism. Although interesting as a start, there is little left.The problem with this book is that he doesn't focus enough on the actual exorcism itself nor the people behind them as much as he should. One patient was molested by her step father and Dr Peck spends little time in the book and with the patient about this occurence. In this instance he wants to blame the victim because she should have known her father wasn;t a real doctor.This is only on example. I really think that anyone interested in exorcism from a relgious or psychological standpoint should not bother with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Terribly Sad...","review":"How terribly sad that Mr. Peck has become everything he so eloquently preached against in \\"The Road Less Traveled.\\" With the publication of this book it's clear that he has, heartbreakingly, failed to attain the psychological & spiritual growth that he once held so hopeful for humanity. This book speaks to the destructive, soul-destroying power of patriarchal, authoritarian, rigid religious systems & beliefs. He seems to have completely forgotten the fact that \\"in order to see evil, we must be evil\\" - that we cannot see something in another unless it is within us. After his appearance on the Oprah show several years ago I knew that something was terribly wrong. From \\"The Road Less Traveled\\" to \\"Glimpses of the Devil\\" his life is a chilling illustration of the deterioration of the human soul - from the best of humanity to the worst. It almost seems as if he's been possesed..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I agree with most of the reviewers above who think this book is hogwash. As someone else noted, the book starts out strong but there is no payoff at the end.As someone with Borderline Personality Disorder and a few other mental illnesses AND a Christian, I think this book is irresponsible. Peck says he thought \\"Jersey\\" might be a touch schizophrenic. A touch? You're either schizophrenic or your not. There is no in between. Someone might have psychotic tendencies; also, some who are bipolar can appear schizo but you think a psychiatrist like Peck would already know that.In my opinion I don't think possession is real because I don't believe demons can cross over into this plane because if they could we'd all be possessed. Especially the extremely wicked. People have minds of their own and that's where the devil comes into play..in your MIND, not your body."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's official.","review":"It's official now, M. Scott Peck was delusional. He believed in demon possession and conducted exorcisms with his psychiatric patients. His belief in the supernatural blinded him to the real explanations for mental illness and lead him to commit malpractice with his patients. While christianists and other gullible supernaturalists will love this account, the great majority of readers will simply find it comical. If America is in decline, it is because most Americans cannot deal with reality and instead seek comfort in medieval tales of demons and exorcists."},{"rating":"1","title":"maybe, too simple.","review":"This book is good in its own right.

However, I must give it a poor review based soley on its title: Practically every photograph in this book is of a purple flower. There are only a handful that I would even generously call blue. What's worse is that several of the species, such as Delphinium where I know there are pure blue varieties, are depicted with purple varieties.

Maybe they can have the live recording, with some of the songs recorded in a studio to give it a \\"clean\\" listen. I still give this recording a 5 - star rating, but I want people to be aware that this is a live recording, recorded in a studio built in the theater where Woman in White was performed for the opening night performance in London (very, unique and special).

The author sticts to what is actually known about Judy and demonstrates her points with lots of photos, documents, facts, quotes. Not for fans of tabloids or trash tv, that's for sure.

He has been in love with her for 10 years but because of the curse was unable to be near her without being tempted. Then they get thrown together and its great because he was the only on that she has ever wanted and always compares every suitor to him. The stubborn sexual attraction they feel for eachother just ignites out of the book and you can't wait for them to be truly honest with eachother and let them know how the other feels. I think it was a great book, and the hopeless romantic in me loves the waiting that they have done for eachother, along with their reactions of their physical contact :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly acceptable on the beach with a beverage","review":"It takes far too many chapters to get to the heart of this story. There is way too much back story, and not enough action and \\"interaction.\\" It's obviously evocative of \\"The Taming of the Shrew,\\" but Cole should have stuck closer to the proven plot winner. I easily skipped whole chapters without losing track of the convoluted story.This is a dubious purchase, possibly acceptable on the beach with a frosty beverage.Since I already ordered No. 3, I hope it's a better book, although Ethan and his \\"little French blonde\\" don't sound like a fun couple.Note to the author and her publisher: Slow down your fast-paced publication schedule & take more time with your writing--and proofreading.

A little. But you can't have a romance without a HEA. I liked the struggle and sexual tention Cole builds so well between characters.

OK - I'm not the best gift giver, but these baking sheets are outstanding. Check sizes when shopping, because lesser priced sheets often are not full sized. Then there's the construction. The 1mm commercial quality steel means these sheets will hold up well to any household use.

Oddly, I am told becuse the generator is hazardous I cannot return it through normal routes, and Amazon will contact me with a resolution. For now, until they get this issue resolved, I would suggest waiting on this. It seems to be a constant issue that would be EASILY preventable by the insertion of styrofoam blocks inside to support the generator while its in transit. The shear weight of the motor and dynamo overwhelm the mounts and in my case, the actual motor itself cracked and tore free. This is a simple case of trying to save 4$ on foam, and I guarantee that more than that has been wasted on return postage.Dont buy until I post an update that Amazon has remedied its \\"you cant return this, its hazardous material\\" issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"My First Generator","review":"The Blue Max 4000 arrived in what I would describe as rough condition; however, I accepted it. There were no obvious defects once I opened the package. Upon more careful inspection, however, I found a defect that appeared to have originated at the factory, and Amazon was fair in making it right.There were no problems preparing the BM4000 for running in. The instructions were fine. I put a half gallon of gas in the tank, turned on the gas, and choked; but it didn't start. Why? I forgot to turn on the switch. After that procedural defect was corrected, BM has started on the first pull every time. The electrical production was excellent.I have no problems with the quality of workmanship, none whatsoever. It was a good buy, and I'm ready for the next hurricane. I elected not to buy the handle/wheels accessory. I use furniture slides, and they work just fine.Amazon's handling of the shipping, etc. was excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value for the money - bad packaging for shipping","review":"My thoughts are similar to many others: It is a good value for the money, it runs very quiet, starts easily and will be a good emergency generator. Documentation is poor, shipping carton is worse. Mine came with the air filter cover broken. I immediately emailed amazon as well as homier. Homier couldn't find my order and amazon says the part is not available separately. This is in spite of several other posters saying they got replacement parts. Amazon did offer to ship me another generator, which is kind of a pain or I would have done it. But the funniest thing is they asked if I wanted another generator or would I accept a 10% credit, then went ahead and processed the credit before I answered! I'm taking the credit just to be done with it, but wanted to warn others if there is more serious damage you will want to get a replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the money","review":"My first generator was delivered with some minor damage and the seller had it picked up and immediately had another on shipped.

We had tremendous winds that knocked the power out to almost 300k homes. I got mine in a day thanks to Amazon Prime! Added oil and filled the tank and it started on the first pull. It has almost a weeks worth of running on it and the only complaint I have is that is appears to be using a little oil I don't know if that is to be expected? Some oil use during a break in period may be part of the process, but I do know the low oil shutoff works. It's too bad there isn't a light to tell you why it shut down.I used this little guy for a couple of days and it was loaned to a friend for 4 more. No problems other than the oil being low on two occasions. Like I said, this may be part of the break in process.Once I get it home I plan to drain the current oil out and replace with synthetic oil and run it some more as a test. We don't lose power that often, but when we do I'll be ready."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Excellent generator. It is easy to turn on not very noisy and extremely dependable. I use it as a back up for my fridge and some power tools and would recommend it. Its not too big and fairly easy to move.It has a run time of about a day and half.

I think its one of the best deals out there for under $300 I dont think you can go wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Tool!","review":"Bought this just before hurricane Ike hit Houston. Starts with one pull and runs like a champ. Didn't get to use it for the house supply, as we left town, but used it for power tools to clean up yards after our return.As in other reviews, it ran quieter than expected but had no damage from shipping. It's a terrific unit and easy to operate. Used a funnel with a flexible hose to add exactly 1 pint of oil with no mess. Attached wheel kit with cute little pneumatic tires for convenience. The handle that comes with the wheel kit is totally useless, though. After assembly, you can only pull the handle end of the generator straight up, but you cannot walk with it or pull it that way. Someone needs to rethink the handle design. The generator was great - had 500 more kilowatts than my brother-in-law's generator and got it $100 cheaper! Bigger toys mean more points, right?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't beat the quality for the price...","review":"This was a great deal.

It was purchased as an emergency power source for my sump pump and a couple space heaters. Virtually no setup (except for wheel kit which isn't mandatory); just add oil and gas and pull the starter. Started first try each time. Workmanship isn't top of the line: oil dipstick stripped itself first time screwing it back in, choke lever flimsy, etc. But I'm happy for what I paid.

I also will be using it for my ac in my camper. It's not to shabby at all. (4/24/08) Ran 6000 btu AC in camper for 10 hours on one tank of fuel .....Love This Generator.

I can't find parts anywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Little Generator!","review":"I've had this since 2008, when I bought it to run my sump pump in the event of a power outage. I run it once a month to keep everything clean, and just changed the oil for the first time. It kept things going during Irene, the recent NE snowstorm, and a recent 8 hour power failure. Reliable, but a bit noisy, but when I have it running at night, I want to be able to hear it so I know it is still working. If you don't have a generator and you have a basement that could flood, without at least a battery backup, you are a fool. Get one of these, or something like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly great for the price!","review":"Great generator! Started on the first pull after adding oil and gas. Ran my RV air conditioner and kept the battery charged for a long weekend of camping. On a full tank of gas and topped up oil, it ran about 12 hours straight. Changing the oil was a breeze after the weekend use, but be sure to get a flexible funnel for adding oil, as the fill hole is in a slightly tricky location. Using an adapter, my 30 Amp RV plug stayed cool. The large muffler made this one of the quieter generators in the park, and for the price, I can't beat it. Fedex delivered and set it carefully on the ground, then my son dragged it into the garage, so the packaging was sufficient."},{"rating":"2","title":"First pull!","review":"I am very pleased with this purchase.

Amazon quickly sent me a different one and yesterday the replacement arrived. I looked it over real closely and this one also had a broken motor mount. They are made of aluminum and the generators are probably being set down too hard, The thin aluminum can't handle the shock, which is odd since the generator should vibrate from running. Anyway, Amazon has said they would have it picked up and issue a refund since it is a reoccuring thing.

Terry Amann relates his experiences ministering to a man charged with the murder of his girlfriend. Rev.

This is a classic tale of a man at his lowest, finding new strength from the Bible to face the consequences of his actions when it would be so easy to hide in the shadows of denial and pursue further exploits in self-destruction.

Watching paint dry, perhaps with a cup of coffee.

The declining arc of her subsequent career moves leads me to wonder where her talent lay. Journalism? TV? Now she's spinning for the MPD.

She hasn't been able to pop out another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"I was interested for the first few chapters, and then completely lost interest, which is crazy because I find the whole Dahmer story very intriguing. She talks far too much about journalism and what the police went through rather than telling about what was going on with Dahmer during all this, and it just seemed to me like she was bragging about being a good journalist who was in with the cops and that she was married to one. It took me weeks to read it just because I kept having to force myself to go on reading about all these things when I just wanted to know more about the man himself. She went to far off topic, it read like an extremely long drawn out newspaper article, and I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expanded Newspaper Articles","review":"This manages to make Dahmer's macabre story boring by stiffly recounting the tale in chronological fashion. The writer, a cop's wife and a Milwaukee newspaper reporter who was first on the scene, doesn't really have the skill to write a full length book. She needed a ghost writer to make the facts come alive. It reads like a long and dull newspaper article. With so many better accounts on the market, don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor telling of Dahmer's story","review":"I would not recommend this book at all. It seems to me that this author used the book to brag that she's married to a cop and has an inside scoop on everything instead of using it to tell us the story of Dahmer.

The author is a native Shanghaise who left China with her family when she was ten-years-old. The book is a travel narrative written in the early 1980's. Pan is a witty and incisive observer of her own people; she resembles V.S. Naipaul in many ways. Having lived in China for two years I found her portrait (although now dated) precise.

Well, too bad I didn't recall my oath. \\"Heartstopper\\" is a serial killer type novel which drags on and on, with needless loose dialogue and very little suspense. A family relocates from upper NY to Florida when the dad has an online affair. The premise is weak and the wronged wife is even weaker. The students she teaches are all sterotypes and not worth a second look. I easily put down this book and only finished it by skimming. I figured out fairly easily half way through (in spite of obvious 'clues' to mislead the reader) who the killer was and I hate that. I do NOT want to figure out who done it. So many better writers out there, that I am sorry to say Joy Fielding must be resting on her earlier laurels. A shame. She is totally boring.

The variety of characters and the quick speed of the story line, helps to ensure that you don't guess \\"who dunnit\\" until the very end. A fun, quick read, perfect to pack to take with you on vacation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Predictable, but good","review":"Within the first few chapters I figured out who the killer was.

I started it one day and just couldn't put it down. All along I was trying to guess who did it and was very surprised. A really wonderful book!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent suspenseful read-great work!","review":"Heartstopper is centered around a certain group of high school kids. There has been trouble in Terrance Florida when girls disappear suddenly, and Liana Martin is found dead. The book begins with the killer trapping Liana inside a room and then shattering her body to pieces soon after. Sandy Crosbie, the english teacher is deeply concerned for her daughter Megan. Sandy and her kids moved from Rochester New York after a bitter divorce from her doctor husband. They thought it would be great place to live with her new teaching position at the school until the murders started happening beginning with Liann and continuing.Sheriff John Weber tries to solve the case, but doesn't have any real leads. It seems this male killer is covering his tracks very well. It is not until near the end that a big surprise is in store. And Megan almost gets killed along with her boyfriend Greg."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliche all the way","review":"While I always support women authors, Fielding's book was just too stereotypically predictable that I didn't even finish it.

The printing is so light it is hard to see the words. at first, I thought it was maybe just a few pages, but the whold book is like that! They were surely low on ink when it was printedJ!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!!!","review":"This is the 3rd Joy Fielding book I have read in the last month and I love them all! Heartstopper, however, was the most enjoyable so far, because she got me at the end, but good! I have read a lot of mystery/thrillers over the years and usually can deduce the villain before the end, but she got me with this one. I love when that happens! Can hardly wait until more are available on Kindle! I'm on my 4th and the last that I can get now, but have requested a bunch more. Why have I not found you until now?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable","review":"Predictable is how I'd describe \\"Heartstopper,\\" and that's a word I'd never use ordinarily when describing a Joy Fielding novel. I knew who the killer was fairly early on; I kept thinking, \\"I always think I know who it is when reading her books, but I always end up shocked.\\" Well that didn't happen with this book. Maybe it's because I've read so many of her books, and that now they're starting to turn out the same. I didn't find myself as eager to turn the pages of this one as I have with some of her other books. It was even somewhat of a chore. She has definitely written better books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the book","review":"I am reviewing the MP3 audio version of this book. Unfortunately, I couldn't get beyond the 4th chapter of this book due to the narrator's (Judith West) interpretation of the various characters. They were terrible. I will eventually read this in print form as I am a real fan of Ms Fielding's novels. But when I found myself 'tsk'ing and rolling my eyes with each overly-emoted word coming out of the speakers, I decided I didn't need to waste my time this way - I have other audiobooks."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL","review":"Boy, did this book grab me! From the first paragraph to the last sentence it was just fabulous! I've read many of Joy Fieldin's books, but I must say this was my absolute favorite. What great characters, and plot, and.....well everything! Definitely would recommend this book highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mindnumbing","review":"I have to agree with most of the negative reviews. Though I won't give away the ending, and I admit I did keep reading to see whether I was right, I figured out whodunnit by about the second or third chapter. It seemed to me like Ms. Fielding honestly felt that the revelation would be a huge shocker to her readers.If you enjoy Danielle Steel's cliched and hackneyed writing style, you might enjoy this book. If you're the cynical type who thinks there aren't any honest, upstanding, good guys out there, you might enjoy the male characters in this book. If you enjoy alliterations, you might enjoy the many samples of it in this book - and you'll enjoy the way each and every sample is pointed out as such.As for myself, I think I'd rather read a riveting railroad schedule that recommend this revolting book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pop goes the accordion","review":"In 1969, the biggest selling artist in Canada was not a folkie or long-haried rock and roller.

It's depiction of Indian history is completely and utterly false. Check the statement that Indian civilization was influnced by Mesopotamia (which started around 6000-4000BCE) than check Indian civilization which started around (8000BCE). How can Mesopotamian civilization influence Indian civilization, if according to the book, Indian cilization started 2000 years before Mesopotamia? Should it not be the other way round? All these thinking came from MaCaulay's bias of a great civilization and Max Muller's obedience to Macaulay. Please write a better book with some true substance. Stop teaching kids false history."},{"rating":"1","title":"The unenlightened","review":"The authors try to use math and logic to explain coincidences, which is of a realm that math nor logic can always explain. There are other types of intelligences that the logical (rational) mind have no authority or insight in trying to explain. The authors also attributes traits of the conscious mind to intuition and either confuses the two or disguises the logical mind as intuition . Their arguments are like symbolic logic used by lawyers, which are designed to be ambiguous, unless you are wise enough to detect their deceitfulness or naivety or unenlightenment whether deliberate or unwittingly.I love math and I did well in it, but I am also a creative person. The creative/intuitive and the rational/logical sides of our brains have to work in unison. One is not more important than the other. They each have their own functions. Using either of them in their extremes can be detrimental to the person's overall health (mental, physical, psychological, emotional.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT a movie","review":"This is a video of a boring lecture by Jason Martell who is speaking from a lecturn.

Though reviews were mixed, some people seemed very satisfied with this set. The chips might be alright, but I never opened them. The box the case came in looked like it might have been stowed unprotected on the deck of the container ship. The plastic feet on the case were all broken when I removed it from the box. The latches didn't look like they'd hold up, posing a significant risk that the chips would eventually end up all over the sidewalk somewhere. There is a plastic insert that holds the chips, cards etc. This is made of the thinnest material imaginable, much thinner than a plastic take-out container. It was already cracked and crumbling in many places. So I returned it. The chips may be fine, but you'll likely need something else to store them in."},{"rating":"2","title":"broken case, replaced, now happy!","review":"like some of the other posts, i too received a defective case. the problem i think is the case comes in a tightly fitted box from the manufacturer, but is shipped in an Amazon box which is much larger in size. there were a couple of airpads to help cushion the inner box from moving around, but this is HEAVY so i am sure it slammed around inside the outer box which in turn broke the inside of the case. anyway, i emailed the manufacturer, received a response in 24 hrs, and they shipped a brand new case directly to me at no cost. the replacement was perfect. i am happy now. the quality on this set is not great, but for occasional use with friends you will be VERY happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fragile damaged case","review":"The case is very fragile, very cheap, chip holders inside are paper-like and not firm, the case came damaged both inside and outside, Amazon offered only 25% refund to compensate for the damage or to return for full refund, I had to spend time returning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very happy with this purchase","review":"We bought this with some apprehension, since we could not see or feel the chips, but we are very happy with it. They are a great weight, and it is fun to handle the chips. Compact case is great because they store nicely and don't flop around inside.

The texture isn't quite right, the weight isn't anywhere near 11.5g according to my scale, there's small scratches and burrs and bumps on some of the chips from poor production quality. The tray thing doesn't fit quite right--it's flimsy (and came cracked) and you can see the aluminum through the edges.I don't expect anything special when I pay under $40, but the fact that the listed weight is incorrect makes me feel like I got cheated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Quality for The Money","review":"I bought this set for a poker tournament I got roped into hosting. I had never hosted a poker tournament before although I've played in a few. After reading reviews for the Fat Cat set I decided to give it a try. I was very happy with my purchase. The metal case is solid enough to take light abuse and does a good job of wrangling these chips. The chips themselves are of great weight and solid quality.The set includes big and little blind chips as well as a dealer chip and a pack of cards.

I'm kind of an occasional poker player so I didn't want to spend a lot of money on chips, but I wanted something kind of nice for when my buddies come over to play. I was a little sceptical after reading some of the reviews, but the price was certainly right on this set. When I unpacked the set, I was totally blown away by the quality. A much nicer set than some of my friends have for half the price they paid. Everything was in perfect condition. The chips are some kind of heavy synthetic material (clay?). They stack well and are nicely finished. The case is excellent and well fitted. Even the cards were good quality. I give this one 5 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Set of Poker Chips","review":"I was quite surprised with how heavy the box was when I got it.

I have seen peeps complain about one of there chips having a die on the chip that wasn't numbered properly. I am deployed and us guys like to unwind. These chips are worth every penny that was spent on them and exceeded my expectations. Packaging was done well considering how many sets of hands this product went through to get to me. The blue chips were on top of the cards but no damage was done. The chips have a good feel to them and would make a great set for someone who enjoys playing poker with their buddy's.

Every one in the platoon likes the heavier feel to the chips. Of course there is no fancy design and the 'painting' is sometimes a little rough, but these were under $50! I think the cost was very good for the quality/quantity of the chips. The case is not samsonite but has taken some beatings quite well and the inner layers keep stuff from moving around. Took off one star because of the dealer/blind buttons as they seem to have been an afterthought. This might seem kind of nitpicky but I couldn't take off just a half-star.

I got it on gold box for $29.95 and free shipping, and it arrived in 3 days. One of the nice things about this set is that you get more low-denomination chips ($1 and $5) than higher denominations, unlike other 500-chip sets that give you equal amounts of 5 colors. With this set you can have a T100 tournament with 10 players no problem (15 whites, 11 reds, 3 blue). There are not enough high-denomination chips to have a T1000 tournament, unless you want to reassign colors. Another nice thing about this set is the case, which has 3 latches compared to just 1 or 2 on similar chip sets.The worst part about this set is the cards that are included, they are crap, which is why I'm giving this product a 4-star rating instead of 5. But that's not a reason not to buy this chip set, just do yourself a favor and order some good bicycle cards to go with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"ALL IN - POCKET ACES: Hold'em chip set is a WINNER!","review":"Best bang for your buck - for less than $40 free ship @ 500 good quality clay chips + nice case: it's ALL IN or fold em' Chips look pretty good, nice weighted feel.

The non-deluxe plastic tokens have been replaced with dumb semi-flexible figurines. The game board folds into six sections (instead of in 1/2) so it doesn't lay flat unless played on a flat hard surface. Forget playing it on the bed as nothing will remain level. The two plastic bridges and castle have no way to insert into the game board and tend to move around and get in the way of game play. If only the game pieces had been magnetic, and stayed where they were placed, then I'd consider this to be deluxe. There isn't even a card holder/discard holder. The cards have the word \\"Deluxe\\" printed on them, oh whoopy doodle!! The playing board is loaded with busy graphics detracting from the simplicity of the game. So if you like this game, save your $$ and get the regular version."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"The deluxe characters are nice and the little bridges are OK, but the game board is a step down from the regular version. Rather than folding into two equal sections, the \\"deluxe\\" game board folds into six sections. The board tends not to lay perfectly flat.

I do not know what slowed me down more; the disjointed writing or the two plots that seamed to just be thrown together. I did not believe the characters; they just were not well developed. I only made it about half way into the book. This book seams rushed, almost like the author did not want to take the time to really develop either the story or the characters. Because of the light development it does not hold your attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book.Very interesting,","review":"I have this Hardcover version book,2003 Hermes Publishing,my Book has American Flag in the Middle and then other flags..(Just like in the pic) Good book, Lots of countries and flags.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of the Grene/Lattimore 'Euripides III'","review":"Again, Grene and Lattimore deliver an excellent collection of plays by Euripides. The language and clear and readable in all translations. However, I also continue my criticism that these works lack footnotes to guide readers through obscure mythological references. I believe the Arrowsmith translations have a few, but this should be more widespread.And interesting aspect to this volume in particular is the thematic unity of the plays. The first three all concern the division of skin and treasure after the fall of Troy. The fourth (Ion) is something of an anomaly, but was actually my favorite of all those within this volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpectedly funny!!","review":"I had gone as an invited guest to a pre screening of this movie. I am not into stupid comedy and had gone with the notion that I would be politely entertained. However - I was so wrong!!

I shall watch it again and again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No bargain at any price.","review":"It is a sense of civic duty that compels me to warn my fellow music lovers away from this thoroughly unpleasant recording. Entremont's playing is almost uniformly dull, and he seems utterly incapable of engaging the subtleties of Ravel's music. On a few occasions, Entremont manages to assert some originality, but his efforts seem misguided and obtrusive. In theory, I could sell my copy to a used CD store and recuperate a few miserable dollars, but conscience prevents me from doing so. If you like French piano music, and you have a couple more bucks to spend, read my review of Koechlin's \\"Trois Oeuvres Maitresses\\", then buy it forthwith.

I bought these for my 2003 Mustang GT and they were almost a perfect fit, a little shorter than the stock muffler and the in/out are 1/4\\" larger than stock but that matches up great with an aftermarket x-pipe and tailpipes. They also shipped very fast, arriving in less than 48 hours with the free shipping. I can't speak for many other models but if you put these mufflers on a 4.6 mustang you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"loud","review":"The 40 series is one of the louder models flowmaster makes. Wouldnt recommend on small engines. I put this on a dodge ram 3.7 v6 and it sounds good at idle but its loud.you can hear it from inside my house. On small engine, has a lot of drown inside the cab and gets annoying. But thats my preference of how much sound i like. Sounds good while crusing but when it hits 2500 rpm, thats when the most drown hits. It eventually goes away while highway driving, higher gears kick in and sound goes down. Didnt notice much on mpg. And once you break it in, itll get a little louder. Hope this helpedReccomend on big engines( v8, big blocks, etc)If you like it loud, here you go!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing!","review":"This is one of the most confusing educational books I have ever read. It is beautifully illustrated but the diagrams, when studied closely, are poorly labelled, do not accord with the text and overlap one another in a misleading way. The text itself is very hard to digest, uses lots of jargon and fails to explain the pictures/diagrams. In addition there is no attempt made to show how the principles so poorly explained can be applied to real drawing situations. In short, I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"incorrect","review":"This book actually contains incorrect information on one of the most difficult things for students to grasp: how rolled cylinders work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty, but not informative","review":"The illustrations are very nice and the book is in full color.

Zimmerman, who comes from a long line of Southern roots matrons, was hit head on with the power of feminism in high school and college, catapulting her far away from her domestic foremothers. Now, a wife, mother and author, she has comprehensively researched her subject and presents it in straight-forward and intimate style. This book oozes with insightful anecdotes and facts about the modernization of American Homemaking, and what it reveals about our society in general. Vividly interesting, entertaining, and thought provoking. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tervis Insulated tumblers","review":"If you ever have the opportunity to try the Tervis insulated tumblers, you will fall in love with them.

Most of the attention is given to the patient for good reason, but we caregivers go through a lot too. In fact, my wife told me that she would rather be her (the cancer patient) than me (the caregiver).You will come away from this book with a much better understanding and more compassion for the caregivers - Mr. Brown did a great job capturing the essence of his experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Different","review":"This movie is different, to a certain extent humorous.

So, Ray is fos on this.Ray also keeps hawking a supplement (Juice Plus+) which is expensive and unnecessary.

You don't see many books or people expressing their ability to identify with that at all. When I picked up the book, I thought I would come across a piece that told my story or at least broke it down in a similar way. Everything rolled along fine with the read until the buildup for the entire premise was just thrown out so the author could have a \\"clever\\" plot twist. Instead, what he did was alienate his plot. No doubt, he was trying to turn it around. All in all, looking at it from another standpoint, I see the piece as a celebration for black relationships. Expressing the greatness that could come from two black people in love. Fine. The main character fell for one type of woman, lost faith in her, and subsequently found his diamond in the rough. I could see that from another point of view. But, I looked for something else and what I got in return was a cop out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break this is a total waste of my money","review":"I must have not read the same book as the rest of you. The whole story is totally unrealistic and is full of character assassination. I know that everyone has there own little secrets but none of these people are true to themselves or the people they say that they love. I have to agree w/the QUEEN from Washington she is one of the few people that told the truth about this book. One last commit for Jonathan Smith for you to even have the preconceived notion that black women are out there torturing black men tells me that either you are not African American or you have already cross over the other side and my point is that you my friend will never be able to understand the depth that this reader is trying to give to you. And if you ARE black then you need to ask yourself who are you being true to."},{"rating":"1","title":"could have been better","review":"Mr. Dickey, I love the way you write but this book made me mad. I get so tired of hearing the same tired things about Black Women. We all don't have attitudes and get pregant. My angre is that I don't behave like that and I don't have any friend's who behave like that. Yes, it's true there are some who act like that but by writing this book it gives white women the idea that Black Women truly are aggressive angre women. If a Black Man wants to date a white woman because he is in love, Great! but don't make us (Black Women) out to be the bad guy because we all are not. If the Black couple in this book just truly did not get along and the Black Woman was a nice person it would not of bothered me but I get sick of these Black Men with these Racist attitudes toward their own women! Grow Up! lets work together. Date whoever you want but always respect your women in your race. Sorry EJD, I hope to read your next book.

He made ALL the black female characters seem ghetto. Made the white female character Kimberly seem perfect. Kimberly was more confused than any of the characters. She lied about who she was to Jordan from the very start. He made Jnette seem evil. For Jordan to be so BLACK and never been attractived to white women, it was strange seeing him falling hard in a short period for a white woman. She was white when it was right for her, and black when she was ignorant and a liar. I beleive EJD was trying to cross-over with this book. Trying to look good with white readers, BUT we black readers, mostly female BLACK readers are buying & reading your books."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:O},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},B=["disabled"],N={key:0},M={key:1};function H(o,e,n,u,s,r){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",x,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(r.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:s.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...h))},[s.isLoading?(a(),i("span",M,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",N,"See more"))],8,B)):b("",!0)])}const R=d(C,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-9ff67fc6"]]),P=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"sponsor/7.md","filePath":"sponsor/7.md"}'),W={name:"sponsor/7.md"},G=Object.assign(W,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(R)]))}});export{P as __pageData,G as default};
