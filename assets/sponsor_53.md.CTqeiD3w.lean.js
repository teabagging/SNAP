Don't waste your money on this book.

In fact, I don't understand the examples in the book even though I understand my professor perfectly and get full marks on my homework and quizzes. The problem with the book is that it introduces new notations out of the blue and doesn't explain what those notations means. It is equivalent to changing the language to Chinese all of the sudden and expecting you to understand it. You can't understand an example if you don't know what the symbols and notations represent in words. In addition to that, it jumps from the first step to the conclusion with the explanation of \\"it's obvious\\" \\"obviously \\"clearly\\" and so on. You'll be quick to see that nothing is obvious.

While it certainly appears his contributions to that effort have been substantial, the title of the book implies something that it clearly is not.If you are looking for background and historical context regarding Muslim-American voting movement, this book would likely prove a good ancillary.

Each meditation was based on a dozen or so works of art (Sister Wendy is best known her books and PBS programs on art appreciation), and all reflect the essence of Christianity--the Christianity that has become so rare in this era of the religious right.

No character development at any level, nobody to cheer for, nobody to really detest -- unless you count a mere 99% of the characters. An unlikely, nonsensical \\"plot\\" that Grimes must have sketched out on a beer coaster at her local pub.I'm guessing that -- now in her seventies -- Grimes is simply padding out her retirement fund.

So what he's done is basically create a cult/religion that makes him money.The premise of the book is that the emotionally charged first memories we all have of certain concepts and products guide our decision making subconsciously. This is an interesting idea, but he always presents it in a vague enough way that it is impossible to test, and never once does he challenge the idea himself.It disturbs me that so many people can't see the bs going on here.The author is unquestionably talented at marketing himself and stirring up controversy.

But nothing regarding hard business analysis.

Unfortunately, Rapaille chooses to make sweeping generalizations about these results, always trying to distill the entire spectrum of participant responses into single catch phrases.

I am new with these but i think they are worth the money that was spent on it (with shipping was about 15-16 bucks)A definite buy if your looking for some simple 108 handwraps that isn't too little of an amount and not too much, a simple and sweet buy :D"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality product, if you're a woman or youth.","review":"I recently purchased these wraps to help prevent bag blisters when using grappling gloves. I started to wrap them how I was taught and realized I bought the wrong ones they're too short for me. If you want to use them for wrist support and to give you the \\"tight\\" feel when closing your hands these wont work unless you're a woman or a youth boxer. I am a 5'11 155 lb man with averaged sized hands and i couldn't complete a full wrap no matter how many ways I had tried to wrap them. Quality product otherwise!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality. Ripped after first wash.","review":"After I washed the handwraps for the first time, they started to rip and fray at the edges. It is pretty pointless if you can't wash them, because they get disgusting during a session of kickboxing. Anyways, I recommend the 'combat sports' handwraps. They seem to be more flexible and comfortable as well! ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent good quality wraps for those with smaller hands","review":"These are excellent wraps but as people have noticed are junior wraps. As such, they're 108\\" long and are good for teens or women with smaller hands.Men should use 180\\" wraps. Everlast sell full length mexican wraps and you can buy them on Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"No problems whatsoever","review":"These 108\\" hand wraps are exactly what the description says they are: 108\\" hand wraps. For those complaining about the shortened size, take heart in knowing that some, like myself, have relatively small hands, and need something a bit shorter. The description does say 108\\", so please make your purchase accordingly.I found these hand wraps to be made of decent quality. I've used them extensively, washed them many times, and they work as well as the day I bought them. Perhaps I've lucked out with really good wraps, but still, I cannot criticize them fairly when they've only been very good to me, and protected my hands very well.Everlast is one of those really popular sporting brands, and when using their products, I can see why- they're simple yet satisfactory, as they get the job done with little to no problems.Hope this review was helpful- please let me know if you have any questions or concerns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have started to fall apart after only 5 uses","review":"These are shorter than normal so you can't wrap your hand quite as well. They also are becoming frayed and the velcro bit that is sewed on is starting to come off. I can't imagine they'll be functional after a few more uses. The only pros are that they're cheap and come in a 3 pack. Next time I'm going to get a higher quality, longer wrap. Don't bother with these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak velcro stitching, too short to provide adequate padding","review":"I ordered these as a total novice for simple heavy bag workouts about three months ago. I was pleased with them at first, but now I'm ordering something else. On one of the three sets the stitching holding the velcro down came completely apart during the very first wear. The others are now weakened too. I had a friend restitch them. I like that they're 100% cotton, but that means that the crinkle up and can be hard to wrap flat. I run a hot iron over them now and then. Finally, now that I've been in training a few months, I'm hitting much harder, and these wraps just aren't long enough to provide enough padding. My knuckles are bruising during training."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Short for Adults...","review":"I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing these. If you are going to do contact striking work (heavy bag, mitt work, etc.) then you need to protect your hands, and these wraps are too short for adults.I have replaced them with longer \\"professional\\" wraps from Everlast, which are the proper length for adult hands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too short!","review":"Indeed, these are way too short for protecting your knuckles.

For kids hands.","review":"its 108 inches, the standard is 180 inches. You can adjust the wrapping method but it won't give the same protection as a 180 inch wrap. Not elastic/stretchable too. Returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for 180 wrapping","review":"These wraps are small and should be advertised for youth. You can not do 180 wrapping with these, and if you are an adult, they do not give you enough slack for adequate support for your wrist and knuckles. It was a mistake buying them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch Out!","review":"These handwraps are very short. 108\\" is not the ideal length and I was very unhappy to find this out. I would suggest a much longer handwrap. Especially if you're a beginner, like myself, you need much longer handwraps for the support because longer handwraps allow you to have cross-finger support as well as the much needed wrist support. DON'T BUY. GET LONGER HANDWRAPS!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BUYER BEWARE, TOO SHORT","review":"Needed some wraps for boxing. I am a petite girl & have Everlast wraps already that are super long w/ some stretch in them. Did not read the details on these, saw the great deal 3 of them for $10. When they arrived they were not the same. They are SUPER short, too short. Does not even wrap around my hand properly, will need to use at least 2 of them if not 3 for the same length of the one I have. Smells funny & is 100% cotton so NO give at all, not comfortable. Kind of a waste of $ for me, buyer beware, good deals for a reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"really uncomfortable","review":"The wrap is really short to wrap around your hands efficiently. The material is also not comfortable. Feel like it scratches on your skin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too thin for practical use","review":"My boxing instructor looked at these brand new out of the package and shook his head. They aren't thick enough to adequately cushion the knuckles. Way to short to compensate with additional padding. I worked out with them anyway, and paid the price. Spend the extra dough and buy quality hand wraps"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Quality","review":"I have been boxing for about a year now, tried these wraps and they both tore apart after one sparring.

You don't want static wraps, period. They're also too short."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not bother","review":"i know this 3 pack may seem like a great value but these wraps are so not worth it. do yourself a favor and buy a better quality wrap, one with proper elasticity which these wraps have none of. wraps are uncomfortable enough but when you buy a better quality wrap, the added elasticity increases your comfort level. i'd also recommend going with the longer 180\\", mexican style, wraps so you can use that added length to properly wrap your thumb, in between fingers, and more layers to your crucial knuckles and wrists. title brand 180\\" wraps only cost $4 so spend a couple more dollars on better wraps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok Wraps","review":"These are decent wraps, they are just small and kind of cheap. For a beginner who is starting to train they could be fine but for an experienced boxer they will not be of high enough quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would look into another set of wraps","review":"I dont know what the deal is with these wraps. I have been using everlast products for 20 years and have never had a set of wraps just fall apart on me in a matter of days like these ones have. Its possible that I might have recieved a manufacturers defect but the stitching on the thumb loop and velcro last me about 2 days with each of the 3 sets.

I dont think so!","review":"These people think that they're going to be the next big thing, but they arent. THey think they are disney protege's, but they arent. The one called Aly, the one from Phil of the future is so bad, she cant even sing, she sounds like pop trash, like lindsay lohan or hilary duff, who only try to play on their popularity from a dumb little children's show from disney. Aly is so ugly, she looks like an old woman, and the other one looks like a sluggish colon."},{"rating":"1","title":"OH BROTHER!","review":"I can't believe people buy this junk.These girls can not sing.They are just some other disney channel wanna be stars who can't sing worth a penny.If you look up to these girls as idols you are just another sucker.If you're just like this\\"oh, aly & aj inspired me to play the guitar\\" you'r just another dumb no life bum.These girls aren't what u call singers.When they supposedly \\"sing\\" you can't even understand a word they say.Don't get me wrong, i'm not racist.My best friend is white.However if this was a black girl singing about \\"out of your soul race through your veins\\" they'd wanna say their demonized.The only thing thes girls prove is that you don't have to be a good singer to get a record deal.

They aren't overly abstracted like a lot of songs these days. Instead, they just state simple emotions of being a person, especially a teenager, and that's what makes this CD so great and easy to connect to. My favorite songs are Rush, Out of the Blue, and Slow Down. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"},{"rating":"2","title":"aj is good too!","review":"i am kind of offended by the last review but that person is entitled to their opinion... but i think that both aly and aj are really good and i can totally understand everything aj sings and actually prefer her voice to aly's on some occasions. so i dont understand the problem. they are both amazing and much better than hilary duff. Its great that they are able to play instruments and not just pretend to in music videos like some OTHER pop singers. they are much more rock than pop and it is great that they write their own music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cream of the Crop","review":"The newest Disney Channel crop of cuties Aly and Aj make an impressive debut with \\"Into the Rush\\". \\"Rush\\" is one of the many standout tracks, asking for you to please celebrate who you are and don't give up on something you need to do. The \\"Ice Princess\\" track \\"No One\\" goes for a more rock vibe, friendship track \\"On the Ride\\" echos labelmates' Hilary Duff's \\"So Yesterday\\" and \\"Sticks and Stones\\" is a better than Avril Lavigne cut. However, don't make any snap comparisons, unlike other blonde and red headed popstars, Aly and AJ write thier own tunes. Watch your back, Hilary Duff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get \\"Into The Rush\\"","review":"This is a great album with great songwriting. These Young Girls know how to write songs. They bring something unique to the whole teen scene by not going overboard in their songs. Sure they have a lot of love songs but it isnt the whole sex thing like a lot of artists. They have one song titled \\"slow Down\\" which talks about slowing down and not going to fast. A great CD that I would let my kids listen to. All the songs were written by Aly and AJ except the remakes of the classis songs \\"Walking on Sunshine\\" and their remake hit of \\"Do You Believe In Magic.\\" I also like the songs \\"Never Far Behind\\" and \\"Chemicals react.\\" This is a fun pop album that everyone can get into and not be worried about the lyrical content. Also contains a Dvd with 4 videos."},{"rating":"2","title":"other stuff to check out","review":"I am a huge fan of catchy melodic girl rock/pop.

I went searching for the lyrics and, when read normally, are very...different from what most people may interpret. to be honest, the lyrics to 'Rush' read like they're describing the affect of drugs or even an orgasm! Don't believe me? Go ahead, look it up, I double dog DARE you.Sincerely,Someone who's actually 18."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Wish That I Had Just Bought The One Song","review":"I bought this CD because I really liked the song \\"Rush\\", which was used as a theme song for the WNBA last year (2007). It's the only good song on the CD. To me, all of the other songs on the CD sound like a variation of \\"Rush\\" and all of the songs seem to just run together. I found myself actually being glad when the last song on the CD was over. And on top of that, I must have got a defective CD, because my CD sounded muffled and \\"muddy\\". I thought that my CD player had gone bad, so I took \\"Into The Rush\\" out and put another CD in. Nope, the CD player was just fine - the CD was bad. I'm happy to have the song \\"Rush\\" in my music collection, but I wish that I had just downloaded that one song. I gave this CD two stars because of \\"Rush\\". All of the other songs get zero stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"SIERRA","review":"I love this album. \\"Do you believe in Magic\\" is my favorite song.

This CD has a whole bunch of upbeat music and not one bad word or suggastive lyrics. it's just what a tween like me would like! In Slow Down, they talk about not feeling the need to rush into a realitionship with a guy, just to take it slow. And in Sticks and Stones, they are saying that you shouldn't let yourself be bullied, that you should stick up for yourself. it's really good!BY;Chelsea ~ of Indiana"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best!","review":"this is the best CD ever!

Very impressive from 2 singers so young. the music on here isn't silly bubblegum pop. It's got good and often meaningful lyrics and the music is substantial, it doesn't just rely on one jingle/hook played over and over.

Their harmonies are pretty good throughout the album actually.My problem with this CD is that there is not originality to it...we have heard it all before with Lindsay Lohan, Hilary Duff etc... Nothing new or exciting that stands out on this CD. I realize that they come from the whole Disney background and maybe that's where and why I get lost in this pop fluff. I can see where kids would like it But, it is just too predictible with it's chours's and guitars that make each song bleed into the next making it sound like one long song!I do give it 2 stars though because they DO have good voices they just need to use them in a way that is not so formulatic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Somebody give this cast an Oscar","review":"a little cheesy but the young actress pulls the movie through.

Even so, it was still extremely dangerous for himself and the spotters.'Rendezvous', its original title is C'etait Un Rendezvous, will leave you stunned by the end.Sadly, the NTSC VHS was deleted some years ago. A new PAL ( Europe ) DVD and Video are available at SpiritLevelFilm.com.

It was 1981 and my father brought it home on a 16mm projector version, and showed it on the family slide projector screen. As a kid I was truly blown away, and as an adult I am still astonished by this work. Truthfully, I feel that anyone who has seen these nine breathtaking minutes of amazing footage will be left with an indelible mark in his or her mind. I was very excited to see that this was finally out on DVD after so many years, and although it is not available here at Amazon, it is available for purchase over at speedtv.com. I would highly recommend this wonderful Claude Lelouche work for anyone who enjoys a fast paced chase scene, or just the thrill of seeing beautiful European shops, avenues and cobblestone streets fly by at more than 100 mph. Most Hollywood cinematic features that involve an element such as this only wish they could emulate it with such reality, for reality is what \`Rendezvous' truly is."},{"rating":"1","title":"rendezvous","review":"Poor quality 10 minute video of a car travelling through Paris.

It only changes the word \\"left\\" to \\"right\\", and vice versa. This is the very basics of golf from the \\"wrong side\\". If you're a mid to low handicapper, don't expect to shave any strokes from your game after reading this book. And for high handicappers, this may help a little, but not enough to spend the time reading it.Unless you've never read a golf intruction book, this one is not very helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun romp of a book...","review":"This is one of those books you gulp down fast, like a cold beer after cutting the grass! A lite beer, frothy and not too filling, but definitely hits the spot on a hot afternoon. I'm a sucker for first person narrative, and the heroine is spunky and fresh. The last half of the book gallops by a little too fast after the great buildup, but I had a good time reading it and will be looking for more by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"This is a wonderful book. It kept me interested and snickering the whole way through. When I finished I felt energized and yearning to read something else by this author. The only reason I didn't give the book five stars is that the end felt rushed and Kaihan wasn't developed enough. If for no other reason, you should read this book for Detter.

Or this book from his point of view."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written and inventive!","review":"Very compelling book! The writing is really good, the story is well told, and there are a lot of finely done nuances in the telling that made this a book I couldn't wait to get back to."},{"rating":"2","title":"*WOW*","review":"I cannot say enough good things about this book! The characters were facinating, with the heroine starting off with her own power, so she did not have that chapter(s) of the heroine making great sacrifices to obtain some power that might give her a smigen of control over her life. She starts out strong, and though her perception of herself changes, she has that hidden part that knows what she can do. She has a perpetual ace up her sleeve with her knowledge brought from her home world. Also, the Magical power in this book is not the conventional stupid \\"thing\\", instead it is like a puppy - it wants to play and have fun, not do unending dicipline excercises. Unlike a force of scientific nature, it has a personality, and acts toward the heroine as a friend, not a pet. I cannot wait for the next book, and I hope for a sequel (The ending leaves so many possibilities!!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"uggghhh...","review":"When I read the summary at the end of the book, it all seemed really exciting. It had everything: magic,\\"one true mage\\", queen-turned-peasant... Yup. Then I read it... Nope. There was no plot. Rather, a bunch of events that don't even tie together nicely at the end. Ms. Turner also added some scenes that contributed SQUAT to the book. In my opinion, she could have done so much better. Look at the characters she had, they were great! If only she had developed the characters better. If only half the book wasn't made up of sexual hype that didn't contribute to the book. If only..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Convoluted plot","review":"This slim volume doesn't give the reader much of a chance a chance to revel in the author's words. The plot jumps from scene to scene awkwardly. The sexuality of the book is overhyped (this is coming from a 19 yr old). I wish the author gave an actual picture of the world where Lisane came from and how she escaped the Enforcers instead of a summary. I quit reading the book halfway because it stunk so bad and I sped through the last pages just to see if the plot got better. It didn't. The only good scene was when she performed the lle act for Kaihan and the rest of his council, other than that, go spend well-earned money on another book."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Golden Bough' vs. 'Dungeons and Dragons' Sorcery","review":"\\"Nameless Magery\\" is one of kind: the heroine practices a sort of Samoan magery. She finds 'mana' (or 'ller' as it is called in this book) everywhere, and comes from a world where the king reigns for a single year and is then killed and eaten by his successor. Her planet is invaded and she escapes to a world where magic is viewed as a power that can only be controlled by a few (male) mages. It makes for a wonderful conflict between the heroine, Lisane and the male mages and wannabe mages who feel an obligation to 'train' her. Once I started reading \\"Nameless Magery\\" I couldn't put it down, and read through to the end. I hope there is a sequel for Turner's idiosyncratic, uninhibited, and squabbling magicians to once again display their very special magic. Thank goodness for a wise-cracking, sensible heroine who isn't afraid of losing her magic if she loses her maidenhead!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Really Fun Read","review":"The author's fresh voice made this book shine. _Nameless Magery_ is a fun little book about a girl surviving among baffling strangers, trying to adapt to her new situation while keeping her personal ethics. This is fantasy on a personal scale, not a Grand Scale, which is just the way I like it. Lisane, our grouchy heroine, does not set out to save the world, but to live in it.For persons reading some other reviews of this book, I would also like to state that I did not find this book to be \\"R-rated.\\" What a silly concept, to rate books in this manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm kind of surprised...","review":"... that the reviews here are so overwhelmingly positive. I guess I must have missed something in my reading of the book, because I really didn't enjoy it.I read this book several years ago, in high school; I am, admittedly, a little fuzzy on the plot now. I do, however, clearly remember the details of the heroine's sex life, probably because these were (as I recall) paid more attention than the plot. I have nothing against sex scenes, really, but I thought they were kind of gratuitous and got in the way. I also remember the plot not making much sense, and the heroine being kind of annoying and not really the awesome strong feminist character the author clearly wants her to be seen as.All that said, I really liked the chapter titles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I read the excerpt and than thinking it showed promise, took it out of the library. All I can say is that it was horrible. The heroine was shallow and insipid, and the frequent references to sexual themes offensive and vulgar. This is not a worthwhile book to read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"Ok I read the back of this book and was interested cause it sounded good. Well I read it and I must say that I was very unimpressed. I thought that Lisane was kind of a flaky character, and I thought that her background wasn't as throughly explained as is could have been. It also seemed that the author, I don't know, got tired of writng at the end of the book. It was like she just wanted to end the book and so she just lumped everything together in the last chapter and ended it. Everything happend at once and then it was over. And ever that was left kinda vauge in some points. All in all I found it unentertaining and I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A recently found treasure from my youth...","review":"I first read this book when I was 13 and living a life FAR-removed from the life of the wealthy and/or blue-blooded girls going to a third-rate private girl's prep school in Manhattan.

It's author was married to the author of the Auntie Mame books, and you can definitely see a similarity in style and sense of humor.

Very nice price considering the prices of silver now days. Did not give it 5 stars as the item seems to run a bit small. I had to go back and order a size up, which I never have to do unless the band is really very wide all around. I should have realized since there is no graduation to the band and it is the same size all around that this could be a problem if it was not exactly true to size. I have other bands of this width where the sizing was not an issue, so I either got one just a bit off, or it does run small. Otherwise great ring.

Although I own a few prints of his, I had never experienced his work completely until I opened this book. Quite simply, the skill and perspective that this man possesed still puts me in awe. This is a very detailed collection of his works, and includes many sketches and studies for individual works. Another important facet of this publication is the numberous quotes through-out the book. It is facinating to stare at the pictures, but the facination climbs to a new level when one can read the writer's commentary on the specific work, art or life in general. I recommend this book highly. It provides the best collection of Escher between two covers, that I have seen to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Work!","review":"This doll is a very nice one.

What's shocking about this shallow treatment is that it begins with a trite epigraph (The best time to manage anger is before it happens) attributed to WDG. I've never read a book where the author quoted himself before starting the book. It gets worse, since over half the anecdotes of recovery from anger are drawn from the author's own life.

I think that, since I'm also using the top protector - which beads up water and makes stains less likely - the spray bottle of cleaner will last me over a year.As for the protector, the fact that it comes in an aerosol is an inconvenience since you have to wait for a windless (and ideally sunny) day; the slightest breeze makes the spray miss the intended target. That said, following these constraints, I found there to be more than enough in the can for 3 thorough coats of protectant. I had about 1/3 - 1/2 of a can left after 3 coats (on my 1995 Saab 900SE Convertible). And the stuff works great, water beads up wonderfully, whether rain or dew.AWESOME, AWESOME PRODUCTS!!

It is a hideous shame that this film only tells the part of her story that is considered morally acceptable. Come on, HBO, this is the 21st century. The public deserve to know, and are mature enough to handle, the full story of this wonderful woman, the battle Irvin Klaw faced, and the consequences suffered, even today, by those that even dare to dream, to follow the path that Bettie and Irvin followed. Great film, superb cast, very well put together ... but cut tragically short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Candy coated.....rushed at the end","review":"Pass on this one folks...unless you really have time to burn.At the very least, you will want to know more about this iconic figure.Personally, I found the film to be very shallow.

Don't even rent this one.","review":"To be fair, I didn't view this entire movie. I couldn't finish it. Although the camera work is lovely, the costumes are beautiful and accurate, and Ms. Mol made a fabulous Bettie, this movie does not do the famous pin-up queen any justice. Flashbacks of her early life are pitiful-poor young Bettie the victim is mistreated by one man after another, pouting and crying. She was a strong woman in reality, but this film presents her as an abused creature to be pitied. Although it is never stated, the movie implies that the reason she got in to fetish modeling was a direct result of her abusive and tumultous childhood. Blech. This film is rather entertaining to look at but if you really want to get a sense of who Bettie Page was, look somewhere else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful movie","review":"It's hard to believe that, in my lifetime, the US Senate investigated somebody for publishing racy pictures.Gretchen Mol is delightful as Bettie Page.

The direction and writing and the photography, black and white and color.I dont remember seeing grainy...and not least the extras. All interesting with a commentary track that was enlightening from both a technical and personal viewpoint. And that short item with the real Bettie.... how revealing of the nature of her appeal.

It also has that elusive element....repeatability.Thanks for reading....."},{"rating":"1","title":"you're forced to watch the trailers","review":"I'm a diehard pinup fan and love this movie.

We had 40000 years in the stone age and as a resultthere were social codes that were pretty universal with a few exceptions.Until mankind gets better at controlling his urges, he has to try to stall inside certain bounds orall social conduct is in danger?Pornography is one thing we are in serious trouble over as a society."},{"rating":"2","title":"history touches all fields.","review":"being a possible porn film I thought the director and producer kept a level of professionalism throughout the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"The illustrated Mary","review":"Very illustrated featuring mainly Mary's imprisionment.

I believe the book is written objectively, but very few pages are are actually dedicated to expalining how he actually made the leap from intern to a CEO of a multi-million dollar company. That was the story I really wanted to read about. Unfortunately, I learned more about Puffy's legal trial than I did about how he built his empire.

This book had good information, but is seriously lacking details. Many of the addresses for the stores are wrong. Many times I would search for a store, only to find the address, but the store was not located there.For one store (Monoprix), she did not give an address but described it as between a cluster of stores and the Hotel de Ville. It was actually a 20 min walk past the Hotel de Ville! We wasted over 40 minutes because she didn't provide accurate information.She also writes that you are limited to bringing $400 worth of goods out of the country, when the limit is actually $800.This would be a good book if the editors checked her information to be sure it was factual."},{"rating":"1","title":"Certainly not the best guide for bargain-shoppers!","review":"\\"Disappointing\\" is the best word to apply to this book.

I mapped out the locations of several of the shops Suzy raves about, and arrived, only to find that the store was no longer (was it ever?) at the address she gave.

Sometimes a bit of information, but not quite accurate. She praises the flea markets but I've found that they contain a lot of garbage or possibly stolen goods. Her research was so-so, at best. Not quite the best for bargain shoppers and she seems to continually sing the praises of Hermes. She has to realize that there is a difference between shopping and bargain shopping. You can spend a lot of money needlessly doing it her way. Also, she overhypes a lot of problems (no problems with ATMs or Metro). Ms Gershman also needs to realize that book writing of this kind is an evolving process. You don't just write a book of this kind once and expect to revise it a little every few years. A book of this kind needs to be totally rewritten, especially with internet shopping available and stores constantly opening and closing.

I'm the only person who uses it, so it doesn't get much use. I probably used it once a week. By May, the automatic switch (off) was no longer working. This may seem like a small thing - one would think you could just stand near the kettle and watch it - but, for whatever reason, the pot will no longer boil water fully. It comes nearly to the boiling point, then it stops, then...minutes later, it will start again, then it stops, (repeat cycle over and over).If I walked away, or if I had children, this would be very dangerous. I can no longer get boiling water from the kettle, just \\"very hot water\\". It's a shame, because I liked the kettle.

Be sure you purchase the Capresso H20 Plus through an authorized retailer (as listed on their website) or you will have no recourse when it fails after just a few months.

And of course, the smell does affect the taste of the hot water it creates.Bottom line is -- do not waste your time with this kettle --I have been reluctant to get rid of mine, since the odor has improved from when it was new.

We use a water machine that produces alkaline water and wanted a kettle to boil water rather than using the microwave. I don't think there has been a day we haven't used the kettle since it was purchased! We love it! Yes, there is a smell, but it is barely discernible. Both of us are sensitive to odors, but this one isn't that drastic and definitely doesn't affect the taste of the water. We agree with others that the odor is coming from the handle. And we notice the intensity continues to decrease with use. The kettle looks very nice sitting next to our Bodum French press. We don't have any complaints and are very glad we decided to see for ourselves if we would like this particular kettle. We do!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rust & Strange Smell","review":"Less than 30 days after use, the heating element has rust appearing. There is a distinct unpleasant smell that will not go away with washing. The water ends up having a strange taste. Just yesterday, I was at my local thrift store and saw this kettle for sale for $8. It also had that strange smell inside. I felt like a sucker for paying $59.99. The smell makes me fear I am cooking the adhesive or sealant into my water. My kettle might end up at that thrift shop unless I can arrange a return."},{"rating":"1","title":"Handle falls off - very dangerous","review":"I was shocked when, after we had owned this kettle for only a few months, the handle just became disconnected from the glass kettle while it was full of boiling water - so dangerous! We were lucky not be burned. The handle is held to the lid with 2 small screws. We screwed them back in, but it barely lasted a week before it came apart again. I guess we're slow learners, because it has now come apart probably 10 times, each time while full of hot water, so I'm buying a new one today (looking at the Cuisinart 1.7 cordless kettle) before my husband or I get seriously burned.It's a shame, because it's such a pretty glass kettle, it boils quickly, like the varying tea temperatures and the automatic shut-off, but this is a serious design flaw. I've talked to several other people who have this kettle and have the same problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convenient!","review":"This is a glass container, unlike the plastic models that make the water smell like plastic, so it seems safer to boil water in.

Bought it with an Aerobie Coffee Press (an absolutely marvelous little device that restores your faith in American ingenuity, by the way) after my unbelievably sturdy yet mediocre Cuisinart coffee maker died a merciful death.Works great. boils water about as fast as it takes me to fool with the Aerobie. Gave one as a wedding gift right away. Has an honored place on my counter along with the microwave. Its that useful. Use it to help start out rice that needs to be cooked, since its so fast.Never noticed the weird taste some people talk about although I think I smelled it coming from the base a time or two when it was new and I lifted the carafe off of it.

Then one day, the blue \\"on\\" light turned off for no apparent reason, then turned on 30 to 60 seconds later, and then went off again.

I love love love how this kettle looks, and chose to ignore the negative reviews about the plastic inner coil with the horrible smell and water taste. I've tried baking soda, white vinegar, lemon juice, everything. There is something inherently toxic about the blasted inside, and I finally had to capitulate to my husband this morning when he said \\"I'm really worried that something you drink every day smells so poisonous.\\" It's packed up and going back. We've ordered a $29 all stainless steel, highly reviewed replacement. Not as sexy looking, but a lot safer choice.

You put water in this pretty little glass pot, the one that cost $60 and change, you push up the mood lighting on-off switch and the water boils. Quickly. That's what happened yesterday, the first day. Today it's a different story. This is the Beelzebub of kettles -- there are no Beelzebubbles. It's now 3:31 p.m. I came home at 2:30 p.m. and turned on the kettle for a cup of tea. After 20 minutes, I plugged in the old $15 Proctor Silex and had hot water in two minutes, a cup of tea in five. I am still waiting for the Capresso to boil. It heats a little, then sulks, heats a little more, then goes, I guess, on vacation. It's not like I'm asking it to do dishes, wash windows, learn Esperanto or clean out the gutters.

The light that indicates if it is heating or not is so dim that I have to cup my hand around it tell. After the light goes out and the water is supposed to be hot, it is barely hot enough to make light tea. If I let it sit and go back on again, it soon does become hot but by then I could have done it on the stove. Just looking at it, you really can't tell if the switch is in the on position or not. It is only about a quarter of an inch movement and with no lines or markers, you just can't tell. All in all, it is pretty, but not well thought out and doesn't work so well either. It is going back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glass Cracked Within the First Two Months","review":"This morning suddenly, after normal usage, just after the unti hit boil and I was pouring the hot water into my French Press the glass cracked and the boiling water went all over the place.

I am not sure if it is my local water source or if it is particles coming off the O-ring that surrounds the metal heating dome.

Later, I purchased this kettle for my home. It worked great for the first two months. We use filtered water so there were no deposits or bad smells either. For no discernible reason, the heating element just stopped working. I called Capresso. Without the sales receipt there is nothing they could do for me.

Now I am boiling water without the chrome top and only the plastic cap. I suspect the plastic may contain BPA?I love the design and glass body. But why does the manufacturer use a better material for the cap and the connecting parts.I don't mind to pay more for a better made product.

Kudos to the product photographer for making it look elegant. I did not notice any odors like other reviewers, but it didn't matter.There isn't any temperature guages, selections.

Some kind of thermal cutoff is engaging and it stops heating before the water boils. Also there is a major recall (15000 units sold) that deals with the handle detaching from the carafe. I'm just glad it failed electrically before the handle broke and spilled boiling water on myself or my kids. I did also smell and taste the odor the other reviewers talk about, and agree that having silicone in direct contact with the heating element is a very bad idea, though it's probably not toxic. There's some other, better designs on the market (seeToastess TGK486 Cordless Glass Kettle, Gray) for glass kettles. I bought my replacement today.

Also, the lid and handle (the non-glass parts) are shoddy looking and don't fit well. Still, it was fun to watch for a month or so, and then it just went \\"plink\\" and stopped heating.

My wife takes her tea every morning and occasionally in the evening so the product was used a lot and cared for a lot. However, it would only boil a a third of a pot of water before the thermostat would shut the unit down, well before it reached a boil. If you waited 5 minutes it would come back on and complete the boil - a pain in the arse. Finally after about 2.5 years it gave up the ghost and does not heat at all.

Hopefully the smell will begin to dissapate so I can use it in the future. If you have chemical sensitivities, stay away from this pot. I purchased it because it was glass and I was trying to get away from plastics. You cannot tell from looking at the picture that the lid is lined with black plastic. I would not recommend this pot to a friend and do not feel comfortable to even give it away to someone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks Great; Smells Bad; a Waste of Time","review":"We tried this kettle despite the reports of its bad smell because of its great looks. I can verify that this kettle produces an odor like burnt plastic or burnt rubber and even infuses the water with that odor. I poured the boiled water into a pyrex bowl and took that bowl to another room where a person who has a sharp sense of smell confirmed that the water smelled bad.

After 2 months of use the plastic cap started melting and breaking in small pieces, also the chrome cap came off loose and glue was crumbling into the kettle. I think it's a health hazard and also a fire hazard, I would not buy it again, my husband threw it in a trash ( $70.00 ) when glue particles ended up in his cup......I was thinking of taking it back to BB and B but it was over 30 days....It's a waste of money....it's a shame for Capresso !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad taste","review":"Reviews are correct - looks ice, but leaves bad chemical taste in water ...

I was a little unsure about buying it again because the lid came off the first one, but that was after a year of very heavy use, so we decided to give it another try. So far, so good. This newer version is definitely quieter, which is a plus. We use this kettle all the time, so I'm giving this product 5 stars in the hopes that the lid issue has been fixed.Update: The second started turning on by itself after about a year, so we stopped using it. The Capressos just don't seem well-made at all, and I've reduced my rating to one star. Get aSaeco 1167 50-Ounce Electric Water Kettleinstead.

The rest of the pot hasn't even gotten dirty yet.You can turn it on without any water in it. I did that once and had to leave the thing to cool off before I could do anything with it. It has ALWAYS shut off when there is water boiling in the kettle.Mine did start with that nasty smell. But the smell went away with use.

I tried the lemon juice and vinegar also to no avail and have finally concluded that I am better off without drinking the chemicals that are leaching into the water from the silicon gasket.I was also told by the company that I could return it for a kettle that didn't smell, but that I would have to pay the shipping which is about 12 dollars.

The customer service email was not helpful at all, and the 1-800 number never picks up - I had to leave a message. When they eventually called me back (a somewhat impatient rep, I may add), they offered no actual help except that I would have to return the product - shipping would be on me (this seems extremely unfair as the product is broken). Also, I would only get a new kettle after they receive mine, and after reading the reviews it seems as though I would rather have one with a faulty off switch than a foul odor. I called back (with my order #) to further discuss the issue, and they never returned my call. I don't plan to place another order with Jura Capresso again, which is a shame because on the surface the kettle appears so promising."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not last more than one year","review":"A first and a second Capresso broke down in about one year.

Ours only lasted a year and a half. It's a lovely design and boiled water quickly, but about 2 weeks ago the knob on the top snapped off, and then this morning it just stopped boiling water altogether. I just don't understand why companies design such disposable products, but still charge obscene amounts of money for them. Plus, it's not actually made of any sort of polished metal. It's just plastic covered with a shiny silver layer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice but not a very convenient kettle","review":"This is an expensive, though nice-looking kettle, worthy of placing directly on the table. When fresh and clean it is nice to look at when the water is boiling. Also, it arrived (from the US to Canada) in a record ~36 hrs!The kettle has however a few drawbacks to consider:1. The bulging heating element requires boiling much more water than one might need for a sigle cup serving. Also, it makes the scale deposits much more visible than they would be on a flat bottom.2. The on/off switch is not very crisp in moving between the two positions and the blue \\"on\\" light is VERY dim and hardly perceptible.3. The spout is not the best ergonimically designed, making the pouring of water less than a perfect experience.4. The kettle has no scale filter which means that it has to be rinsed out quite often.5. The nested design (kettle within the base, rather than just sitting on top of it) is less convenient than typical bases."},{"rating":"1","title":"STILL has that nasty taste/smell","review":"Our old kettle's switch broke so we ordered this one - big mistake. It looks nice and boils water quickly, but after several months, and despite a number of cleanings with soap or vinegar and thorough rinses, our teas STILL have that nasty taste to them and the kettle STILL smells. Don't waste your money buying this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this Kettle!","review":"I've used this kettle for going on 3 years and have never had the problems listed here. Maybe a break-in period is necessary? I'm a tea drinker so use my kettle daily, usually more than once. It quickly heats water to boiling and turns off when it reaches the correct temperature. One note: be sure to have the water cover the silvery heating element in the bottom. When my sister was visiting, she liked this so much she immediately went on Amazon and ordered herself one so it would be waiting for her upon her return.I don't write many reviews, but seeing the negative ones here, wanted to highly recommend this product and share my experiences."},{"rating":"1","title":"The top will bubble up.","review":"The top lid is covered in simulated chrome over plastic which will bubble up around the edge in one year or less. This is what happened to our kettle--it is still a pretty glass and all and is an enjoyment to use but the fact that in one year the lid needs to be replaced (if you want to maintain cuteness) is appalling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great while it works but doesn't last long","review":"We just went through our second one in a year. We liked it and figured we just got a lemon the first go around when it broke after six months, so we tried another one. The second one only lasted four months. It is a nice product (when it works), but I am really disappointed in the quality. I don't want to have to buy a new one every four or five months. The Capresso service support stinks..... I am an engineer and when the second one broke, I tore it apart trying to figure out what was broken, but it is basically a disposable unit, and is not fixable (I couldn't find a new heating element on-line) and the way it is glued together, was never meant to be taken apart and put back together. Try something else, you will be happier in the long run."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great electric kettle!","review":"Been using this a few weeks now. Works great, no off-tastes in the water. My only grip and the only thing keeping this from a 5 star rating - the automatic shut off isn't sensitive enough. It can get to boiling pretty hard before it shuts off. Also, if you remove the kettle from it's base before it shuts off, it doesn't automatically shut off, so you could set the kettle down with very little water in it and it will start heating again."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"I have to agree with the other reviews - this kettle has a foul chemical smell which I think comes from this silicone insert inside at the bottom. I boiled it several times and it actually got worse. YUCK. I am sure it can't be good to drink water that had been in contact with this. horrible. I took it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Perfect, No Funky Odor","review":"I am a person who lives life keenly through my sense of smell, and I am a little baffled by all the reviews stating that there was a foul chemical stench coming from some people's kettles. I followed the instructions and ran water through it once, then discarded that first kettle's worth of water. There was a bit of a plastic odor with that first discarded pot, but every successive pot has been normal, and I use it a couple times every day. This thing makes for a perfect cup of tea, and does it quickly. It is much faster than boiling water on the stove, or even microwaving. I love it. I think any tea-drinker would appreciate having one of these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible smell","review":"Believe the reviews about a bad chemical smell. I could smell it very strongly immediately after opening the box, and every time I try to boil water in it the smell gives me an instant headache, and after trying to drink beverages made with it I get a scratchy throat for a few hours. It's been cycled over 20 times and it still has the same smell just as strong as day 1. Do not buy it unless you are not affected by strong smells. The people saying we are crazy or that it has no smell must have either gotten a good batch or worked in a glue factory to the point where they wouldn't notice. Calling Capresso yields the familiar \\"lemon juice, vinegar, baking soda\\" spiel. It's fairly obvious they get calls about it constantly if they train their techs to advise those remedies, which do not work at all anyway. I can't warn against it strongly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Capresso glass water kettle","review":"I am very satisfied with the Amazon service and the product myself. Helped my dad research this to purchase for my mom. She is very satisfied with the glass kettle, since we had previously used seen (& used) it at a family members house.Quick boiling, safe to touch after heating and just the right size make this water heater very sweet. Amazon did a great job delivering it to the right address and kept me informed of its progress. For this product, Amazon did a great job!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast Hot Water","review":"Reliable, very convenient, and fast. Water is boiling by the time I get the tea bag in the cup."},{"rating":"2","title":"Follow the directions","review":"I've been using my new Capresso for about 2 weeks at least once a day. There are several reviews posted here that say the water has a bad smell and taste. Apparently the folks who posted those reviews may not have read the directions. It says not to leave water in the kettle after you heat it up. Many of the reviews for the other tea kettles say the same thing. If you don't leave the water in the kettles after you pour out your water for the tea or coffee, your water will taste just fine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"I purchased this kettle on October 12, 2008 from Amazon because I liked the look. However, not long after I purchased it, the switch would not turn off after the water boiled. The water would cool down and then start to boil again. I had to manually turn the swith off. Not long after that, the switch stopped working completely (just before Christmas), and now this kettle is no longer useable. This was not a cheap product, but it is cheap quality. My old stainless steel kettle lasted for years until I finally replaced it with this one, which lasted a little over 2 months. Absolute waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY -- Persistent Chemical Odor","review":"All of the plastic parts have a strong chemical odor. This was reduced somewhat after sponging with soapy water, but still remains. The steam also carries the strong smell.The odor comes not only from the external plastic parts, but is also on the inside of the lid and from the rubbery sealer inside the carafe, which comes in contact with the water.I've tried boiling a dozen batches of water, I've tried cleaning with vinegar, and with soap. I don't know whether it will eventually go away, but really, I shouldn't *have* to worry about this. It should have been taken care of by the manufacturer.Given safety issues with other made-in-China products, I have no confidence in this device and I'm surprised and disappointed by Capresso."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEAUTIFUL, efficient kettle","review":"I've had this kettle for a year and absolutely love it. I wanted to move away from my plastic kettle and I'm glad I did because the water tastes better out of this one. It did smell for the first few days, but I expected that. I put some vinegar water in it, then lemon water, and never had a problem after that (although one of those combos foams up a bit...I can't recall which...so watch out!). My only complaint is that the inside heating element at the bottom is changing color a bit, which is probably my fault because I tend to not empty it right away. I am SO glad I got this water kettle!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Electric Kettle","review":"Since I already have this product in my home, I wanted another for my summer house. When I was away all summer, I missed it! It's fast and you can watch the water boil."},{"rating":"1","title":"dangerous ketlte","review":"I had a scary experience with this kettle. I poured a cup of hot water for tea one day before the water had come to a complete boil. I emptied the kettle and then, seeing that the indicator light was \\"off\\", assumed the kettle was off and set it back on its base. Three or four hours later I went to put water in the kettle for more tea, and the kettle sizzled! It was HOT. All that time it had sat empty with the on-off light OFF, and the kettle was heating. The kettle has no safety mechanism for automatically turning off either when the kettle is removed from its base or when it is empty. I promptly stopped using the kettle and contacted the manufacturer, who told me that there was no defect; that was how the kettle was designed. I asked the telephone representative to tell me what the purpose of the on-off light was, if one could not tell by looking at it whether the kettle is on or off. He had no answer. I don't recommend this kettle to anybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"quit working after six months","review":"I bought this mostly because I felt it looked attractive. Like some of the other reviewers mention, it does emit a foul odor (I think from the rubber ring around the heating element). Another other thing I don't like about this product are that although it looks like chrome, it isn't. Instead, a chrome-like thin wrap has been sealed to whatever is beneath it. After using the kettle a few times, the chrome-like wrap on the lid cracked/crinkled up, and it looks cheap. When it worked, it did boil water very quickly, however after about six months it quit boiling water, and now just heats it up a little. Despite its good looks, I deffinately do not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glass Shattered","review":"The kettle worked well for about a month. Appeared well designed and boiled quickly, but..... My wife was using the kettle to boil water for tea and the glass shattered as she picked it up. Luckily, she wasn't scalded. I won't be buying another one of these kettles. I don't want to risk another accident and there are other designs that work just as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty but horrible quality.","review":"I got this teapot because i thought it looked amazing and it does when it boils but it is so cheaply made. If you drink tea a lot like me (i boil it at least twice a day this product is not for you). We had to return the first one we got after a week because it started coming apart at the seems. The second one is about 2-3 month and has cracks already. When it doesn't have too much water in it and you turn it on it will keep on boiling that water over and over and over again till you manually turn it off. It wont shut down on its own. I'm very disappointed by the product and sad that I cant return it. It is really not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works Perfectly but Broke too soon","review":"We bought this product as a Christmas gift to ourselves. It worked perfectly and very stylish on the kitchen counter. However, it died after only two months of regular use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks Great - Smells and Tastes Bad","review":"Kettle looks great and heats water quickly. Unfortunately, a bad chemical odor and taste is imparted to the water, possibly from a piece of plastic in the bottom. After boiling over 20 kettles of water, some with vinegar and some with lemon juice as directed by Capresso customer service, we still had bad odor and taste. Capresso customer service never answered any questions about the plastic and what it was made of. We finally gave up and returned it. BTW, its made in China."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're trying to avoid plastic, don't buy","review":"This is truly a beautiful kettle. It's fast-- I can hardly get my tea ready before it's boiling. However, if your goal is to avoid plastic of any kind, please do not buy this. After one year's use, the top metal of the lid near the pouring spout is peeling back to reveal some sort of plasticky substance underneath. We've used it almost daily for a year. I expected better than this, and I'm now looking for a combination stainless and glass kettle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Capresso glass kettle","review":"I think the kettle is fabulous! It is cool to watch, quick to heat water, and easy to operate. I love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"falls apart within a year","review":"I bought this kettle about one year ago. I loved the look and did not have any problems with smell. I use a kettle several times a day, each day. By month 3 the light on the on/off switch quit working. By month 6, the silver lid fell off into my cup. The glue came off the plastic black part which it was attached to. Then by month 9, it completely stopped working. I took it back to the kitchen store I purchased it from and it was quickly replaced with the exact same model. If it falls apart again, I will throw away and replace with another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"hmmm.....","review":"Indeed, this electric water kettle was a nice piece of machinery, but the prevalent stink of hot plasticy chemicals didn't fade over time as I had hoped. Through many a filling and many a heating, the dome inside the pot turned a rusty brown and I worried whatever was occurring to the metal was being transferred to my water and consequently to my belly. I tried gently scrubbing with a kitchen sponge, with the scrubby side and the soft side, but nothing came off. I was still alarmed. Is it my water, or is it my kettle?So when, after about a year of use, I made my morning cup of tea and soon after went to re-heat the pot, without a sound a whimper a click or a beep it failed to turn on. Am I surprised that the appliance at hand broke after such a short amount of time? Not really. Am I disappointed that I spent $69.00 dollars on said tea kettle? Quite. I shall be buying a stove top kettle once again! I am reformed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great kettle","review":"I've had this kettle for two years now.

We use it several times a day for making tea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Pretty to Not Buy","review":"So I cautiously bought this despite all the reviews that mention the horrible plastic smell. And yes - it in fact does smell bad. I've had it for 3 weeks and I can still smell the plastic after I'm done boiling water. However, it only SMELLS bad, it doesn't taste any different or plastic-y at all. And let's face it - it is far too gorgeous to let a bit of poisonous fume here and there bother you."},{"rating":"2","title":"water kettle","review":"I mainly like the design. I think it looks nice.

Both started with the chemical smell that others have referred to but either I was luckier in cleaning these or they have more sensitive noses that we do. However, both simply stopped working after about two years of admittedly heavy use (probably 4x/day). Taking the base apart and scraping the contacts to remove oxidation seems to buy a little more time, but eventually these kettles stop responding to that treatment as well. I'm still looking for a kettle that puts no plastic in contact with hot water; suggestions welcome!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Imparts bad taste to water","review":"This Glass Water Kettle was ideal in most ways, with one major exception.

It will only last 1 year.","review":"We got this electric teakettle for our wedding gift and we loved it at first. It's nice looking and worked well. But I kid you not, it just stopped working for absolutely no reason, and we are JUST outside our 1 year warranty on the thing. Almost like there is some hidden mechanism inside to break as soon as the limited warranty is up. We wrote to the company and they offered a discount on a replacement. Seriously, the thing is brand new. Don't spend the money on this one. Just buy a cheap one, that way if it breaks at least you didn't spend that much."},{"rating":"1","title":"tea water tastes like toxic waste","review":"I decided to buy a glass teapot because I wanted to stop drinking out of heated-up plastic. I read the reviews about a funny smell and taste in some people's, but not everyones, then read someone's who has a keen sense of smell and said it was fine, it's only the lid that smells bad. My experience-- the element inside is what makes it taste and smell nasty-- I would only have water in there long enough to heat up, and it would ruin it every time! I used it for a couple weeks, hoping it would go away, but it didn't, so I returned it. Boo."},{"rating":"1","title":"chemical smell still a problem","review":"I saw the positive review on America's Test Kitchen (Cooks Illustrated) as well as the negative reviews here regarding the chemical taste/smell. I noticed that America's Test Kitchen was still using it, and assumed that the problem must have been resolved, so bought this in January 2010.Well, I was wrong - so wrong! The chemical taste problem is still present. It appears to come from a plastic gasket around that shiny heating element inside the kettle. I tried boiling multiple pots of water daily for a month. I tried letting it just sit unused with the lid open for two more months. The taste/smell is just as bad as the day it arrived."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted only 15 months","review":"We loved our beautiful Capresso water kettle--until it broke! We used it roughly once per day to heat water for coffee and tea. However, it failed after just 15 months; while the barely-visible blue light would come on, the kettle was still cold.With a multimeter, I found the heating element died and shows no conductivity. (The kettle is surprisingly well-designed and easy to dismantle, as if it were intended to be repaired, unlike most consumer devices.) Since the element is a custom part and the warranty has expired, I expect it will be cheaper and less hassle to replace the whole thing with a Krups, which we hope will last longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Capresso - Great Boiler, Bad Chemical Smell","review":"This tea kettle looks great, boils fine, but has a strong, chemical odor that does not go away. Odor aside, I am concerned that whatever causes the smell is polluting the water. This is a huge miss, the manufacturer had to know about this defect. The culprit appears to be the clear rubber ring at the bottom of the kettle that is exposed to the water. As a secondary point, the kettle also does not have a chime when it is complete boiling, as do other kettles."},{"rating":"1","title":"One year later...","review":"It was a good kettle for a while. Our water is very hard. I will admit that. However, my husband found a crack this morning in the glass and I don't care how hard our water is and how that might affect the glass, that shouldn't happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible product - do not buy","review":"The number one problem is that something leeches chemicals into the water. The water tastes absolutely disgusting, and there is a very strong nasty odor from it as well. I compared it with the taste and smell if I boil the water on a stove top kettle - and of course that water tastes and smells perfectly fine. Basically, you are probably ingesting all sorts of poisonous chemicals that are leeching into the water as the kettle boils, and especially if it sits there a while. This is a dangerous product!It doesn't even work that great because there is a blue light on the switch that is supposed to glow when you turn it on, and it doesn't. So you can't really tell just by looking at the light when the kettle is finished. I am absolutely returning this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nicely designed...EXCEPT PLASTIC TOP!","review":"This kettle is seemingly nicely designed, with modern lines. It boils water quietly and quickly. There's one flaw, though, which in our case was a deal-breaker. The inside of the top is plastic. During use, condensation on the underside drips into and contaminates the hot water with a plastic taste. In fact, our kitchen was filled with a burning plastic smell each time we used it! Rather ironically, our main goal in purchasing this kettle was reduce our exposure to plastics and plastic residues in our food. Fortunately, Amazon came to the rescue! After explaining what we perceived to be a design flaw, they emailed a post-paid return shipping label. End of story, but our search continues...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chemical Smell and Taste","review":"This kettle does have a chemical smell and imparts a chemical taste to the water. I suspect all these kettles have a checmical smell, just that some are more sensitive to it than others. I would consider myself sensitive. I ran multiple cleaning batches of water through the kettle. There was a slight decrease in the chemical smell, but not enough. If I can smell and taste chemical I have no interest in using it to boil water. I do not recommend this product because of the materials used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Esthetic and dysfunctional: it doesn't switch on","review":"I also bought this kettle a few months ago.

What a time saver!! I also agree with previous reviews regarding it's appearance as being very chic and unfortunately that it does have a smell at first, but the smell lasted less than a month. I like the glass because I can see when it needs to be cleaned which I need to do about every third use. That is my personal preference because we have hard water and I can \\"see\\" the residue on the glass and metal element. Cleaning takes less than a minute and is quite easy. I find this electric kettle to be worth it and want to purchase another one for my office. I would have given it a five star if not for the smell issue and the plastic cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful design, bad plastic lid","review":"After used this kettle for 6 months, the plastic lid was broken around the edge and the fake stainless steel coating became peeled off.

However, after using it for 6 months, I cannot recommend it because of what I believe to be a safety issue. I have watched my tea kettle bring water to a boil...and boil...and boil --without every shutting off automatically. This happened only once, but once is enough to deem it unreliable. To make matters worse, the little blue light that lights up when the \\"on\\" button is engaged is not readable in normal kitchen daylight. So I have to walk over and examine the \\"on/off\\" button closely to make sure it has turned off after getting the water to a rolling boil.

The big problem is the design of the handle. There are two small screws that hold the pot and top to the handle. These screws loosen constantly. You cannot put Loctite on them because of the heat generated by the tea pot will dissolve the bond. So we now keep a screw driver next to our tea pot to constantly tighten the screws. We have owned this tea pot for 6 months, and it keeps falling apart!This is a beautiful tea pot, but a waste of money! Even at $29.99, I would not order another one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I took it back.","review":"I should have listened to the bad reviews. I 'treated' myself to this kettle since I've been getting into tea lately, but what a mistake. After boiling, the once clean water has a chemical film on top, and smells of petroleum. I'm guessing it comes from the rubbery seal in between the metal heating element and the glass. I thought the smell and film would go away with time, or that maybe it was just impurities in my water, but no luck.To test, I boiled water in this kettle and in an old stainless steel pot I have (stovetop). When done, the Capresso water had nasty film and odor. The stovetop water was crystal clear.Kettle looks great!

The handle came off. Remedy was to get a free replacement from Capresso. Capresso has a web site. They advise lifting the lid if pouring out all of the water. The site states that the heating element cover is stainless steel (not plastic as one reviewer suggested).

I previously had a S/S electric kettle with a plastic \\"on switch\\" lever at the base of the unit which broke off. I purchased the Capresso because the \\"on switch\\" is on the handle and would not break off. This is advertised as having automatic shutoff. This is incorrect. If the kettle is empty you can accidentally switch it on and it will NOT shut off. (I returned one unit and was told it should not do this. The second unit has done the same thing so I believe it is an inherent design flaw.) On several occasions I have attempted to use it and found the unit quite warm as it had drawn power all night after being accidentally switched on.

After 3 weeks of usage the smell is still there.I came to conclusion that the source of the smell is the silicone gasket that is located between the glass and the heating element.

It was beautiful, it heated the water quickly, the underside did not get hot on the counter....but it had an unacceptable after taste in the water.I am so disappointed, but had to return it. I thought at first it was the new smell of the kettle, but it was not. I used several mild solutions of white vinegar thinking it was again the newness of the kettle...but it was not.

Anyway, I was very happy with this product until it started leaking around the seal at the base, and dripping, after about 9 months use. Then a month or so later, it just quit working altogether, other than the blue light going on. Also that blue light is way too dim to see in the daytime, not very helpful. It did turn off automatically when done boiling, but the steam seemed to have peeled away some of the covering on the lid. Very unhappy with the kettle for the expensive price I paid.

Our coffee is much more flavorful now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big fat NO to the Capresso kettle...","review":"Unfortunately, cannot recommend....Bought the Capresso Electric Tea Kettle as a Christmas gift, and it worked beautifully! So fun to watch, so beautiful on the counter - so nice to control the temperature of the water at the flick of a switch - and be able to SEE how close we were to boiling.However after using the kettle for several rounds of hot water (maybe 10), there was a strong chemical scent in the air which we realized came from inside the kettle. The smell is a bit industrial - like plastic and electric wires when hot. I use pure spring artesian spring water which I gather at the local artesian spring, so I know it was not initial water quality causing this smell. After a week of boiling baking soda and water in the kettle (hoping to eliminate the off-odor), I took it back to the store. Nothing we did improved the situation.I'll get a different brand.

We had our for about six months before it stopped working. You may think that sounds bad, but we literally operate our kettle about 5-10 times per day. So it underwent a great deal of use, and I think I got my money's worth. I think I'll still try a different kettle this time around though. The major downer of this kettle for me was the size. We had to refill it quite a lot. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and poorly made","review":"I liked this kettle when I saw it a friend's house. Watching the water come to a boil is fun and it looks beautiful. However, after two years, the lid has fallen apart. It's made of cheap, crummy plastic, as is the handle. There is no chrome or metal on the lid or handle. I'm surprised the product is listed as having \\"polished chrome,\\" when it's just shiny plastic. The silver plastic part of the lid has fallen off, and the black plastic inside lid has broken in two, so you can't pour the boiling water safely. In addition, the metal heating element inside the kettle is discolored. Just don't buy this product. Keep looking for a better kettle."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"We have had this kettle for less than 4 months. Last week, the kettle started shutting off before water boiled. This is happening on a daily basis and is very frustrating especially since sending it back to the manufacturer would mean signficant amount of money on shipping it. Not happy about this product at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"love this pot!","review":"I am so surprised at all of the negative reviews. I bought this from a local store for $39 but even at that was hesitant because of the numerous complaints from Amazon customers. I am so glad I decided to try it anyway because I love it! It does occassionally have a little odor....yes there is a silcone seal but come on folks, it is a neutral so is not going to harm you! I have used it every day, several times a day without any problems. In fact, I liked it so well I went back out a week ago and bought another one to have for when I totally wear this one out. $39 is worth it to me for as much as I use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Capresso H20 Kettle","review":"We have had our kettle for 2 years and it has not let us down.

We have at Capresso coffee grinder also and are happy with it too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic smell is really strong","review":"I bought this kettle at a local store before reading reviews. It doesn't smell initially but once you heat up water the smell is awful! Like another reviewer stated, if you can smell it imagine what it's releasing into the water you'll be drinking. It looks really nice and does heat up water very fast - a lot faster than the Toastmaster kettle I've had for years - but I'm sure many/most of the new kettles have a fast heating time. So I've returned mine and am currently looking through my other options."},{"rating":"1","title":"very cheaply made/top comes apart","review":"I bought two of these kettles. I didn't find they smelled, but after a bit of use the shiny top, held onto the black plastic top which lifts, fell off. There's a tiny, cheap bit of black plastic which is supposed to hold the pieces together, and, despite meticulous care in use, it broke, probably from the heat of the kettle in normal use. After a short time the same thing happened to the second kettle. The kettle is pretty, and has relatively limited contact of hot water with plastic, but doesn't hold up. Don't buy unless you want to replace it every few months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful at first, but doesn't last","review":"I bought this kettle for my parents who drink lots of tea. At first I was really mesmerized with this kettle -- I'd literally sit and just watch the water boil. The water heats up quickly and the capacity is sufficient for everyday use.However, after a few weeks, the water began to leave white scale on the glass. I know it's easy enough to clean with vinegar, but is just kind of a hassle to have to keep doing this. After a few months, the fake chrome paint began to peel off the handle. After about 9 months, the inner metal heating element began to discolor and rust. At which point I replaced it with something not as flashy, but more reliable."},{"rating":"1","title":"water tastes strange","review":"I ignored the negative reviews about this kettle because it looks so good, and some people seemed entirely happy with it. I used it for a week, but the funny plastic smell and taste to the water never went away. It's a shame, because otherwise it performed well. I returned it to amazon and I'm now looking for a replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"looks good, smells bad","review":"I was so happy with this kettle, it looks good, the handle is great, I like how it has bumpers under, so you can remove it, and set it down softly anywhere. But there is that chemical smell, I thought it would go away after a few uses, but now I've been using it every day for 2 or 3 weeks, and the smell is still there, I feel like I'm drinking some plastic emissions....There is a plastic gasket in the bottom, between the metal and the glass, and the lid inside is plastic. Be aware of this. I bought the glass kettle as I thought it would be all glass.... can't really recommend this..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks can be deceiving","review":"I ordered this kettle specifically to avoid heating up water in plastic. However, this kettle emitted a foul chemical odor that also transferred to the water. I boiled it a few times plus tried the water/vinegar suggestion in the brochure but nothing seemed to help. I decided that I didn't want to take the risk of drinking these unknown chemicals so I'm returning it - it's not worth the risk. I can't figure out if it's coming from the \\"stainless steel\\" bulb (that feels like plastic to me if you tap on it) that covers the heating element or the plastic seal between the glass & the bulb. Plus the lid has a stong odor too & that is plastic covered in \\"stainless steel\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous","review":"I had mine for about 8 months and then the handle fell off while I was pouring a full kettle of boiling water into a teapot. I was lucky not to be badly burned. The handle is held to the lid with two small screws that are screwed into plastic. It looks cool, and maybe mine was somehow defective, but watch out (especially if you have small kids who might be in the way of the boiling flood)."},{"rating":"2","title":"totally pleased","review":"My biggest rave is the Amazon.com customer service. I fell in love with the look of this kettle and found the best price on Amazon.com (with free shipping!) When it arrived, it only worked if the kettle was oriented one way on the base -- when it boiled, the water dribbled on the cord. Called Capresso Cust Svc -- 1st person said, it's supposed to do that. After another week, it got worse. Capresso would replace it if I paid it's shipping back to them. Called Amazon.com, got another in the mail days later, post-paid shipping back the first one to them. Wow! This kettle works just fine. Very rapid boiling of water, no complaints about anything. To keep the glass and that silver dome shiny, you do need to do the vinegar thing every now and again. Couldn't be happier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great - BUT be careful when cleaning it!","review":"I bought this last January (of 2006) through Amazon, and it was used several times daily for well over a year without showing any signs of wear. Very durable and extremely fast at boiling water.It died on me last week though when I decided to wipe off the base - it was getting a bit dirty from the kitchen counter. One small spot of water got into the exposed electronics in the base and it shorted out. I never submerged it obviously, but it appears to not enjoy cleaning of any kind. Silly me, to leave it plugged in when I was wiping it down. A damp rag was enough to kill it.I'll buy a new one though, it was a workhorse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous!","review":"I paid approximately $90.00 for this kettle in May 2010.I bought it mainly because it looked nice and had a few options for water temprature.Last week I had boiled water for tea and as soon as the motor turned off, I picked up the kettle to pour water in my teapot! The handle came off and the pot itself landed on my counter and broke!!! The kettle broke when it was filled with HOT BOILING water! I was wearing jeans and managed to splash some on my clothes, but because of wearing jeans I only had a red patch on my thigh!I then spent about 20 minutes picking up glass shards and mopping my floor!This product is dangerous! NOT recommended!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really cheap","review":"This gorgeous looking kettle with a list price of $100 has extremely cheap and shoddy finishing. The top is made of plastic, not metal, with a thin layer of metallic-colored film to give the look of chrome. One year into use, the film is peeling off and looks really tacky. The handle on the top has also given up, with the plastic screw snapping in two. I am so disappointed: at $100, I expected use of more than a year and I simply can not believe that the manufacturer saved so much money that it was worth ruining a potentially great product. A metal top and screw in the handle would have had me enjoying it for a long time. Too bad..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Functional and handsome.","review":"I really like this kettle, which is beautiful as well as functional. Having read previous comments before purchasing, I was a bit concerned about the odor people mentioned. I found it hardly noticeable, and fading over the month or so that I've had the kettle - not a problem for me. The design is excellent - the kettle itself is just the right size, the measurement marks are easily visible as the kettle is being filled. It pours very well, and is comfortable to hold - well balanced. Also, the design of the lid eliminates the danger of steam burns, while pouring. The only design element I might change is the color of the light that signals the kettle is on. It is blue which is difficult to see against the black handle; red or white would be more visible. Otherwise, it boils water quickly, looks elegant on the counter, and hopefully will last a very long time. I'm glad I chose this one - it replaces another brand's kettle I'd used for years, which had accidentally burned out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful, but the auto-off is not realiable","review":"This kettle is beautiful. I'd have given it 5 stars if the function was as nice as the looks.However, I have often found that the heat has been on all day long without my knowledge because the \\"on\\" light is not very vibrant. On vs. off is blue vs. green and only very slightly lights up. I do not know why it stays on in the first place. It is supposed to auto-shut-off when it reaches boiling.Suggestions to manufacturer:-Make the auto-off foolproof.-change the color of the \\"on\\" vs. \\"off\\" lights to make it VERY obvious when it is still on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad smell","review":"The Kettle looks good but smells very bad.

They agreed to exchange but told me I have to pay shipping and no guarantee the new one will be better.I would not recommend this product. Returning to the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"toxic smell from plastic lid","review":"The toxic smell is coming from the plastic lid. The water boils, steam rises, and you get plastic molecules in the water. The water was horrible tasting! Several times I used a baking soda paste on the inside of the lid (setting the kettle carefully in a bowl, on its side), which helped a lot, but I still had to put a teacup cover under the lid to prevent the water from touching the lid. Then I read the review about using charcoal. I emptied 2 capsules of charcoal, filled the kettle with water and boiled it twice. Now the smell is still slightly detectable from the lid itself, but the water tastes fine. A lot of hassle just to get the smell out! The company could have used a food grade plastic and saved themselves a lot of money on all the returns. Could have been a fabulous product.To follow up: I ended up returning this, as the bad taste never completely went away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke in less than 2 months","review":"The seal in the bottom has sprung a leak.

Died after just over one year of use - past the warranty :-("},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have bought Cloer","review":"I bought the glass Capresso kettle but am unhappy with the small switch on the handle because you can't tell if the pot is on. It smells like hot plastic and was made in China; the glass is German Schott. The glass does not cover the heating element. The heating element is a stainless steel (or chrome) dome in the middle of the kettle that sits on what I believe to be a silicon ring. Thankfully, I can get my hand in there through the spout to wash it (I am 5'11\\" male). When it dies I will certainly replace it with Cloer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Capresso Lost a Sale","review":"I just want to let Capresso know they lost a sale because of the reviews about the odor.

It worked great for two weeks. Unfortunately, after that, the mechanism which keeps the lid open for pouring broke so the only way to pour out hot water is to hold it open with your thumb. Even though the lid is between my thumb and the steam, I still get burned if I use this pot. Other than that, it works fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love This Water Kettle!!","review":"I've had this product for a week now. I hand washed the glass kettle out with soap and water before using it. I've used it everyday and I've not experienced the \\"foul\\" smell that some people have experienced. The water heats up very quickly and I love the automatic shut off. The instructions tell you not to leave water sitting in the kettle but I've done it a couple of times by accident. I love this kettle over using a kettle on the stove. I highly recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great kettle!","review":"This is my first kettle, and I couldn't be happier. A bunch of us at the office are tea drinkers and have been stuck microwaving water for the past year. We decided to buy one, so i took advantage of my Prime account and bought this. Two days later we're all enjoying the sound of a rolling boil and great tea. Nothing negative at all so far. We'll see how it holds up, we go through 4-6 pots of water a day..."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't last","review":"I bought this kettle TWICE because I like the appearance and the comfort of the handle (unlike the big bulky Hamilton Beach I can hardly get my hand around). Both times it stopped working a few days after the warrantee expired. It sometimes didn't turn itself off. It has to be half full (cover the metal heating ball) to work at all. For the price, it's a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"No problem.","review":"This kettle looks nice and works well. I do not taste any plastic flavor in my hot drinks, but I can smell it when pouring the water out. The smell is caused by the underside of the plastic lid which is exposed to steam as the water heats , and which comes in direct contact with the boiling water when it is poured out.The solution is to lift the lid to its vertical position before pouring; this avoids direct contact with the water, eliminates the smell, and has the added benefit of protecting the fingers from steam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shorted out after a year and a half","review":"I really enjoyed this kettle - it's beautiful and functional. However, mine just shorted out (big sparks flashing inside the kettle) - kind of cool, but very disappointing after only a year and a half of use. And I have to say that I too have been troubled by the chemical smell, and can't bring myself to re-order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lemon!!!","review":"I purchased two of these and that was a mistake. The unit looks really nice but it is not very easy to use. You have to try and get the kettle just right on the heating element and really mess around with it to get it to work. Not an easy item to use and definitely would not recommend this to anyone for purchase. Just purchased the Saeco kettle and love it. So much better!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stops working","review":"We've been using this electric kettle here at our office for the past few months. About 3 months after we got it, it started having difficulty catching the \\"on\\" position. Now, 4 months in, it doesn't work at all. What a waste! I have the stainless steel Aroma kettle at home, and it's both cheaper and more durable. I'd recommend getting that one instead of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reviews are right--horrible smell!","review":"VERY disappointed with this beautiful electric tea kettle. The smell is HORRIBLE. I have tried and tried to rid the kettle of it with vinegar, etc, etc, to no avail. I feel like I am drinking carcinogens. Like there aren't enough already in our environment. It is a very attractive kettle and works beautifully, but I will have to pack it away. I wish I had read these reviews before purchasing!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't last","review":"I bought the kettle about 2 years ago and use it once a day. It does boil water quickly, and I haven't ever noticed the odor others mention. However, over the time of my ownership of this product, it has gradually fallen apart. First the on/off switch lost its power-on indicator, then the top of the kettle refused to stay open, now the little knob on the top of the kettle has broken off. I've also noticed that an empty kettle will sometimes warm up when it's plugged in, even if the power switch is off...dangerous. Now that I've read the reviews reporting that the handle can suddenly disengage from the hot kettle, I'm going to retire this one and find another brand. I've been very gentle with this appliance, but it just isn't built to last."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it!","review":"First one I received did not work but a replacement was sent immediately and I got it 3 days later, so no complaint there. Works perfectly - amazingly fast and energy efficient, compared with boiling water on my electric stove, with all the wasted heat from the still-glowing burner (safer too, obviously, as there's no glowing burner after boiling is completed). One tip others seem not to have mentioned: if you leave the lid in the open position after pouring out all the excess hot water, the residual warmth of the glass totally dries the inside of the carafe in minutes! This is a very cool thing, like it's \\"self-cleaning.\\" I give it only four stars because of the residual plastic odor (although I don't think it gets into the water itself) and the lid, which seems like it could be easily breakable if you accidentally pushed it back too far. All in all, happy with the purchase of this beautiful and very functional kettle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good once you properly build it.","review":"I bought two of these (about 1 year apart) in the last year or so. The first one came with an improperly built base--I bought it online. I had to pull out my screwdriver and take it apart--and found that whoever built the thing didn't properly build it--they left a key plastic part that holds the electrical connector steady against the kettle disconnected. So I got it working and it worked great for about a year.Then the heating element died on it. I liked the glass kettle aspect of this, and this is one of the few I've seen with that feature, so I bought another one from a different supplier (local chain store), and it had the same defect in assembly. The exact same defect. So I again repaired it and it works fine so far.Not much more to say about it, except I don't know why they can't assemble it correctly. I'd probably give it 4 stars otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chemical smell persists","review":"This product is not designed well in that you have a silicone seal at the bottom which is in contact with the heating element. As a result, there is a very noticeable [chemical] smell after repeated use although I have not detected any after taste. But, like another reviewer stated, this doesn't make any difference. It's the fact that the seal is probably releasing some chemical into the water that is causing the odor and causing concern for me. I have purchased a replacement product (Krups) that has a STAINLESS STEEL, sealed vessel with nothing in contact with the water. It's a shame b/c it is nice to look at and heats water in no time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Capresso Glass water kettle","review":"i am very dissapointed in this product! all i can taste is plastic! why would you even sell this?Well i guess it goes back to you get what you pay for!

If I knew they would go for a couple of yrs, I'd get another since it's been great otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Capresso makes this S/;(T?","review":"I used to think Capresso meant quality. We've had their high end coffee centers for years, and although the machines are high maintenance, they keep decently well and their customer service is great. Same was true once Capresso and Jura joined forces. Not so with this crappy product. First off, the heating element rusted within less than a month. These were not sedimentation and settling spots as I was told by customer service-- I followed the directions precisely with white vinegar and vigorous scrubbing. While the film on the heating element did come off, the rust DID NOT. That was the major complaint.The overall build of this thing is totally shoddy, too. After several months of use, I ended up with the lid in one hand and the pot in the other (they're supposed to be connected by a screw which ended up in my cup!!)Capresso- I'm really disappointed. My $10 Walgreens hotpot in college was better made!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke down after 7 months!","review":"Beware! I loved this tea kettle until it stopped working after 7 months!

I've had 2 fail in the same way. The heating element dies after about a year. Cappresso replaced my first one but informed me upon replacement that they would not replace the 2nd one should it fail also. The pot will heat a little and then stop and then heat a little and stop. It will keep doing this until you unplug it as the automatic shut-off does not engage as it never boils. The glass will stay hot during this process. It's a shame because when it worked it was fast, reliable and an attractive little electric kettle. Clearly there is a problem that the company does not seem interested in fixing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lingering Chemical Smell","review":"As many other reviewers have noted, this product comes with a strong chemical smell. I have owned it for about 2 months, and while the smell has weakened, it is still noticeable. I boiled a mixture of white vinegar and water several times to try to neutralize the smell without any success.I have not noticed any \\"off\\" flavors in my tea, so I continue to use it.

But, the glass carafe was so attractive, I chose to ignore them and get it anyway. Big, mistake. After 6 months the smell and taste were still there in every pot of hot water. I had to toss it and go back to a more conventional plastic model. It's a shame, because it's beautiful when the water is boiling and you can see it through the glass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I purchased this product in March of 2010. Although it really looks nice and takes up little counter space, it is very cheaply made. The lid looks like chrome/metal, but it just cheap plastic. I had a feeling it wouldn't last long. I was right, the lid completely broke off last week. I can still use it as I can just put the lik onn top, but pouring boiling water from it is now not very safe. If I don't remember to hold the lid in place, it falls off and all the hot steam from the boiling water goes right to my pouring hand. I've had a couple of good steam burn from it. So, my assessment, for the cost, it is just not worth it. Stick with a good electrice hot water kettle that is really metal and won't break."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank you reviewers","review":"Thank you everyone for your reviews I was going to buy a kettle because of the cool design but knowing about the horrific customer service and foul smell, I am looking at another brand.

Quote from Consumer Product Safety Commission : \\"The handle can detach from the glass carafe, spilling hot water and causing severe burn injuries.\\"After using this kettle for 3 years, the handle snapped off as I lifted it up - and I missed being scalded by sheer luck. If I had lifted it off the counter and the kettle did not happen break off on a basket full of onions, it would have smashed on the floor and who knows how badly I would have been hurt. So dangerous!! The only time you would ever lift up this kettle is when it is full of scalding water - which is when the handle would snap.I contacted the manufacturer, but after asking for my serial number and therefore, knowing exactly that my kettle was defective, they failed to inform me of this recall, and tried to sell me a new kettle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Looking High Functioning","review":"This is another great looking and high functioning product from Capresso.

Thank you for your reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to love this kettle...","review":"This kettle was most highly reviewed in Cook's Illustrated, which has never steered me wrong with kitchen tool recommendations. I also had hoped that the reviews on Amazon that mentioned the chemical smell might have been a little overblown. However, they're true. I really loved the kettle design and functioning, but I think the rubber gasket on the base of the kettle is the culprit. Even when the water had cooled off and sat in the kettle for an hour or so, you can lift the lid and smell something vaguely like shower curtain liner. Serious bummer. For the folks at Capresso: replace that gasket with something hardier, and you'll rule the kettle world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"I bought this from Amazon on November 15, 2010. Today is January 23, 2011, and the kettle won't boil the water. The light on the handle comes on, so I know it's getting power to the unit, but...no boiling water. This is my second Capresso; the first one lasted a little over 8 months, but I thought maybe I had just gotten a 'lemon.' Since I liked everything else about the Capresso, I decided to order another one. Well, this one will be the LAST Capresso I ever buy. They just don't last!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware Handle Not Polished Chrome but foil on plastic","review":"This kettle is advertised on Amazon as \\"Polished Chrome\\" It is polished chrome in color only. It has some type of chrome colored plastic foil overlay on a plastic handle. I've used the kettle for approx. 9 months and recently noticed that the handle was separating right above the on/off switch on the handle, making the switch somewhat balky at times. Closer inspection shows that the \\"polished chrome\\" is bubbling up and peeling off. When I contacted the mfgr. since it it still under the one year warranty I was told that they discontinued the real polished chrome a while ago. If the handle is only plastic wrapped in foil you can be sure that the cover is made of the same cheesy material as well. I would not purchase this product again, nor would I ever recommend it to a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"I bought a Capresso H2O and used it for about 3 days. The foul odor others report was indeed a problem, but I did not get to see if it would clear up since, for no reason other then simply the heat of the water, the glass cracked around the handle. I read the warranty and found that the unit is guaranteed except for cracks in the glass carafe. I had thought that Capresso would have designed it with enough thickness and heat resistance to function for a reasonable product life. I guess they did not. Don't buy one of these. It is a bad design and a bad product through and through."},{"rating":"2","title":"works great after 2 years","review":"This kettle is very efficient and fast. After reading earlier reports about smells, since day one, it's been used almost exclusively with filtered water, and as a result, there have been no smell issues. I do agree with reviewers that the plastic lid comes apart easily, but some good-quality glue fixed that. The other complaint is that the blue \\"on\\" light is so faint that it's nearly invisible in a not-so-bright kitchen; a light with more contrast would be a big benefit. Still, it's been a solid performer and boasts an attractive design."},{"rating":"2","title":"clearly boiling","review":"This all glass electric kettle has only one flaw and that is the plastic lid. The lid emits a smell that we have found we can reduce by lifting the lid before we pour the water out. Will the plastic smell diminish as the product ages? We hope so. Otherwise, we are happy with the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice... while it worked","review":"I bought this kettle in November 2009, I enjoyed using it but one morning I went to turn it on and it would not heat the water... To possibly get a replacement I need to pay for shipping from California to New Jersey and wait. I'd rather buy a new and different kettle that, hopefully would last longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful kettle, ruined by the smell of plastic","review":"As others have mentioned, the water has a strong smell of plastic. It's definitely the plastic or silicone ring around the heating ball.Too bad, because it's beautiful and it heats up very quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Capresso depresso","review":"I have purchased two of these dogs on Amazon. The first one worked for a couple of years, then simply quit working altogether. Wasn't sure whether it was the kettle or the base, discovered it was the kettle. Got a new one. I've had it about 6 months and this morning it boiled a great batch of water for coffee, then when I wanted some tea a bit later it was dead. I'll never buy another item from Capresso...nada."},{"rating":"1","title":"Capresso H2O glass water kettle","review":"Got the kettle for Christmas. Looks beautiful and boils water quickly. However, the smell coming from the unit is unbearable. We boiled water several times and emptied the contents thinking the smell could be residue from the factory, but it didn't help. Called the company and the customer service rep knew exactly what I was going to say almost before I said it. He suggested we boil the water with some lemon juice. We did and it didn't help. We are returning the kettle. It isn't worth worrying about the chemicals that may be leaching into the hot water."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"Great water kettle. Had one for about five years when my husband broke the lid, and did not hesitate to buy the same one again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice concept with a smell of plastic","review":"What a nice idea - a glass kettle, the one you can see through boiling. Nice design as well. Main problem is that the heating element is surrounded by a plastic ring, which produce quite a noticeable smell of plastic when boiling water. We used it for a weak hoping that the smell will go away, but it didn't. Many kettles has plastic parts, but this seems to be the only one where plastic directly contacts heating element, not just water. And of course, bad stuff goes from plastic to your water along with the smell, but this is only for those who are concerned about health. My point is that this smell just ruins taste of all kinds of tea.Also, two minor things- it takes about 2 times longer to boil that other comparable kettles (still fast, actually)- nice an stylish blue light, which indicates that the kettle is on is not as visible as in other models."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problem with smell and auto-start","review":"I recently bought one from World Market and returned it. The rubber smell was too strong and did not get any better after cleaning it over and over. Also on several occasions it started by itself so I could never leave it with cord plugged in.We have cuisinart which works great however it brakes down after a while. I went through 2 of them so far. We still have one for upstairs. I bought a Hamilton Beach (SS 10 cup) from Costco for downstairs. It works perfect. I am not sure if it will breakdown anytime soon, but at least it is not as expensive and does not have any foul smell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful but Flawed","review":"This kettle is so beautiful and it heats water so quickly that I hate to give it a bad review. I have owned it for about a year and use it at least twice a day. Yesterday it turned itself on and boiled dry. I didn't realize it was still on until I smelled melting plastic. I am still using it, but unplugging it after every use."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST - DO NOT BUY","review":"THIS IS THE WORST TASTING WATER EVER. For a $70 water kettle, I should expect much, much more. It should be against the law to sell such a disgusting, toxic gadget. Even my husband, who is not in the least concerned with toxicity and who seems to have few tastebuds, will not drink the water heated in this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped Working","review":"We got one of the more recent kettles, so we had not noticed any odd smell or taste to the water. It had been working fine for the first 6 months, but it suddenly stopped working all together."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy this!!!","review":"Looks can be deceiving as they say. This is a beautiful looking water kettle and for that reason I bought it. However, like others have said, there is a horrible chemical smell and taste when you boil the water. Even after I add sugar and milk in my tea, you can still taste a chemical. Not a good thing to say the least. This company should correct the problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recalled twice","review":"My capresso was recalled because the handle would break off. When I called capresso to get instructions for the recall, the rep was impatient and rude. But he was efficient because shortly my new water kettle arrived. I have had it for one year and it has stopped working. It won't turn on. When I called capresso, the rep said explained that there was another recall for an electrical problem but because I had a replacement kettle from the last recall, I was not eligible to receive another one. They would sell me one at a discounted price. After two recalls and no working water kettle, I have decided to buy another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissatisfied","review":"I loved the look for this tea kettle and the glass with the view of the water boiling but found that THE LID IS MADE OUT OF PLASTIC NOT METAL. When you boil the water the plastic stinks so bad you can't use the boiling water. Such a shame. I have looked at stores to see if they are all like this and so far all have plastic lids. I also wrote a memo to the company which they did not reply."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it.","review":"i love the way it look (it means a lot to me and my kitchen design), its fast, just right amount of water, boils water fasst, and. doen't splash water when pouring"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love tea, hate this kettle","review":"Ok, so maybe \\"hate\\" is a strong word. But, after two months of use, frequent cleanings with vinegar water, lemon, etc., the kettle still smells. There is a chemical odor to the kettle itself...but even worse is the chemical odor I can detect even after I steep my tea and add a little milk! I cannot imagine whatever is causing this smell is not harmful. My kettle is going back to the store. After reading many reviews about customer service nightmares, I'm not going to bother trying to return the product through the company. I certainly won't be purchasing another Capresso product. This is the FIRST time I have ever reviewed ANY product on Amazon...I wanted to warn any other future purchasers of this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Foul Odor and Not Reliable","review":"Like others mine arrived with a strong chemical odor. I bought this, in part, because i wanted to avoid boiling water in plastic. So much for avoiding chemicals. The odor dissipated with time but six months later there is still a faint odor. Looks better than most and boils water quickly but started to malfunction after several months. Turns itself off before the water is fully boiling then turns itself back on several minutes later. The water gets hot now, never boiling. Comes on all by itself so we have to leave it unplugged. Between the smell and malfunctions not reccomended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worried but got a good unit","review":"Got this for my wife Xmas 2012. I did not notice any weird taste or odor and she uses it almost every day. It takes about 2-3 minutes to boil a pot and is fairly handy .Additional use:Use this to heat up water and toss in a pot for cooking other items rather than heat up water on the stove. Can shorten prep/ cook time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"Can SEE the water boil, unlike the old-fashioned kettle. So it doesn't have to whistle to make known that the water is ready. VERY quick heating, as well. Use this for convenience in my home office on another floor from the kitchen."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Year Later","review":"I loved this kettle and did not have a problem with the chemical smell (as other reviews have commented). Perhaps I bought mine after they fixed that issue?It served me great for about six months so I bought a second oen for my father.SIx months later my kettle began to fall apart. A year later his did as well.Some of the issues:1. Metal heating element ball rusted2. Plastic cap over blue light fell off3. Chrome plastic cap over lid fell offUnits still work but no longer look pretty.At $60 I expected this to last longer than a year.I use it 3+ times a day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but then it died","review":"We bought this kettle for it's looks (I didn't like it but my husband loved it, so I said okay) and the fact that you could see the water in the kettle. I was not really happy with it at first but it grew on me and I liked it very well until the painted-on silver handle began to peel and show a cheap plastic material underneath. It was still a workhorse for the kitchen so we kept it of course. After only about a year's normal use the thing just died. It was a disappointment overall and cost way more than the real value of the product. I would not recommend this kettle to anyone. I give it 2 stars for at least working for a year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glass kettle is great","review":"This was the electric kettle recommended by Comsumer Search. My mother in law moved in with us and she likes all her beverages warm, so I wanted a unit that could stand up to repeated use every day. I'm glad I ordered it. A glass kettle is ideal- you can see the water level 30 feet away without needing to glare into a small gauge, you can see the stages of heating...so you can cut it off if you don't want a complete boil, it's very easy to clean, the 360 base allows it to be placed down simply, it heats water very quickly (about 5 min when full with cold water). The unit looks good, and becuase it's see though, it looks less intrusive than a stainless or plastic container.Some readers said they smell/taste a chemical scent from a faulty gasket or something. I've never had this problem, and I think you won't either, since it's all glass with a stainelss steel heating element. I'm extremely happy with this product- it has my recommendation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good outside, bad inside","review":"The design is very good, but it starts to smell plastic after a couple of usage.

I have tried and tried everythingto get rid of it all to no avail. I hate to do it but the kettle is going to be returned.I was going to buy one for my mom but after reading all of the comments no waywould I do that.Too bad too because it is very pretty but again looks can be deceiving!!Anyone else thinking of buying one - word of advice D O N \\" T !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great but light doesn't turn on any longer","review":"This electric kettle works great, boils water quick and shuts off automatically after boiling. It use to have a light that turns blue when you turn it on to boil, but stopped working after a month, although it still boils so not a big problem. I did notice a bit of a taste like a plastic or some kind of after taste but after we switched to soft water i did not have that taste any longer, even with my stove top kettle i had a taste to it so the soft water helps. I still love it and would recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"This kettle switches itself on and wastes a lot of energy","review":"This kettle tales a long time to heat up the water and then continues to turn itself on wasting lots of energy. Now I unplug it every time. Also it does not work with a small amount of water. Poor design overall. I am disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not recommend","review":"I agree with one of the previous reviews that looks can be deceptive as far as this kettle is concerned. Very poor quality. This pot basically disintegrated over the period of 6 months. First, the plastic power on button broke, steam started to escape through that opening so the foil on the handle and then on the lid peeled off. Capresso customer service sent me a replacement that went down exactly the same road. Would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls apart","review":"The silver piece on the lid to the kettle fell off in a matter of 12 months- the plastic piece to the blue turn off light on the handle broke off in a matter of weeks, and the chrom on teh handle is pealing off in a matter of 12 months. I liked that it was glass so calcium was less likely to develope on the inside - however the product is not manufactured well.I would not buy this product again...it easily fell apart on me. It barely lasted 12 months and I hardly washed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT","review":"I purchased this kettle after a recommendation from an associate. It is beautiful, heats quickly, and I had no trouble with a smell. However, after a year of use, the top fell off. I had taken care with this appliance but the plastic that holds the top just broke. I sent an email to customer service with no response at all. I didn't expect a new appliance but at least an acknowledgement of poor design. This is also a safety issue that could cause a bad burn. I will never buy one of their products again. A manufacturer should stand behind their product and Capresso certainly did not.C.Ely"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty But Doesn't Work","review":"I had bought one of these a few years ago, and it burned out pretty fast. Then Capresso took them off the market since there were so many problems. Now, I see it back on and think they must have solved the problems. It's such a beautiful kettle I tried it again. When you boil water, water leaks from the base, not the spout. That can't be good. Then I thought well that's not the worse thing. Then after about three weeks of using it, I started to smelling something burning and knew it was going to die. Lastly, if you have hard water, the metal heater turns white immediately. You have to use Durgol to clean it everyday to keep it shiny. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Stainless Steel\\" heating dome starting to rust.","review":"I have had this kettle for almost a year and small rest spots are starting to appear on the heating element dome. As this dome is advertised as \\"Stainless Steel\\" I'm not certain of their claim."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works wonderfully and looks great...","review":"All in all, this is a very nice water boiler. It works quickly and looks fantastic on our counter. It feels sturdy. Watching the water boil has not been this much fun since childhood.My only gripe is that there is no notification sound when the water HAS come to a boil. It just turns off. If you are in another room, you have no idea if it is done. That and if you have hard water, the steel heat plate at the bottom will show off the deposits quickly. It is easy to clean off but you must stay on it and clean it frequently.Over all, I give it a 4 out of 5 since there is no sound when the water finished boiling."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap lid","review":"I purchased this kettle to replace a 20 plus year old english kettle for my wife. The way the kettle operates is top notch.The main issue that makes it a failure is the plastic lids on these fall apart from the steam. If Capresso would make a stainless lid this kettle would be great."},{"rating":"1","title":"ODOR RUINS GREAT LOOKING KETTLE","review":"Well all electric kettles do the same thing they boil water.

Personally i don't think so but aside from that after 20 usings it still has an odor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Capresso H2O Plus Glass Water Kettle","review":"Purchased this kettle before I read all the reviews below. I agree with all the comments posted. There is an odor, however over time it does go -about 6 months. The most serious issue I believe is the handle coming loose. There are two small screws at the top that has come loose. I have rescrewed these but again they have come loose. This is a serious defect as the handle could dislodge and burn you."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent!","review":"I bought this mouthwash from the recomendation by Edgar Cayce in his readings.

Courtesy of filmmakers such as Richard and his \\"Perpetual Pictures\\" cohort, \\"Andrew Juncker\\" (whose style seems indicate that he is the Godard to Richard's Truffaut), those audiences unafraid to give low-budget independent cinema a shot have been treated to some truly special moments in post-9/11 celluloid history.

It was an easy book to read and explained things in ways that people not familar with ships can understand. It was great in giving you the basics of what tools you need to get started, what to look for in picking out a ship (especially early on as you do not want to pick one too diffcult which will dampen your spirit with hobby), definitions of many common terms, and the basics on most of the skills that are required to build your first ships. Basically this book builds a great foundation to start your hobby. As you move along in the hobby and get into more difficult ships, you can get additional books specific to certain skills which I would recommend. The more detailed books however, are just more detailed versions of the basic skills that are covered in this book. For anyone that is starting out, or thinking of starting out in the hobby, this book is a requirement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very much information ...","review":"I looked carefully at the \\"Look Inside\\" review.

She was my first choice from this series for the following reasons: her beautiful face and realistic (and trendy) curls, her adorably cute pink hairclip and silver hoop earrings, her pose-ability (as she has bendable arms), and her interesting fluffy pink dress. The attention to detail is marvellous; I was fascinated by her. She comes with a make-up stand in which you can store her tiny compact, perfume spray, lipstick, mascara wand and powder brush. These can also be carried along with her on modelling assignments in her sizeable pink carry-all. My only criticism is that as an aspiring model, she should realise that the shade of lilac-pink lipstick she is wearing is NOT flattering against her warm skin tones, otherwise, she's just about perfect!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Doll","review":"I have the original Nichelle doll and she is beautiful. I got her for my 14th birthday. I like how her hair is naturally curly instead of straight.

I think the positive hook angle and slightly thinner kerf really helped as this blade cuts much without slowing or burning, which the Forrest was doing.

I ended up replacing the Freud blade with a 60 tooth Dewalt and it makes as clean of a cut as the Freud when it was new and the Dewalt is about a third of the cost.

Most of the other recipes sound pretty good, too, though the silly recipe for scrapple clearly proves the author has never been to the Delaware Valley."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Can I Say..................","review":"If you love Billy, Carlos, & their new friend Tyson, you'll love this cute little book.

By the end of the story you forget they're only dolls and believe you're reading about real people. Quite an accomplishment by David & Dianora.It's the story of Billy who has almost everything, the perfect body, a great New York job, and a beach house in Provincetown. What more could he want? A boyfriend who happens to be a fireman and is called Carlos. Then along comes Tyson. This is a cute little story, as well as a cleverly designed book. It's a must for you Billy lovers. Truly enjoyable, and fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"impossible to cradle","review":"Im sorry but this phones design is terrible. the talk button is so large and sticks out so much that if you try and cradle it between your shoulder and chin while talking you will likely hang up. sometimes just walking around with it in my hand I inadvertantly turn it on. its a big pain and will be returning it for a different model."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can't go wrong with Hoodtown.","review":"Christa Faust really takes the time to set up this bizarre mix of lucha libre culture and crime noir. She really knows her stuff and stays true to the unspoken tenets of both. The story starts off slow, with hints of back story and well thought-out character development. We get pulled in as this dark mystery unfolds. The violence escalates; the questions lead to stark realizations; the plot twists and writhes like a snake on hot sand. The pay-off is classic. All the elements are here. The story is logical, believable, and captivating. Faust has created a world that could easily become a franchise. It's a quick read due to the way it hooks the reader. Once you start, you just don't want to put this book down. Don't just think about buying it, kid...just do it. You can't go wrong with Hoodtown."},{"rating":"2","title":"I want to live in Hoodtown!","review":"One evening, I took a nice hot bath and cracked open \\"Hoodtown\\" with the intent of reading the first two or three chapters. Next thing I know it's two hours later, I've finished the book and my bath is now ice cold. I woke up the next morning very, very sick. For this, I blame Christa Faust. Her book is impossible to put down. There's not enough space to go into plot details (see book description above), but let me tell you that Ms.Faust has created a completely engrossing world of masked heroes, serial killers, midget pimps, savage violence, and rough sex. Once you've finished the book, you'll want to visit Hoodtown to buy some churros, a souvenir mask or some hot masked lovin'. ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"LC","review":"I just finished it.

I don't think it was necessary for her character to disappear like that. If she wanted to leave her husband she could have left a note that she felt endangered and was disappearing, some kind of note to keep the police from wasting years of manpower looking for her. She would have been just as safe, maybe even safer without her picture being all over the news and papers.It was no small thing to me that the detective, Patrick, had his marriage ruined because of his obsession with Mara's disappearance. All that could have been avoided, but it seems Mara didn't care what the fate was of those left behind, just as long as she and her baby were safe.It rather ruined the book for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I dont usually read these kinds of books.........","review":"and now I know why - *yawn*. There was nothing at all thought provoking or even mildly interesting in this book. But I felt I had invested so much time, I had to finish it. The only redeeming thing was the mildly interesting twist near the end. I felt sorry for both the women - victims of domestic violence - but the characters were not really developed enough for me to greatly care. I was interested to find out the mystery of the missing pregnant woman and when it was seemingly figured out, the story lost all appeal to me.

Once you see the product yourself, you will understand why leaks are bound to happen under any normal use: it's two flat sheets of some vinyl or vinyl-like material joined by a narrow 2mm heat-bonded seam. The seam is (unsurprisingly) too weak to withstand the force of being pulled apart when the inflated roll is put under pressure.I bought this because it was inexpensive and some reviewers left positive reviews, which in retrospect is baffling because it doesn't seem possible that this thing could last for very long for anyone. I gambled that the other negative reviews (which mentioned the leaking) were simply the result of people getting random bad copies. Well, seeing the construction myself, I concur with the other negative reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical solution to lower back pain relief.","review":"The Airback TM Inflatable Roll is a very practical solution to relieve lower back pain while traveling or riding in your car.

About three years ago the quality was good and then I suspect that the quality control department must have been involved in a Lay Off. With a bad lower back, the theory behind the cushion would require it to hold air. The last three purchases in bulk for me have been horrendous- you would be lucky if 1 in 10 held air for more than a day or two. I think the quality issue is in the valve itself. Do not waste your money on these. They are asking over 10 dollars a piece for an item that may not be worth 5 cents.

Why oh why do so many historical authors feel that in order to redeem the hero rake he must fall in love with the plainest gal around? Make Jane plain if you must, but not so plain that it is ridiculous to really imagine Ethan not recognizing her at the ball. Hello - I don't believe plastic surgery was around back then to really allow such a transformation in Jane. Yes, good clothes can improve but not to recognize her? Really pretty ridiculous. Jane was so judgemental and nosy. Again, she barges into a man's bedroom, in his own home, and is surprised to find him with a woman?

I was very surprised about who the mother of the child actually turns out to be and would recommend this book just based off of that twist.

A great read, accurately poetic and scientific at once, with stories of clients, scientists (Newton and Hawking), and Ann Jauregui herself.

I used this filter years ago when our well was new and I do not remember there being such a warning.One might want to go to the 10 micron or finer size for well water and expect to change it more. I use the 10 micron filter from the same company and like them very much over the years. The 4.5 micron is also good but requires frequent replacement when a well is new or there is a lot of rain.I was hoping to use this as we just put in a new well pump and there is a lot more sludge in a new installation, but I am hesitant to use it now due to the explicit warning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Taste","review":"We have city water but sometimes have sediment in the water when they flush the lines.

Also, the material is accessible and the exercises hard -- both of which, IMHO, are important benchmark for a good math text.However, compared to his classic textbook of topology, Munkres did not perform as well in connecting with the readers.

This is okay for light jointer work, but difficult for work that would actually require a planer (when the lead-in edge of the work-piece is not accessible, like when trying to take down the face of a stud in a wall). As a hand-held power jointer, this is a very good one. The face adjustment is quick, with detents at 1/64\\" increments. Blade change is simple. The power switch lock is a bit tricky, and doesn't always stay engaged though."},{"rating":"1","title":"fits but sticky","review":"The case is perfect for the cameras listed but the velcro is stuck on with glue and the glue is constantly coming off thte sides of the flap.

It was more expensive than this case.Many of the reviews mention the lack of storage for spare batteries and things. Remember these are Camera Cases not Camera Bags.

It is convenient that you can wear it on your belt without it getting in your way (due to the small size). If you want to carry any additional battery's or s.d. cards, however, this case allows no room for that. I think that this case is ideal to be used within a larger case. I place the camera in this case and then into a larger case that can hold the battery charger, an extra battery, and a couple of sd cards as well as my cell phone. This way you can leave the larger case in the trunk or hotel and just take the camera in this case for quick outings. The hole in the top for the strap is essentially non-functional, I am not sure why it is there.I say that for the price, this is a good investment.

On a plus side, if fits S400 perfectly, and does a good job protecting it from scratches. It has a belt loop on the back and an opening on the top to pull through the strap. The case does not add much to the bulkiness of the camera. On a minus side, the case does not have any additional pockets, which would be very useful for additional memory cards or a spare battery. It is also not padded, which would of course make it a little bulkier, but would probably do a better job protecting the camera. The case will also not protect your camera from water, since it has holes on the sides both at the bottom and under the cover. Overall, a usefull accessory, but if size is not that important you may want to go for a third-party case with additonal pockets. Alternatively, it may be a good idea to have two cases - this and a larger one - to use under different circumstances."},{"rating":"1","title":"No pockets, wore finish on camera","review":"I got this case when I ordered my Canon SD110 (excellent camera).

I was very disappointed because there were black marks all over the camera and they would not come off. I read this from another review and should have listened. I just threw the case away.

The camera fits in the case quite well. The interior is lined with a soft fabric. The leather is thick and provides adequate protection. I would recommend crushing the leather before you use it, as another reviewer suggested -- it helps to eliminate the stiffness of the leather.Those reviewers expecting a complete carry-all should reference the price -- it's $8.99, people! This is not a camera BAG, it is a camera CASE, therefore, don't expect much padding or interior pockets. I would recommend a smaller accessory bag or purse if you need to carry an extra battery or SD card.

I was mostly upset by the fact that the description says \\"the view of Andromeda will knock your socks off\\" when you can barely see it on a great night! It is still incredible to see another galaxy, but it (literally) looks better through a $30 pair of binoculars. The views of saturn and jupiter are absolutely incredible, the rings are amazing on saturn and you can see 2-3 of its moons. Jupiter i prefer even more over saturn because you can make out several of its red \\"stripes\\" and 4-5 of its bright moons!

Robert Johnson's guitar styling on his chords are ones used by many modern day musicians and are worth hearing from his original reditions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go for the complete set","review":"When you are talking about Robert Johnson, alternate takes are not just alternate takes. This is a genious of the highest order, that was barely captured on disc, in a world then ruled by Jim Crow. Therefore, you want to listen to every single note he put on record eventually. Besides, many of the alternate takes are completely different than the released versions, sometimes different rythms, different words, and some alternates are even better than the released versions.

I will give them credit for one thing they hide their overt \\"influences\\" to put it mildly, fairly well.

I may even go as far as to rank it right up there with Aenema from tool. The songs are emotionally charged seamlessly blending together beautiful melody with hard hitting guitar riffs and earth shattering bass. Just an all around superb album."},{"rating":"2","title":"You know what to expect.","review":"You have heard the first single from 'This Type of Thinking' , 'Vitamin R' on the radio. Chances are equally good that you had already heard, or own, a Chevelle Cd. That said, this is good mainstream rock with a unique feel. Chevelle maintains the very atmospheric feel, including dissonate guitars and harmonizing, throughout 'This Type of Thinking'. Some songs are slightly heavier than their previous work but it never deveates into anything greater than 'Nu Metal'. You know what to expect from Chevelle : great singing, inventive guitar riffs, and catchy hooks. The band may show increased maturity but they will neither get new fans with this release nor loose any exsisting ones. This is just about what you would want from the brothers; more of the same great, atmospheric sound the have made their trademark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Polished Sounds","review":"Chevelle's New Album is far more polished then their previous outings. They've lost a bit of the indie rock roots, but will probably gain a wider mainstream audience with more tracks that are airwave friendly, \\"Vitamin R\\", \\"Panic Prone\\" and \\"Emotional Drought\\" being the most notable. There are still some harder stuff on the album for those who loved Wonder What's Next. \\"Breach Birth\\" and \\"Still Running\\" being good examples. Pete's vocals definitely take more of a Maynard Keenan(TOOL) sound to the forefront on this one which is good and bad. Good: because the lyrics get a more emotional boost. Bad: because they end up sounding a bit too much like a Tool copycat.The overall effect of the album might be a disappointment to those purests of Chevelle's first albums, but Pete, Joe and Sam still know how to rock out when it counts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Album","review":"The new album by Chevelle is addicting!!!

This is a fantastic cd go buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tool lite.","review":"Hey Maynard! Call your attorney!Chevelle sounds like Tool. When I say that, I don't mean that Chevelle was \\"influenced\\" by Tool, or that you can hear some Tool here and there in Chevelle's music. I mean Chevelle has appropriated, ripped-off and otherwise completely stolen Tool's sound, from the vocals down to the guitar riffs. Unfortunately, they decided not to swipe the underlying tension and menace that usually lurks in Tool's material, and this is the type of thinking that could do them in...I'd guess that when their recording career winds down, they'll at least be able to book themselves into 2-bit clubs as a \\"Tool tribute band.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"I hated Chevelle's music on their previous two albums. On Wonder What's Next, only one song was good to me (\\"The Red\\" which was later killed by radioplay). I also saw Chevelle live, and well...that didn't help anything. So when I heard this album was coming out, I passed it up until my good friend told me it was actual a solid, well-made album.I bought this two weeks ago, and I must say...it's not technical. It's not the most emotional music ever. It's not amazingly heavy. What it is is some damn good, solid tunes that I can listen to over and over again when I want a little break from black metal or the numerous other styles I listen to. The songs are much more meaningful than those on their previous outings, and although I like \\"The Clincher\\" and \\"Vitamin R\\" a lot, I must say I can't pick a favorite. This was a nice surprise."},{"rating":"2","title":"This entered where 'Closure' left off - the last spin-off","review":"You will enjoy this album fully if you dig other bands like Breaking Benjamin, Cold, Hoobastank, Incubus, you'll get the picture of what I mean. This album has Tool-lite tendencies but for a change this album does tread on new ground level. This trio of bros. snapped up production up a bit with another 'unknown' producer but will soon get an album worth to critics' causes or vice versa. The riffs off the first two tracks, The Clincher + Get Some, will sum up quite nicely. They've improved acoustically esp. on Bend the Bracket. But they've weaken quite a bit. I liked ten out of eleven songs on Wonder What's Next. Now, I like only eight songs out of eleven on This Type of Thinking (Could Do Us In). Crank it out live, you guys. Just gotta find the right producer to do you guys in with someday :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"i think this cd is a pretty good cd if you are into hard rock which is personally one of my favorite genres. its worth buying so if youre a fan of hard rock then pick this one up. i was suprised when people mentioned on the reviews that Peter's voice sounds like Maynard James Keenan. i guess it does but i havent noticed it until now (Maynard is way better though)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks like it was designed for a different camera","review":"Did not like this one bit.

I don't know what it is about the slow roasting, but it is delicious. My DH enters the house with a big grin smelling the popcorn in the oven. You can not go wrong with this Whirley Pop.

This item is faulty. If you use it to make popcorn it will fail.The first time you use this poper you will notice there is no way to get the popcorn out without spilling, or burning. The lid flaps, which in other models open to allow the corn to be dispensed, are clipped shut in order to make up for the poorly designed latches.The Lid does not securely latch to the pot. This small detail will cause your steaming hot pot of popcorn to broadcast itself all over your stove top, the hot burner, and you if you try using the handle to dispense the poped corn.The plastic gears will work for a couple of months. Then the mixing shaft will begin spinning in the top bevel gear causing you to wonder why there is so much smoke.Please do not give this product as a gift.

I have not yet experienced some of the problems assoicated with the plastic gears melting noted in the other reviews. I keep the flame on medium to mediam-low to make sure the pot does not heat up too much. But I can see it becoming a problem if I set the flame too high.How much would it cost the mfg to make the gears metal instead of plastic? I don't think that much more (and most people would pay a little extra for the metal gears, I certainly would have).

While the pot is okay, the lid is ridiculously thin - any thinner and it would qualify as foil. And, the 'whirler' (or whatever) doesn't fully touch the bottom, thus the corn was not being stirred and started to burn. And yes - it's now made in China. So why is it still so expensive?

I dont care about the calories when it comes to my popcorn ... sorry calorie counters, and thats what makes my popcorn sooooo good, the oil, and of coarse the Whirley popcorn popper. Another hint aside from using theater oil, buy white hull popcorn and also Savoral popcorn seasoning....and there you have it....the perfect popcorn concoction.

The popcorn did taste great until the popper broke after about six batches. The plastic gears on the turning mechanism still turn around but the stirrer on the bottom of the pan doesn't, resulting in half popped and burned popcorn.

I am going to order yet another brand made of aluminum but with brass gears. Hope springs eternal."},{"rating":"2","title":"whirley-pop popcorn popper","review":"This is a GREAT popcorn popper! The aluminum makes for a light weight popper that heats evenly and pops 99.9% of the kernels. It doesn't take much oil and the pot itself cleans up pretty darn easily. I paid attention to the reviews I read on this product prior to purchasing it, so I knew NOT to use on the highest heat, therefore I have had no problems.

It's a little slower than the advertised 3 minutes when used on an electric stovetop. However it still does a very good job. It cleans very easily after use and produces excellent, tasty popcorn with very few left over kernels. The included instructions are kind of lacking, but they refer you to the company website which does a good job of explaining usage.The top seems a bit flimsy, but I've not had any problems with it. The pan heats quickly and uniformly and the crank turns smoothly (although it did squeek a bit the first time I used it).All in all, I like this product and recommend it for an excellent alternative to expensive microwave popcorn."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap plastic gears","review":"We love this style of popper and it is the only style popper we use, but this particular model is somewhat cheaply made. The plastic gears do not keep cranking as the popper gets full, and the lid does not stay on tight, so that when you dump popcorn, you frequently lose the lid and your yet unpopped kernels land in the bowl as well.

We will always have one becasue it easily makes such good popcorn."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's supposed to be thin!","review":"Thin metal doesn't hold a lot of heat. This lets it warm up quickly (non-soggy popcorn) and cool down quickly (no burnt popcorn when you're done!). Aluminum conducts heat better (and holds less heat) than stainless steel, which makes it the better choice for this.I think proper heat setting was key here, you need to follow their recommendation on how long it should take to pop a batch from start to stop. If your heat is too low, your popcorn will be too chewy. Complaints about deformed metal might be from putting the heat too high. I usually go about a medium high, both on my old electric coil ctove and my new glass flattop. I have found that preheating the burner for a minute helps, just for the the it takes me to measure the oil and corn into the popper.Been using my popper for about 3 years now, with no problems at all.

After eating the popcorn from this popper, you will never want to eat the chemical-tasting microwave popcorn. And fast - faster than the microwave bag corn, and nearly every kernel pops...upbelieveable. I used the Mrs. Butter flavoring (okay, a few chemicals here) and popcorn salt and am in popcorn heaven.

Just use about 1 tablespoon of oil, throw in 1/3 cup of popcorn kernels, turn the heat to medium and stir. We're happy with just a little sea salt.

Pops perfectly and quickly, easy clean up, great tasting popcorn. I loved mine so much, I bought another for my parents. I am not rough on mine, but do see the gears are plastic, so I'm careful with it but I'm realistic that it may not last forever. Rest assured, I'll be buying another if it does.

I bought a new one after mine was falling apart after many years of use. The new one is made of FOIL. Believe me when I tell you that a flip top can has more tin than this popper. The gears are now made of plastic. Any resistance and it will break. The gear popped off the first use because there was a small amount of resistance stirring the popped corn. Even the instructions tell you not to get this pot too hot because the metal will melt. That should tell you something. Spend more money and get a REAL \\"all metal\\" popper. Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor qualtiy","review":"I bought this for a gift for Christmas last year and the popper never worked properly - the gear on top didn't turn the stirring rod inside the popper.

Won't buy another til they fix this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whirley-Pop Stovetop popcorn popper Sept. 6, 2007","review":"This is the second one that we have had. Apparantly nobody else pops as much popcorn as we do. On both of our poppers the shaft to rotate the stirring devise comes loose from the gear rotating the shaft, you are unable to stir the popcorn and it then burns very easily. I believe the original Whirley-Pop had metal gears. Another failure from our free trade as they are probably now made in China. I cannot recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic gears","review":"After a couple of uses, the aluminum rod separates from the plastic gear that turns the stirrer. This is understandable because plastic will deform after a period of time, particularly if it's under stress.This looks like an engineering flaw. Metallic gears would have been better.And I agree with the other users that complained about the ease of burning your popcorn, particularly if the plastic gear disengages and falls off while you're popping popcorn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gears are the weak point","review":"As other reviewers have said, this popper makes good popcorn until the plastic gears start to slip. Our popper has been gently used but within a few months of getting it the plastic gear got loose on the shaft. In the middle of a batch it would slip and the cranking mechanism would become unusable, leading to a ruined batch. Reassembling the gear mechanism is a pain and the fix doesn't last. When it works it makes wonderful popcorn, but they need to reengineer the gear mechanism to make it last as long as the other parts. I hope they solve the problem. I wouldn't buy another until they do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Developed a popcorn addiction","review":"Prior to purchasing this, I wasn't much of a popcorn eater other than the expected purchase at the movies. I was never a big fan of microwave popcorn either, always feeling the taste fell short. That all changed when I purchased this popper. I seriously find myself making popcorn most nights than not.If you follow the enclosed instructions regarding recommended heat and the amount of oil to use, you shouldn't have any problems when making the popcorn. Cleanup is also super easy: I remove the lid and wipe it down and the inside of the popper with a paper towel before each use.I haven't tried any other brands of popcorn other than the Orville Redenbacher (why change what is good) and I tried both vegetable and canola oil and personally prefer the taste of the canola oil."},{"rating":"2","title":"An American Classic","review":"This thing makes EXCELLENT popcorn pretty quickly and very easily. It's cheap, using plain kernels, and very customizable...you can experiment with different recipes.Cleanup is easy, and just requires being wiped out with a paper towel.I haven't had problems with mine, but I know that Wabash Valley has great customer service and will replace parts in the event of a mechanical problem.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Priceless popcorn!","review":"We have had our Whirley Pop since we got married, so for 14 years, we've used it once a week. That's roughly 700 big bowls of popcorn! It still works like a charm, but I am now replacing it, because it's getting discolored, and gunky on the top. I will not hesitate to order my second Whirley Pop from Amazon and keep popping away. I use canola oil, only about 2 teaspoons since it's so seasoned now, to a half-cup of popcorn - Newman's Own when I could find it, otherwise Redenbacher. Nothing on it has broken or worn out in 14 years. This is a well-made product and I'm so glad it's still available after all these years!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A healthy choice","review":"I ran across this popper and after reading a few of the bad reviews I was hesitant about buying this. I received it as a gift and have been using it every night since! I love this popper and how it makes the popcorn light and fluffy. I didn't realize the difference until I decided to compare the tastes of microwave vs this popper. The Whirley-pop won hands down!A bit of advise for people who are debating on weather or not to get it:1) If you follow the directions correctly then you will have perfect popcorn.2) Make sure to season the pan before doing anything, many people forget this step or think that it is not important.3) You do not need to wash it after every use, a paper towel wipe out is good enough.4) slow and steady turning is the key, along with a low/medium heat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is this thing being made now?","review":"My wife and I used an old Whirley Pop for a number of years and enjoyed the popcorn it made. Then I made the mistake of trying to clean it by soaking with an oxygen bleach product and ruined it. We recently bought another unit, and immediately noticed a difference. Unfortunately, it left lots of black residue on cleaning rags, obviously from the aluminum. This residue has continued to come off on cleaning rags and sponges, to the point that we are discarding the unit. It is too cheaply made, probably in China (where they apparently have no consumer safety standards), to be safe to use, in our opinion. It's too bad, because the popcorn tastes great. It's just not worth getting Alzheimer's.PS: If it's not made in China, I challenge anyone to try to find out where it's actually made. I did a considerable amount of online research, to no avail. I was unable to find the words \\"Made in USA\\" in any of the company's materials. Or \\"Made in China,\\" for that matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Godd Product","review":"For some reason, this popcorn popper popps most all of the kernals, much more than our normal cooking pot. If you put too much popcorn in the popper at once, they fill the kettle and then the handle is very hard to turn. After pouring out some of the popped corn, some kernals on the bottem may get burnt. Other than my misuse, this is a pretty good way to pop a small batch of popcorn. Good product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Money","review":"As everyone else has stated, it makes great Popcorn! Cheaper than microwave and much more flexible. Vary the oil from a little to alot. Use the recipe book to make some crazy flavors for adult tastes. The aluminum is thin but mechanically it is sound if you dont abuse the crank. It really does only take 4 minutes start to finish for a large batch of popcorn.After exactly two years this thing is still going strong. No worries about the mechanics breaking at this point. We make one to two batches a week so thats about 2 cents per serving so far. We buy the big 10 lb bags of popcorn and keep in the freezer so a full batch will all costs included is about 7 cents. cleaning the lid is a bit of a pain but I am lazy. Being aluminum makes no difference compared to stainless steel in my opinion. It wont go in the dishwasher so no worries about pitting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Popper","review":"The Whirley-Pop popper produces the best popcorn I've ever had.

We popped all our own popcorn and I did more than my share, so I know about popcorn. This is the closest I've come to making theater corn on the stove. The real trick is the oil. You have to use flavored theater oil that is hard like shortening before it's heated. The liquid kind is OK, but any other oil just doesn't quite do it.The only issue I have is that it's a little difficult to clean and the oil can get caked on the mixing arm.I'm giving them out to friends as Christmas gifts this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"yummy popcorn!!","review":"This popper does just what it's supposed to, it pops good popcorn. My kids really enjoy turning the little crank. I put the burner on medium, not high and I don't think there are ever any unpopped kernels in the botton of the pan. I also don't immerse the pot in water, I just wipe the inside out with a damp kitchen cloth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent but Delicate","review":"This popcorn popper does indeed work well and is worth the money. You need to be very careful when turning the crank so you don't break the plastic gears. Once the popcorn is done popping and the crank meets some resistance STOP turning and take off the heat. If you try to force the crank it will break the gears.Also, when washing it you have to be more careful than I fear some people are capable of being. It is a fragile item and you will break it if you don't move slowly and wash very carefully. I ordered one and broke it on the first batch. I returned it and this second one is working like a charm now that I'm aware of how delicate it is.I do recommend it for perfect popcorn. And as a side note go with the Paragon Coconut oil and the Flavacol seasoning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful family fun","review":"I have had my Whirly Pop for a few months. I Love it!

I have ordered a different stove top popper with a stainless steel pan. Hopefully it will be better quality. Whirley-Pop had good quality at one time, but they don't now.

Each plastic gear is secured to a shaft by a set screw. Either the plastic is too soft to allow the set screw to be properly tightened, or it was overtightened at the factory and stripped. Was this a manufacturing, quality control or design flaw or all three? (I can recall when only China produced such crap.) Regardless, after a couple of gentle turns of the handle, the gear to the vertical shaft popped off and everything fell into the pot. Now that's my idea of family fun.

We only pop using the Whirley-Pop since it produces a far superior (and healthier) product. I enjoy being able to put just the amount of salt and oil that I want into a batch. If I feel like splurging, I add extra oil. If I want to be healthy, a just use a thin coat. Either way, the results are always good with few, if any unpopped kernals.

(This keeps the lid from moving around too much.) The water splashes enough that it gets perfectly clean along with everything else. Would it last longer if I hand washed it?

The popper is very easy to use, quicker than microwave and almost impossible to burn. When you hear the popping slow, you remove it from the heat and all of the kernals are popped. The resulting popcorn is so good you don't need to drown it in butter and salt. We use one tablespoon of melted butter for the entire 6 quarts and it is perfect. Only draw back--you will never want to buy movie theater popcorn again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"popcorn pan","review":"This popper is made very cheaply.

I thought for sure this thing would be *overhyped* to some degree, but no, it's really that good. It's easy-to-use, easy-to-clean, and (most importantly) makes great corn. Oh yea, it's quick too! Don't worry about having to crank, the corn is poppin before you realize you're doing any manual labor. Personally, I just go into a trance and then stop when I smell burning.

It's flexible, ambidextrous, strong enough for the application, cheap enough to replace, and has a decent warranty for its price. One doesn't have loading or pouring problems, it doesn't fall apart when one picks it up to wash or load or dump popcorn, it's easy to clean (I use water unless something stronger is required). This is my second one only because I ruined the aluminum finish by putting it in the dishwasher 100s of times and I wanted a clean one for $25. I had the first one for 9+ years and it still worked but I'm giving it away to charity. I learned that if I load too much popcorn because I'm a popcorn pig, I can separate the gears on the crank shaft. I've not only managed to persuade the gears back in place, but also to use less popcorn in one popping as well as smaller baby kernels. Absolutely no problems with my new popper with these changes. We make popcorn 4-7 nights/week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great popper!","review":"This pot is so straight forward and so easy. Highly recommend it.

While I didn't necessarily expect to find specific state information, all the book said was you may be required to get a commercial kitchen. No resources on *where* I would find that information or who I would contact. And when I looked at the business card section, all it said was to get business cards & stationary with your business logo - duh.

Very well made, heavy duty (even the cord is about ten feet long) professional grade all the way. They easily disassemble for effortless cleaning and everything fits back in the heavy duty case.

If you are an enthusiast of historical information concerning photography, the Bowery, the circus, or disfiguring diseases you will enjoy adding this one to your collection. It does not encompass a large wealth of knowledge on any one of these subjects, nor does it show a great deal of varied photographs however, taking into consideration the variety of information covered, it works. It does leave you wanting more.I was disappointed to not have a greater variety of photographic subjects as told were included in the original collection.

Suddenly he's receiving his first traffic ticket, falling from a roof when he's trying to spy on his soon-to-be-ex wife, beating up an \\"intruder\\" who turns out to be a relative, and having his bare rump photographed by a private detective when a local rich woman throws herself on him. In between these capers, he's learning about himself and about growing older, about dreams that don't come true, about adjustments we all have to make as we get older, about many, many insightful and touching things.

The few photos that are intended to illustrate are not clear. For example the before and after of how to hold a pick is ridiculous. A before shot? Really? The actual shot that would be useful has the camera in the wrong position.There is no music instruction here.No songs.Only power chords, which are not even technically chords.What the kid is supposed to come away with is vague.Give some rhythms, some chord changes, some actual chords, if not actual songs.

The book states clearly at the end that the purpose of the book is to establish the women's feminist movement within the traditional church.

The book promotes a false religion of feminism and takes it from its satanic and secular roots into the church of God.The presentation is clever and refined, but the message is clear.

On the beach or on a boat, this can be extremely annoying if you are talking to people. However, it does provide great protection from the sun since it covers your entire face (and your shoulders and some of your back!). I would say be sure you understand just how big this hat is before you buy it. Also, do not fold this up, it does not easily bounce back to its original form. The thatch on this is widely woven so some light does shine through but it's no different from many straw beach hats.

Personally I loved his chapters on fathers titled Forgiveness, The Protector, Baseball, Mr. Mom and Daddy's Girl.Reminded me a great deal of Tom Brokaws book from people who wrote him after his excellent book The Greatest Generation which is also a must read book in my opinion.Mr. Russert is such a gifted writer. The kind that you pray will write another book, and then another. There are enough stories of such a wide variety that the book will appeal to males as much as it will to females.Great gift for Dads as well as their kids. Though provoking and so much wisdom that one comes away a wiser person.

There is much to be said for the heartland beginning with the unglamorous mid-west and the great rust-belt cities of Buffalo, Cleveland, Detroit, and the crown jewel, Chicago. Russert was all about being from Buffalo, a town joked about by those seeking sophistication and importance. I am a late-comer to the Russert admiration society, but I am now a true-believer. I knew him not, but I did spend some time watching his shows this election season and came to admire him enormously. This book is not all that great, but that isn't very important. It is a book in which the transitory words of Television are turned into immortality. This and his other books are our single hold on him. He deserved to be admired and was. That in itself is rare."},{"rating":"2","title":"Showcasing invaluable parental guidance and advice arising from the forgiving and endless love of true fatherhood","review":"Wisdom Of Our Fathers: Lessons And Letters From Daughters And Sons is both authored and narrated by Tim Russert, with additional reading by Joseph Buttler, Marc Cashman, Susan Denaker, Kathe Mazur, Arthur Morey, and Staci Snell.

So if you are in the Business section reading an article and you want to view all the other articles in the business section you have to select \\"view sections list\\" which takes you all the way back to the front page sections list, than once again scroll down to \\"view articles\\" in the business section.I live in MT and enjoy the NW news articles.

As I was looking thru these books I started to laugh and told my friend to get his money back. I was shocked to see that all the info in these books can be obtained just by doing a search on SecurityFocus and Google and most of the info in this and the other books where outdated exploits that have been patched already. The IT industry moves at the speed of light and the most important aspect when it comes to securing your networks is having the newest attack and exploit information, which no book can ever provide... including this lousy book that is nothing but a compilation of what can be found for free online.

Sadly for me, I guess I'm not as computer savvy as I thought since about 70% of the content went way over my head. That's not the book's fault, since it is well laid out, well thought out and well presented.Maybe what got me in the end was the SUID shell...

The red haired actress and the overweight guy are about as wooden as the chair I'm sitting on and the rest of the cast didn't fare that much better either. Maybe that was down to the script as well I don't know. The tone of this film was just way off - did it want to be a drama? A comedy drama? Both? Some deep and meaningful tone poem about love and life and friendship?Maybe it's just me, but after watching a slew of excellent films of this type (\\"Elena Undone\\", \\"Room In Rome\\", \\"Loving Annabelle\\") this one it's safe to say falls WAY short of the mark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little film.","review":"Heard about this movie on AfterEllen.com and finally got to view it online on Amazon Demand.

Now, I do appreciate when I don't have to look at pictures that are so good that they discourage me because they're way out of the realm of possibility for me to produce. But, such bad drawings weren't inspiring, either.Finally, some of the suggestions were plain old silly. Getting rid of the camera and only drawing might be OK for a day or a weekend, but not for a longer time frame. When we travel, we want to come home with photos of the sights (and us enjoying them), since we'll probably not return. Why not enjoy BOTH mediums and have the strength of the true-to-life photos along with the fun of sketches?It was an OK book and I passed it on to my son so he'll see that journals aren't just for girls.

This sequel chose to focus on the story versus the dancing. The first film had a more compelling story.However...there is something that makes me like this one better...although I LOVE the first one's final dance solo better and have watched that part of the film over and over.This one just had a lot more funny characters and was notably LIGHTER in tone. The surprise is the final dance group number that is delightful.Isabella Miko is STUNNING as Sarah. However her dance numbers just don't sizzle (aside from one early ballet solo)...mostly just so so. Columbus Short has an ELECTRIFYING smile and made the movie doubly enjoyable. Jacqueline Bisset was excellent as the hard nosed Julliard dance professor.This is a light film that will make you smile."},{"rating":"1","title":"The first one was better...","review":"I hate this movie the first was so much better.

It would be better if the entire book is dedicated at the art/science of statisical analysis and fighting spam.Note that this book does not target the lowest denominator and some the science flew over my head.

I wasn't looking for anything other than a crackling fire that would be on the TV without music or other distractions. It was a nice touch to Christmas morning activities in my home. If you are looking for a basic DVD that makes your TV look like a fireplace, you will probably be happy with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not impressed","review":"So the colonial fire scene films the entire fireplace. Which I don't care about I only want to see the fire. I think the picture seemed to far away. I wanted more of an up close fire scene.The beach scene is to bright. It lights up the whole room because of a bright sky not a warm fire glow. Also again the fire is to far away. You cannot hear the ocean as much as I'd like either. It films the fire as the sunsets and once the sun actually does set it starts over from the beginning back to being bright again!And as for the campfire, well I just didn't bother with that one because It didn't look good at all, not even an impressive fire.So I guess I just didn't like this video because really what I'm looking for is for my entire screen to only be showing the flames. I really liked the idea of having a beach scene but it just wasn't good."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a gift for my husband.","review":"He loves it!

The fire continues for 30 minutes then restarts. This is the equivalent of a lava lamp, which is cool, but not an annual focal point. You can never replace a real fireplace and the closest concept would be to record a number of entire burnings ... expand here if you wish.

The one good thing about the book is that Gaskell offers many worked examples (unfortunately the errors in the examples make many of them quite confusing).I find it ironic that the preface reads \\"The fourth edition...is different from the third...[in that] there is an acute emphasis on typographical and mathematical accuracy.\\" If this is the case I would have hated to have used the third addition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard text","review":"Thermodynamics is one of those topics covered in multiple branches of science such as physics, chemistry, geology, materials science, chemical engineering, etc... This book approaches the subject from materials science and is meant to serve as the book for a one or two semester course in thermo. First of, it is not meant for beginners to thermo. I used this book in a course taught by one of the best instructors in my department, after having taken two easier courses in thermo. Yet I still found it difficult. Second, the math is advanced enough that one should not take the course without having differential equations. Third, the example problems can get quite difficult real quickly; and not all have solutions. But overall, the text is a good reflection of the subject; difficult and time-consuming to master."},{"rating":"1","title":"His other thermo books are bad, so is this one","review":"Like others have said before me, thermodynamics is hard enough without Gaskell's weak attempts to make it even harder.

I hate the book when there are whole page of description of the figure, and then the figure is on the next page. How can you read and then flip the page again and again? The other thing is why couldn't it be a letter size paper? It is so hard to read with such a small size of paper with tons of equations over and over again.

Supporting users who require floppy use but have no floppy drive can be difficult. Memorex's 3.5 external USB floppy drive is easy to use, at an affordable price. No software needed (at least not for the latest Windows OS and Mac OS systems.) It was immediately recognized by the system, and useable.

They do have a 9v battery backup, but a year later that will be dead and you could lose messages. My older digital (not tape) machine doesn't have this problem, and when I can get a 16GB SDRAM card for my camera for $25, it seems they can solve this problem :)Recorded voice quality of the outgoing message is worse than current machine - a little crackly.

My daughter played very light, less than 2 hours a week. I am trying to contact the manufacturor. It has a two year warrenty. I don't know if they will reimburse me the repair fee. The company is in CA. If you live anywhere else and could not wait to send them the flute for repair, you have to pay ahead and pray if they will reimburse you anything. The company rep is quite nice on the phone, but again I don't know he will reimburse me or not. I doubt this flute will last 2 years. renting a flute will cost about $100 a year and hassal free.

I figure if it will make it to 100 meters on my next dive trip, it'll survive a dunk in the bathtub with baby or the dishwater. I had to have 2 links taken out and the pin on the clasp adjusted in one notch. My favorite jeweler did this for me for $5. The watch is a bit \\"doctorish\\" with all the dials and minute markings, but those markings glow in the dark (so I know the baby is waking me up at 3:30 am).

Although unintelligible to the lay reader, Minsky is justly renowed for his financial instability hypothesis, which holds more or less that investment demand is hostage to the varying price of long lived capital assets and shifts in the debt carrying capacity of financial actors. He divides financial techniques as Julius Caesar divided Gaul: there is Hedge Finance, Speculative Finance and Ponzi Finance (guess which is unsustainable). Exactly how this works is largely a matter of faith and of course calculus for the initiated. The important thing to know is that equilibrium is unsustainable, crisis a recurring theme.

Personally, I love it. I do not love it, however, at the expense of a good plot surrounding those sex scenes. This story has it all. I had read through three quarters of the book before I truly became conscious of the fact that the lead characters had not yet slept together. It was not that they were not sharing hot, sexy, intimate moments. They simply had not \\"gone all the way\\" yet. This story had depth to it. Also, it was completely believable. I don't want to get into specific instances because you can read other reviews for that.

I couldn't believe that one of the only places to have it in stock was Amazon (via Target no less). Even Bialetti was on backorder! The quality has improved over the past 10 years, but the general design remains the same. It still provides a wonderful ritual in the morning of adding water, coffee and threading the unit together.

The only quip I have is once he is in the suit, it looks bulky because it has to hide the cape and all those muscles. There's a reason in the pics on the site he's only half dressed. He looks slightly funny in full Clark Kent Mode.But the SUPERMAN part of the figure is awesome. He's articulated well and can move in to countless positions. He looks authentic, and everything is well done. There are no gimmick buttons or anything else to distract from the action figure. He's fun to play with, or makes a great collector's item.Very fun, and probably the best figure in the line of toys so far!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Figure with one Flaw","review":"This would be the Best superman figure ever if they had made the cape removable.

What I got was a book with some interesting recipes (quite a few that are not made with a Dutch oven!) that was very vague about cooking techniques. There is a section on the differences in cast iron and aluminum Dutch ovens and some info on the various ways you can use them, but nothing on the actual techniques. After reading the book, I have the same questions I started with!

For example, fresh blueberries. Probablyjust fine for the Northwest US.Pro or Con.It took 2 1/2 hours to prepare and make the one recipe I tried.Not good if you would rather spend your time hiking.

The uncanny thing is that it almost follows the manga shot for shot.The story itself is unchanged form the manga, mainly because both are published by the same publisher, however the atmosphere is not as dark as the manga leads you to believe. I also found that, that the flow of the dialogue was fragmented in such as way that it was almost like bad acting had these been real actors.Despite all this, I gave this a high score because the story is good, good art, and a good introduction to the story. It may even spur people who have not read the manga to go and read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun to look at, but would you eat it?","review":"If you like working with sugarpaste (fondant) and the people you bake for like eating it, this is a very nice book.

Having tried city life and monkish asceticism/astheticism, Huysmans gives the coutryside a shot, and returns the familiar misanthropic, peevish verdict. Amazingly, Becalmed out-against-natures Against Nature! The people who work the land are rendered stupid and greedy, and many passages throughout the book use disease imagery to invoke the encroaching malignity of the land itself. If you've ever thought of moving out to the country to 'get away from it all', this highly accomplished and delightfully bizarre book should give you pause."},{"rating":"1","title":"need informations about this video","review":"I'd like to have some informations concerning this video and the other one untitled \\"STEVE MCQUEEN 2-PK;if a MCQUEEN fan read this he can send me infos to my e-mail.I'm a french admirator, and is OK to chat on this fantastic actor and man!

If there is a way to improve on the dialog offerings I would say that there should be more drill work. Some practice drills are offered in the \\" Learn On The Go \\" tapes. However, they require several playings to commit the phrases to memory. But this is only a small matter. In the final analysis though, I applaud Living Language for producing tapes and a study guide on Chinese, a language that few language companies are apparently willing to tackle.

The short cord makes it more portable but harder to use. It must be plugged in with the batteries already installed, a bit inflexible and you can't put in one battery while another is charging. It will happily recharge a battery it's just fully charged, indicating that it is not nearly as smart as the leading \\"smart charger.\\" On the lighter side, unlike most chargers, it will indeed charge batteries individually, with a mix of AAA and AAs, no need to have two at a time. It will recharge batteries that are completely dead, too. The progress display is nice though not especially informative; it tells you roughly how far the charge is progressing, and is lit up while charging and dark when done. Overall it's better than the average \\"dumb\\" charger but not nearly as good as the LaCrosse BC-900.

I didn't realize this when I started looking. You want to watch for the packs that recharge based on just time. These can overcharge your batteries and lead to a shorter battery life.

Independent circuits so you don't need pairs to charge. Refresh function is a great feature, but it is really only useful if your batteries are charged in other chargers since this charger performs so well. I've owned this charger for two years and it still works like new. Charging takes a long time, but thats a good thing! Helps batteries last a long LONG time.

I purchased this charger 3.5 years ago with a digital camera and another set of 4 sony batteries so that I could always have 4 in the camera and 4 charged backups. This setup worked great and kept me shooting for 3.5 years and thousands of photos. Finally the batteries have given up the ghost and will no longer hold a charge, so I'm back to buy more of the batteries as the charger still works perfectly.

It turned out to be a waste of time. The batteries take a few hours to charge and that's OK. But when they only have a working charge of just 5 minutes in a Wii remote, they cause more harm by interrupting the game with 'lost communication' failures. Even when executing the looonnnnggg 'refresh' charge cycle, the batteries fared no better.

Having flown remote control model airplanes for many years, I was aware of the importance of cycling batteries for proper maintenance. The refresh feature on this charger allows me to discharge any remaining charge in the cells before recharging them for use. Also the 2700 mah rating is about the highest capacity you can find on AA batteries. I only wish they had made the lcd screen a little better, showing the actual amount of charge in a partially used cell. It does this to some extent, but the graph is very crude.

The only one thing I did not like is it's manual. It's not clear on explaining how recharger shows when a battery is fully charged. It says it turns off, but I tried and recharged several batteries but the lcd never came off, even thoug the temperature of batteries became cool, meaning (at least I guess so) they are not being recharged any more.

I have nothing against the charger itself. The problem is on the included 2700maH batteries. They just don't hold the charges. The voltage level drops so rapidly and the batteries are unusable after 2 to 3 days for digital camera. It is too bad that I also purchased a pack of 4 Sony 2500maH at the same time and they turn out to be the same. It's funny that I had to rush to a nearby 7/11 even with 4 batteries in the camera and 4 spare ones on hand (charged 2 to 3 days before the event). It is a big disappointment on Sony.I was wondering why I didn't see any complaint when I first noticed the problem. I guess it takes some time for a problem to surface. I have since switched to another two sets of similar batteries from another name brand and gained some confidence back on the technology."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible design","review":"Yes, as others say, the batteries that come with this are trash, don't even waste your time with them.The charger design is ridiculous.

These batteries are far superior to all the other batteries I have tried. There is a screen to see the charging process and this charger will first drain the battery then charge it if you like to remove the memory effect. I would just plug in the charger in the evening and by morning my batteries were ready to go. If you need a super fast charger don't buy this one.

So, I'd conclude that the battery is NOT compatible with the charger. The charger, otherwise seemed to charge most of my batteries. In the manual it lists specific maH capacities that it works with. So make sure your existing batteries are these sizes at least. Fortunately I have a charger that DOES charge the provided AA batteries.

It has 4 independent intelligent charging circuits, so you can charge 1-4 batteries in different states of charge. Each battery will come to full charge and stop charging.

This said it does refresh batteries, and seems to do so effectively and quickly.That's the good news. The bad is that the Sony NiMH's that came with the charger are el stinko. Don't hold a charge and are only good for an environmentally friendly circular file. Feels like they are simply dumping relatively old and low capacity ones. Bad practice. My relatively low review is therefore based on that fact. When I buy a package I want the whole thing to work. Caveat Emptor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok charger, horrid batteries","review":"I got this set about 6 months ago and after the first month these batteries have stayed in a drawer...only because I'm not sure where to recycle them. The 2700mAh capacity sounds great. However, they lose charge SO fast that if I charge them the day before, by the next day they're already half gone. It's absurd. Do NOT get these batteries. They will let you down when you need them.That being said, the charger is fine. It charges both my Sony batteries (crap) and my Energizer ones (workin great).Were I to do it again, I would not get this set. Go get some Eneloops or Energizers. Leave the Sony batteries for someone else.Dave"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice product","review":"Nice product. received delivery on time.product in good packed condition.Overall good product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never charging?","review":"I bought one of these, and the batteries _never_ did charge.

The batteries would not stay in contact causing the remote to shut off & lose signal in the middle of game play. The battery door also eventually completely broke off.

My observation, as a visual type learner, is I expected the CD to contain all I needed to conduct tutorials. This is not the case. You need some level of an Oracle database on your computer as well as the Developer 2000 software. I think it would be good business for the publisher or Amazon.com comments to advise what you need in order to benefit from the enclosed CD tutorial.

Later that week, I shelled out 50 dollars to buy this game. I expected some additions and variety from the demo, but I could not have been more dissappointed. A bunch of extra sets and actors, but not much else. The one part that I actually was pleased with was the music and radio announcements. The sound truly reflected on the time periods that you would play. Other than that, I honestly would say you should just play the demo over and over again until you are bored.

The DVD is promoted as Cartoon Network Christmas 3 leading you to believe that the cartoons would be based around X-mas episodes.

However, I object to the homophobic tone that the writer pursues, as if such accusations were the most evil thing one could say of another, and I find the organization and arguments to be rambling and excessively repetitious.

There is a useful information about the customs and mannerisms of people from various cultures, but it is arranged by subject rather than by location. For instance, information about people from Taiwan might be located in several sections throughout the book, within sections such as \\"Greetings\\", \\"Holidays\\", etc. Each of these sections contains very brief information about the topic as it pertains to people from a few (not all) different countries. I find this layout to be very problematic. If I am in need of information about a different culture, most likely because I am either travelling to a certain country or will be interacting with a person from a certain country, it would be much easer to have information organized by location.

The information was second, third, and fourth hand, unsubstantiated, and based on assumptions and innuendo. It was like reading a tabloid that went on for over 400 pages. Milton spent too much time explaining what Hillary thought and what all of her \\"ulterior motives\\" were for virtually everything she has done in her life thus far. Did she know Hillary's inner thoughts by osmosis or through some Vulcan mind meld? Come on! Don't buy it, don't even check it out from the library.

An especially recurring theme is Hillary's position on family issues; the author would assert that Hillary wants the state to raise children and not mothers and fathers.That being said, there is a lot of stuff in this book which, if halfway true, does form an image of Hillary as a post-hippie policy wonk who has a powerful intellect and strong will. I do think that, nearing the age of 60, Hillary has outgrown a lot of the viewpoints and beliefs attributed to her in this book.And, as others here have said, this book is a scandalmongering exercise, but, well, we must educate ourselves on the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination, right?

One revelation is that--surprise surprise--Rodham had inconsistent politics as a college student. There's a shock--she's 20 and changes her mind!

I was amazed by three things, primarily: (1) the omniscience Milton apparently enjoys (i.e., her criticisms of Hillary Clinton require expertise from so many disciplines no human being could master all of them; (2) Milton's access to Hillary Clinton's thought processes (i.e., she repeatedly describes Clinton's thoughts and motivations); and (3) that my public library would have purchase this piece of trash. My assessment: the book will be disgusting to all but the die-hard Clinton haters.

This book lacks credible research unless biased investigation is the new standard. Hillary was demeaned from all levels ranging from her lack of \\"smarts\\" to her inability to manage. My distaste for smearing Hillary grew more troubling as I read from chapter to chapter. I am not defending Mrs. Clinton; nor will I defend the manner in which this author bled her agenda all over the pages. Sounded too biased to be an honest attempt to learn about our first lady. This book was clearly written for right-wingers - not for mainstream America. Ms. Milton can and should do better. Some books you can't put down. This one should be put down - and I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"the book was not credible reading.","review":"I have read just about half of the book, but it does'nt take long to realize that the author is no fan of Hillary Clinton. The book is so biased and mean spirited that it loses its credibility. Anyone who has ever opened up a newspaper and actually reads it, knows that there have been plenty of problems with the current occupants of the White House, however some good things have also occured during \\"their\\" term of office. She has repeated every rumor and innuendo that has ever been printed and spoken about the Clintons, from Hillary's lesbianism to her affair with Vince Foster, I do believe there is a conflict here, to drug dealing and everything in between. No where have I found anything that sounded vaguely like a compliment. What happens when an author is so critical about their subject is that they lose all their credibility.

The author is not original or enlightning. Unfortunately this First Lady has fed the insatiable appetite for trash by the media, the far right and attack authors with transparent agenda's. Hillary will go down in American history as one who unabashedly prostituted herself for power. The feminist movement and Democrats would be well advised to distance themselves from (Ms)Clinton.

I was hoping for an objective look at her contributions to policy, instead, this novel is full of acrimonious allegations and innuendo.

She has gone from a \\"Goldwater Girl\\" to the biggest threat to conservative values in the opinion of her opponents. It is time to cease such books by not buying them.

The band's unwillingness (or inability) to show a little spontaneity in their note for note reworking of some of their songs suggested that the band was either beginning to run out of ideas, a notion that was sadly confirmed by its follow-up studio effort \\"Novella.\\" The fatal flaw here is that the band seemed to be putting more effort on expanding the orchestral sound that worked so well on their two best albums, \\"Turn of the Cards, and \\"Scheherazade\\" at the expense of writing actual songs. Sadly, \\"Novella\\" seems almost devoid of melodies that one remembers 20 seconds after the song is over (although \\"The Captive Heart\\" comes tantalizingly close). This is all pleasant, competent stuff, and from a music theory standpoint it can even be impressive at times. But it is that over studied fell that, ultimately makes it an album that fails to excite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply: Wow!!!","review":"This has been for the last 20 years my all-time favorite album. It just brings me so many memories of my childhood, it really transports me somewhere else. It was my first Renaissance album, so I regard a special place for it in my collection. The arrangements, the angelical-but-powerful voice of Annie Haslam and the incredible music makes this a must-have. There's absolutely no music today that has such strength, creativity and musicality.Every time I listen to Novella, I find something new, some hidden detail. I disagree with some reviews that make sound this record as a 2nd class one. The orchestral arrangements sometimes eclipse the band, but who cares? You must listen the music as a whole."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong, Melodic Album","review":"I enjoyed Renaissance during their original run, seeing them in concert twice. In the CD era I've found that the twoTales Of 1001 Nightscompilations do a good job of summarizing the career of Renaissance. Beautiful thing is, in this post-CD, mp3 era, one can download select tracks from the original albums to complement the best of collections.Three of this album's five tracks are included onVolume 2of the best of set. Of this album's two remaining tracks, \\"The Captive Heart\\" is decent but it's one of those take or leave numbers that span the middle of a vinyl album's second side. Rather, check out \\"The Sisters\\". It's got the classic sound of Renaissance, slightly mournful, and if I were king it would have ended up on that 'best of, volume two' in place of, say, \\"Midas Man\\" or \\"Jekyll and Hyde\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Art Rock Band No One Ever Heard Of","review":"This is the band's most consistant studio album.

I have read many reviews on this album over the years stating what poor quality it is, and I admit that many of the ideas on this album were not fully realized, and that some of the musical combinations were less than optimal. However, this album is pure potential. Unfortunately for those of us who enjoy the dark beauty of this style, Deborah Borchers felt that she grew beyond the stage of her life that required this music and changed her style completely.

ALL of the lead characters; men and women, are pigs. Horrible, borderline sexist stereotypes of women - the bimbo, the bitch, the hot mess. These chicks, if they exist, and again, I'm so glad I've never encountered anyone like them, deserve to be transplanted over to a slasher flick where they can all get what they (cinematically) deserve for being so mean and so pathetic.

Although the comparisons to \\"Bridesmaids\\" are inevitable, both of us found this to be the better movie. It relies on well-written jokes and the comedic timing of the actors (specifically Lizzy Caplan and Isla Fisher), while \\"Bridesmaids\\" relied more on the physical set pieces that Judd Apatow favors.

Two of the stars try to get in her large wedding dress and rip it, thereby driving the plot as the three main actors try to fix it. Isla Fisher and Lizzy Caplan spend most of the movie acting like two high very unfunny people. I guess the writer was trying to out-raunch Bridesmaids and therefore be cutting edge but it doesn't work at all. Bridesmaids was a great movie and this one has jokes that are too cruel and too obvious and the gifted Caplan is completely wasted in this film. She and Adam Scott were great in Party Down, which was funny and intelligent. Both Caplan and Scott are mired in this terrible script and the cliched performances demanded of it.

The whole drug using scenes in this movie are such a turn off that I almost walked out of the movie theater, but I stayed because I was curious the see how this train-wreck of a movie ended.

I am a fan of Rebel Wilson and was hoping that this movie would showcase how funny I find her to be. She wasn't in the movie all that much and didn't produce any laugh tracks for me. Instead, I find a 80's throwback glorifying coke use (seriously, coke?!?!...could you be more original?). The last time that that produced a ton of laughs was in Bachelor Party circa 1984.

Not very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prudes, be warned","review":"I can see how people would hate this movie. It contains slutty behavior and drug use, and that turns a lot of people off. But this movie far exceeded my expectations. As a personal preference, I didn't like the way Rebel Wilson's character, Becky, was treated as the \\"fat girl.\\" But I also thought it was pretty realistic. The others are jealous of her for marrying a rich guy when they feel she just doesn't deserve it, compared to them. I don't agree with their thinking but this is typical female behavior. I found some of the drug use to be a little over the top but overall, this movie made me laugh and kept me entertained. I can't say that about most movies I've watched lately.If you're looking for a feel-good movie that will leave you with warm fuzzy feelings, this sure isn't it.

I have rarely seen a good movie about pre-wedding shenanigans but I enjoy so many of the cast members I thought I'd give it a shot. What a waste of $10! My synopsis: \\"Coked up, insensitive, mean girls ruin lifelong friend's rehersal dinner and then tramp around NYC trying to get laid and more coked up all under the pretense of getting their \\"friend's\\" wedding dress fixed (that they tore while mocking her size). In the end the selfish girls find boyfriends, get the dress fixed at the 11th hour and are forgiven by the kind, fat bride.\\" I didn't care at all about these horrible, selfish characters.

They also have a utility called \\"Drop Doc\\" which will automatically convert any MS Word file (.doc) to an RTF file that is then opened flawlessly by Write. So, now you can convert all those old documents without any difficulties.What can be improved: changing the view size (from say, 100% to 150% can result in some slight blurriness of characters, depending on your font choice). That's it.And there is a MS Excel alternative (Mariner Calc) too.Word and Excel can do a lot of fancy things, but I only need and use probably 10% of their capabilities -- and for me Mariner Write (and Calc) do more than what I need, for a lot less $$."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect.

The art is, simply put, terrible -- sloppy, amateurish, and our well-loved characters are barely recognizable! The stories are all derivative and devoid of the slightest spark of imagination. The \\"humor\\" falls completely flat.Even \\"completists\\" will be sorry they bothered. Thank goodness I only borrowed a copy from the library! The price would be highway robbery for a book this slight, even if it were much better done than it is. Time to break out the old comics again, and try to remember what I liked about \\"Elfquest\\" in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"An amatuerish attempt not worthy of the Elfquest line","review":"I am surprised and dissapointed by this book. The art in particular is very poorly done to someone used to Wendy Pini. Proportions and perspective change completely from frame to frame, and the expressions are rendered with no ability whatsoever. The storylines were simplistic and had little to do with the Elfquest series (which I have very much enjoyed) The characters were simply not the same as those in other stories-they were simply grafted onto stories written without the Elfquest motif in mind. That would not be so bad, but the artwork was so terrible that I could barely finish.I am returning this book, and I would strongly discourage anyone from buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good.","review":"Maybe it's just me and my own sense of humor, and seriousness, but I wasn't amused by these stories at all. Bursting out with laughter? No. And the artwork is awful. I'm a fan of the ElfQuest series all the way up to Kings of the Broken Wheel, and the change from beautiful, symmetrical elves to ugly, lopsided weak characters was shocking. There's a lot of fanart out there that's better than this! And the dialogue was flat and simple.If you're a really diehard fan of EQ, stay away. If you like the series, but can accept the art, boring stories, and all, then go and read it. I hope the artists that drew this get better.

It's supposed to be about the supernatural.\\" I say lighten up.Over the course of eight seasons,I think you're entitled be silly every once in a while.Yes I could have did without a couple of the episodes,but overall season 6 is one of the better Charmed seasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great:","review":"I have ordered all of the Charmed Seasons except the 7th.

I loved Drew fuller and the charachter of Chris. I have no idea why fans need to divide the seasons. They are all great and need to be looked at as a whole. Despite a few continuity problems, this season brought something fresh and new to Charmed. What a great twist; Chris comes back from the future to save Wyatt and the Charmed ones from a deadly fate. From the end of season five, I had a suspision that Chris may be Pipers son, I thought, however that he may have been Wyatt at first. But I rooted for him, despite his scheming at times. Maybe in the future, writers need to review past episodes of the show they are writing for to avoid messing up details.

I love Rose McGowans hair color during this season! It really matched her complextion - so when she was a brunette suddenly.. That was hard to get used to! But besides hair, everyones acting is superb, especially Brian Krause - he was really shining the last few years...I say go for it because its worth it if you want to understand the season or you're just a fanatic. Likewise, its good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best, but still 'Charmed'","review":"In typical Charmed fashion, this season is no letdown as far as vanquishes, humor, and skimpy outfits are concerned. Much of the season is spent trying to fill in gaps in the storyline - basically keeping Wyatt from turning evil or keeping evil from killing Wyatt. The sisters continue their awesome performances in the sixth season which, although is not my favorite season, still keeps fans inthralled with the show and leads to an amazing ending. If you love Charmed, you'll love this season just as much as the rest!For the release date for season 8, make sure you check out this site - [.....]I can't wait for the final two seasons on DVD!

They should have been jumping up & down, but they all kinda just sat there, talking. I think the biggest problem w/ this movie was they kinda made it seem that PEOPLE were being glorified instead of our Lord.

I really didn't care too much for this particular movie, sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book for beginners!","review":"I agree with the reviews here that this book is for beginners. Why? When I opened this book and saw the paintings inside, I felt as though I were looking at paintings done by someone who had just begun to paint and was taking a brush and just splashing color all over the canvas. Any beginner would be thrilled to learn from this book, because to duplicate what this artist has done would seem quite simple to do. I realize that this is just my opinion of an artist's work. Apparently he is well received and has won many awards. But, I could not even get passed the paintings to get to the text to see if it was actually of any value, because I felt the paintings were so horrid.

And that is what the new John Rain book is -It is fast paced, great locations, and some very bittersweet scenes.John Rain's profession is a hard one. His tries at redemption are fascinating. Also there is more humor in this Rain book than the others, and that makes the book more appealing, if there was a need for that...Great cast, great writing. Great continuation of the series -Another reviewer noted an appendix to his book - mine had none.

The style of writing is difficult, circuitous, repetitive, and wordy. It is full of generalizations and citations from other authors and is lopsided in its thesis that all good things come from hunter/gatherers. It is nostalgic babble about a time long gone, from which we continue to evolve. There is no going back. No pragmatic solutions are offered for improving our present day predicaments, such as over population, aggressive behavior and overcrowding.

It is only limited to four dedicated watch spaces but includes room for various other items such as 3 pens, cufflinks, rings, chains or even a smaller watch or two. It is well made (the clasp could be a bit more robust and the case could have been made thinner) and with several recent price drops is a much better deal.

I was hoping she'd have on slippers or sandals. The doll is actually barefoot, which is fine, but she does not have any toes (no lines to mark toes) from what I can see. This is my first collectible without shoes, so I don't know if that's common or not. I've given her a 4 because of the lack of shoes and in my collection she falls in the middle.

It tore and fell off of the gun after a few uses. Wrapping electrical tape around the grip doesn't exactly look professional.The next problem was the unit misfiring after every few shots. Personally, I think there is a design flaw in which the driver blade does not line up quite perfectly with the staple to be shot. This has been a frustrating and persistent nuisance. Technical support was quite pleasant to deal with, but has yet to deliver an effective solution.Now, the stapler has lost it's muscle. Even at 120psi feed, it struggles to drive even 1\\" staples effectively.I am all about repairing tools, as I absolutely hate having to buy a tool twice, but one can only invest so much time and frustration and eventually it just isn't worth it.In summary, \\"Should have bought the Hitachi\\".... comes to mind again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tow Harness","review":"Being part of a Marine Serach & Rescue group, this harness along with a tow line is primarily used for towing disabled boats off the lake.

There is great chemistry between Max and Lysette and the story is fast paced and interesting. Set during one of my personal favorite time periods (early 1800's) and in one of my favorite locations (New Orleans) Ms. Kleypas manages to include historic people in their own storyline that is not boring to the reader but at the same time manages to include main characters and move the story along.

The author may not have been happy with her original effort but this is by no means an improvement. Is this an example of the type of characters we have to look forward to in historicals from now on? I hope not. What she did to Max in this updated version made me cringe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of her best","review":"In my opinion, this is the weakest of Kleypas's novels; it was the second novel by her that I read and made me rethink my initial attraction to the author. I found the characters to be non-engaging and the story predictable and dragging. I would recommend this novel only to a die-hard Kleypas fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"i was turned completely off!!","review":"i couldn't get through this book when the herione explaned max's house as a slave compound??? what was that supposed to mean? me being a black woman was turned off.why is this mentioned in a romance????"},{"rating":"1","title":"If It Ain't Broke........!!","review":"Don't fix it!!! Watered down version of the first book. Lysette our heroine now has more of a spine and our hero ,Max, is less tormented and everybody got along w/ each other. Blah, blah, blah, boring , boring, boring. The characters...the whole story is much less compelling. Very disappointed in L.K. I think she just got too lazy to create a new story from scratch. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"the new politically correct version","review":"I bought the book without reading the summary because it was a book by Lisa Kleypas and I love her. My favorite book is Only in your Arms. Imagine my disappointment when I realized its the same book, not new or improved, simply modified to make the main characters more politically correct. Lysette was made over to appear more strong and educated. She was a much more likeable character without this makeover. Part of the beauty of the first book was that she was nervous and unsure but still wielded a mysterious power over her husband Max and her stepsons. While the new version is not totally bad I ended up being very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Kleypas novel I've attempted to read","review":"Couldn't finish it: characters just weren't like-able or deep.

It is a very heart warming story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Lisa Kleypas - Hated this makeover!","review":"I was so dissapointed in this remake! The only thing that was changed was making Lysette unattractive. I'm sorry, that is just too un-original for me. This is honestly the worst Lisa Kleypas book I have ever read. Generally, I adore her books - I found myself wanting to burn this one. Only in your arms was a great book - one of my favorites. I think I'd like to remember the story the way it was."},{"rating":"1","title":"When Strangers Marry","review":"I would have hated to read the first version of this book. This re-written version was so boring that I read 10 pages at a time and dreaded picking it up again each time. Bernard was the only character with any real passion and he wasn't a pleasant person. Justin was somewhat interesting until he went soft halfway through the book. Lysette trying to pretend to be a parent to two boys that were almost the same age as her was very weird. For that matter I couldn't quite get it out of my head how young she was compared to Max. It was like he was having sex with a 12 year old. There was no passion or friction between the two at all. The romance part of this book was very, very boring. It would have been more fitting for Lysette to end up with one of the twins rather than Max. The end of the book was a great disappointment. What they did when the murderer was found out made me ill. I didn't enjoy this book at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Potentialy Good","review":"I love Lisa Klypas, but this one did not take my fancy. It had a great story line, BUT very drawn out. What normally takes me a day, 2 tops, to read it took me a month to get myself to finish this novel. My absolute FAV at this point is Blue-Eyed Devil! It had a realistic twist and kept me emotionaly involved with the characters. Which is what everyone should look for in every romance novel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite","review":"My least favorite of all 10 books Ive read by Lisa Kleypas. I think I would have enjoyed the original much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great historical romance","review":"This rewrite of an older story is a vast improvement. It has a rich flavor of New Orleans under American protectorship and of the Creole culture. The heroine has spunk and is intelligent as well as tactful. The hero is a powerful man who loves his family and has been thought a murderer for years. Behind the scenes currents and betrayal echo throughout. The writing is done with a sense of humor as well. Great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good PT session","review":"I did a short stint at Naval Officer Candidate School and this sure brought back memories. OCS is taught by Marine Corps drill instructors and I must say, the are just like they are on the DVD. PT starts out with the stretches (even though you typically do a few more at OCS), then goes to the workouts. The workouts are identical, but we tended to do a few more than are on the DVD. The circuit course is great and you DO NOT need one of your own. You can substitute dips for pushups and others, but it might be a good idea to get some dumbells. A good product... very motivational."},{"rating":"2","title":"Need a bit of kit...","review":"Great DVD, just stretch along with the marines, do the workouts as they do them, but you really need a dvd player in the same location as your gym equipment. You don't need much the only thing thats hard to find is a good beam/bar for doing heaves/pull-ups. The dvd is explained well, suits all levels of fitness, stretches, warms up and worksout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Work Out: Too Much Money","review":"I was in the Marine Corps and really enjoyed the work out, but $25.00 is was too much money for it. This is a $10.00 DVD. If it had more than one session on it, I may say different, but you will get bored doing the same workout every time. I also love the fact that Amazon.com made it $24.95 instead of $25.00 so it wouldn't qualify for free shipping.However a previous reviewer was correct in that you don't have to have a circuit course at your house. I was able to do most everything with just a set of dumbbells."},{"rating":"1","title":"pignose lil PA has a problem","review":"I bought the Pignose lil PA for my church group and it had a similar problem to other posts, sound died out after a minute or 2. I am an electrical engineer and checked into the amplifier circuit. I discovered that the design is flawed leading to the bad performance. I fixed mine and it now plays great.

I'm 54 years old and I have an enormouse record collection spanning 5 decades. This album would be in my top 5.

Anyone not moved by this album is not human."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Van Album","review":"Although I have stated I think \\"Into The Music\\" is Van's greatest album, this is my personal favorite. It oozes with beautiful jazz flavored melodies. It really transports the listener to another place altogether and can set the perfect mood for enjoying a rainy day. A few choice moments: the grandiouse orchestration of \\"The Mystery\\", the subtle but infectious opening piano of \\"I Forgot That Love Existed\\", the backing vocals of \\"Did Ye Get Healed?\\" You know this is one of his finest works when such gems as \\"Alan Watts Blues\\" and \\"Give Me My Rapture\\" occupy the usual \\"filler\\" spots on what used to be called \\"Side 2\\".

I tried using small blocks to narrow the area but that did not work well. This less than desirable workaround caused the gate to keep falling down, so I had to return it.My question is: why design a gate that has an 1.5 inch gap in coverage???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice gate","review":"I believe the other reviewer is mistaken. I too thought that the gate was bent at the top when we got one (two of them actually). Then I realized that the gate is manufactured like this on purpose. By having the top of the gate be wider than the bottom you can force the gate into the opening which keeps the top of the gate very snug in the doorway. I really like this feature. Since there is no top bar (when the gate is open) this also means the gate has no wobble when it's open. This and the version of the gate with the opener on the bottom (that you step on) are quick solid gates that I would recommend. I will, however, point out that the other review is right, the instructions do not make it clear that gate being \\"too wide\\" at the top is by design (and quite a good design I might add)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I bought this product for childproofing purposes.

We don't need the extension, but we have it in case we need it for a later use.The latch is pretty easy to use (once you read the instructions), not very loud, especially to open (in response to someone else's review, it does click shut more loudly, but still not \\"loud\\"). My 2.5 YO daughter can close it, but not open it. We did figure out that we can ALMOST close it (but not latch it closed), so that she can get in and out but the cats still think it's closed.I installed it (I'm a fairly bright female, age 39) in about 7 minutes, including time for reading instructions.I really like it, she tripped over it once, but that was it, she learened really fast. If I needed another one, I would definitely get this one again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the money","review":"I found the gate easy to install and a good value for the money - I have another pressure-mount gate that I like better but it cost twice as much. We have this one in our bedroom doorway and I like that the profile is so slim that we can still close the door without removing the gate. The gate swings both ways which makes it easy to use, and the one-handed operation takes some getting used to but is doable. Like some reviewers said, in order to have the gate tight enough that your kid cannot yank it loose, it becomes so tight that you can't just push the gate closed. However, it is easy to hold the locking mechanism in as you close the gate, and I consider that to be an acceptable workaround. The gate is a nice neutral taupe that fits in with our color scheme - much better than the other offerings in this price range that are gaudy white plastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible unsteady gate!","review":"This gate is horrible. I cannot find a way of making it tight because it requires that you loosen the pressure mounts so the door has 1/8th of an inch room so you can slide the handle to unlock it. In order for our gate to reach the 1/8th of an inch we had to loosen the pressure mounts so much that there is no way it would stay in place with my 12m old pulling on it!!Not only did we have issues with that but it is REALLY difficult to open! There is no way my 8yo can unlock the gate and even I'm having a lot of trouble.Save your money and purchase something different. We'll be returning this gate."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"it works perfect at the end of the stairs to keep the dogs from going upstairs. The walk though door is perfect. The only thing that was a little difficult was tring to put it together without looking at the instructions. After reading the instructions it went together easy. All and all it is a great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Sturdy Gate","review":"I just got this gate today and I'm glad I bought it. It was so easy to put up! I have put up three other gates around the house and this is by far the easiest to install. It took me longer to get it out of the box than to install. It is very sturdy and my 18 moth old son can not pull it down. He was able to pull down the previous pressure mounted gate.I gave it four stars instead of five because it is a little bit of a pain to close. Instead of just clicking closed like most other gates you have to hold the buttons to make sure it locks. A minor inconvience. All in all it is a nice sturdy gate that is easy to install."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best...","review":"Was unimpressed with this gate.

GREAT PRICE. looks good too.","review":"if you're having trouble opening the gate, try standing sideways in front of the gate and pushing/pulling the slide-lock mechanism instead of facing the gate and trying to slide it sideways. makes it easier for people like me, with three babies and back and wrist problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great gate if you have a strong, healthy back and always have two hands available","review":"This is a great gate if you have a strong, healthy back and always have two hands available. But how many people with kids have both of those! It was great at keeping my baby in the room, but my 4 year old couldn't open it and neither could her grandma. And it made me and my husband want to cuss. It is back in the box and in the return pile. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non receipt of order","review":"I ordered this dog gate on January 1, 2009.

Little pets can get though it...NO PROBLEM AT ALL! also with enough pressure pushing on the door, it'll easily push open. I've never used it on a baby nor would I even think that anyone should use it for babies/children. The stepover pet gate would be better and it'd be good for pets as well as small children. I would NOT buy this again nor would i suggest it to anyone. sorry"},{"rating":"2","title":"love it!","review":"I purchased this one over others I have had because my 2 and 3 year old grandsons can open them.

It's pretty easy to open and very easy to close. However, as other reviewers noted, at first it seems that the gate is defective and it is hard to install.My dad and I tried to put it up, he said I should send it back because it was defective (I knew better after reading other reviews), and then my husband finally got it up after an hour of cursing. We also had a difficult area to install the gate, our stair railing is thin and metal. We used a metal drink coaster on the drywall side to prevent any damage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept, poor construction","review":"I purchase 2 of these gates on Amazon. They installed very easily and I loved the general design and operation. Unfortunately the buttons on both gates jammed within the first two weeks of use. Maybe it was just a bad batch, but something to be aware of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality, works as designed","review":"I have this gate at the top of the stairs in my house to keep the dogs out of our bedroom area. The gate fits snugly in the doorway and is easy to open and close. Our little puppy is able to squeeze through one part; to prevent this I wrapped some packing tape across the bars. The tape is nearly invisible and prevents the puppy from squeezing through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious even if you aren't Muslim","review":"I was worried that there would be jokes I wouldn't get, not being Muslim myself, but there was no problems! It is hilarious, everyone should own a copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Praise for \\"Praise Jerusalem\\"","review":"This is a wonderful book, and Augusta Trobaugh achieves a tour de force in addressing aging and coming-of-age, race, religion, class, and the complex ways women bond across those divisions. The voice of the main character, Amelia, is convincing and compelling in both youth and age. The description of what might be called the mysticism of the common person is unsurpassed. This is the only book I've ever read from the Christian tradition that addresses what Buddhists call tonglen, breathing in the suffering of others, breathing out the hope of happiness for them. The language is lush, gorgeous, almost painterly, and the message -- that the love of another for you is something that cannot be thrown away -- will make you look back over those moments in your own life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like reading two different books","review":"I really wanted to be wowed by this book, but I wasn't. In fact I had to struggle to finish it. Such hope and promise but the author failed to bring it home. Great characters, but not totally developed. There were times when I was able to put myself in the car with the three women and picture them traveling down the road with their belongings, but it needed more dialogue between the women. I ended up making up conversations with them in my head. It is horrible to love the characters so much and then they just sit there on the page."},{"rating":"1","title":"couldn't make myself finish it","review":"I have never written a review, but also this is only the 2nd book I just could not make myself finish.

Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Bother","review":"I am not sure why other reviewers gave this 5 stars - if I could give this no stars then I would. Do not waste any of your precious reading time on this meandering novel. There is no resolution and the child in this novel keeps talking about the \\"Great Mystery\\" - the great mystery to me is why would anybody give this novel an outstanding rating. No redeeming qualities at all and I am sorry that I wasted my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"southern woman","review":"Amelia, the main character, switches back and forth between the present and one summer of her childhood. That particular summer, Amelia stays with a Negro family, attends their church and is \`saved'. During that short time, Amelia finds her purpose in life.

It advertised that it would hold a pet up to 20 pounds. When I received and opened, it said right on the tag accommodates dogs to 12 pounds! My Japanese chin is 11 pounds and it seems quite uncomfortable for him. It is usable but not comfortable. It doesn't seem like it would be comfortable for a smaller dog either. It is long and thin. My dog takes up only a small portion of the bag because his body just squishes to one side in it! Maybe if it were deeper? I think he would be more comfortable in one of my own pocketbooks. Very odd shape for carrying a dog. Also, the little pocket in the front in very cheesy looking ."},{"rating":"2","title":"pet sling","review":"I bought the sling for my almost 10 pound dog. I wasn't able to carry her in the many dog bags that you put on your shoulder, she was a little too heavy. The sling is the solution! My dog loves the sling cause she is as close to me as can be and it keeps her very comfy. The only drawback is that it could be a little deeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love This Product","review":"I love this product! My fuzzy toy poodle took to this carrier immediately, and settled comfortably into it as soon as I put her into it. I own a very expensive carrier and she really doesn't like, since she usually resist getting into it and trys to fight her way out of it every chance she gets to get me to carry her in my arms. In the Sling Go Pet her little body is right next to my own and she feels safe, secure and happy because she can comfortably look out at the world while traveling in style next to mommy, leaving me hands free when needed. Plus I love the fact that this carrier is competely compact and folds away easily. Hence, I highly and whole-hearedly recommend this wonderful, innovative and affordable product to any pet lover, who loves having their pet with them when on the go.

It's flimsy, shallow in very awkward areas and cheaply made. If you have an 8 pound terrier this will likely somehow work for you -- otherwise it's just a disaster. My 18 pound Italian Greyhound could only sit up straight and awkwardly twisted her body to fit this flimsy, non-supportive bag. I expected the bottom to be padded more than a cotton ball amount and for the bag to have at least a little structure -- just like how the photograph displays. Instead it's just a poorly made and falsely depicted product.

Not good.Otherwise, he liked it, he was comfortable, and even more so when I tried lining it with some fleece to try to pad the edges.

I had some concerns because other people had said it hurt their back. Well, I have arthritis in my spine and it never cause me any issues. This was perfect! Thor weighs about 8lbs and the sling says it is good for up to 12lbs. Thor had plenty of room and although he was hesitant at first to get into it, once in it for a few minutes he appeared to be okay with it. The next time I brought it out Thor was trying to leap into my arms before I could get it on. Now, Thor will beg to get in the sling and he curls up and goes to sleep.

It arrived within the week in spite of being during Xmas season, very well packed and in excellent condition. The carrier is solidly constructed and adjustable as to how high or low you want to carry the pet, and has straps in the pocket for added security, to attach to a pet collar or harness. Essential for independently minded cats.Only suggestion I might have is to add a bit of padding to the shoulder strap, for increased comfort to the human. My kitten Foxy (age 6 months) likes being carried in it, especially when I spray a little catnip inside. However, he is still so feisty that he soon insists on exploring on his own four feet down below (he is also leash and halter trained). This carrier also comes in handy indoors, as an alternative to Foxy climbing where he shouldn't, and giving him an \\"almost\\" human level view of what his human (me) is doing."},{"rating":"1","title":"MissLondon","review":"My dog hated this sling.

Sling bottom: Package claims it's padded. It is not. The elastic neck thing cinches up around the animal, and the whole apparatus acts exactly as you would expect a non-reinforced, non-padded synthetic bag to act if you dumped an animal into it. May as well be carrying the dog in a laundry sack. It's clearly not comfortable for the puppy. I end up putting at least one arm under the bag to give the dog some confidence and stability -- essentially carrying the animal one-handed. Better than no pouch at all, but not what I paid for.

It's great for being hands free, and worked great at the farmers market and around the house. He may get a little too hot in it during hot days, though.

I was in love with her soulful smooth sound. But a sub par performance in Memphis, Tn and later her death made me stop listening to what I thought would be a great artist for years to come. I don't mean to sound mean, but I just don't understand what would make someone take their own life. There are too many people and things to live for. Artist become a part of their fan's fabric.

This story of an offbeat friendship between a Brooklyn kid and his baseball hero feels real, had me laughing convulsively, kept me waiting breathlessly for the next adventure, and brought to life a great cast of supporting characters.What makes the book so special is that, although often hilarious, there is a gentle side to the humor.

As I read the book, the words \\"precious\\" and \\"adorable\\" came to mind. Steve, in his unusual format for storytelling, just wraps big and loving arms around his readers, allowing them time with beguiling characters, a great time frame (WW II), the sport of baseball (and, no, you don't have to be an expert or even a fan of the sport), and celebrity figures from sports and entertainment and politics of the period, all making for an absolutely delightful and moving reading experience.

Precocious 9 year olds, written in letter format and baseball? How much worse could this get? I was hooked on the first page when 9 year old Joey has a letter from Franklin D. Roosevelt thanking him for his support. The book follows the relationship between Joey and professional baseball player Charlie Banks. I found myself laughing out loud numerous times. Joey grows up as different personal and world events shape the world around him. This is a great book for sitting on the beach or just relaxing. It reads very quickly and is very entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one's for the bookshelf","review":"There isn't anything else I can say about this book that hasn't already been said.

I was at a bar the other night having a gin -tonic and I immediately thought of Joey, and Charlie, and Hazel, and Stuke; unarguably, it's also the secondary characters that really made this book shine.Excellent book!

Maybe somewhere down the road, I'll pick it up again and remember the memories that this book contains that really lend themselves to the reader making us all Joey and Charlie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A laugh-out-loud tearjerker","review":"I don't know when I've fallen in love with a book like I did with Last Days of Summer. Touching, poignant, moving, and at the same time hysterically funny. I borrowed a copy from the library to read it for my book club, but will be purchasing a copy for my personal book collection so my husband and son (when he's a bit older) can read it. I can't recommend it highly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"I FRICKIN LOVE THIS BOOK","review":"IF YOU KNOW OF OTHERS LIKE THEM E-MAIL ME. I LOVE SARCASTIC CHARACTERS, THE '40s, BASEBALL ETC... GREAT BOOK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"????","review":"After reading all these 5-star reviews I expected this book to be a grand slam, but all I got was a walk to first. The characters come across like cutouts from a comic book, in a story that reads like something a 12 year old kid might dream up for English class (and get a C in-- OK, maybe a C+). I suppose the author was trying to convey something like the poignancy and cuteness of the old Little Rascals series, but he ends the book with a completely predictable \\"tragedy\\" which plunked no heartstrings here. Phony, contrived and lifeless. Forget it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just One of those Books","review":"Kluger did such an amazing job with this book. Through notes, letters, and more he was really able to bring out the characters and let you get to know them. I laughed, I cried, I have read this book more than a dozen times and still love it. I read all kinds of books at all times, and this will always be my favorite. If you like baseball, read this. If you like humor, read this. If you like being able to connect with the characters, read this. Its totally amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"How Long Do We Have to Wait for a Sequel?","review":"This is truly one of the best books I have ever read - and I don't even know why I picked it up in the first place? I'm an avid reader and have spent a lot of my time and a lot of my money on books that I couldn't even finish - but this book I reread about every three months. It's a laugh out loud, cry out loud, smile out loud kind of book and it will enrich your life tremendously. My only question is Steve Kluger - how long do we have to wait for a sequel?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Read","review":"Not a bad read. Entertaining and fun. Little bit of bad language and the format of the book is a way different then normal, but it is good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Last Days of Summer","review":"This is my all time favorite story! It will have you laughing out loud, as well as moving you to tears. It is just a wonderful and moving story about friendships and living with heart. The story is told through notes from the characters to each other, thereby letting you understand how each one is thinking. I highly recommend this book. I have read it many times, and even though I know the story, I find myself moved each and every time I pick it up! Last Days of Summer is a must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A leader in the field.","review":"This book was introduced to me in the best way possible. Someone read excerpts from it to me for 30 or more minutes. At that point it became a highly addictive drug. I've pushed this book on several people in exactly the same way.It is heartwarming, funny, touching and sad all at the same time. The only complaint that I have with this book is that it ended.If you read no other book this year, read this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Less about baseball, more about life","review":"If you're worried that you won't like this book because of the baseball element, worry no more. Baseball is part of it, yes, but the focus is more on life and on how much one life can be changed by a single relationship. We watch Charlie and Joey's relationship as it grows, and they grow along with it. There are lots of laughs along the way, but the book doesn't shy away from difficult themes: bigotry, war, abandonment. It's a wonderful book that should be required reading (except \\"required\\" usually ends up being \\"hated,\\" and that's a fate this book does not deserve)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Great Read","review":"I would have never guess that I would enjoy a book about a boy and his hero - a baseball player. I not only enjoyed it, I laughed out loud and finally I cried. Then I told almost everyone I know who likes to read to read this book. Loved it, loved it, loved it. Oh and I really loved it. Did I already mention that?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very funny! Suspend your disbelief and wallow in it.","review":"It took me about 3 hours to finish this book - it's a fast read and VERY fun.

The story is told through newspaper clippings and correspondence and in this clever format, Kluger presents as rich a novel as I've read in a while. This book is an especially good young adult selection."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"a couple of years ago my sister gave me this book as a gift and since i had nothing else to do i read it. boy did it knock me out. i laughed and i cried, i am a major baseball fan and this is a story for everyone. i wanted to believe this story was real i even looked in a ny giants baseball records book for a charlie banks knowing it wasnt there.in todays world atheletes dont talk to kids unless you pay them.i gave this book to people who dont like sports and they loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Delightful and Hilarious","review":"I almost NEVER post reviews on this site, but this book deserved to be praised. Only rarely do I read a book that is laugh-out-loud funny; that captures the speech and sounds of a certain place in time perfectly; that tells a great story; that makes you care about the characters; that makes you cry; that develops protagonists who will live in your memory. This is one of those books. I'm no great fan of the epistolary novel generally, but having read this book, I can't even imagine it written in a different style. A triumph."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh out loud","review":"Hysterically funny! If uou don't laugh out loud while reading th is book you have no sense of humor. Surprisingly touching and well written. A delightful light read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pleasure to Read","review":"If you read for pleasure, then this book is for you. A page turner in which you may ignore your favorite television show just so you may read the hysterical and brazen letters between the boy and his chosen recipient (the White House, a major league baseball player, etc). The book illustrates the development of father/son relationship between the boy and the baseball player. Charlie Banks, the Gentile baseball player, demonstrates true love for the boy by assisting him to prepare for his Bar Mitzvah. While reading this book, one could envision a movie depicting this wonderful story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly moving; funny and sad at the same time.","review":"\\"Last Days of Summer\\" is a thoroughly moving novel. It reminds me of the movies \\"The Sandlot\\" and \\"My Summer Story,\\" and of the play \\"Brighton Beach Memoirs.\\" I'm not a fan of baseball, but that didn't stop me from loving this story. It's told through a series of letters, teacher/parent notes, flyers, posters, and newspaper clippings over the span of two years during World War II, and it was a smart way of telling the story. The humor is sarcastic and delightful, and you'll become engrossed in the relationships and friendships made. Because of this, you won't be able to stop crying (or at least get misty-eyed). I recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Point of View CD","review":"I have always enjoyed Southern Gospel music and this was a CD from a few years ago that I could not find anywhere!

I was given the Sheep in a Jeep by an old family friend who said that it was her grandchildren's favorite books and it quickly became my daughter's favorite too (she was a year when given the book). So I went ahead and ordered a handful more... Sheep out to Eat and Sheep in a Shop are both very good and very comical especially when you own a flock of 30+ sheep. You can only imagine that's exactly how sheep would behave if in these circumstances. The rhyming is excellent, the illustrations are hilarious and I would highly recommend these books to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Perfect book for preschoolers. Not too long. Easy to read aloud. Get all the Sheep books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very cute, fun to read aloud","review":"This is my favorite of the sheep books, with sheep in a jeep ranking close behind. The rhymes are simple and fun to read aloud. The vocabulary is challenging for a preschooler. The illustrations are clever. However, I pick it to read aloud more often than my daughter does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment","review":"We received Sheep in a Jeep as a present when my son was born and I nearly tore my stitches I laughed so hard.My now 1 year old LOVES Sheep in a Jeep.So, I bought this one expecting the same type of humor and level of writing. This one seems like it was written in a day just to get another book out there. It isn't funny, the rhymes are clumsy and I did NOT necessarily like the message - which the first time around felt to me like something along the lines of \\"don't try to venture out where you don't belong\\" and \\"stick with what you know\\". Messages I'm not really excited for my toddler to learn.Just one mama's opinion, but again. disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"SIMPLY A FUN BOOK TO READ WITH YOUR CHILD.","review":"Again, our adventurous sheep find themselves completely out of their element and in a world of trouble. This is a great addition to a great series. This time our little band of sheep decide to go out for lunch and visit a local tea room. While this work can be classified as a beginner reader, I have to admit that I was laughing and smirking just as much as the kids when I read this one to them. The illustrations are of the usual high quality that Margot Apple has offered us in the past and the text is absolutely delightful and goes perfectly with those illustrations. This is a fun to book to read to the entire class, or a good one to read with your child one on one. Actually, I found absolutely nothing to not like about this work."},{"rating":"1","title":"No for Pros!","review":"I own a small home improvement/remodeling company and own many fine tools that I depend on everyday to make a living.

Love the vent in the palm too-hands never feel too hot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't offer very much protection","review":"These gloves are well made leather gloves with an iron bar for good grip but they're very light and offer no support for the wrist or hand. In addition, the padding is very thin. I wouldn't recomend them for heavy bag or working with a trainer. They're probably fine for the speed bag.If you're going to use these gloves, at the very least also get yourself a pair of hand wraps or, like me, you'll probably loose some skin from your knuckles.For not very much more money, you can get gloves that offer significantly more protection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for starting out","review":"These gloves came with my bag and they are more than comfortable for when I was first getting used to it.I'm giving it 3 stars for now because something about the internal material rubbed my knuckles the wrong way and since I don't want to stop working out I have a near dime sized perpetual scab on my pinky knuckles.I'm going to purchase another pair at which point I'll come back and change my review relative to those.Edit: So I'm downgrading to a two because these gloves would not stop scabbing my knuckles and once I went at the bag for over an hour I took off the gloves to find my hands were complete fubar. They may have been a size too large but the material inside is what I'd say is to blame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage gloves","review":"If your hands are bigger than a child you will not fit in these gloves. I wonder if my seller gave me cheap knock offs they are so small. Quality is bad also. Who are these people that like these gloves? Too small too cheap the real deal, garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thin??","review":"If you truly believe these gloves are too thin...then you've obviously been raised in todays society as the bunch of weeklings that the whole world is coming to. These are excellent gloves for the Seasoned Heavy/Speed bag enthusiast. Obviously NOT for beginners as apparently stated in others comments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Usefull","review":"If you need impact protection (e.g. for heavy bag work) these provide no protection - you need to wrap your hands, preferably with long pro style hand wraps and use 14 oz or heavier gloves. For hand protection you may also want to look into using knuckle guards for use with wraps - but the guards are not appropriate for sparring use.Wraps provide structural support for the entire hand and wrist.These gloves do not.Cheers, Erik"},{"rating":"2","title":"They aren't lying, it's hot","review":"Hot but delicious!

The Catholic Church is absolved of the sins of the Inquisition in this alternate reality,since they were just trying to root out the breeding program of the Satanists all those years, and continuing to do so to the present. And where did this arcane breeding knowledge come from? Why, from King Solomon!

It has much more quality and its fun to use and less expensive. The Tsunami Motorized Blaster is a waste of money to me. It dosent squirt far and dosent give you a good workout, unlike the water guns with pumps. The water capacity is also very small, runing only about 45 sec of continuous squirting. Don't be fooled.

While Bloesch argues that Scripture does not teach historical inerrancy, Warfield makes a good case that it does -- based on Scripture's own teaching.

I love it. But, I'm sorry folks, Blue on Blue is just awful! Dull lyrics, dull tunes, dull instruments. There are no catchy songs, there are no deep, thoughtful songs.

I grew up during the 80's but enjoy pop/rock songs from the 70's through today's current trends.Now that you understand a bit about my background, I am astonished an album of this quality wasn't more mainstream shortly after it's release. I recently purchased it and cannot stop listening to it. It's ethereal and meaninful.

The ink is actually a rubber based material and protrudes above the playing surface so it grabs the cards as you deal them across the table. I would have preferred there was no ink, especially \\"Blackjack\\". We play \\"Hold-em\\" so don't need the BJ theme anyway. Otherwise a very good product."},{"rating":"2","title":"You won't be disappointed","review":"Before I get into rating this amp, let me just say that it is not like regular guitar combo amps. Like the product descripion says it was designed for multiple types of instruments so don't go plugging into this thing and expect an amp with distortion when turned all the way up. It has a very clean tone when used alone with a guitar but add your favorite distortion or overdrive pedal and you will be amazed by its sound. Very punchy and with today's multi-effects with amp modeling built in, this is the only type of amp you want to use. Also, I can just unplug my guitar and effects and plug in my bass and not worry about blowing the amp. And the portability of it is great. The battery really does last long on just one charge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Solution for Me","review":"I have owned the Hog-30 for nearly one month and have found it just what I had hoped it would be-- a perfect boost in volume for my acoustic bass guitars while strolling with another band member on acoustic guitar among tables and guests at weddings and parties. I have mounted the small amp on a small luggage cart so that I don't have to bend over to pick it up when we move; it rolls along with me nicely. I've been practicing with it daily during the month, and have only charged it once, before using it, as per the instruction booklet. That seems amazing to me. It really holds a long charge. Though you will have to charge it for 8-10 hours at a go. And it can produce a warm, rich, upright-like tone (at acoustic-level volume,) or a more edgy, aggressive tone if you dial it up. Acoustic bass guitars, in my opinion, need a volume boost to be heard in crowd situations, even playing with a single acoustic steel-string guitar.

This is where Jonn took about a 45 degree turn in his musical style. \\"Winter's Chapel\\" is not only my favorite piece on this c.d., but is probably in the top three of my favorites songs of any ambient piece from any artist. It is a beautifully haunting piece with a slow, off beat rhythm and a subtly tricky melody, if you listen closely. The cover of the c.d. is beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"New age to chilled-out trance","review":"Serrie offers a range of musical styles on this CD from upbeat new age (the title song) to trance (\\"Tingri Maiden\\" and \\"Annie by the Sea\\"). The latter two cuts are the longest on the album and definitely material for the chill room at your local rave.My favorite cut in this set is the truly chilly \\"Winter's Chapel,\\" with the electronic rumble of wind blowing in the chimney and a haunting, repeating musical motif that evokes images of snow-covered fields under moonlight. Great for the car stereo and late-night freeway driving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different, but refreshing","review":"This might be Jonn Serrie's most different album. The theme of this cd is Tibetan culture, so there is an African flavor to several of the tracks. That isn't the only thing, though. On this album Serrie also experiments with more conventional-sounding music. The first few songs are bouncy and upbeat, containing far more substance than you might be used to hearing from Serrie.The last half of the album, however, takes a sharp turn back to the long-form ambient music Jonn Serrie is known best for. \\"Winter's Chapel\\" is a wonderful song for stargazing, and \\"Annie By the Sea\\" has a beautifully melancholy, yet deeply mysterious tone to it.Tingri is one of Jonn Serrie's least space-focused albums, but it still delivers."},{"rating":"1","title":"To Small","review":"I order a 7 1/2 in this shoe however when I got the shoe it look and felt like a 6...I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a smooth easy read of victory for family love.","review":"What a warm refreshing rekindling of family values at a time when we seem so helpless against the spread of hate and destruction!

Jean Sasson tells a real story of times and places, where there was no such thing as humanity. One had to become a beast, to be saved from another Beast.

But Mayada's story of prison and torture in Saddam's Iraq is a powerful testimony calling for justice against a regime that ranks with Stalin in brutality. Mayada's account covers everything from rubbing shoulders with Saddam and others in his entourage to meeting falsely accused prisoners undergoing incredible torture and humiliation. She exposes life inside Iraq from the luxurious elite to the oppressed victims, revealing fear and tyranny that Westerners can only imagine. Despite the troubles in post-Saddam Iraq, Mayada exclaims that despite the current strife Iraq is better off now that Saddam is gone. After reading her story, I couldn't agree with her more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"Mayada has to be one of 2004 top reads. Exploring the jail cells and treatmeant of Iraqians Mayada is a very touching story which will fill your heart with different emotions. Jean Sasson has yet again conjoured a wonder of a book. The book is put together so well and it even has a glossary if you dont understand the words. Mayada has all the cons of the Iraqian government and what Saddam and the government used to do (Uday who is saddams son used to let go of a tiger at busy restaraunts). Bizarre! Its starts off with Mayada, a newspaper journalist being imprisoned at Baladiyat where the guards torture people for days on and even killing them in the process (RIP JAMILA). She was imprisoned for accusations of herosy. This book is well put together but some parts seem fake and untrue and the ending wasn't good enough considering it had such a good story. So in all the only major con of this book is the bad ending(which cost it a star)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Shocking Must-Read","review":"After reading the Princess Sultana Trilogy and developing a keen interest in the lives of Middle-Eastern women I knew I had to read Mayada's story.

The IMF did not help matters nor did the former Communists who used their positions to loot the economy during privatization. Yeltsin too was a bit of a populist and as often happens populists make romantic rebels but horrible rulers. In the end the USSR was destroyed by the stupid 8 coup plotters who could not grasp the Soviet Union was not Guatemala and a coup in such a vast country was hopeless. The Republics were willing to sign the new union treaty but not after the coup. I was not fan of Gorbachev but history has proven he was right.

Thinking that this person actually knew what she was talking about when she said how wonderful the Suzie brand was, I went ahead and ordered the Suzie spelt cakes and they are awful. They have a very strong taste and they are vile - especially compared to the Paskesz ones I should have ordered to begin with.

And... there are pictures in the other sections of some of the rose bushes... but it could have been much more helpful if there were also a picture of each shrub, not just the close-up of the flower.But not to be forgotton, other than the beautiful flowers and the missing shrubs, David Austin's history of the English roses, etc, makes for interesting and educational reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sent me right to the computer to order roses","review":"I'm a dedicated rosarian, and love pouring over catalogs and books about roses.

In this album, Leroy Quintana and Paul Speer have laid down atmospheric tracks (much deeper than Musac or elevator music).

It has to be fictional because it's obvious Vigor never did it himself -- after all, he's still alive.Not only is his advice ridiculous, it's dangerous. Read works by real sailors like Hal Roth, Bernard Moitessier, Pete Goss, Richard Henderson, Beth Leonard, and Lin and Larry Pardey if you want to learn about sailing. Their recommendations are based on actual experience, not fictional accounts. But remember that many of their works were written before the Jordan Drogue was invented.

Secondly the romanisation is not pinyin, nor any other recognisable system. Thirdly this should be entitled \\"making out in Taiwanese\\" as a good 20~30 percent of the phrases in the book would not be recognised by mainlanders.If you want a book on Chinese slang then get either 'Mutant Mandarin' or 'Outrageous Chinese' by James Wang (China Books, San Francisco) although these include a lot of liumang and Beijing punk slang that doesn't travel well, or Li Shu Juan's 'Chinese-English Dictionary of Modern Slang in China' (ISBN 962-238-222-3, Hong Kong) the only failing of which is to not always distinguish Cantonese and Northern slang."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book to learn","review":"I like this book a lot!

Later, I bought a copy of Making Out in Chinese and was so relieved that the author did not write the pronounciations using the inane romanization system. I could actually say what I wanted to say in Chinese and be understood. I would highly recommend the book to those who hate the ping-yin system.

They do not show head resting on blocks, head resting on hands, and several other useful variations. The seated twists show legs crossing over and arms doing full wraps, that probably 40% of regular practitioners of yoga cannot do in that form (and I suspect an even larger percentage of the audience for this book). Also, all of the lotus pose pictures have the head improperly positioned, with the face looking forward instead of down and slightly front to maintain spinal alignment.

Great product, leaves coat soft and smells great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't do anything for my hair.","review":"Nothing special about this shampoo. It doesn't make it shinier or anything that other shampoos can't do. Live and learn."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's great","review":"My dog, bloodhound, has shown allergic reactions to almost all other shampoos and conditioners. But my neighbor pushed me to try this product on him, and miraculously it worked! His skin didn't flake, he wasn't irritated by it, and her coat was incredibly soft and shiny. Afterward, I rushed to buy my own bottle for him. I love this product and recommend it to all pet owners!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great shampoo and the conditioner is amazing too","review":"This product is awesome. I've used it for like 5 years and i've never had hair this soft and manageable. Used the more expensive products and didn't do the same thing as this does. It's the most amazing product ever. I'd say if you don't want to spend thousands of dollars on high end shampoo and conditioner then this stuff is the best. It's even better than that expensive stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for beginners and experienced dancers who want to look amazing","review":"This dvd is excellently choreographed and fun! but don't be fooled this is a real workout, especially great for people who are already fit and want a new workout to add to their home collection. The moves are broken down to a simple level for beginners, however it does take a bit of practice and determination before you get them perfect. Julianne's instructions are clear and helpful, this in-conjunction with her bright personality make the dvd that much more like-able.Beginners- with effort and practice will not only love this product but will also definitely get sweaty! but thats the point right?Experienced dancers- This is an excellent workout for even the fittest of people.Worth the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Need Coordination to Complete","review":"I was disappointed in this dvd. The steps are not for beginners. I did do the dance lesson segment a few times and tried the routines a few times. I ended up all tangled up. Julianne has a pleasant personality and the music was ok. People who love to dance and those with more of a dancing background should enjoy it, but others may have lots of frustration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Workout","review":"This is a fun workout. I have no dance background but found the moves easy to follow. As a beginner, my moves aren't as quick or as smooth as Julianne's but I still get a great workout. She starts with a warm up (5min) then goes through three routines, cha cha, jive, and paso doble (10min ea), then ends with a cool down (5min). She teaches some of the moves she actually teaches her dance partners on DWTS. The three dances are great, just wish she would have also had the samba."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD, even for a non dancer.","review":"As a huge fan of Dancing with the Stars and Julianne herself, I bought this DVD. It arrived quickly and I just did it for the first time today. Holy moly, not only was it a good workout, but it was also a lot of fun. As someone with ZERO dance experience, who is COMPLETELY out of shape, I can say that it was hard at first for me to pick up the choreography and finish the entire dances, but Julianne is a great teacher. She makes it easy to learn, truly fun, and made me want to finish all the dances, which I did (with some breaks tossed in). I had a smile on my face the entire time and I can't wait to do it again. This is a complete body workout and hours later, I can still feel it all over, which is great. I recommend this dvd to absolutely anyone, with or without dance experience, who wants to learn in the privacy of their own living room."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are your legs Julianne???","review":"I thought this video would be great! There were additional instructions on how to do sections of the cardio workout which were great! When you got to the actual work out video they were not filming her ENTIRE body and half of the time it was focusing on her upper body which was not helpful! I became frusterated because I was not able to see or follow along with what she was doing with her legs. I'm not sure who shot this video but they did a poor job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beginners beware!","review":"If you don't know how to dance...don't do it! I truly have no idea or any education of any ballroom dancing and this workout did not help with that. I think everyone loves to \\"dance,\\" but this is truly dance. I thought it would be something fun and different but this workout is very fast-paced with little instruction on the moves. It is definitely for someone with advanced knowledge of dance moves. Tried it once and now it's sitting on the shelf!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This DVD is definitely NOT geared toward beginners and should state so. Julianne's moves were exhausting to the point where even she comments on how out of breath and tired she is. Wish I could get my $$$ back. :o("},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I love Julianne which is why I bought this DVD. I love to dance and thought it would be fun to workout mixed with dance. I danced for many years as a girl, however, I had much difficulty following her dance moves. I don't consider myself to be uncoordinated, and have never really had a problem following a routine, but this one didn't work for me. It lacked instruction, moved very fast and I found myself frustrated in short order. Julianne is an incredibly talented dancer, but I wish I would have left this one on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch Julianne Dance","review":"This workout is disappointing and not at all motivating. I love to dance, but I used it once and wanted to return it. I've had some dance experience before, but this workout went way too fast to keep up with. She has a nice upbeat personality, but that's about the only good thing about this video.There is a step guide, where the moves are broken down, but there isn't much repetition in that section. She shows you the move once or twice, and then goes onto the next.I suppose you could stand in your living room and practice them alone for hours to prepare for the workout, but who wants to do that?The actual workout portion is extremely hard, so many whips and turns, it is dizzying!If you've had an advanced dance background and want to get back into shape, I'm sure it would be great; however, her fancy footwork is far too fast for the average person."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed-Not What I Expected","review":"I was excited to get this work out DVD but upon my first time trying it-never finished. I have taken ball room dancing classes in the past and consider myself to be pretty coordinated. I felt (even with the intro on how to do some of the steps) that the routine went too swiftly to keep up with. I haven't had an interest in trying it again. I feel that you would have to be a more advanced dancer to get much out of this work out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feel those legs burning!","review":"This is a perfect DVD for those who think that dancing is not a tough workout. This one will have you panting and sweating while moving through the segments. At the same time, the moves are fun and not overtly complicated. Both the warmup and cooldown are actually pretty good also.The dances are well choreographed for solo dancing and for maximum cardio effort. The jive will leave you absolutely breathless in the best possible way.Julianne is a good instructor, and she looks great, but makes me feel like I would throw something at the TV if I had to listen to her squeaky, super perky voice much longer. They should offer a music only option. :)Anyhow, well worth the money, and you can always turn the volume down hahahaha"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome and fun workout!","review":"I really enjoy this tape. The workout is energetic and fun, and I sweat a ton! I definitely recommend doing the private dance lesson first; it really makes it easier to keep up with the pace of the dances. I only wish the workout was a little longer. I frequently repeat segments to lengthen the workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Julianne","review":"This dance video is so much fun; Julianne is happy and upbeat, is great at breaking down dance moves, and is a good workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lotsa fun :)","review":"I really enjoyed working out to this video. It definitely helps to watch the private lesson first, but either way, you're gonna get a good workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I just got this DVD a few days ago. It is difficult but you break a sweat and really push yourself...that's what working out is all about. I am out of shape and not a dancer but I paused and rewind when I didn't get something and I didn't move on to the next routine until I got the first one. Currently, I am still working on the second routine which is VERY HARD but I like the way I feel after.To do this DVD, you do need coordination. So far so good, I love this DVD and would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout...","review":"This is a fun, easy to follow work out routine that inspires you to want to do more. It helps you burn tons of calories and is an amazing cardio work out. Julianne is America's Sweetheart and she's having so much fun doing it that you can't help but have fun with her. Doesn't even seem like a work out. Seems like a fun night out on the town dancing your booty off..."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I didn't watch more than 5 minutes of it because the hip thrusts hurt my back, and it bothered me that she was talking the entire time. The music was very poor (background house beats, no lyrics, no songs you know). This video is for people who don't really like to dance but desperately need a workout, have NO dance experience (i.e. not even going to clubs). It's for people who are doing the dance for the sole purpose of \\"working out\\" instead of enjoying the process. In short.. I wish I didn't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This is not a workout!! I didn't even break a sweat! If you want a great workout try The Biggest Loser Bootcamp gives you a great workout that makes you sweat and sore the next 2 days. Unlike this tape that was a waste of my money"},{"rating":"2","title":"Julianne Hough Dance/Cardio","review":"This is a beautiful CD and Julianne is as adorable and sweet as ever....just not enough detail on the moves. Seems she is instructing intermediate dancers which would have been helpful information on the site or jacket prior to purchasing. Still, a lot of fun and a delight to watch, just somewhat frustrating to have to slow, stop or repeat steps (this compromises the cardio effect). WE would have been better served had she focused more on instruction rather than just setting us up to watch her own brilliance. It's almost as if watching her is the priority and picking up the steps and moves is secondary which naturally cuts down on the cardio effect. LOVE Julianne and LOVE the dance nonetheless!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginners","review":"If you are a beginner to dancing this video is terrible and impossible. If you don't have a great deal of dancing experience it is way too fast paced. She gives you some \\"tips\\" but shows you the moves a few times then goes up to tempo and you have no prayer if you're not a dancer.I'm upset I wasted my money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh man, I so wanted to love this!!","review":"Unless you are a former dancer, or an extremely quick, agile and coordinated person, do not even think about trying this DVD. I made it through about the first 20 minutes then had to quit because my knees started to hurt in a bad way. Julianne is gorgeous and it's clear she loves to dance and teach others to dance, but I'm not dance-oriented and bought this based on the good reviews. So, to eBay this DVD goes, and back to my Jackie Warner DVDs I go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money","review":"Julianne is adorable, but this workout is pretty bad. The choreography is choppy, disjointed and not at all fun. I really wanted to love this, but was so disappointed in this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tough to Follow","review":"I love Julianne but this video is really tough. I have no dance background and I couldn't even make it through the one-on-one lesson before I got frustrated and gave the video to my sister (who is also frustrated!). I suppose if I gave it a couple weeks of just trying to learn the moves, I might pick it up but I want to work-out and not just stand there shuffling my feet. Like I said, Julianne is cute and upbeat but even that didn't help me keep my cool while trying to learn the moves."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is Okay","review":"This DVD is okay....but I wish I didn't buy it. Some of the moves are difficult, and Julianne faces you so it is really hard to follow to steps. In most classes, the instructor has his/her back towards you so you can mirror the movements...with this is all opposite and tricky...And, I didn't really get out of breath - except for the Jive! That one is good....other than that, not that great. But! Julianne is so perfect looking that watching the DVD does keep me motivated to continue working out - so that is good :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"**a***m****a*****z********i************n*********g*******w***ork***out****","review":"i had so much fun with this workout ... i try other dancing with the stars work out and they were so dispointing and very slow. but this was up beat and fun and easy to learn and gave me lot of enrgy when i done. i am not even dacing with the stars fun. but i thought it was really fun and very good cardio work out. i also learn so very differnt moves. i would like to see her make more work outs in the furture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the uncoordinated","review":"I love Julianne. And I'd love to look like her. For starters, I have no dance experience nor do I have any coordination. THAT is on me, not the DVD. HOWEVER, I found this DVD to be very fast paced and confusing. There is not enough of a slow breakdown showing the progression of the moves. She does it slow once or twice, without any detailed breakdown, then does it fast while combining other moves. I cannot follow it and cannot see how someone of no dancing background could follow it.I gave it 2 stars because if you say the heck with it and keep trying, you will get a workout. But honestly, with the pace that she goes at, it is a discouraging workout video. So unless you are a good dancer or actually wanting to learn to dance (aside from the workout aspect), save your money and dance to the radio! What matters is that you are moving, not that your side-steps are perfect and up to speed with her. If I'm going to look dumb, I'd like to be having fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"stop changing the camera angle!!!","review":"This was very hard to follow and the camera angle kept changing every few seconds and that made it even more difficult.If this is supposed to be about exercise while dancing shouldn't they focus on her legs and not her face? I wish I would have read more reviews before purchasing this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great dance workout!","review":"As a non-dancer, I've always been fascinated by people like Julianne Hough and the other pros on Dancing With the Stars who make it look so easy! After this DVD, I can say that I know it's not easy, but this is such a great workout. My favorite section is the middle one, the jive. It's a fantastic cardio workout. The only challenge is that in the beginning, if you don't know the moves, it goes a bit fast. However, Julianne has a segment on the DVD with a private dance lesson, so you can do the steps more slowly and learn them before doing them at tempo during the workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Workout","review":"Today was my first time using this DVD and I really liked it. Definitely do the private lesson before you start. And I'm so very glad no one could see me because I looked like an idiot trying to keep up with the moves during the real workout. It looks like I'll be able to pick up the different dance moves pretty well over time."},{"rating":"2","title":"I sweat more doing this than when I use the treadmill or elliptical!","review":"I bought this because I wanted something that I could do at home on the days that I didn't feel like getting around and going to the gym. I've used work out dvds like P90X before for a VERY short while because it was a little too intense for me. I wasn't looking to kill myself every time I wanted to workout. I've never used a dance themed work out dvd though, but have always wanted to try it because, as others have said, you don't think about the fact that you're actually working out and getting exercise because you're DANCING! Although, I still will be going to my gym to work out, I will definitely be incorporating this into my regime for the simple fact that it is fun, provides a workout at home and I sweat WAY more in 38 minutes of \\"Cardio Ballroom\\" than I do in 38 minutes on the treadmill or elliptical! So, I would suggest buying it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"She's pretty in the video but the moves are not do-able!","review":"Julianne looks good in the video but it's really hard to follow her moves because she's facing you and you are facing her so it's hard to follow. I did not break a sweat, although I feel motivated to lose weight just seeing her so I'm giving it a 2 stars. Overall, I viewed this video a couple of times only and never bothered after that, felt like it's a waste of time. I'd rather watch a youtube video like zumba, def a workout!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dance Teacher?","review":"The overall cardio on this dvd is good for the average person. The dancing is fun and keeps me going and interested. The problem is that most of the time you have to watch and rewatch Julianne do the dance steps because she doesn't give clear directions. Growing up with a dance background I was expecting 8 count instructions. You are lucky if you get left and right instructions!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Grr","review":"So before I bought this I was told \\"anyone\\" can do this workout. And let me tell you, they can't. I'm a little chubby, therefore just going into all of these difficult dance moves right off the bat is ridiculous for me. I'd suggest this to people who already have a knowledge of dance and can move at a super fast pace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible camera angles!","review":"This is supposed to be an exercise video. If you know nothing about the dance moves, you buy this to learn and to exercise. The camera angles on this DVD are changed every 2-5 seconds, and 75% of the time they are shooting Julianne's face. How can you learn the moves if you're looking at her face? They shot this like it was a music video, not an exercise video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"If you are just starting out and wanting to learn a few steps and get a great, fun workout, this dvd is NOT the one for you. She goes so fast and doesn't do well in giving you instructions. There is a one on one part of the dvd where she goes over a few \\"basic\\" steps. The shots are in and out so, when you're trying to follow her, you get lost b/c they cut into her face or her flipping her hair that you lose your steps. I have taken dance lessons before so, some of the steps I knew but even then, I found it to be very hard to follow and not much of a work out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leaves You Tired, Frustrated and Wanting to Try Harder!","review":"I am not a dancer, and I've been out of the work-out game for a while. I got this DVD because I love watching dance, and thought it might be a more motivational way to get me moving again. The steps are not hard to follow so much as they are FAST. I wish her back was facing the front, so I could watch the correct feet and follow them better. I probably look ridiculous doing this workout, but who cares! It's in the comfort of my own home and it leaves me sore and tired. I can pause it when I need to, in order to get the steps down, or do them the best I can, and it's much more fun than running!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Julianne Cardio Ballroom","review":"Not good for beginners, the steps are too fast and Julianne is facing you so you're getting a mirror image which is hard to learn. The video keeps focusing on her face and not enough on the legs and steps. If you know the basic moves already it should be a fun workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little boring","review":"Great for exercise, but a little boring. I would buy this if you are young and able and can really get these challenging routines. If you are older, it lacks fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very fun","review":"Of all the dance work outs I've done, this is probably the most boring. Better off going w Taebo or Zumba."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure yet","review":"I have only tried it once. I love Julianne since Dancing. Kind of hard to follow, but I'm going to keep working on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very hard to follow","review":"It is very hard to follow. Very frustrating. If you have a dance background it might help understand it better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty fun workout","review":"It's a pretty dancy and fun cardio workout. Just have to practise a few more time to get the steps right. I agree on the camera shots not v gd can't c her legs well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Workout Video","review":"This video is a good, fun workout! It has some pretty tricky moves that I didn't get until the second time I did the video. But, it was fun! You wouldn't want this to be your ONLY workout video, because there's only one routine and you could get board. But, it's a fun way to add some variety to your current workout routine. You'll get tired as it's a good work-out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed...","review":"I don't have much dancing experience at all, but thought i'd try this as it said that you would be able to easily catch onto the moves, etc... The 12 minute training session is not really that helpful and she goes way too fast. It's difficult to follow and i found that a lot of the video did not focus on her whole body, it would focus on her upper body, while you were supposed to be doing complicated movements with your legs, so i'd get lost! I did Zumba and really enjoyed it, a good workout and very clear instructions, much better than this!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor camera angle/editing","review":"I like Julianne's teaching style and would have given this a much better review except for two things which make it hard for me to use this video, camera angle and closeups. First, if a teacher is going to use mirror image teaching, the camera needs to stay in front of her. I get confused when I'm following in mirror style, then the camera switches to a side angle where she is clearly stepping right but saying left. I am not very co-ordinated and this really throws me. Second, I do not need close in shots of her chest and smiling face while I'm trying to follow her foot work. This video frequently moves in tight and b/c she goes really fast, with fast footwork, I'd like to see her feet. I paid less than $5 and got free shipping with amazon prime, so I'll keep the video and struggle until I get it, but I would be returning it if I'd paid more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Julianne is a great dancer, terrible fitness instructor","review":"She looks pretty and has a hot bod, but she should not have tried to sell herself as a fitness instructor. This video is a joke, don't waste your time!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Julianne's cute but not a physical trainer","review":"Julianne is an awesome ballroom dancer, she danced in world ballroom and latin dance competitions as a junior and teen. She even won Dancing With the Stars, twice. Trying to combine her dancing knowledge into a workout routine was a great idea and so I bought the DVD - but - there was no way I could follow Julianne. She would show what to me was a complicated dance step once and then expect you to get it right immediately as she moved on adding more steps. Nada. The DVD is collecting dust on my shelf and until I find someone better, I'm back to my favorites Tamilee Webb and Jillian Michaels."},{"rating":"1","title":"difficult and all over the place","review":"Even with the private dance lesson segment this DVD is really hard to follow. Julianne Hough doesn't give enough practice time or instruction with the moves and jumps into the dances too fast. Unless you have a background in ballroom dancing, I'd pass up this DVD. It's more trouble than it's worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Your run of the mill dance video","review":"I certainly did not think there was anything special about this DVD. If you have a dance workout video somewhere in your house then you pretty much have this one. I think I probably bought this because Julianne has such an amazing body on the cover. Good marketing but not a great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ain't Got No Rhythm","review":"Oh my goodness, I had a terrible time trying to follow this tape. I am not a good dancer, though, so that is probably why. If you have had dance experience, this may be the one for you, but I sincerely struggled. Julianne is a wonderful teacher, but I am going back to my aerobics tapes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Fast","review":"I agree with the reviewers who say that the dances are too fast for beginners. Even when she says she is doing the steps slowly they are still pretty fast to learn. And, I also agree with the reviewers who say the camera spends too much time on her upper body versus her legs and feet. Why not pull back and show all so you can see both the leg and arm movements. That would make it easier to follow. This video may be good for young people and people with dance background but not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh","review":"I've used this once and that was enough. Unless you are a dancer, this will be frustrating and embarrassing. I have no rhythm and this DVD only proved it. You also need a ton of space to do these moves. I am an athletic, petite 26 year old, but this was ridiculously hard for me. Waste of 10 bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I have the complete Zumba dvd and love it so I thought this dvd would be fun too. Wrong, the dancing isn't even dancing to me. Julianne is annoying to watch. I didn't break a sweat. When I do Zumba I am wiped out and the dancers in zumba you can tell are there to work out and love to dance. Julianne's instructions were not good either. I will stick to Zumba. I've lost 30 lbs so far and do zumba 4 days a week. The music and dance moves are way better in zumba. I thought Julianne's dvd was a joke. But maybe it would be better for beginners. I was surprised this many people rated it high because I bought this based on that. At least it was cheap."},{"rating":"2","title":"exelent","review":"It is wonderful and l have fun when l am working out l have told my friend and she is going to see amazong too"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, fun workout!","review":"I just purchased this DVD yesterday, and I couldn't wait to try it! I popped it in as soon as I got home, and let me tell you, it was a great workout! I have been slacking on exercising for YEARS now, and one of my resolutions for 2010 was to get in shape! I absolutely LOVE to dance, and I love watching Dancing with the Stars. Now, some of the steps are a little difficult to pick up on at first, but she repeats them a good bit till you get the hang of it. She is so cute and motivating. I actually had to stop to take a breather in the middle of the paso, but I made it through! I can't wait to keep doing it, so I can get more comfortable with the choreography. Oh, the JIVE was sooo much FUN!! I actually found myself smiling and chuckling while I was sweating like a pig. Haha! What exercise DVD makes you do that?! I definitely recommend this DVD for those that love to dance. Have fun! :o)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, unique novel","review":"A lot of reviewers have said they dont understand where Adrianna got her skills from... well it says that early on she was a math wiz and learned calculus before she dropped out of school at a young age. I thought it was kinda obvious that she must have taught herself (because she is so smart, good at math and logical thinking).This book was interesting because the first part of the book was so different from the last half, as far as tone and action. I found the plot very unique because you get to see both the good and bad sides to living in a Moslem world. I kind of wanted Adrianna and her father to make up somehow, but I guess thats just the optimist in me. Excellent book, I could hardly put it down and finished it in about two days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"This is an absolutly wonderful book.

Since I was on my summer break, and I had nothing better to do with my time, I read through all of them. This was the last one I got around to reading. While there had been some I'd enjoyed more than others, I thought that in general, by this time, I knew the formula for all romance novels, and that if you'd read one, you'd read them all. But while this did stick to the general formula, it added a chemistry to the relationship of the characters that none of the other books had had. More than in any of the other romance novels, I could tell the two characters in this book were really meant for one another and hadn't just ended up together by chance. I just couldn't help but be swept away by the way the two of them understood one another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I loved this book. This was the first Nora Roberts book that I ever read. I was not disappointed. The only bad thing that I thought about it was that it was slow getting started. The way she writes it is in the past first, then the present, but you need that knowledge to know why Adrienne is doing what she is doing. Lot's of drama and action and romance. I thought that Phillip was the perfect match for her because he also was a thief himself. I also loved the parts where they went back to Adrienne's country. Be ready to cry at some parts though. It has a sad beginning. I loved it and would recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Revenge","review":"I am a great Nora Roberts fan. I read her books all the time.Just finished reading Sweet Revenge. I don't know how I mised this book because it was written 1989-90.It is so good. Written with a middle eastern background that is so current today. It is deep and involved but with the redeeming value of love and loyalty, as always in Nora Roberts books.She has a way of making families out of non-related peoples when there is no blood-to-blood relationship. Love her intricate characters and plot turns.This is fabulous and holds your attention from beginning to end.Great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fast paced story, wonderful main character","review":"one of the best nora roberts books i've read. The story has intruigue, is exotic, and the main character fueled by revenge...it all adds up to a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring...","review":"This book started out fast and then died. I kept wanting to skip to the end to see how it turned out, but eventually I gave up and it's been sitting on my bookshelf ever since. It was more of a mystery novel than a romance. I read at least half the book and the romance still didn't happen. Did the heroine ever actually meet the detective? Was that the romance part of the book? It kept dragging and dragging and dragging. I kept saying to myself, \\"When are they going to meet each other?\\" The half of the book I did read only had about 2 scenes with the detective. The rest of it was yada, yada, yada about the mother and her problems with life. It was nothing about the heroine. Only a diehard Nora fan is going to give this book a 4 or 5 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical, Eurocentric Stereotypes About Muslims","review":"I couldn't read past the second chapter. Roberts is just perpetuating the same old stereotypes about Muslims. It really steamed me that she used a verse of the Quran out of context for the title page of \\"The Bitter\\". \\"Your wives are your fields, so go to your fields as you like\\" isn't meant as a justification of sexual abuse and has never been interpreted as so by real scholars of the Quran. I'm not going to finish this book, because I'd rather not be reminded of how much I am viewed as some sort of exotic, oppressed \\"other\\" type of woman, thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have never been disappointed by a Nora Roberts book before.","review":"I bought this with high hopes as I love Nora Roberts.As soon as I hit the Middle East part of \\"Jaquir\\" my heart plummeted. Every cliché was dragged into this, and every misreading of a wonderful part of the world. While it is obvious that she has researched Saudi Arabia I was so disappointed that it was just another \\"Choose a baddie from the Middle East\\" option - and even included a 'good hearted but poor mother of the hero\\" with a cockney accent.I just could not get past the clichés.I think it is best to stay with what you know, and not make up theoretical ideas about a culture important to the book, but so synthetic that it raised every hackle."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST","review":"THIS BOOK WAS ONE OF THE WORST I HAVE EVER READ! THERE'S RAPE, ATTEMPTED RAPE OF A YOUNG GIRL, DRUGS, AND DEPRESSION. BESIDES THAT IT'S BORING AT TIMES, AND NEVER EXPLAINS HOW ADRIENNE LEARNED HOW TO STEAL. ALSO, NORA ROBERTS WOULD REPEAT INFORMATION OVER AND OVER AGAIN AS THOUGH SHE WERE JUST TRYING TO TAKE UP SPACE. THE BOOK LEFT ME DEPRESSED AND VERY DISAPPOINTED. I'M GLAD I DIDN'T BUY IT, BUT I WISH I HADN'T READ IT. I HAVE READ OTHER BOOKS BY NORA ROBERTS, AND HAVE LIKED ALL OF THEM UP TILL NOW. IF YOU WANT A GREAT BOOK OF HERS TRY \\"JEWELS OF THE SUN.\\" I CAN'T WAIT TO READ THE NEXT BOOK OF THAT SET."},{"rating":"1","title":"She didn't live up to the hype!","review":"I bought this book on a whim at the grocery store because a good friend of mine loves her books. What a waste of $8.00! Between the blurb on the back of the book, the blurb inside the front cover, and the first two chapters, I figured out how the story ended and completely lost interest in finishing it. I realize this book was released 18 years ago, but I have no interest in seeing if her writing has improved over time. She just didn't live up to the hype!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Stand the novel","review":"I couldn't even finish the novel. The setting was boring and difficult to relate with.

ROBERTS SHOWS WHAT IT IS REALLY LIKE LIVING INSIDE A HAREM. IF YOU LIKE BOOKS WITH HAREMS IN THEM THEN YOU WOULD LIKE THIS ONE. SHE DID EXCELLENT FIELD WORK ON IT. I FINISHED READING IT ONLY BECAUSE ROBERTS WROTE IT. THE AMERICAN PARTS I ENJOYED THOROUGHLY"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed","review":"Enjoyed this e-book, but then again I am a big Nora Roberts fan.

Needs better editing and/or proof-reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attention: this rating is based on a Nora Roberts scale!","review":"I have to admit that I go back to Nora from time to time when I am looking for purely mindless reading. I found Sweet Revenge on a bookshelf (probably an aquisition from the college days) and devoured it in two nights. The plot was a little outrageous and there wasn't much that could explain how the protagonist got her training to be a jewel thief extraordinaire, but it was INDEED entertaining. I liked all of the characters as a whole and found it to be a relaxing way to kill a few hours. By the way, I have noticed that I prefer the old Nora, such as Sweet Revenge and Montana Sky, to her newer stuff. Who knows..."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 1/2 stars","review":"The first part of this book is the set up and background story of Adrianne and Philip. You learn about their childhoods and I felt it was really interesting and well-written. I kept thinking wow, I'm really going to feel for this couple because I feel like I \\"know\\" them. Well, when it finally got to the parts where the hero/heroine interact I wasn't feeling much at all. The chemistry wasn't there for me and I just thought it was kind of boring. I've read 5 Nora Roberts books so far and this is the one I like the least. I will keep on reading them though because I know what she is capable of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet revenge","review":"I liked the book and the characters. It is an easy and interesting read.

It was a \\"good read\\", and I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"My children had an IKEA tent for 3.5 years. After the success of that, I was really disappointed with this one. It has no base and no side-to-side support. So as soon as the children climb in, the tent tips over and collapses. My daughter (5) loves the picture on the side, but that's the only good thing about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"In the garbage in less than a week","review":"I usually don't have time to review products I've purchased, but this one was so bad I forced myself to make the 5 minutes to write this review. This tent is so flimsy, even my 2-year old couldn't crawl into it without knocking it over. The frame quickly lost its shape, and I ended up throwing it in the trash about a week after my daughter received it as a Christmas present. Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hideaway Blues","review":"My kids ages one and two got this for christmas. It was trashed the first day. The spring form construction would not stand up on it's own for very long. Just as soon as it was knocked over or the sides where touched it would fall over. There wasn't a bottom on it so it blew over easy. I would not waste your money or time it takes to fight with this hide out. The size was perfect, the idea was good, the colors where bright, but it just wouldn't stay up."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY FLIMSY","review":"My sister bought this for my 17-month-old daughter and she absolutely loves it. The material is very durable. However, it is SO FLIMSY that she just can't play in it. I'm going to pick up some plastic dowels and slide them up the seams and see if that helps. If not, it's going in the trash. The one I have is supposed to be easy to fold up and put away...forget it. IF you can even figure out how to fold it up for storage, the wire that lines the seams stays bent once you unfold it again and it doesn't stand up anyway.The price is good but you don't get what you pay for. Check reviews before spending money on an item like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy, but that shouldn't be a surprise","review":"It's flimsy. It doesn't have any bottom support structure so it tends to flop over. My 2 year old daughter pretty much refuses to use it.

The only thing I think that might use some work is the drumming- it's very repetitive and could be better with some new beats. But over all it's most diffently worth all the dough (even in the Canadian dollar!!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kravac creates another winner!","review":"This CD is definitely worth buying! Producer Steve Kravac has put the same creativity from his MxPx producing jobs into this project. While having a blast with the heavy punk sound, the listener can reflect on the group's focus on God and the Spiritual. The one problem with this album is that their sound isn't original enough. They sound too much like MxPx, but even that isn't all that bad! Definitely worth a listen, especially if you love punk music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointing","review":"\\"rusty\\" was one of the greates albums i've ever heard, and I was really looking forward to Burn out. but when I put it on, I was really dissapointed. All the songs sound the same, with riffs everyone have heard a thousand times before. the vocals are really cheesy, coming from a 16 year old. He sounds like a girl. everybody else seems to like this, but when you think about it, it's not very original. this band has too much of Strung Out in it. the only thing I found good about this album is the guitar solos by Jackson. They amaze me. too bad he quit the band. now I don't believe slick shoes's new album can be any better. bye it if you want, what do I care..."},{"rating":"2","title":"It never gets bunt out","review":"I like this cd. It's one of those staple albums that everyone has to have. The songs are complex with dual guitars that have lead flowing continually through the songs.

Although he has added OKS, Ice Ice Baby, and Detenator again, the songs that are original and new are some of his most mature work to date. I found that the three rap/rock songs on the album were not that great but songs like Huslin, Rollin in my, and Ninja Rap 2 were tight, as were most of the other tracks on the album. My only complaint was the packaging looked like something that was done by some high school kid on Photoshop, but the music speaks for itself. Unfortunatley for Ice, I don't see it getting picked up and distributed well, as I visited 5 shops before i finally was able to find it. Hopefully his various TV appearences will help get this album the exposure it deserves, as it is awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"ICE at his best","review":"This CD is some of ICE's best work to date.

I had to read it in small doses as it brought back the terror and anguish I experienced working in the war zone during the same period. For anyone who did, it is impossible not to feel that Ben Linder died in our place, and that we must never forget his sacrifice lest we forget the still unresolved crimes against humanity committed in our name."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true American hero","review":"This book offers an intimate view into Ben's life and dreams while he worked in Nicaragua. It effectiveley portrays what it was like for Ben and his co-workers to work in rural development while under threat of attack from the US organized Contra forces. The book gives clear insite into the motivations that kept Ben and others from giving into that threat. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historical document of life of an idealist in Nicaragua","review":"A vivid description of a young American's idealistic determination to bring to a Nicaraguan village electricity created by a hydroelectric source in a flowing stream.

Tendentious, poorly written and dull, and playing fast and loose with the facts. The ultimate critique must be that the red and black mafia for which Ben Linder gave his life hasn't won an election since 1984 and is a totally discredited and corrupt political force. A really misleading and mediocre book about a controversial period in Latin American politics that polarized America."},{"rating":"1","title":"Linder Made Bad Choices.","review":"The book is, predictably, awash in Left Wing garbage. I would not waste my time with it if I were you. Linder simply made the choice to align himself with the wrong people, namely, Red Danny Ortega's Communist punks. Ortega was in bed with the USSR, and why anyone would support Ortega's regime is beyond comprehension. President Reagan came along just in the nick of time. Too bad Linder got in the way, but sometimes we make bad choices that are very costly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little-known, but wonderful film","review":"I can't believe this is finally available on DVD! I have been waiting a very long time for this.What initially drew me to this film was the fact that Big Country wrote and performed the soundtrack. But I am so glad I watched it, as it is an absolute gem. It is the tale of 2 friends in Scotland who decide to earn a little extra money by holding up tour buses and robbing the rich tourists of their cash and jewellery. Disguising themselves by wearing wolfman and clown masks, they lead the police on a merry chase through some truly stunning parts of Scotland. They even become tourist attractions themselves, with people clamouring to be on the buses that are most likely to be held up. Highly recommended if only for the breathtaking scenery and the wonderful soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well...","review":"This is, of course, typical BBB house.

The beats will move you in parts, but in the middle of the only good track (Pumpin') Bad Boy Bill ruins it by adding a sample announcing that he is a world class DJ, RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SONG! He didn't write that song, all he did was place the vinyl on the turntable. In Bangin' the Box 4 BBB demonstrates he can mix, but seeing him live is a dissapointment, he is lousy outsite the studio. Any DJ from Chicago should be ashamed Bad Boy Bill claims he is from thier town. If you want to hear good SOULFUL Chicago House without the DJ trying to be a superstar, look up Mark Farina, Glenn Underground or if you are lucky enough to find him, Paul Johnson!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"Alan Dean Foster does it again..with his third novelization of an Alien film. Alien 3 is an ok movie, but Foster's tie-in is much better due to the fact that it contains lots more dialogue from the original script(and some improvised obviously) that was cut from the final edit of the movie. I also like this book better than the movie because it features extra and alternate scenes that were in the original Alien 3 script, but deleted before the film was released. Such scenes mainly deal more with prisoner Golic and his obsession with the Alien, an alternare birth of the warrior Alien which I like better, and more character-developing dialogue among Dillon and the other prisoners.

I was pleasantly suprised. Normally their books are overpriced relative to other publishers on the same topic.Anywho, this book does justice to explain what one needs to understand about web services. It is targeted towards developers and architects but has some interesting concepts that are also applicable to project managers.

Unlike other books this one doesn't waste any chapters with theoretical content. Almost all the chapters are covered in depth with examples. I especially like the fact that the book does not waste time on explaining the Sun Web services pack repeatedly. This book keeps the focus on web services technologies by doing the coding in a notepad like environment-where you write all the code, make mistakes, stumble, and in the process, learn.

They also went to the extend that every recruiter purchased this book and asked questions in recuitment interviews based on this book! I think that was a novel, albeit cheap way of marketing a technical book.I bought this book about two weeks back and was trying to make sense out of it till now. This book does not live upto the standards that's expected of such famed authors. Maybe it's a bit too early to come out with an architecture book on java web services when even Sun Microsystems are in double mind about the success of Web Services as such. there are many silly mistakes in this book. Also some incomplete info. i dont recomment this book in its present edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I am involved in a project to determine the best practices for integrating web services into our applications. We purchased a handful of recommended books on the topic including this one. I have to say that I am disappointed in this book.First off there is little coverage of web services from an architecture point of view. There are some decent chapters that introduce the concepts of web services and SOA and then the authors jump directly into reference mode on the dozen or so technologies that they think you must master to develop web services.Maybe it is just a failure of the J2EE process, but this book does little to address the confusion and complexity involved with developing web services in Java. In fact this book just adds to the problem. Developers should not need to know all the details of SOAP, WSDL, UDDI, and all the JAX APIs in order to develop web services. For the most part, all this plumbing technology should be hidden from developers yet it is the focus of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complete coverage of web services","review":"This is one of the most complete books on web services published to date.

Third billed (as Brent's half-brother) is James Coburn's son Harrison. His film resume consists of only TWO 1985 efforts: this, and a decent West German war flick called MORENGA. The latter was whittled to two hours from a 3-part mini-series.SYNOPSIS--An L.A. private eye (Huff) takes a case in the Bahamas that leaves him recovering from a gunshot wound in a Bahamian hospital. While there he meets a lady (Boulting) from his home turf who asks for help in wresting her dead husband's assets from the control of a crooked business manager (Robert Chandler). She plays on the detective's affections in their mutual illegal scheme and sets him up for a double-cross.This movie is not now nor will it ever be available on DVD.

However, his bias came through loud and clear that he was sympathetic to the anti-war groups. He included people with anti-war experience more than any other group. While he did interview some military participants, very few who served in the war were included. There were about 5.5 million military and numerous civilians who served in Vietnam. There was virtually no mention of these people and very few interviews from Viet Cong, ARVN, NVA or civilians of either North or South Vietnam. Also omitted were stories from any supporting allies, i.e. South Korea, Thailand, etc.I also think the book failed to mention much detail of the post war activites: the re-education camps and refugees fleeing.

I use this primarily inside of an apartment and it's silent enough that it doesn't bother anyone else. One thing you should consider is that to adjust air pressure on this model, you have to open a valve on the moisture trap which, at very low PSI, creates a constant hissing sound which prevents the compressor from shutting off when not in use (as intended). It sprays just fine but it is markedly louder at lower pressure.I use this in conjunction with anIwata-Medea Eclipse HP CS Dual Action Airbrush Gun / Gravity Feedto build Gundam models and it's been great."},{"rating":"2","title":"great little machine","review":"Only concern is thick air hose that tends to knock things over when using.

Contrary to the the complaint of another reviewer that some of the models are too ordinary, ordinariness is the point. If there is anything to complain about the models it is that too many of them are young, slim, white women. No, the problem here is that the models are poorly posed in silly locations--this photographer seems to think that best thing to do with ordinary people is to pose them as Helmut Newton would. I know the work of Helmut Newton and Rankin is no Helmut Newton. This book is an insult to the models who posed for it--they deserve better. (By the way, when will photographers, designers, and publishers ever learn that printing an image over two pages with a cavernous gutter in the middle destroys the image--it's a waste of paper.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad models, bad photos","review":"After reading some of the other reviews of this book, I have to wonder if they were looking at the same book!

The book is fun to read, and your significant other will probaly be more up for owning a few hens after reading this book.If you intend to actually get some birds, you will have to gather some more information than what is provided in this book.

But Kilarski's book is true to it's title, \\"Keep Chickens!

When Toad finally gets to be the one excelling on stage, his success causes Frog to shrink and disappear, turning Toad's dream into a horrible nightmare.

It has passed, but it was unpleasant while it lasted. Also at one point one of them says \\"he is trying to kill me!\\" and that word hasn't been introduced in our house yet.

Herzog's academic career suffers from a lack of focus. He just cannot get his next publication project completed because of the many distractions in his life. And the distractions are many. Two failed marriages have left him with two children he idolizes at a distance.He is absorbed in writing letters to illuminaries and dignitaries, some living, some dead which he never posts. Moses Herzog is a pathetic picture of alienation and lonliness and this is an ongoing theme of the book from beginning to end. His notes are fragmented reflections in a stream of consciousness which serve to underscore the tragically confused person he is. His marital and extramarital vicissitudes demonstrate his lack of ability to commit to long-term goals.This novel is not an easy read but will rewarding to the patient reflective reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book of Introspection","review":"This book is not for the fainthearted.

Herzog never becomes a fully realized character and it's impossible to care about him or, ultimately, this novel. Herzog seems, to me, a vehicle for the author to spout; at times he is just a mouthpiece to show off how much the author has read. That makes the main character almost literally paper-thin. The end happens so abruptly that one would think that he missed something somewhere, or that 20 pages were cut out. But by that time, anyway, we've stopped caring. I maintain that, had this book not been written by Bellow, it would no longer still be in print. I would say that this is a minor work by a somewhat overrated author.

The force is so powerful that you have to make sure it is in your mouth fully and that you turn it off, as the directions indicated, before you take it out of your mouth. I didn't so I had water on the mirror and sink which proves that it has excellent force for removable of debri between the teeth and anywhere else in the mount such as braces or bridges.i am very pleased with this purchase.

I fully expect any device I buy to last longer than that, so I can't give it any more than two stars.

That one worked for 4 years without incident. I could have replaced the battery but chose to buy a new model. I cannot live without my Waterpic. My gums and teeth are healthy and it does an excellent job cleaning around crowns and an implant. The battery on this model holds a charge for about a week's worth of cleanings without having to recharge. My older model seemed to have a longer battery life but this is sufficient. I just plug it in overnight every weekend. The water reservoir holds just enough to do your mouth once. If you need more water it is easy to refill. The amount of water pressure is good, enough to clean but not so much that you hurt sensitive gum tissues.

It's really nasty.Trust me.I didn't want the full size waterpik because I read all the reviews about kids pulling on the hose and the whole thing crashing to the floor. My kids would do that..So I got the cheaper cordless model.... and it works great. It has plenty of power to blast sticky rice and bits of chicken right out of the pallet expander and braces. I can also hit the dog with a concentrated stream of water from 25 feet away (bonus).Nice tool for the price. I'm glad I didn't get the newer model at twice the price.

LASTED LESS THAN 1 WEEK!!","review":"I use the regular (full-size) Waterpik at home, but bought this one for travel. Wasn't nuts about its small capacity (had to refill it at least 3 or 4 times each time I used it) and the fact that it had only one pressure setting, but couldn't bring the full-sized one, so I got this one. Well, as some other reviewers stated, it had to be held pretty much upright for it to work, so that was awkward but do-able. LESS THAN ONE WEEK after I started using it (after having followed the charging instructions to a T), it stopped working!! I thought initially that maybe I hadn't let it charge enough (3-4 hrs) after the initial charge, so I let it charge overnight but it STILL held minimal (and not enough to use it) charge. I then charged it for a longer period overnight, and now it's pretty much DEAD!! Definitely not useable at all - WHAT A PIECE OF CR*P!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's OK, not great.","review":"Contrary to other reviewers, mine has lasted for about 2 years. Technically it's still working but I'm going to have to buy something different. It only really worked well for the first two months, and then became rather weak. No amount of charging brings back the power it initially had.I guess you get what you pay for. My gums need top notch cleaning to stay healthy and this device just isn't really doing it. Plus, the well is so small I have to refill at LEAST twice... more like 4 times to attempt to do a good job.

Should have done some research before buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy This Product","review":"Read the reviews on this product and note the common thread. For us, the lifespan for this unit was about 4 months. After that, it would no longer hold a charge. I cleaned the contacts and tried to re-initialize it with an additional 16 hour charge. It continued to die within seconds. Since I knew the unit was headed for the trash, I opened it up to see what was inside. It was full of mold. So an item that is designed to hold and dispense water isn't even sealed well enough to protect from ordinary use. The battery, of course, is soldered in and impossible to replace. In short, this is a poorly designed piece of junk. Do not buy this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Water Pik warranty","review":"I have bought several cordless water piks (WP360W) and the battery always gives out. The last one almost made two years. Since they have a two year warranty, they replaced it free. However, the second one only lasted 7 months and they would not replace it again. I found customer service to be less than friendly. Maybe they are tired of all the complaints. I would think the company would try to improve their model.

I thought that would offset the smaller tank size. What a mistake. I have to refill the tank 3-4 times to do my teeth and the unit is soaked completely by the time I am finished which can't be good for it long term. Also, for the price paid I expected more. I replaced this one immediately with a Conair Interplak Water Jet for $10 (vs. $35 for the Water Pik).

To be fair, after e mailing the Waterpik company, they agreed to send another Waterpik to me after 15 days (to date the item has not arrived). The water reservoir is too small for the unit, and requires two fills, at least, to properly cleanse the teeth and gums. The charger ran out after one or two uses, even the first few days, in spite of the fact that I charged it for 16 hours the first time, as advised in the instruction manual, and had to be recharged again over night. This item is made in China, home of (lately) massive product recalls all over the world. This item lacks product integrity, certainly won't improve China's current standing in the world of manufacturing, and, I think, the Waterpik company lacks integrity for selling this thing. Maybe their other products are good. This one isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't age well","review":"Have to agree with the various reviews citing the unit's poor battery performance after a few months of use. I've stepped up to a countertop WaterPik and like it much better.

I bought a battery-powered travel model but it just didn't have the oomph, and so have been actually checking a larger bag on the airline instead of using a carryon, specifically to lug the full sized Waterpik along so as not to miss a single night of dental hygiene.The outstanding feature is this model is that it is portable.

However, nowhere did i read online, BEFORE buying the Waterpik that the force of the water would slash my throat...yep! it did. I guess i was just so willing to try anything to remove the tonsil stone that i didn't do much research about the possible dangers of misuse! I still give it 5 stars because it effectively removed my tonsil stone and i was desperate at the time because i hadn't kissed my new boyfriend in 2 days because this nasty tonsil stone gave me bad breath!!

You can add my complaints of a faulty battery to the mix. I love the concept and the operation of the flosser, it's just a pity it is so badly constructed that quick breakdown is inevitable, not an exception. Mine worked for about a month before the battery started running out of its charge; and another month when it stopped recharging altogether. I'm surprised there wasn't a recall, but at $20 I guess no one thought it worth the effort. Still, I'm glad I saw these reviews.

What I now realize is light use (2/3 of a reservoir used twice a day by one person) runs the battery down in 3 days, after 3 months of use. Initially the charge would last about 5 or 6 days, but no more. I hate this thing -- the recharge period is so long (16 hours) that I can't use it every 6th or 8th time that my dentist recommends that I do so. In addition, it is so much longer compared to other chargers that I use for my cellphone, blackberry, rechargeable batteries for flashlights and shower and other portable radios, that I have actually seen my electric bill increase.

I have replaced it with a standard water pik that plugs into the wall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for what it is...Small and Portable!","review":"I bought this just prior to getting braces. I am in my 30's so I know what I need to do to keep my braces clean and was looking for something that wasn't bulky but would work well. After promptly breaking the high power tip because I didn't read directions I figured out how to use it properly with the low power.It fishes all the gunk out and helps my mouth feel cleaner as well as clean out the braces so that they continue to dig into my cheeks and tongue. I have now broken the low power tip and just ordered replacements (cheaper on Amazon even with shipping than at the waterpik store) and I miss using it already.Yes I have to refill it, but it's portable - isn't the point of being cordless/portable making it small enough to carry around?

I purchased this product because I'm a middle aged person with braces and found the full size water pik setup to be invaluable dealing with the situation. If this product didn't have the following shortcomings I'd rate it 5 stars because it is a tool I use every day. Design issue #1: The battery. The water pressure just isn't there anymore and this thing is only 3 months old. As it runs you can hear it slow down as it pumps the water #2 The charger inlet falls open easily and water gets in the charging area. BAD. #3. There is no good way to clean out the water holder and it goes stale.

I took it apart to find electronics fine but motor grinding when hand-rotated.

Almost nothing else, though, is good about this device. It holds so little water in the reservoir (about 30 seconds worth) that in order to clean each tooth the specified five seconds, you have to refill it FOUR times. What were the designers thinking? Do they really expect users to turn it off, open the lid, pour water inside, start it up, and continue four times?? I called customer service and the service person admitted, \\"Yes, you may have to fill it multiple times.\\" I could tell by her tone of voice that she had heard the complaint many times before.I have not had my unit long enough to say whether the battery lasts a long time--I know I won't have it long enough to find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"same battery issues as others","review":"this machine worked really well.... it was compact, and did the job.

It has the advantage of not using a flexible tube to connect the pump to the hand peice, which tends to collect mold, and is nearly impossible to clean.The water tank is small, but it is easily filled and refilled using a glass of lukewarm water, rather than directly from the tap, as it doesn't fit under my bathroom sink faucet.Battery charge has not been a problem, but I recommend recharging after every two or three uses, to insure long battery life. Operating the unit until the battery is fully discharged before recharging will cause early battery failure, and it is not replaceable. The size and battery power make it suitable for travel.Jet pressure is only adjustable by changing tips.

The water pressure is not adjustable and set so high it can actually hurt. The water volume is so great you need to refill 2-3 times to really get to all your teeth inside and out. Because of it's size and reservoir attached, you cannot tilt it correctly when water is below full for hard to reach places. Just not a User friendly device and definitely not one we want to keep.

A few weeks after I notice the battery is no longer charging effectively, the battery fails completely. I have to admit that Waterpik's Consumer Service has always responded promptly to my complaints by sending me a replacement unit at no charge. However, the replacement units last only a few months before they begin to die too and I have to begin the whole annoying process of asking for a replacement unit again.

Hopefully this will last more than 11 months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good waterpik but awkward.","review":"I liked the performance of this waterpik. However, the design is flawed. It is heavy and awkward to hold. The water tank doesn't hold much. And you'd think this would be designed for travel but the transformer won't work on voltages other than US."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rechargeable Dental Water Jet a bust!","review":"Very, very noisy, and adding water to it in the standard bathroom sink is very difficult. A kitchen sink would work better, but who takes care of their dentition in the kitchen? The battery doesn't last very long at all and you've got to recharge it every few days. It doesn't hold much water at all, and I only bought it because of the limited space on my bathroom vanity. For someone who is sold on using oral irrigation, it would make a good addition to your shave kit if you travel a lot. After about a month it just quit working altogether. I guess you shouldn't expect much for $21."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality","review":"Good quality product; does the job and perfect for travel, though a bit bulky to hold.

First of all, it is so powerful that you practically have to use it in the shower to keep from drenching your entire bathroom. Water GUSHES out of your mouth! One of the attachments is supposed to be more \\"gentle.\\" Not so! My poor gums hate me. Whatever you do, don't use this product to clean out your tonsils (those who still have tonsils may know what I mean): it kind of works, but they bleed so badly it's not worth it.My mother has an older model WaterPik that is gentle and wonderful, so I know a good product is out there. Buy a different product than this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"good product that doesn't last","review":"I bought this product at walmart for less than $30.

The first lasted 6 months, so we bought another one. The second lasted about the same, and this time I had it replaced by warranty (they are pretty good about that, at least). The third one lasted about 7 months, again I returned it under warranty and they sent me another. But I've finally had it as this one has lasted maybe 5 months. Each time, the battery either refuses to continue to charge and you get a weak jet or the whole think just dies (sometimes I can get it started again by banging the base on the counter). The idea of oral irrigation is great, I have much better dental appts since using it (my gum lines have lowered) and its great for a kid who doesn't like to floss - my son uses it twice a day. But I will not buy a waterpik again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly designed and very disappointed in Waterpik","review":"I wish I had read these reviews prior to purchasing. As others have mentioned, in order to adequately clean your mouth, the reservoir must be filled up repeatedly (at least 4 times), the angle the unit has to be held is awkward and not well thought out, the unit has very little power (I've not even used the \\"gentle\\" tip) even when fully charged. I can see where this would be helpful when traveling, for every day home use, it falls short. Thankfully, the unit was inexpensive, but it will be going into my closet until the next time I travel and I'll go back to the reliable (and powerful) countertop model."},{"rating":"2","title":"POWERFUL, PORTABLE & WORKS WELL","review":"I own this item and it works well. It has as much power as full size irrigators and it's really easy to clean. My only complaint is that the water tank is too small.

Additionally, the charging port is protected by a rubber stopper to keep water out, which does not work all that well. I upgraded to the Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet which is an outstanding product. If you have the vanity space in your bathroom, and an electrical outlet nearby, then I highly recommend the slightly more expensive model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for Travel","review":"This is excellent for travel and takes the fuss and worry out of healthy teeth and gums while on the road."},{"rating":"1","title":"waterpik","review":"It works BUT great Idea for handheld but does not hold enough water.

In an attempt to upgrade, i chose this new model. The results were extremely dissapointing. First, the dispenser nozzle keeps popping of when trying to irrigate. Second, the tank is too small doing entire mouth on one fillup. Third, filling is tricky with lots of spillage when trying to fill. This results in waste if you are using more than water for irrigation. All in all very dissapointing. I would have returned, but had waited longer than 30 days for first use. I would NOT reccomend this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dies too quickly","review":"I am about to throw out the third WP-360 that I have purchased. The first lasted a few months and I loved it. It cleaned between my teeth and took little space on the countertop. But then it died. So I gave in after a few months without and bought a second Waterpik cordless. It died after a much shorter period, a few weeks I believe. I gave up on irrigating between my teeth.But I really needed a dental irrigator; dental floss does not do the trick for me. I had gone months and months without and I could see how my teeth and gums were suffering. So I gave in, and bought another one. I thought this time would be different...........And this third one died much quicker. I found it hard to believe. I don't know who I am more frustrated with....myself for buying another one or WATERPIK for selling an inferior product. I just assumed that they would improve their product.

Returned it to the store a week later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even think about it!","review":"This has to be the most poorly designed consumer device ever. You can't fill it at a sink with normal faucets because it is too tall. The tank is too small for a thorough job with only one fill. The pik rotates out of alignment on its own with only gentle pressure. The pik release is too close to the on/off buttons and you end up releasing the pik by accident and water is everywhere. It is cumbersome and needs to be used two handed, one to hold it and the other to steer the pik. The old plug-in styles work much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery and power troubles, low water capacity","review":"While this is better than using no waterpick at all, and cordless is nice, my experience with this over 6 months has been:CONS- Battery wears down quick.- Over time battery holds less and less of charge. After 6 months I'm lucky to get through 1 or 2 full sessions without it getting \\"weak\\".- Water resevoir only holds enough to do one side of your mouth. Not hard to re-fill, but a little annoying to have to keep stopping and refilling it for a thorough cleaning.PROS- Better than just flossing, noticably cleaner / better feeling mouth. Better breath.- Much more enjoyable than flossing.- Cheap and portable.- Once you upgrade to a real waterpick system this will make a great squirtgun, you'll win every time in short battles ;-)OVERALLWish I'd spent the extra $16 for a full powered, higher-end system, and will be ditching this for one soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't last!","review":"This item does not even deserve the one star I had to give it!

Panasonic must still be laughing. Apparently, this opinion is shared by most of the other reviewers. Yes, the reservoir is ridiculously small. The unit must be held upright to operate. The battery barely holds a charge sufficient for two consecutive uses and is declining in power. The power input is covered by rubber flap, which hardly secures it against the torrent of water that courses down your arm when in use. And given the size of the unit you might as well carry a regular Water Pik in a plastic bag when you travel.Unfortunately, as usual, the joke is on the consumer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Water Pik","review":"I made the mistake of buying this WaterPik flosser twice.

I just can't understand why WaterPik would offer such a sorry excuse for a product. Forgive me for rating it so high but they insisted on at least one star. They do clean just fine but do need a larger reservoir. They are in fact a lot cleaner to have around than their big corded brothers, and they travel as well as one would expect.

On the unit I purchased, the nozzle-tip will not stay in the unit. This is likely because there is only one small catch to hold the nozzle-tip. The 'classic' water-pik hand-unit has four catches. Without the additional holders the nozzle may pop-off into the mouth and create a choking hazard.

Aside from the battery issue, its much easier to use the plugged in one as the handle is less bulky, and the mechnism to turn the nozzle to keep it aligned with your gums is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"i use to have this as my secondary oral irrigator ( i wear braces) but thank goodness for the panasonic , i dont have to suffer using waterpik anymore! this product sucks and a waste of money. the battery doesnt charge for some reason and the unit stops right in the middle of using it! try the panasonic brand coz its a much better alternative for this junk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible design, lousy product","review":"I bought this Waterpik instead of the \\"old fashioned\\" kind because I thought it would be better and save some space in the bathroom. I took it back to the store after about 1 week. The tips pop off unexpectedly and water leaks from the base of the tip, as well as from the water chamber. The water chamber doesn't hold enough water, so you have to refill it 2 or 3 times in order to get a thorough cleaning. It is difficult to control the angle of the tips, because they swivel on the base while in your mouth. All together, this is a poorly designed product. I exchanged it for the \\"old fashioned\\" waterpik which is WAY superior."},{"rating":"1","title":"It has too little power","review":"It has less speed of water and dosn't do the job. It also only hold small amount of water. You need to refill several times to finish whole mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor product","review":"I had an electric (plug-in) that died after a couple of years of use. I tried this unit and it not only operated at a fraction of the strength of the plug-in unit, the battery did not hold up for very long. The lower power means the product does not clean plaque or get between the teeth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Water everywhere except where you need it...","review":"This was my first waterpik. The first one I picked up was clearly used. I ended up taking that back to the store and got a new one...but I also wondered...why was this brought back? Hmmm?For the second go-round, the irrigator's tip kept on moving during usage and never stayed still, causing water to splash everywhere..at one point, my entire shirt got soaked and I felt like I had taken a bath.I tried using it for a few days, and had the same difficulties.The reservoir constantly requires refilling.I gave up and ended up going back and getting a Waterpik Ultra. I had better luck with the stationary, home model.Not sure if there's a good portable out there as of this writing...*shrug*"},{"rating":"1","title":"I have a dead one of these","review":"I never used mine in the shower or mistreated it, but it died anyway, after just a few weeks of use, and now sits in a cupboard because it looks brand new and I couldn't decide what to do with it. For a portable unit, it is also far too big, and as someone with relatively small hands, I found it very awkward to hold onto. By contrast, the battery-operated PanasonicPanasonic EW1270AC Portable Oral Irrigatoris everything this is not--compact, easy to hold, and functional. I have 2 of those that have been working for years. This Waterpik is clunky, poorly designed, badly engineered, too big, and, as others have noted, does not work. We need the option to provide no stars, or minus stars, for products with completely negative characteristics. If someone has the address of a Waterpik office I can send this disaster to, I'd be grateful. Shame on them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Unit doesn't hold a charge for long, and the longer you own it the more often it has to be recharged.

But a year after I bought it, I accidently left it at a hotel. So I bought another one. Within 3 months it stopped holding a charge. I was very frustrated with the lack of quality and tossed it away. After reading the poor reviews, which out number the good on Amazon, I went with a different brand. But it too stopped working quickly. Less than 30 days to be more specific. So I'm back to square one, 2yrs and 3 picks later. I did read a couple of reviews on the Waterpik that say the poor cord design can be fixed with something from Radio Shack. And given the low price, it is tempting to purchase this. But right now I can not convince myself that's the best reason. Maybe Waterpick will fix their problem and I can return as a customer."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it","review":"I have had my Waterpik for at least 4 years.

I would definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died after 3 weeks - poorly designed, poor quality.","review":"I liked this product while it lasted, and I could really feel the difference in the health of my gums.It's bulky and unwieldy, but I got used to it. Didn't hold enough water to do my whole mouth, so had to refill several times - annoying.But then it just stopped pumping. The battery is still good, it just makes this slow grinding churning sound and no water comes out.Unfortunately didn't keep my receipt.I plan on getting the counter model instead, keeping my receipt, and filling out the warranty card."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design","review":"When I opened the box the first thing I saw was a note that essentially said \\"call us before you return this item to the retailer.\\" I thought to myself, this can't be good. Correct. Dittos to all who said the reservoir is too small, the requirement that you have to keep it vertical is quite awkward, and it's just plain messy.I guess they've made a train load of them and have to push them out the door.Update: After 4 months it has totally died. The motor can't turn but a few seconds, even after a full charge. The design allows water to get into the interior, which likely corroded the motor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on Me","review":"I'm a dental assistant. The two I purchased had short battery lives.
