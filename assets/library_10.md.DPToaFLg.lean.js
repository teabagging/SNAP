The exercises use files included on the accompanying CD-ROM as starting points, and lead you through modifications and enhancements. There are some AVI files on the CD showing some of the techniques in video.A big plus, if you are on the fence about using FrontPage 2000, is that there is a 45-day demo of this program on the CD. During the demo period you may use the unrestricted program to determine whether you want to buy your own version.As has been stated, you will probably have to buy a more advanced book if you will be doing heavy programming, but for beginners, this is the one to get."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Program, Vice Versa on the book","review":"This book can only be reccommended to people that have never used a computer before.

The touch pad controls are a little sensitive, but easy to use. The ear buds have good sound, but are always falling out.

The touchpad interface is easy to master and easy to use. The software included makes ripping CD's and transferring music and files from your computer a breeze. The battery life is a little shorter than the 12 hours advertised but still plenty long. I have occasionally had problems with the player freezing when I turn it on but this only happens occasionally and is easy to remedy by removing the battery. Accessories are nearly impossible to come by in brick and mortar retail shops but easy to find on-line and are much cheaper than i-pod accessories. In all, the Zen Micro is a great alternative to i-Pod."},{"rating":"2","title":"not bad!","review":"This player isn't bad at all...the only downfall is 1. the pad takes a little usage to get used to and 2. it takes prettyy long to fully charge the battery. other than that, sound quality is GREAT and it looks COOL."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall very happy with my purchase","review":"This has been a very good mp3 player for me.

It's a darn good unit if you put in a little time to get it right.Don't buy it from Crutchfield however.

I'd ordered one from buy.com, but when it still hadn't shipped a month later, I cancelled and found it on amazon. It arrived at my house 2 days later! The only problem I have with it, and it's not even a problem with the product, is that the ear buds were uncomfortable in my ears.

Besides the buttons not working, it also doesnt hold a charge for very long. It lasts for about 4 hours until it dies. If you want a mp3 player that lasts long and is durable then you should probably keep looking because this definitly doesnt. But it was good while it lasted =/"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointment","review":"I bought this the other day and was excited that a mp3 player with such large storage had a fm radio tuner which is great because I travel a lot so I get more music out of my mp3 player. When I got home and installed the 'Creative MediaSource' I spent 5 hours trying to get my music from iTunes into it. Only 350 went in out of 1,348, then it started to delete songs off of my computer. Just all by it's self it errored out at least 200 and deleted 100 without any sign. The 'songs' that were now in the 'creative' mediaSoure were mostly old podcasts and music tripled. I really love the zen, it looks great, love the blue with the black and the fading when it idles the headphones are awesome, but I'm going to have to turn to the iPod. Something that is in print 'Compatible with iTunes'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk, could've been great","review":"The Zen micro could've been the ultimate alternative to the IPOD. It has everything-and more-that you could want in an mp3 player. Unfortunatley, it's works for only about 2 months before the headphone jack goes out. I bought on for my self and a friend. His wife then bought one. Same problem: Headphone jack fails. It's a piece of garbage. This is my second review on this item, and I'm writing because there have been other people since the first review who have been victimized by this company. Creative acknowledge the problem is a design flaw. check the bullentin boards: There are sites dedicated to showing you how to repair the headphone jack. However, you will need to know elemenatary soldering and you will have to void the warranty. It's garbage, save you self time, money and trouble. Again, it's garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor tecnical support","review":"I purchased this product to take with me on a deployment to Afghanistan. It has never really worked for me. At first I simply had problems loading music onto it. I spent the better part of a day on customer support and they were unable to fix the problem. I ran out of time before I deployed and now my customer service period is over. For a while I was able to listen to the few songs I had gotten loaded but now my operating system keeps crashing.

The story is imaginitave and is reminiscent of stories told in the oral tradition.

I couldn't even get to the third page. With sentences like \\"Des' mother, had Joyce, accompanied her as a favor to her son.\\" It's amazing this book got published. Where were the editors/proofreaders?It's sad the state our young Black readers are in that this book had a good rating on this site. I can't even comprehend what the author is trying to convey half the time. I'm glad I didn't buy this and checked it out from the library; I would have been highly upset. The fact that the headers for the pages aren't aligned properly and that they use capital letters in the middle of the sentences should have given me a hint on what's to come. Please don't buy this book. I have nothing against urban contemporary Black fiction (I actually am a fan), but I'm warning you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Please....","review":"I'm not going to sugar coat this review. The book made no sense whatsoever. First of all, the chances of a 15 year old girl captivating the mind of a seasoned hustler is not believeable. Then he meets her mother to ask her for permission to date her in full hustle gear, with a hustle mobile parked on the curb... I think not. Granted, the book is fictionally characterized, but the writer seems to try to base the theme on the realities of \\"the game.\\" Not even close. It was the fairy tale version of young girls with rich dreams. I think this was a excuse to expose the use of street slang, and throw in a few clothing lable names for added effect. If you want to read about life in this perspective, then read \\"The Coldest Winter Ever\\" by Sister Souljah. She puts it down so real. And you walk away with a truer sense of reality when it's all said and done. Sorry Nikki... it's just not poppin. Peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't quit your day job!","review":"This book was terrible. How can Nikki Turner even call herself a writer with a straight face?

The title as well as the cover was an eye catcher, but the title doesn't support the book. She was neverhis wife, unless you bring in the topic of common-law.

Not a real mother!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Hustler's wife she was.............","review":"This book was off the hook 4real.

Yarni was supposed to be a hustler's wife, but I felt that she kept getting played throughout the book, and the book was poorly edited...fo' real. I give Nikki her props for trying and pushing it out there, but there were some scenes that were not believable and maybe just too over the top and c'mon...I just don't see the moms black mailing all these big time officials just to get Yarn's man out of jail...dude was doing like life or sumthin...and that whole happy ending thing for a drug dealer, finally being let free and reuniting with his girl...c'mon...the moms would have been dead and so on...but once again, I just don't see the hype in this book..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Good","review":"Well, It was kindas stupid.

Just terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your time","review":"I picked this book up mainly to support an african-american author, while I do not regret supporting her I do regret buying the book I truely felt this was a waste of my time and hers.

I also felt the author started out writing a love story then changed her mind and tried to turn this into a mystery/horror story. I would not recommend buying this title."},{"rating":"1","title":"P I T I F U L!!!","review":"This \\"book\\" is a joke. The author makes numerous grammatical errors and it's obvious that punctuation is not on her to-do list. She uses quite a few cliches too which would be alright if she knew the whole cliche. The part about Des asking Yarni's mother for her hand in marriage, not getting it, and moving 15 year old Yarni in with him anyway is far fetched, to say the least. Ms. Turner needs to take a course in creative writing which hopefully touches on spelling, grammar, and punctuation as well. I found this book a pitiful, sophmoric attempt and very hard to get through just because I kept getting disgusted with Ms. Turner's silly mistakes and less than articulate style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I love to read....2 to 3 books a week.

This book was ok because it shows how some bad things can happen and it still kinda gave a good message, but this book is unreallistic. What mother would let some 21 year old man take her 15 year old daughter and move him in with her without trying to press charges? It was kind of a fairy tale.

It had a hand full of grammical errors and last but not least, the book was a little boring. but overall the book was ok."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good hustler","review":"This book was marginal, at best. I don't see how Yarni ever \\"hustled\\" anyone. A more accurate description would be to say she prostituted herself for material things.

I would not recommend it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where were the proof readers ??","review":"The grammar, english language usage and poor use ofspeaking in the correct tense made this book unreadablefor the most part.

At the ending of the book you are like ok so what happened to so and so etc. I would recommend borrowing the book rather than purchasing it for full price."},{"rating":"2","title":"good but unbelievable","review":"The story line was excellent, but a little unbeleivable.

I have seen this story played out in NYC. Yarni had to deal with so much it is a wonder she did not have a nervous breakdown. I also liked the way Ms.Turner incorporated religion into this gritty street novel. I keep saying this over and over. Our people turn to selling drugs and other street ways because we see no way out and EDUCATION is not glorified for our children as a way out.

The dialogues were hard to follow along with the constant grammatical errors. I'm not really sure what the point of the novel was. The main character, Yarni, did not grow or change throughout the book. Her life was ridiculously unrealistic, in my opinion). I'm guessing it was just another testimony of the lives of young materialistic women.

I love to see Black authors trying to get on their feet and get the recognition everyone wants, however, I think people need to be unique in their writing styles and stories. Although this book started off slow and childish, it begame an okay read I thought. To witness the struggles Yarni and her close friends and family went through and overcame was a joy. I loved to see her turn herself to God in the end. I think most of us get carried away in situations and forget to thank He who brings us through everything. The love story between her and Des was real and it shows that even though a woman might do her thing while her man is on the inside, she's always thinking of him first.

I loved how she didn't turn her back on Yarni like most mothers probably would have, after leaving home so early and marrying an older man.

No man would continue to spend money on a woman (with gifts way to extravagant) with her keeping contact with her husband. With my husband in prison a lot could be related to the book, but if I love him I'm not going to cheat on him. Yarni made it seem like she loved Dess so much but was living a double life.

Sometimes, Yarni seemed too nice, and that kind of got on my nerves, i mean, niggahs did her dirty, and here she is, trying to play an angel to everyone--c'mon, i mean, lets get real, she's suppose to be a hustler's wife, not Marry Poppins.

This book was just mediocre but the cover is pretty. I bought DON'T KNOCK THE HUSTLE by Stacy Nelson and there's no comparison. It's something about the TCP authors.

Now that she's with a major publisher let's see what she comes with."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT GET'S NO BETTA!!!!!","review":"I gotta give it to you Nikki Turner you did yah thing on this.I can't even explain how good Yarni and Des story was,I fell in love with this book as soon as I picked it up.I couldn't even think of a way to put it down all I can say is that this book is off da hook.Anybody who said this book wasn't a good one...you dont't know what a good book is,and to the people who haven't read it my suggestion to you is to pick it up and read it,and to you Nikki if you reading my review,you made me want to write my own book,and keep on doing yah thing...I cant wait till I read another one of your interesting books."},{"rating":"2","title":"not that bad","review":"I read this book a few weeks back, it wasn't a bad read. It talks about a girl name Yarni that's a somewhat sheltered child. She hooks up with a balla name Des... his mama was off the hook!lol. it's a good book and has allot of ups and downs. The book ends really well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book, Horrible Editing...","review":"I just finished reading this book and it is really a good story. Nikki Turner is a very good writer, however there were many, many, many typographacial errors, misspelled words and the grammar was really messed up. There were too many to count. I don't blame Ms. Turner, but I do blame the publishers because the editor did a horrible job. It looked as though there were sentences that were 1/2 way deleted and just thrown together and the sentences did not flow at all. I would have given this book 5 stars if there were not so many editing errors, however because of that, I rated this book 4 stars.On the outside of that, Ms. Turner's story was very interesting. Some of it was far fetched, however it's a very good story and it's worth while reading.If you could get through the very bad editing, you really will enjoy her book.Thank You."},{"rating":"2","title":"AI'IGHT","review":"A HUSTLER'S WIFE WAS OVER ALL A PRETTY GOOD BOOK...THE AUTHUR REALLY SHOWED SOME OF THE DRAMA A GIRL MUST GO THRU SOMETIMES IN ORDER TO KEEP HER LIFE TOGETHER.

The essays has extremely negative view of the world without much hope. All I hear is whinning and complaining without offering solutions to anything. Give me a break! If you're going to gripe about something than offer some solutions. Anyone can gripe but not everyone can do something about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"cool","review":"Much better quality than expected. A little pricey, but I think he will be thrilled come Christmas morning."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Imperial City ..... Short-Changed","review":"Initially unimpressed by the first chapter of the book, in which Freely provides a cursory summation of Byzantium's early history, I was amazed to find on page 13, the first of Chapter 2, that he mistakenly identified Mesembria (modern day Nesebar)as the Greek colony closest to the Bosphorus. It was in fact, and still is, Apollonia Pontika (modern day Sozopol), which was one of the earliest Greek foundations (late 7th century B.C.). The rest of the book is an assemblage of information, much of which will not be particulary useful to a visitor. The book's saving grace is an excellent bibliography for the reader to explore. For tourists, the \\"DK Eyewitness Travel Guide - Istanbul\\" is a far better companion; easier to carry, containing excellent color photographs and diagrams,and full of historical information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was expecting....","review":"I'm about 150 pages into this book. If you're interested in geneology - who gave birth to who - this is the book for you. The book briefly mentions the Hagia Sophia - it briefly mentions what lead to the schism between the Greek and Roman Churches but continues to onslaut the reader with geneology - which has become a bit boring. No doubt the author has done his research - but I was hoping to get a better idea of what Istanbul was like - the arts, the food, the architecture. There is an index of monuments at the end of the book. I'll continue to slog away and let you know...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably the Best Guide About Istanbul...","review":"This is both a book on history and an excellent guide of one of the world's most wonderful cities. Dr. FREELY first takes you through the history of the city and then provides a very complete, concise list of monuments and museums.If you are planning to visit Istanbul and want to say that you really (but really!) saw the city, this is one of the books to buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of facts, but dull","review":"This book does have a lot of information about Istanbul, but it's the kind of book that someone would finish only if he or she were living in Istanbul or going there on an extended visit. The book isn't really entertaining in itself, but there are lots of facts and dry anecdotes about the city's history.A better, more interesting, book on historical Istanbul is Constantinople : City of the World's Desire 1453-1924 by Philip Mansel.As for Freely on contemporary Istanbul, he is never able to give the reader a feeling for what it's like to spend time with the people who live in Istanbul, like Max Rodenbeck is able to do in his book about another city, Cairo: The City Victorious. There must be better books about Istanbul out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bring this book to Istanbul with you!","review":"This is one of the few books that both covers the complete history of Constantinople/Byzantium/Istanbul and at the same time serves as an excellent travel guide. The list and description of Istanbul's monuments and churches helped me immensly as I visited the city last month. The book does not go into enough depth on any of the historical subjects but is a great overview of the city's history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging, Intriguing, Engrossing","review":"Falling in love with Istanbul during three visits motivated me to pick up this book, but both as a travel and a history book, it is fascinating enough in its own right. This history reads very fast, with the characters morphing and returning from the (nearly) dead, just like a soap opera. By focusing on both the history and where it happened, Freely's book will make the next trip to Istanbul even more rewarding. Unlike most travel guides, this book covers the lesser-known places, for someone with the time and the interest to seek out what's left of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"meandering, pointless and confusing","review":"What begins as an inquisitive study of the humanity and divinity of Jesus meanders to a disappointing conclusion. Character development and geographical descriptions are excellent; that is all except for the central character. All the supposed mysticism, parallels and theology fall flat on their faces. A very compulsive yet unsatisfying read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crace's Arab characters devoid of humanity, one-dimensional","review":"Inspite of its stunning imagery this otherwise well researched novel suffers from traditional negative portrayal of Arabs and Arab culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"As dry as the landscape it depicts","review":"I enjoy intelligent, philosophical writing, which is why I was eager to read this novel. But I found the writing to be as arid as the desert landscape it describes. I forced my way through it, hoping for something allegorical or thought-provoking. The characters were well-differentiated but shallow, and the entire thing read as if it had been outlined and then filled in. I wasn't bothered by the lack of plot, but I finished the book wondering what was the point of it all?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Dull, and not worth the time","review":"If you like a book that makes you keep reading and you do not want to set the book down, then DO NOT read this book. There is no point to the story, the characters are dull and boring. From page 1 to the end of the story the plot does not take you anywhere. The characters are dull, and in no way can relate to the reader. Do not get this book!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time and money","review":"It's not unsettling, bizarre or anything remotely wonderful. It's a bunch of words signifying nothing. Incidentally, crace, the G in god is capitalized."},{"rating":"2","title":"He makes you think.","review":"Jim Crace's novels are so different from one another that it's hard to believe they're written by the same person. Quarantine, that's ostensibly about Christ's 40 days in the desert, really revolves around the others staying in caves while Christ goes through his forty day fast.The other characters are very interesting: there is a woman who wishes her husband had stayed dead, there is a merchant suffering from a terminal illness, and there are several other unique individuals to interact with these. The novel's central idea involves the self-imposed suffering of people and their reasons for it.This novel will likely upset those with strong views on either side of this issue in terms of religion. The funny part of that, however, is that the novel isn't really about religion per se, it's about the way that people perceive religion. All in all, this is a thought-provoking novel well worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intelligent and emotional","review":"\\"Quarantine\\" presents the story of a group of people who are changed by their experiences in the harsh desert of the Middle East. Fascinating from a historical and religious standpoint, this novel succeeds in creating a cast of unique characters and infusing the story with a compelling, complicated group dynamic. While Jesus is not the main character, his deep conflict and physical struggles are fascinating, as is his final transformation from child prophet into the son of God. Still, he is just one of a number of truly compelling characters which make up the heart and soul of this novel. The conclusion is wonderful. Each of the characters is (in one way or another) freed from the troubles that have haunted them, and their journey continues in another direction. This is a slow book, but it is definitely worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"fasting","review":"Who among us hasn't wondered about going on a long difficult fast. I wondered how I would hold up under the strain Jesus went through, and although I am not a person of faith I found the story to be hopeful and grittily real in a way most modern stories are not. If you want sand under your fingernails, in your ears, and a raging thirst, then I recommend this tale to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"My introduction to Dave Valentin","review":"I love his work, I love his talent. He has a sweet sensation on the the way he improves his sound. This was the first CD I'd been introduced to him at a Fulton County Library in Roswell GA or whatever. All the remakes are tight incl. the title track to the album which is a good standard to me. He absolutely worked w/ everybody from Ralph McDonald, Anthony Jackson, Steve Gadd and Dave Grusin (who's among my favorite people from the GRP group and along w/ film scores, music and everything), among others.This is sure is a CD I must-have even tho I don't have it yet. Most standout tracks are: Legends, I want to be Where u Are, Bouree in E Minor, Patterns for the Sky and Afro Blue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet bluegrass fiddling","review":"Bluegrass/old-timey fiddler Kenny Baker is no spring chicken, but he still can saw with the best of them. As with most all-instrumental fiddle albums, you have to be a real fan to appreciate a whole record of this stuff, but for those who are down with the program, this is a nice album. Baker plays both sweet and hot, and has a deft melodic twist that will make your ears perk up on tune after tune."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality, don't waste your money","review":"Very cheaply made and fell apart within a month.

White's Rules is a reminder that what is basic in life is also basic in the classroom. The classroom must provide more than academic instruction; it must be a place where teachers establish the primary values and morals that their students need to survive in the world outside the classroom. This book shows how teachers can demand bedrock solid values of their students and reap the rewards of mutual respect that such values create. White's Rules is not just a book for inner city teachers and their \\"incorrigibles\\" it is also a book for teachers like me in the suburbs with diverse middle class kids. The combination of strict consistent discipline and unconditional love is a formula that works. I recommend this book to anyone looking to find what's essential and what works in the classroom today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Investment","review":"You get what you pay for and that is certainly true with this jewelry cleaner.

Wheel went out of round within 200 miles.... broken spoke. Got them professionally fixed and trued. 200 miles later.... broken spoke, then another, then two more. Once one goes, the other ones go in quick succession... it was a matter of seconds. I'm 210 on 700c's. That shouldn't me too much to ask of them. I do crank up a lot of steep hills, but all on pavement. The wheel is so out of round now that it can't be totally re-trued, this from a professional bike shop. Either bum spokes, bum construction, or bum hubs, but something about these wheels doesn't agree with Fuji hybrid road bikes. I've read other reviews of the Weinmann equipped Fujis and there are a larger than normal ratio of complaints about broken spokes. I'm trading up to Mavics recommended to me by a pro bike mechanic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke right away","review":"I was really excited to give this to my State fan for Christmas, but it broke 2 days after Christmas.

I don't run anything out of the ordinary.There is nothing in the event log to point to the instability and tech support has been useless. All they did was have me send it to them and they re-imaged it after I had just done that not long before. I even had problems with nothing but the original HP image and no added software other than Firefox installed.Vista is such a resource hog that 1 gig of memory is really not enough. If you run more than one application performance slows.

Something about this collection of 10 songs grabbed me from the very first listening. The first track, Ten Year Night, is incredible, as are Just You Tonight and For Once in Your Life.

I already had Flesh and Bone and loved it (still do). To me, this one is nowhere near as good. I saw her touring in support of this album and sing all the songs live before I heard the studio versions. I'll take her and her guitar onstage any day to the fully worked up with a backing band version. In particular, the song \\"Turn the Lights Back On\\" was oozing with raw emotion and hurt at the concert. The song sounds rather tame on the disc, by comparison. So Lucy is still a great artist, but I'd recommend you buy Flesh and Bone instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another tremendous album by Lucy","review":"This one has it all--great, personal lyrics (Just You Tonight will have you running for the kleenex), well-written songs and playing.

Stan Getz's 'Focus' was such an album. Ray Bryant's 'Con Alma' another. And then there is Beirach's 'Elm' which is a gem of twentieth century art, in my opinion. This is another of those icons.The key for me is 'How Deep is the Ocean'. It reminds me of 'Sea Priestess' on the Elm album. It begins in a meditative, rhthmic fashion and builds gradually into a statement of aching beauty, an homage to life.This collection of pieces resonates so strongly with me that I am at a loss for words. I will give this cd to those I love during the holidays and hold my breath, hoping that they 'get it'."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for!","review":"I tried to find a cheaper ink and now I am paying.I replaced two colors with Rhinoteck cartridges in my Cannon S800.The prints looked good at first however after a while, the prints lost saturation and appeared streaky.

I thought \\"What harm would it do to just try it - the price is right.\\" So I bought the photo cyan and photo magenta since those colors seem to be sucked down faster than any onthers on my S820. I first replaced the photo cyan cartridge. At first there didn't seem to be a huge difference. But then I reprinted some photos I had orginally printed with the OEM cartridge and did a side-by-side comparison. I could detect a more washed-out greenish tint to my output - and this was just 1 cartridge.

It dosen't fir on most mounts. I've tryed a 9mm, Deagle, 38mm, and a few more. I'm not just dumb, it's just really difficult. Plus it's not that good of a product anyway. The little laser can't have anything in front of it, and has to be perfectly alined, with the scope. It's not helpful, do not buy. Get a laser that attaches to the bottom of your gun instead!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For $10 it's great!","review":"I put this on a Crossman 760 Pumpmaster and it's surprisingly accurate with the help of this sight. The sight is all plastic and has windage and elevation adjustment screws. The dot is pretty big, but it's made for BB guns, so you shouldn't be shooting anything too far out anyways.Surprisingly, it has very little parallax, meaning, you can move your head around the gun and the dot stays in the same place (on cheap red dots the dot usually moves quite a bit forcing you to center the dot in the sight and then put it on target)At about 10 yards I could get a 1/2 to 1 inch group, which I was shocked at because BB's tend to hit randomly.For $10 you can't go wrong, but keep in mind this is not a military grade Eotech or Aimpoint. It probably won't stand up to too much abuse, but if you buy it to plink around on some cans with your little brother like me, it's money well spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"ok...i bought this at wal mart for like 8.95 or somthingit does NOT project a laser onto the target.it is very light.i though mounting it was very easy.i mounted it on my jt tac-5 recon paintball gun.it only fits 3/8 dovetail rails(the kind on air guns and .22s)it has 2 brightness settings.you have get the laser in the center of the sight, so it may take a fewseconds to pic up in a firefight.batteries are included(walmart included them)the price is good, i was going to get a red dot scope for 20 bucks,but i saw this and im glad i got it, i saved 10 bucks.it is very similar to a reflex sight.it is adjustable for windage and elevation.it feels kind of cheapy though.i would actually give this a 4.5 rating, but you cant.i hope this helped,Rambo"},{"rating":"1","title":"Daisy Dud","review":"My blunder wanted to try something different and this surly was , If it only worked as good as it looked .

I couldn't stop listening, but as I learned more about the band I found out I was little too late. Thats when I found their purevolume Cassino page. This music is so refreshing. I waited and waited for this album to come out, im so glad they took their time. I agree its great to hear the new versions of the original demos.I would recommend (and do recommend) this album to everyone who enjoyed Northstar. Amazing album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, From Start To Finish","review":"This is an amazing album. One of my close friends, who is a self-proclaimed music addict, recommended it to me. At first I was a bit apprehensive - who can imagine the boys from Northstar breaking into some country-style folk beats? After giving it a listen (well, more than just one), I rememebered suddenly what music is all about - it's about taking risks, finding new ways to express catharsis, and simply being creative. There are some very intriguing songs on the album, and if I had to recommend any specific one, it would be \\"The Gin War\\". This song made it into my top 25 most played songs on my iPod in a matter of three days. I also love \\"Platano\\" and \\"Lolita\\". This is a GREAT album.

Breastfeeding has been great, and Womanly Art of Breastfeeding has been constant reference for me from birth through starting solids and discipline. I'd strongly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"When I purchased this book I was looking forward to another engaging story with sizzle from Ms. Walker. Unfortunately, it didn't deliver. The characters are likable and engaging, but the stroy simply doesn't deliver.Because the timeline makes a rather clumsy \\"jump\\" from one event to travel back and tell the bulk of the story, then back to the \\"present\\" for the finale, I had to take the time to figure out when the passages I was reading took place. Very distracting. In addition, I don't feel the reader is given enough information to understand the fantasy world that has been built for the story. This book also lacked the sensuality I have come to expect from Ellora's Cave.I've read enough of Ms. Walker's work to know she can write great stories with incredible hot scenes, but had this been my first Walker book, I would never consider buying another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mind-Blowing","review":"An album so good, I bought it; it got stolen; and I bought it again. and I usually don't buy an album even once.A little too much to handle at first. if you're looking for something simple to break yourself in on dredg, listen to track 2: same ol road, and track 7: convalecent.The whole thing's brilliant though. And don't forget about the previous album, lietmotif. it's not equal to El Cielo, nothing probably is, but check it out anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a beautiful album.","review":"After listening to this album, it took me a while to really like, although I thought it was better than most of the stuff you hear on the radio. But after a few listens later, I heard things that I didn't notice the first time around and I felt things I didn't feel the first time around. This album is very artistic and sent me through different kinds of emotions as I listened. Then I realized that this album IS better than anything you could hear on the radio or on MTV. There are actual musicians here. This is art.You really have to listen to the album in its entirety. You can't just listen to 30 second samples. The song structuring is actually creative, so you will miss A LOT from just listening to a sample!Also, Dredg is a very original band. No one sounds just like them or even close to them.The only one thing that bothers me is how Dredg is going to top this album. I really hope they will."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dredg's second major release is warming to the ears.","review":"I have been a loving listener of dredg for years and finally the new material has been released. To those that have heard \\"Leitmotif\\", but not \\"El Cielo\\", you will find that the style and feeling of the presentation has elevated in thought. I strongly recommend new comers of Dredg to open ears to this masterpiece. Every song (including interludes) is enjoyable and at the end of the album, I felt enlightened. Dredg is not like any other band out there. They play with passion for life and search the unknown in innovation of sound. So in final, this is a must get album. The instruments used along with poetic lyrics bring new light upon the listener. So if ears are willing, give it a try..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A letdown.","review":"People have been recommending this band to me for over a year, and I just now got around to listening to them for the first time. My first reaction was that nothing about this rather long album caught my attention at all the first time I listened to it, and it really just seemed like background music. I tried listening to it again, and paying closer attention, and it still really struck me as bland and boring. It really just seems like these guys are trying to hard to be deep, when there really isn't anything there. The instrumentation is weak, the lyrics are weaker, and overall, it was a dissappointment. For now, 2/5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put Me to Sleep Please!","review":"What are all you people thinking. This has to be the worst CD I have ever purchased. I bought the cd based on it's reviews, huge mistake. The idea of the album is cool don't get me wrong. But the lead singers voice sounds like it has been so computerized it makes me sick. How can you people compare this band to Pink Floyd or it's singer to Maynerd what a crock. I want my money back!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"trying to be something they are not","review":"just because you think you are deep doesn't mean that... This band obviously thinks they have a message but they don't. It sounds like music made by rich punk kids who don't really know anything about putting true emotion into their music. All of the songs sound shallow [and] uninspired I have seen them live and have heard the album. My advice to you, save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great sonic experience...","review":"El Cielo was my first entrance into the music of Dredg, and it took a few listens to get used to their style, which is nice and original. After the first few listens, I was hooked, listening to this album everyday until I got tired of it. El Cielo is Dredg's concept album about sleep paralysis and the effects and visions it causes the sleepless to have. I can relate so a few of the experiences myself, as I am sure many can. The musicianship on this album is superb, nice semi-complex music that ranges from rock to progressive, including interesting instruments and pieces. The vocals are decent, the lyrics are good, but odd. I enjoyed this album a lot and its worth a listen, but not a must have. And don't listen to those that compare Dredg to Tool or The Mars Volta or A Perfect circle, they sound nothing alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"Being a new Dredg fan, I purchased both El Cielo and Catch Without Arms together through Amazon about a week ago. (a ref from a good friend.)By anyone's standards this stuff is top shelf. This definitely high quality music. I'm enjoying it immensely.I just ordered their first record as well. No regrets."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't believe what this CD has done to my brain","review":"AMAZING!A week ago at this time I didn't know who this band is. Now I'm so addicted I'm listening to them all day long.This CD is my favorite so far. Their other stuff is really good too, but this CD has something else. Something I can't describe. It ate my brain in one big gulp."},{"rating":"2","title":"impressed again","review":"Dredg has made another impressive album. The vocals are a huge improvement. The length of the CD is quite a bit longer than leitmotif and demonstrates their creativity and uniqueness using a variety of instruments and vocal styles. It sounds a bit softer than leitmotif but is still heavy. It is also a bit more song based, but that is ok. I shouldn't compare leitmotif and el cielo because they are both awesome. I recommend this to anybody who wants to listen to a good band that doesn't use controversy or anger to give their music emotion and a life of it's own."},{"rating":"2","title":"A much more melodic release","review":"Dredg's sophmore album \\"El Cielo\\" is a much more different experience release than their recent album \\"leitmotif\\" The singer's voice got more deeper and the music is more original. The lyrics are more poetic and remixed in a nice orderly fasion. Pianos and other string instruments beat and drag through this album. I have been a dredg fan for a while and they are quite a good experience. The guitar solos and the drumbeats are a little repeatative but they work well with the rythemes. What makes this album good is the high notes that the singer puts out make the songs more passionate. So if you bought the first record expect more dramatic results out of this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop reading and buy this CD!!","review":"As en avid music and art fan, I cant express the sorrow that I feel when I see the [stuff] that passes as music now adays. Just watching TRL for 5 minutes is enough to put me on a 7 day coma. But then a wonderful work of ART like El Cielo comes along and reminds me why I like music so much. I love Tool, love Pink Floyd, but this band has a style of their own. God blessem, buy this cd and SPREAD THE WORD!!!!! El Cielo es hermoso, gracias Dredg."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really amazing Music","review":"Dredg have released one of the greatests albums I've ever heard. With lots of diferents influences, going through metal, melodic rock, emo...This album creates a new kind of music, never heard before. Tecnically all the musicians demonstrate their skills (incredible drum work), the sound is enough acurated and the music sounds great, with a great sense of Feeling and Strenght during the Cd. I would Recommend this album to Everybody who thinks that likes music. You won't regret."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Flow than You Can Shake a Stick","review":"I can't express to you how much this changed my life. I happened to be having bouts of sleep apnea when I discovered this album, and it was so amazing. The structures and funky break downs in the midst of dreamlike melodies. The effects and sounds get deep into you, and take you somewhere completely else.The Canyon Behind Her: My favorite ending for an album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece!","review":"Dredg's El Cielo is one of the best cd's I've ever heard. Honestly, this cd was an inspiration, serving as a soundtrack of sorts to life, as I struggled for two years writing my first novel, Payday. There's just something about the music here that takes you to that place inside yourself where everything is sublime. In that regard, this is a rare find, and is a definite must own."},{"rating":"2","title":"A dynamic original record","review":"I don't quite recall how I stumbled upon this record, but I'm glad that I did. Apparently their first record was a bit heavier than \\"El Cielo\\" and the band was compared to Tool. I think a better starting point on this record would be the missing link between Radiohead and Porcupine Tree. There is definitely a progressive rock element here as well as washes of guitars the invoke shoegazer era britpop of the late 80's. The vocals are a bit unique, but once you get used to them this record becomes a very rewarding, fresh and dynamic journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Point of entry","review":"For those who haven't heard Dredg I offer a simple piece of advice: hear Dredg. As with all music, hearing is believing. Dredg manages to echo aspects of Tool, Miles Davis, early Pink Floyd, and other forms of progressive/art music while retaining a truly unique sound all their own. The drum sound on their albums is the heaviest yet most natural I've ever heard. The band doesn't multi-track everything to death (listen to the Smashing Pumpkins or Boston if you like that). Instead everything has room to breathe because art is about space. The msuic ranges from hard rock to piano ballads to indigenous vocal chants to psychedelic sound washes to free form jazz excursions AND sounds completely cohesive. Dredg is one of the best rock bands on the scene, period. If you crave art is music, and are tired of being fed ... pseudo-indie bands with trashy guitar tones this album may provide salvation. Turn it up loud for maximum effect. It will open your third eye."},{"rating":"2","title":"They shall not go unnoticed","review":"WHo knows how many spins this album has had for me, but it gets better each time as I connect with it more and more. It is so emotional and almost makes me want to cry at how beautiful it is. One listen is all it takes. LIsten to it once through without interuption and you will be in awe. CD of the year, and quite possibly of bands that have come out in my lifetime.A masterpiece. I can almost not imagine anything better than this. What else could they possibly do?!?!?!Has that whole great Cd quality similar to Radiohead and tool...takes you on a journey that you never want to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Humor based on the ignorant southerner, the time for this type of humor has passed","review":"This is a pamphlet book where I am unsure as to what the target audience and purpose is.

Phrases like \\"sed\\", \\"sez\\", \\"air\\", \\"shore tuh\\", \\"ovah\\", \\"whar\\" and \\"et\\" are frequently used. Since it was written by a southern man, it would appear that it is a parody, but it is decidedly unflattering to people of the south. My best description is that it is a book where if it had been written by a Yankee, the verbiage would be considered \\"fighting words\\", so it could only be written and published by a true man of the south.If you like silly humor based on the ridicule of a segment of the population, you might enjoy this book.

Unfortunately, this isn't even close. If he (or his record label) chooses to release \\"The Best of\\" Volume II with the other hit songs, I won't be buying! That would just be a marketing gimmick to make more money from the buying public. They could have released ALL his greatest hits on one CD as most artists do; but, that wouldn't allow them to sell two CDs for twice the profit! It seems to me that, after a 28 year career and millions of record sales, we (the buying public) deserve a TRUE \\"Greatest Hits\\", all of them on ONE CD!

It doesn't include many of his great songs. Every time I think about buying this CD I stop. There's way too much missing. My advice to anyone wanting to get some Jackson Browne into their collection is to look elsewhere. Start with one of the stand alone albums. \\"Saturate Before Using,\\" \\"The Pretender,\\" and \\"Running on Empty\\" are my favorites. I have different advice for the record company: Get your act together and release a true \\"Best of\\" for Browne. Sure, it will probably need to be a double-disc set. Also, it would be nice to see some remastered versions of the individual albums.

A best of compilation would need to be a double disc set and would have to include such songs as \\"The Road\\" from RUNNING ON EMPTY, \\"Before the Deluge\\" from LATE FOR THE SKY, and two or three additional tracks from FOR EVERYMAN. Really, his first five albums merit owning in their entirety, even for non-fanatics. A single best-of CD that covers his later career (from HOLD OUT onward) would be welcome, as the albums are much more spotty, but this CD fails to document even his more recent stuff adequately. The choices are so strange in some cases that this CD can't even be considered representative.That being said, compeletist may have to buy this CD anyway for the title track and \\"The Rebel Jesus,\\" which appears on a Chieftains album, I think in a different form. \\"Somebody's Baby\\" is only available on the \\"Fast Times at Ridgemont High\\" soundtrack and was a Top 40 hit in 1981 or so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Collection","review":"This compilation of Browne's career is ok, but there is a lot of material missing that could have been included. In fact a more recent two CD retrospective was released a few years ago that covers a lot more ground than this disc does. The choices of songs selected for this album are not necessarily Browne's \\"greatest hits\\" although several of his big ones are included (\\"Doctor My Eyes\\", \\"Running On Empty\\", \\"Tender Is The Night\\", \\"Lives In The Balance\\"). The collection includes one track from each of his studio albums so some of his better album tracks are included here as well (\\"Late For The Sky\\", \\"Barricades Of Heaven\\"). The album also includes two new recordings \\"The Rebel Jesus\\" and \\"The Next Voice You Hear\\" both of which are good. All in all this is a good collection, but might disappoint those just looking for Browne's hits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best of - NOT!","review":"I gotta agree with many of the posts.

Maybe we will be inspired to delve further into an artist's history after listening to a Best of Collection.I was waiting for years for a JB Best of Collection. I bought this album with the hopes of getting all or most of Jackson Browne's hits. This doesn't even come close. So many big hits or popular songs are absent.

Notice anything missing?Like many people who admire Browne's work but don't run to the record store (or to the computer) everytime he puts out a new release, I've always hoped he'd deliver a knock-out greatest hits album.To say that the quality of the track selection on this album is wafer thin is an insult to wafer makers around the world.A major disappoinment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delightfully melancholy journey","review":"This \\"best of\\" album nicely showcases Browne's progression through the years, from his highly personal early work through his more outwardly focused and often political music. Overall, I enjoyed the album, because the song choices often coincided with my favorites from particular albums. For example, \\"Sky Blue and Black\\" and \\"The Barricades of Heaven\\" are the two best from their respective albums. It is a shame, though, that music does not seem to have been chosen this way consistently; some, like \\"Running on Empty\\" and \\"Somebody's Baby\\" (while, granted, good songs) seem to have been included more for recognizability than artistry and stick out oddly among the more pensive-sounding tunes that populate this recording. One caveat: Jackson's best work is excellent, but often his best work is also wrenchingly melancholy. This makes it hard to sit down and listen to \\"The Next Voice You Hear\\" at a stretch without sinking into a deep melancholia yourself. Be warned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An Uncompromising Artist Compromises Here","review":"It must be a real challenge to put out a dud of greatest hits album when you have as many truly great songs to your credit as Browne.

Peterson does beneft from the value of 20/20 hindsight joining in the anti-military rhetoric, using questionable sources as times to validate his perspective. Despite factual inaccuracies and the hard-to-justify moral blame he puts on the United Nations (over African warlords), it is, regardless, a first hand account of events the world would rather forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Things you should know","review":"I found that this book was very helpfull but you need to update every six months.

The characters are in crisis every moment of their days.... A lot of gulping and gasping. Also, it is clear that the author has never lived in nor been intimately involved in a small town. Her portrayal of one is very unrealistic. In addition, her agenda is clear in her choice of villains. However, having said that, the plot DOES have some twists and surprises that make you finish the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I prefer more thrill, less emotional drama...","review":"This is why I usually stay away from female authors. I really felt like there was way too much emotion and not enough good story here. The story itself is a good one, with some good parts that are thrilling. However too much time is spent with drama filled pages of emotional feeling, that could only be written by a woman. And the book didn't seem to flow - too many short sentences one right after another. Maybe the author has better writing skills that she didn't represent in this book but I know I was happy to be finished with it and on to something I could really get in to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheers","review":"I can't believe I have just now read my first book by Spindler.

Over the weekend, we started listening to it, and noticed that these were *not* the original recordings of these popular songs, rather, they were performed by \\"The Hit Crew\\". Furthermore, as we studied the liner notes in more detail, we realized that aside from the name \\"Ellen\\", there seems to be no discernible connection between this, and daytime talk-show hostess Ellen DeGeneres.We got a chuckle out of it all, and the CD was only $6 or so.

While I don't remember all of it, impressions remain of the colorful images his prose painted of his immigrant family and his own antics. He tells the tale of his impersonation of a Middle Eastern prince on vacation in Hollywood, strewing fake jewels as he ostentatiously breezed through town. (I remember watching the Groucho Marx game show You Bet Your Life and seeing Blatty persist with that impersonation until just before the end of his segment, when he 'fessed up.

Instead of focusing on overly-wordy descriptions of computer hardware and jacking-into-the-virtual-cyber-realm-via-the-com-link type thing that too many other authors fall victim to; Noon instead comes up with very different and surreal means of involving future technology and culture.

Every time I think I might want to have some beyond what I've allowed myself, beyond my 36 ounces, I look at it and it does everything coke made it to do. Red silver, it makes me think of drinking it, it makes the roof of my mouth feel fizzy and cold and not sweet but not not sweet, just cold refreshing that opens out into my throat, and now just looking at the red swirl and fake bubbles, just looking under my arm makes my brain feel fizzy and fresh all over, like shaken a little, and colder ande cleaner.I love this bag.

I do tell the kids not to take off the removable mouthpiece, or if they do, to be careful not to break the fragile red spacer-ring.Flutophones are easy to play. They are better than recorders for smaller fingers since they are shorter with holes closer together. They are better for smaller finger tips because their holes are smaller and have raised lips that are easier to cover than most flat recorder holes I've seen.Well worth the $2.99 each we paid!

I bought and thought their first two albums were satisfactory listening but their third album was so terrible, I returned it to the store the same day and demanded my money back. The album just didn't hold me. The words have no meaning and the rythms and chords seem to change drastically from one verse to the next that it's too jumpy to enjoy. I expected better from this group, but it's no wonder why you can't find their music hardly at all in the stores. It's just not good enough to sell."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Family Stand Triumphs with their best album yet!","review":"I love this album! I believe that it is one of the best albums to come out of 1998. With their new female lead vocalist (Jacci McGhee of Keith Sweat's \\"Make it Last Forever\\" fame), the Family Stand have matured into a band to be reckoned with. There is not a song on this album that I do not enjoy, and I am hard pressed to say which songs are my favorites. I feel that in \\"Connected\\", a perfect chord has been struck between R & B, Rock, and Funk, mixing together into a big ball of great music.

Aided by the nice person he met in bar, and he has found a friend, he ventures off, just taking advantage of opportunities that arise.It's about looking for that one person we want to spend the rest of our lives in and not one night stands or convenient relationships.I would suggest this book to everyone who wants to understand how men and women think, regardless sex orientation"},{"rating":"2","title":"I can think of 50 Reasons to buy this book.","review":"Brilliantly written, wonderfully entertaining.

I would have liked it more if it was like a real car, with the clutch and the 5 speed stick (or 6) cause that's howi'm used to driving, but i can get used to the stick.

The 3 point mount system seems to work better than the WingMan and the wheel and base feels a lot better than the WingMan as well.

The resistence on the race you just won is set to \\"0\\" and it's real easy to turn on that race. The next race is totally different though. Even though settings are the same the resistence is like going from power steering to manual steering on an old truck. Then came the real bad problem.

Looking for Hustler's Wife now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A load of unrealistic rubbish!","review":"I was recommended this book and at first I like it; maybe the first chapter or so..interesting content and good opening, but then it got ridiculous; she made several errors, skipped through time in a short number of pages- I didn't know where it was going one minute it's the next day then 10 years later! Also it was very unrealistic in terms of what happened and she stooped as low as to advertise her own book smh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NIKKI TURNER JUST MADE HER FIRST BAD BOOK!","review":"I couldn't believe this, one of my favorite writers Nikki Turner made a bad book! No, no, say it isn't so. I could have excepted this from another writer but not her. I read this book and it was so up and down to me. I just wasn't feelin' it. I'm so upset, maybe others will love it, but to me it wasn't that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"THIS BOOK STARTED OFF A SMASH! I DIDN'T WANT TO PUT THE BOOK DOWN BECAUSE A LOT OF SUSPENSE KEPT ME GUESSING. I THINK THAT EVERY FEMALE SHOULD READ THIS BOOK BECAUSE IT MAY HIT HOME.I GAVE THIS BOOK FOUR STARS BECAUSE AT THE END THE AUTHOR DRAGGED THE CONCLUSION. THE AUTHOR NEVER SAY WHAT HA[[ENED TO OTHER CHARACTERS.THANKS KEYANNA"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a favorite","review":"This book was sort of slow to me. It also had a lot, and I do mean lots of grammer and spelling errors. At one time she was telling Gypsy after she became paralized that \\"she was going to get custody of her nephew if the police ever caught up to her brother, she then said Wiggles just blew into the straw to agree\\". Wiggles had been killed 4 chapters back. These are the types of errors that occured all through the book, which is why it was so difficult to read. I am not sure if I will read any other Nikki Turner books anytime soon (hopefully she has a better editor now). This book was overall a slow read, and in no way can compete to other african american authors like, Zane, Michael Baisden, Eric Jerome Dickey or Sister Souljah for that matter. My recommendation is to read at your own risk, its better to check it out at the local library for free, then to spend $10-$15 dollars on it at the store. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This was the worst book I ever read!","review":"I didnt finish it because I thought a 5th grader wrote it.

That's Triple Crown's Motto. I agree with most of the readers that we should boycott Triple Crown Publishing until they provide us with some quality editing. Instead read Sister Souljah (Coldest Winter), Weber (Player Haters), Zane (Nervous), Rolyat (Lust), Dickey (Other Woman). Now these are quality, pageturning stories with sound editing.Souljah is STILL the reigning Queen of Hip Hop! She never gave birth or passed her baton to another so there is no princess of hip hop!

It Donald Goines style circa 2000, with much \\"heat\\" but no \\"meat\\".I mean really....how many times are various different wannabe authors going to try and entertain us with these key things:1. Pretty, street wise black girl that loves the hoodrich culture.2. Handsome, psychotic young black man who \\"slangs\\".3. Gun fire, sex, smoking blunts and having kids?4. The pretty, street wise black girl \\"wakes up\\" and realizes that this life is not for her?Gosh, I mean HOW many times is this same, dry story going to be told? Where is the story telling? The orginiality?I was extremely disappointed in this trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth my time","review":"This book was horrible from beginning to end, very unreal, Greasy and boring.

I feel like I need to have a red pen in my hand to read these triple crown books. (Vickie Stringer and Shannon Holmes should be ashamed of themselves for putting this stuff out.

A million and one typos, The story was predictable and some parts very unbelievable I don't know why I wasted my money In the book I found Tressa to be very long winded (Think Blanche from the golden girls) some of the things she would say was so long a drawn out she the type of person you would cut off right in the middle and say ALRIGHT ALRIGHT GET IT OVER WITH ! she would say long drawn out things like your gonna crumble! crumble like the walls of Jerchio crumbling to pits of hell on a speedboat (not actual quote) All this just to say watch your back your going down ???? come on ! I wished Lucky had killed her off just so she would shut her long winded TRAP ! My suggestion is SAVE YOUR MONEY ! My plans for this book is to loan it out and hope it never comes back !"},{"rating":"2","title":"project chick","review":"This book was good but not as good as hustler wife.

For thoese who read hear me out and for thoes who haven't listen to me realll good ok. I thought this was a repeat of or copy of \\"Hustler's Wife\\" the main haracter Lucky Luck seem to be bengie all over again, Gloria from H.W seem to be or show some simalrities in \\"wiggles\\" from P.C, Yarni was Teresa, I forgot his name but Teresa's brother was Des from H.W all in all the books were two much alike and didn't show any uniquenesss. Also Triple Crown Productions was and still is doing the damn thang but what's up with the editing even the slang was wrong and words were flip around. It's one thing to read the book and figure out what going on but to be confused because of the misspelled words come on now."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT THE F**K !!!!!","review":"THIS BOOK SUCKED COMPARED TO HER OTHER BOOKS...

DO NOT BUY...!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE!!","review":"Ok, i have read Triple Crown Books before, but they were all good. I thought that this one would be the same way...not so!! This book is so poorly written, I can't stand to finish reading it. Why do we have editors? Obviously Nikki DIDN'T have any for this book. The sentences don't even make sense! I mean, I know I'm not the most intelligent person, but I know you don't write in the past tense, then turn around and write in the present tense...in the same sentence! There were also plenty of fragments, and I was so confused when she went directly from the chick leaving the mansion with her two kids to her living alone without a mention of the kids. I'm used to a \\"A Few Months Before\\" or something like that to let me know, ok we're about to go back a little bit! Overall I am very disappointed in this book. I feel like it was a waste of my money, and had it been the first Nikki Turner novel I had ever read, I probably wouldn't have bothered to read anymore. Shabby job, Nikki!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Project Chick Review","review":"I thought this book was pretty good. I support all of TCP's works because although it is fiction, the authors make you feel like you are right there, and you feel what each character is going through.Nicki has a very creative and wild imagination. I like how she is able to twist urban/ghetto drama with adventure/action (i.e. Indie's escape from the police when he was on the run).Kudo's to Nicki for another creative work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This said it all","review":"I really really enjoyed this book I was starting to be able to predict the endings of all the rest of the books-- Their love one dies and the women have to fend for themselves but after reading this book it makes me want to read more.This book is at the top of my list I finished reading in two days and I having been passing it to friends ever since keep up the good work the book was GREAT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Time and Energy!!","review":"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.

I READ A LEAST 4 BOOKS A WEEK AND I AM SURPISE BY SOME OF THE BAD REVIEWS. I AGREE THAT THERE WAS A LOT OF TYPOS AND GRAMMAR ERRORS; BUT PASS THAT \\"A PROJECT CHICK\\" HAS NICE STORY LINE. I HAVE GAVE MY COPY TO OVER TEN PEOPLE, AND ONLY RECIEVED ONE BAD COMMENT.

First let me say that I know Ms. Turner is capable of better judging by the first book. This one seemed a little rushed and out of step. The errors in the book were ridiculus. I'm sure Spell-Check was on the computer, I don't know why she didn't use it.I hate to ever say this but....Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK Story Line... Horrible Editing!","review":"I haven't finished the book; I am only on the first few chapters. But the grammatical and punctuation errors in this book are ridiculous! Just because the book is about the 'hood doesn't mean that the author/editors can write correctly.I'm not speaking about the word choices and language used. I expect that from this type of novel. I'm talking about misplaced and unnecessary commas, run-on sentences, etc. I'm enjoying the story, but trying to decipher what Ms. Turner is saying is giving me quite a headache!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I WAS PISSED","review":"THIS BOOK HAD TO BE THE FAKEST BOOK THAT I HAVE EVER READ. I WAS NOT FEELING TRESSA AT ALL. AND I HAVE TO SAY THAT IT IS APBOLUTELY A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY. I EXPECTED IT TO BE GOOD BUT IT REALLY DON'T DESERVE THE TWO STARS I GAVE IT. ALL THE STUFF THAT HAPPENED IN THIS BOOK WAS STRAIGHT UP UNREAL. WHAT KIND OF GHETTO WAS SHE TRYING TO IMATATE IT SHOULD AIN'T THE HOOD I WAS RAISED IN.

It was written specifically for you and about you. I don't know who else that can relate to this garbage! The plot was BLAH, the characters were BLAH, and the editing was BLAH BLAH BLAH and BLAH. I think at one point the author forgot whether she was writing in first person or third! My God! NIKKI, baby do you have your stuff edited? I wish I knew someone I could refer you to because your publishing company is just throwing you in the fire with gasoline underwear on!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Still not feeling her","review":"I know a lot of people are not going to like this, but I am still not feeling Nikki Turner as an author.

I guess that's why its called fiction.Later!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"project chick","review":"I must admit I was totally feeling the book for the first half. Then the other half she got all unrealistic and it really did make sense how it ended one moment she said lucky lights went out and the next he was in the story alive.Some scenes were redundant and absurd and to me she was lucky that they even published the book sorry but I was a fan of your first book but the second one was a great dissapointment TRY AGAIN"},{"rating":"1","title":"Let Down!","review":"I really enjoy Nikki work, but Project Chick wasn't the best.Who ever did the editing need to be fired! I understand doing the street lango, but getting the charcters wrong in the book was the worst. Saying that a charcter was speaking when they died chapters before was a let down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't get through it","review":"I'd like to show Nikki Turner some love for her new book, but I can't get through it. I have to agree with all the other reviewers who slammed on Nikki for the editing. It's not that hard to get it right. I can't get more than a few pages in before I have to set the thing down. Nikki, you can keep it real without making the book sound like a 14 year old who never took an English class wrote it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning","review":"This Author shows no growth between her previous book and this one, in fact, she declines. I gave the last one two stars for entertainment value, but this one was straight up stupid. There was nothing real about it except for the fact that the main character is triffling (Although the author does not seem to think so). Nikki Turner seems to think that women who mess with hustlers and hustle themselves in any kind of way, including prostituion, deserve to be on some kind of pedestal. The publisher also has not shown any kind of growth, or hired a decent proof reader to catch the horrible spelling and editing mistakes. These books must be typed on the typewriter, what other excuse is there for not using SPELLCHECK? The story line is all over the place, there is just nothing real about it. Keep trying Nikki. I don't recommend buying this book. You can have my copy for free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life's Struggles!!!!!!!","review":"This was a good read. Tressa is living a lavish lifestyle, the problem is, this lifestyle comes with a price, in the form of Tressa's crazy, possessive boyfriend Lucky. Tressa endures the verbal and physical abuse to live this lifestyle but things are about to change. Tressa finally decides to move on, and find's that life is hard. From baby daddy drama, to backstabbing friend's, you'll experience what it's like to struggle to find some kind of peace in a world that is anything but peaceful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tressa's pain","review":"I enjoyed this book; However, it was not as interesting or as good as A Hustler's Wife. A Project Chick was very interesting from the beginning to the end. Not to mention what Lucky did in the beginning of the book really shocked me. That guy was a crazy loser and he didn't care about anyone or anything. What was up with all of the type o's in this book. That was truly terrible. It was a very great book but it had way too many typeo's."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Page Turner","review":"This book was very good from the very start. It wasnt that unrealistic.

I cant wait to read the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing - I don't think so.","review":"Sorry to be the fly in the ointment here, but I just don't see what everyone else is seeing. Yes a few of the papercuttings are intricate, but most of them are crudely cut and rather dull. The designs are not at all attractive and I found it extremely disappointing. If you're looking for beautiful papercuttings, there are far better ones available. Maybe you have to be a Hans Christian Andersen fan to appreciate this book. I was more interested in the cuttings themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointed","review":"I think this is the best Bible that money can buy however, I am dissapoined with the print. Almost every page I have read so far has letters that are a \\"blot\\" of ink instead of the letter and words that run into each other without a space.

I've used about half of them and have thrown out around 5 because they wouldn't work. Now I come to find out that even though the images I saved on one disc before overhauling my pc are showing as thumbnails(I did a double check before deleting them) the disc causes whatever program I'm trying to open a file with to lock up, so it's useless and now I worry that I may not be able to replace some of those images and photoshop projects that I use on my website.

Decided I learned from this an tossed the rest in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"11 of the 50 discs did not work","review":"These dvd's must have been a recall or something because 11 out of the 50 did not burn! I don't mind a couple not working but the wasted time and cost makes it unacceptable. Maybe not seller's fault but I've never had a problem out of 1000's of Memorex discs until now so I guess you get what you pay for! Just hope the seller wasn't aware but doubt it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"READ REVIEWS!!!","review":"This product is a prime example of why you should always hop on Amazon and check reviews of products before even running to Walmart and buying something. I'm sitting here trying to burn some DVDs and a good half of these DVDs won't burn. I hopped on here to see if other people have the same problem with this product and sure enough. Look at the reviews. Now I have to do some research and pick up another brand to get the job done right.I knew to check reviews, but had the impression that Memorex was a good brand. Lesson learned that I thought I already knew."},{"rating":"1","title":"Many DVDs don't work","review":"Like other purchasers, I purchased these DVDs thinking that Memorex was a good brand; however, I quickly found that many of the DVDs are dead and will not allow data to be written onto them.

I do not recommend buying these."},{"rating":"1","title":"A once great product","review":"Memorex used to be a brand worth buying, but not now.

Recordings on my PC do not work with my DVR nor do my recordings on my DVR work with my PC, but that is the marketplace right now since all encoding is not standard or capatible. Standardization will eventually occur but this is not the DVD blank that is the problem but those that cause standardization to occur moving slowly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burns Ok, but will not read in set-top player.","review":"I was able to burn videos to these discs just fine. Don't let that fool you though. I was disgusted to find out that nearly all of them would not play correctly on my Sony set-top DVD player. Whenever they get to the end of the movie, the player skips back a few chapters or just quits all together. The problem seems to be at the outside of the disks because the shorter movies that I burned seemed to work ok (they don't use the whole disk). I could even look at the burnt disks under a bright light and see dark spots on the disks that I think is just poor manufacturing. I was able to read them again on my PC though and make another copy to a good disk so that was life saver. My suggestion, go with another company that actually has a quality assurance department."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid at all costs","review":"I thought Memorex was supposed to mean quality. These DVDs have totally exploded that notion. When I first started using these, the first half dozen spindles I bought worked great. However, the past few I have bought have been totally defective. I have bought from different stores, so I know it isn't just a case of me getting a \\"bad batch.\\" 1/2 to 2/3rds of the disks in any spindle are totally dead.

From the very begining it is brought to your attention how the male cops treat Trish. You are than introduced to the killer and his plot to terminate a family. The last thing Cain, the killer, expected was a cop to get between him and his plot. Greed, hate and revenge takes Cain and Sergeant Robinson down memory lane. Mr. Harper does a great job in letting you know what it going through Cain's and Robinson's mind. Some of the violence may be a little to strong for some girls, but if you enjoy reading about cops you will love this book. As a reader, I enjoy reading about girls 'saving the day' and this novel shows what Sergeant Robinson goes through to stop Cain. I don't feel anyone under 14 and maybe 15 years old should read this book. It has mature plot. Some sections may be a little to descriptive and violent."},{"rating":"1","title":"No insight","review":"This book is a collection of stories accompanied by a description of each one according to a set structure; backstory, present action, character,tone, dialogue, imagery and description, time management and design.

Yet, the 'Leatherette' (must be Chinese for micro-thin, leather colored, brittle plastic coating) case was damaged on the two top front corners of the case, and, one of the two, under sized, miniature hinges on the case was missing the hing pin. It wasn't even in the shipping box. The damaged corners were quite visible as I opened the package. This indicates to me that the damage was there before shipping. I use to enjoy playing tile rummy with my parents 20 years ago and I purchased this game to play with my grandchildren. I love the game but it's a d*@n shame we can't get the Chinese to use better material to make these games.Bruce Cooper"},{"rating":"2","title":"A VERY ENJOYABLE GAME!","review":"BECAUSE IT IS THE HIGHEST RATING AVAILABLE.

So when I saw the yellow and red tiles on the Rummikub in the picture, I thought it would be as advertised, but when I received the toy, it was the same red and orange-red as my friends' cheaper set.

The cotton fabric could be a bit thicker, but it's substantial enough to protect your clothes against splatters.

Johnny Mercer was one of the finest lyricists during the golden age of American popular song, and Marlene Ver Plank is one of the finest interpreters of those songs. The songs, from \\"I Remember You\\" (From a movie made before Pearl Harbor, but shown after, \\"The Fleet's In\\"), to \\"Early Autumn\\" (which in the instrumental version by Woody Herman's band made a star of his teen-age tenor sax soloist, Stan Getz), are all first rate. Ms. Ver Plank treats them with the respect they deserve, which is to say, the tempos and emotional tone of the performances are at one with the melodies and the sentiments of the lyrics.

After reading Elaine Pagels synopsis of the secret gospels unearthed at Nag Hammadi, I was Very dissappointed to read such far out un-useful stuff.If I am to understand, Gnostiscm is the path that each person has a direct relationship w/ the creator/divine/all that is. What I read was Panella's interpretation of the Bible. Nothing here to aid someone seeking to persue a spiritual path(never mind a direct relationship w/ a Higher Power) while in an earthly exsistance....I personally believe the secret truth will be revealed when we re-discover for ourselves the feminine face of God and how we as a species are sufferring for lack of it.

Krayzie, the second member of the former rap group to release a solo album, fails to convince the listener that he has a music career after Bone-Thugs and Harmony. Krayzie does not let his street credit slide in this album; giving Bone fans something to cheer about. However, Krayzie fails to realize what has made Bone Thugs and Harmony successful. Lyrics derived from the street with vocal harmonies and catchy choruses. Krayzie Bone continues with the image of the group but fails to accomplish what the group did. When Krayzie and Bone-Thugs and Harmony collaborate on certain tracks, the teamwork and harmonious vocals are tremendous, creating a tune, listeners enjoy.

Those feelings are probably universal.

I am sorry for those who may be offended, but this album has no energy. Each song has a very weak baseline and as a whole, made me cringe. It had very little creativity musically, and even the singer had no range -- her voice always sounded the same. Each song sounded vaguely like the last, and I found myself frustrated, skipping the tracks in a futile attempt to find some variety.I sampled Stereolab once -- and I said to myself, never again.

It simply does not move me in any significant way & that is the whole point of being a music fan in my opinion. Finding music that you can connect with & that can move you. Stereolab's earlier louder guitarier dronier songs work their magic on me but this just doesn't.It sounds really clean though, the production is top notch (I bet it would sound incredible on an audiophile's $100,000+ hi-fi system), and Miss Modular is a great track, but the rest doesn't really leave much of an impression even after many listens. But obviously looking at other reviews a lot of people do get it & find it amazing, so it must have something in there I just haven't found yet.

Two foolish young people making very bad, emotional life decisions is not the stuff of ennoblement. The mere fact that they both survived to live to old age is the astounding part, and that their son became a famous singer is a further fluke of nature.

As he became bigger and needed larger amounts of formula at a time these bottles became a problem. They are advertised to hold 8oz. however that is only if you use liquid and still then you must fill them to the rim.

When I'm on-the-go with my son, I fill the liner with the required amount of water (6 ounces is what he eats now), then when he's ready to eat, I pour in 3 scoops of powdered formula, which fills the liner to the top. So how in the world are these 8 ounce bottles?? I could see if you premix the formula in a pitcher or use concentrated formula, but you cannot make an 8 ounce bottle with powered formula. Even if you carry an extra container with you with 8 oz of water in it, then mix in the 4 scoops of formula, it will not fit in the bottle after it's mixed.

My son hated the nipples (every baby is diffrent) I wish I would have jsut went with the good ol'fashion Gerber ones from the start. They did just fine, cheap and my son never really had problem with gas pain. Don't go crazy buying them if you have never used them before. buy this set to see if you like them before you register for a mess of them like i did. I ended up selling them on ebay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only one good feature","review":"These bottles are great as far as not having to clean them all the time because of the liners, but that is about the only pro I found. When you are trying to squeeze the air out (which takes what seems like forever when you have a screaming baby anyway), sometimes they bust and you have to start all over...not to mention a waste of expensive formula or breastmilk. Second, once your baby is down to a couple of ounces left in the bottle, it is impossible to reach your fingers up in there to get any air out. Third, there is no way to heat these bottles in the car. I have a Munchkin car bottle warmer but it doesn't work on these bottles because of the liners. The milk does not actually touch the bottle so there is no way to heat it. Not very convenient for long or short road trips. I switched to AVENT and my baby is like a different baby. I didn't realize that he was unhappy with these bottles until I changed, but I see a big difference now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doing it again!","review":"We used this system with our first child 5 years ago and are planning to use it again. It was a lifesaver! My son didn't like the standard bottles and nipples and also had a case of reflux. He took right to this system and it also cut down on his reflux. The only complaint I had is that he didn't like standard nipples and we had to buy orthopedic nipples which were a little more than the rest and bit hard to find but I think it was worth it to make feeding more enjoyable for him. So all things considered, it is worth the price if you have a picky eater."},{"rating":"2","title":"premium nurser","review":"These bottles are great. We love them and so does our baby.

For the first few weeks I had to pump and then give Max a bottle until he could learn how it all worked. I bought these bottles as a cheaper alternative to the Avent bottles recomended by my lactation consultant. Trying to push and keep the air out is rediculous. You spend too much time doing this and your child will be hysterical. He still is unable to completely drain the bottle and his suck is back on track according to the pediatrician. If you are feeding your child breast milk... aka liquid gold... you don't want to waste one drop. My son did not like the nipples at all... they are suppose to be designed to be the most like breast... I've checked with friends and we know no one with nipples like these.

Basically it's just a gift set that comes with a little of everything you will need: 4 oz bottles, 8 oz bottles for later, nipples and drop-ins. This one comes with the pump adapter too, which mine didn't back in 2003, which I'm sure is really nice too. Anyone who has used a pump would probably agree.We also tried all the regular bottles: Dr. Brown's (hello? who wants to be cleaning a tube at 3 a.m.?)

After reading the reviews for these I bought them, and am I ever glad I did. After one feeding, our son's stomach discomfort was all but gone, and we had a smiling baby. Of all the bottles we have used, It is the closest thing to breastfeeding I have used. He gets hardly any gas, and does not spit up at all anymore. With the Avent bottles, he sounded like he was sucking in tons of air, and they leaked horribly. This resulted in loud feedings, loud burps and lots of uncomfortable gas.

We went to buy medium flow nipples, and Playtex's medium flow nipples are the wrong shape/texture! For some reason, Playtex doesn't make medium flow nipples in the same shape as their silicone. My son was gulping air, which caused excessive gas/spitting up. He couldn't figure out the new nipple. I did like the drop-in liners, but when I ran out of the ones I received at my shower, I found them to be too expensive. It's twice as much for the drop-in kind than the regular flat ones. And the flat ones are impossible to put in the bottle while holding baby. I also found them to occasionally \\"split\\" when attaching, also hard to figure out how much to fill. Do you follow the ounces on bottle or liner?? So in the end, mostly because of nipple issues, I switched to Avent and haven't had any problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but not as great as people say","review":"I bought these bottles because of convinence. My friend had told me how she loved these kind of bottles. At first they were okay, but I have had trouble with the drop in liners coming loose while feeding my daughter, getting her soaked in formula. Also they are hard to measure because the liner draws in as they suck and if you burp the bottle you can not tell without having to open and shake the bottle around. The liners gets rather expensive, it would be worth the money if they weren't so aggravating."},{"rating":"2","title":"best bottle","review":"I tried 3 different bottles before trying this one. I wish I tried this one first. I heard such great things about the Advent bottles but my son did not like it. He took to this bottle right away. I was so happy to find a bottle he liked. The bottle is easy to use and easy to clean. I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"you never are done paying for them.....","review":"We received this starter set, plus a bunch of extra 4 ounce bottles. We love them but I'm tired of buying refill dropins. I wish I would have registered for the gerber bottles. I still stick these bottles in the dishwasher anyway so I would not need disposable liners if I had selected real bottles.I took the fast flow nippes back. Our son still likes the slow flow (5 months old)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes Breastfeeding Easy","review":"I have been pumping and storing my breast milk for my daughter for several months. When it was time for her to take the bottle, she took it was ease. It is also very convenient to store, freeze and feed her with the bottles and liners.It is the only bottles I use!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but Naturalatch is better","review":"My breastfed baby wouldn't take other nipples and didn't event blink at the Playtex system...however, I first bought a Premium Nurser with the new \\"Naturalatch\\" system. When I went out to get more bottles, I bought a bunch of the Premium Nurser bottles, thinking they were all the same - wrong! The be careful which ones your buying, they are different.The normal Premium Nurser nipples work fine, but the Naturalatch has a textured, slightly different shaped nipple that helped my baby center the nipple more in his mouth. He also slurped much more with the standard nipple. I would recommend holding out for the Naturalatch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for a nursing baby","review":"My son started taking a bottle once a day in addition to his regular breast feeding at 3 weeks old. He took this bottle like a charm and continues to not have any issues. Sure he gets gas and spits up sometimes...but he does this when he breast feeds too. The breast pump adapter is a nice option, but there's not enough rings etc. in this kit to really be useful. To get more you can call Playtex and they'll send you some and they have a kit you can buy with more. It's cheaper and easier to just get milk storage bags though!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated them and so did my baby","review":"I thought these bottles were going to be great. They were a pain. You're supposed to squeeze the air out of them so the baby will have less gas. It is very hard to get your hand in the end of the bottle to do that, and once the air is finally out it comes rushing back in once you let go. My baby was the worst at spitting up, she would bring the whole bottle back up. I finally found the MAM Ultivent bottle (they're only found on www.babywise.com --a great site!) It is terrific, and so easy to clean. It totally comes apart. And it really works, after 9 months of constantly wearing a huge bib, we got the MAM bottles and you can finally see her outfits!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly doesn't compare to the original","review":"Why playtex would mess with something that worked perfectly fine for years, I have no idea. I used the original latex nipples & 'pull-tab' bags 20 years ago when my children were babies. They never had a problem going from breast to the 'old' type Platex nipples & tab-bags. But I guess some techno-wizard thought it best to 're-invent' them. These new 'drop-in' bags, combined with the silicone nipples (now in a staggering variety of 'flow-rates'), are the WORST!! I recommended the Playtex nursers to my daughter when she asked me about the best bottle for when she weaned her daughter. How upset was I when they turned out so bad. The amount of air that leaks in & goes to the baby is awful - worse than the regular ole' plastic ones from 50 years ago. I could actually hear baby sucking in the air & bubbles gurgling in her belly. I returned all the 'drop-ins' & bought the tab-bags & old standby latex nipples. Much, Much better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"leaky","review":"I bought this bottles cuz it was pretty and looked convenient. However, the bottle leaks at the rim. It was impossible to push the air out until the nipple squirted few drops of formula without leaking and when I finally removed all the air out untill the nipple squirted few drops of formula, the air weent back in the liner. I followed the instructions and it still failed. Maybe there was a defect on my bottle...I tried using Avent disposable bottle with playtex liners and worked beautifully."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ideal for a breastfeeding mom","review":"I adore this system. My son only gets breastmilk, and the system works great for bottling/storing/serving breastmilk. In conjunction with the breast milk storage kit, I am able to express milk directly into a bottle. I then twist on a lid and put it in the freezer or fridge. When the milk freezes solid, I am able to remove the liner and lid from the bottle. This takes less freezer space and means I don't have to buy that many actual bottles.I will have to keep buying liners, of course. But the cost isn't prohibitive. And I did have to buy several storage systems, but compared to paying for formula, I find this cost unimportant. Particularly because I will be able to use the system again for our next child.It is a tidy, easy system that works great for me and for my son. He has no problem taking the silicone nipple in spite of the fact that he prefers the breast. He IS slower about taking the bottle, but he takes it fine nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timesaver for pumping moms!","review":"I decided to switch to Playtex Premium for my 2nd baby(I used regular playtex last time) because I liked the clear silicone nipples that are closer to the breast shape. Little did I know how AWESOME this kit would be!! The most impressive part to me was the breast pump adapter - I can pump directly into the bottle liner with or without the bottle!! I gave the kit 4 stars because it only comes with one breast pump adapter. I haven't found where I could buy just the adapter, so I'll be buying another kit since I have a double pump. My baby latched right on to the nipple and her mouth looks just like it does when she is nursing - very pleasing to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fragile","review":"I didn't even get to see how well this bottle stood up to the bottle tests I've designed (I don't want to have to deal with leaks, etc.) because I dropped it and it broke. The plastic is hard, but thinner than the standard Playtex disposible nurser.I went and bought another one, so I could hopefully run it through my little test before the little one arrives. It performed as well as the standard Playtex disposible nurser.This many not to be the bottle for traveling or when baby is self-mobile, but when they are small and Mommy & Daddy have to feed them, they are great.Also, all parts can be used on other Playtex disposible bottles. SAVING YOU $$$ :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Liners","review":"This is in response to the customer who suggested to buy the 8 oz bottles.

It's vaguely fun reading about life in rural southern Spain, but these characters are too cliched and situations too contrived to make this delicious travel writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty much a lemon","review":"Am I the only person that was bored to tears by Driving over Lemons? I found this to be a mind-numbing yawn in which sheep-shearer Stewart uproots his family to southern Spain, fixes up his wreck of a farm (irrigation problems, etc.), meets his not particularly interesting neighbors and struggles to adapt to the local ways. Sound familiar? Well Peter Mayle started the trend and is still the gold standard... and Chris Stewart just can't measure up to Mayle in terms of wit, charm or humour. Sure the writing style has the sort of easy flow that one would expect and the fact that Stewart is there for the long haul- striving to re-establish himself as a sheep shearer- represents a new twist and seems to appeal to people (the glowing reviews on Amazon led me to buy this in the first place). But reading Driving over Lemons made me realize that not every move to southern Europe deserves a book or an audience. Strictly for fans of the \\"expat-lifestyle\\" genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another gem","review":"Read every one of Chris Stewart books and will continue to read as long as he keeps on writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really quite boring","review":"I read this book about 1 year after i visited the same town that is depicted in this book. I stayed in a small house outside of town with a lemon orchard and olive trees that had been bought and was in the process of being fixed up by an English couple. So, i was excited when i saw this book. I expected to read wonderful descriptions of the surrounding mountains and the town... unfortunately, the couple in the story have such uninteresting observations about their surroundings, it made the entire book quite bland. I wish i hadn't read it, so that my own vibrant memories of that place could have remained untainted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up to all the hype","review":"The rave reviews this book received made me expect a much more humourous and interesting story. The author and his wife were like strangers..both to each other and to the reader..no emotion or warmth exhuded from the pages. The many locals they came into contact with were well depicted but the author gave you no insight into how they might have impacted his life and times...they all seemed to be stand-a-lone characters. In contrast, Tony Hawks' \\"playing football with the Moldovans\\" and \\"around Ireland with a fridge\\" made both the countries and the characters come alive."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that great...","review":"I must say that I wasn't intrigued by this story, but it came recommended by a friend. I didn't think I would even finish it, but kept reading in the hopes that there would be an interesting twist or good climax. There wasn't. The author seemed likable and was at times witty, his characters were real, hard-working people, and I related well to his wife. It just wasn't that great of a read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Provence or Tuscany either","review":"I opened this book with great anticipation because of my previous happy trips to Provence with Peter Mayle and Tuscany with Frances Mayes. Though Stewart's reporting of his experience as an ex-pat living on a rustic farm in Spain is serviceable and may be useful to someone planning a comparable adventure, the book never achieves the transporting quality of the best of this genre. When I closed it (half-way through), I missed enjoying that delicious sense of having made a trip to a new place without leaving my own armchair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, knobs are poor.","review":"I hope that with this controller I will easily use garageband in the gig.But the package came to me in this morning and i played the 'First' song of my garaband file excitedly, then one of the knobs was taken off.

Great cast, good directing, detailed costumes, and awesome effects make it one of the better war thrillers.

This movie does a magnificent job of drawing us into the plot and the people that tried to bring about his downfall. The successes and failures will surprise you.

The movie is based on one of the most well known plots to assassinate Adolf Hitler near the close of WWII in Europe. The movie successfully argues that not all Germans were content to allow the Nazi party to continue their crimes against humanity. Given the subject of the movie and the suspenseful pacing it is not relaxing or overly re-watchable, but at the sale price it is well worth adding to your movie collection.Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting...","review":"I didn't know that Hitler had so many atempts on his life.

It never takes off, and has a very slow pace. Cruise plays the lead as Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, famous for trying to assassinate Hitler and bring WWII to a quick end. However hard Cruise tries, he just does not grab the viewer as the character. It is Tom Cruise dressed up in period costumes and just saying his lines. The scenes look authentic but Cruise does not.\\"Valkyrie\\" is the name of Hitler's strategic emergency plan that a group of high ranking Germans use as part of their plot to assassinate the evil dictator and take over the Nazi government from inside. The future of the world is at stake, and so is Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg's wife and children.It is based on a true story, but there does not seem to be enough material for a full-length movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be sure Fuhrer is dead first!","review":"Says it is a movie based on a true event. Okay well we all know that Hitler did not die before the bunker death with Eva. Not going to do an extensive review about Tom Cruise and all that stuff all the positive reveiwers wrote about. I paid $1.70 for this DVD (used).\\"Be sure the Fuhrer is dead before you overthrow the Nazis!\\" Just did not happen,think somebody needed to see the dead Hitler before all this garbage to take over Germany started to unfold.Not the best Hitler movie I have watched.

But, incredibly, it was flat, flat, flat as a story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Educational, Well-done, Sad","review":"This is a great depiction of Operation Valkyrie. It shows that there were many Germans opposed to Hitler's rule of their country. Some of those people were even willing to sacrifice all to overthrow the tyrant. It really makes one think how different things would have been if one of these attempts had been successful.The movie itself is compelling. I struggled to follow some of the flow, so I had to drop everything to watch the movie (I usually watch movies in the background). My daughter was introduced to this film in her German class, so she really wanted to see it. We are glad that we watched it with her, because it has led to several discussions about leaders and tyranny.We watched this on Amazon streaming.

Cruise is great as usual as the hero in this heroic tale of treason. All the actors in this movie are first rate, especially the simpering Wilkerson. Maybe it was because I knew how this movie would end that I found it so hard to watch, I kept getting up and leaving the room, it's tragic beyond belief the true ending of this movie. When you think of all the lives that could have been spared had it ended differently. This is a very sobering movie and not for the faint at heart.

I decided to rent the movie on Amazon and it was worth the money. After you get past the early parts of the movie you completely forget about Tom Cruise and his American accent. When they set the bomb off to kill Hitler you really start to move to the edge of your seat and the movie has a great supporting cast of actors. You don't realize how close they came to actually assassinating Hitler until you watch this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice","review":"This was a nice little thriller. It was a surprise considering how the critics lambasted it. I thought it was a good story and a great period piece. Tremendous acting all the way around including Tom Cruise who comes under unnecessary fire for his acting skills. The two things against the movie is that everyone knows the ending and everyone in the film uses different accents. I don't mind that German is not spoken by the actors, but I wish they had at least all settled on one accent to use. For me it was a bit distracting and took me a little out of the movie at parts.

A historical movie should be historically accurate and \\"Valkyrie\\" does a very good job of presenting and not altering the facts and great credit is deserved for that.Besides being truthful, the event should be historically significant and be entertaining and \\"Valkyrie\\" again scores here. Most of the cast is very good in their roles and Tom Cruise is in it also - he's actuallyfairly decent here.

They hatch a daring plan to set off explosives during a briefing. The main man in all of this is Col. Stauffenberg, played ably by Tom Cruise.

This?

I also found myself lost as to why the Nazi's had various accents from across the world, but none sounded like they were German...AND, the writing on certain forms (not all forms) was German, yet nobody spoke German.Plus, everybody already knew (if they paid attention in history class) that Hitler committed suicide. So why waste your time watching a film about something that you know is not going to work in the first place, only to pull for a Nazi posing as a good guy, and all under a family friendly rating?Need I say more?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Historically Accurate and Highly Entertaining","review":"Valkyrie is a depiction of the well known 20 July 1944 plot to assassinate Adolph Hitler.Although I am not normally too impressed with Tom Cruise, he gives a stellar performance in his depiction of Col. Claus von Stauffenberg, who was one of the ringleaders of the attempted coup.As those who are familiar with WWII history know, this was the last of several attempted assassination attempts against the German dictator. It was spearheaded by von Stauffenberg and other German officers who wanted to find a way for Germany to survive the Hitler insanity and be able to negotiate a reasonable peace with the Allies. Although many films purporting to be historical are not, this one is actually very true to the events in question.As we all know, the plot ultimately failed.

The film was criticized for a lack of German accents and for Tom Cruise's involvement. I understand that the German accents may have lent some authenticity to the film, but it was the artistic decision of the director not to use them. Valkyrie is a very good movie, and is undeserving of much of the negativity it has received. It is a well paced film filled with some excellent actors. The story is well told and stays true to the historical events. The video quality of the Bluray is excellent. I was surprised by the aspect ratio, as the picture filled my entire widescreen tv with no black bars! The audio is excellent. The documentary on Hitler and Germany is an awesome bonus feature, and is almost 2 hours long. Overall, a very good disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent historical film","review":"When I preordered this film I was a little worried that it would be done as an action thriller with limited attention to history and lack of intelligence in the plot as unfortunately it is the case in many recent movies that try to depict historical events. But now, after having watched the movie I must say that it is one of the best films of this year. Tom Cruise did an excellent job. The plot follows the actual history of the events very closely. Valkyrie will disappoint those who seen cheap action thrills, but anyone who is interested in a serious, acurate and yet creative depiction of such an important historical event will not be disappointed with this film"},{"rating":"2","title":"retells a complex story in riveting fashion","review":"This was a really good retelling of the failed assination attempt on Hitler. As complicated as the plot of the men involved was, the movie made it pretty easy to follow along and moved at a brisk pace. The suspense and build-up work very well , especially considering you see very little war action. Tom Cruise did very well playing the defiant Colonel although hearing him voice the lines in English was a bit weird at first, but short of learning German on the spot and using subtitles, not unexpected. I enjoyed this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agonizing","review":"Good grief. So here we have it, once more it is the Bush administration's fault.

This album is simply HOT!!People must buy this CD !"},{"rating":"2","title":"My oh My has Mya Improved and Matured","review":"Mya has truly matured and definitely aimed to do better than the first and second album. With singing, she had the chance the write, produce, and executive produce on the album.Songs like \\"Take A Picture\\", which Pink had the chance to co-write, showcases Mya's versatility, along with \\"Things Come And Go\\" with Sean Paul. Other highlight tracks include a very emotional \\"After The Rain\\" and \\"Free Fallin\\". The bounce track off the album is \\"Step\\"\\", which basically commands all man takers and do just that when it comes to her man and the very catchy \\"My Love Is Like Woo\\", both Missy Elliott had a chance to write and produce on. The more eccentric of tracks on the album is the bonus track \\"Real Compared To What\\" with Common. It's jazzy, groovy, and funky. It's a really great song.Embrace Mya's growth as a female entertainer. Lay back after a very stressful day, take a breath, turn your stereo system on, and connect with Mya's Moodring (Haters Not Included)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mya Harrison is a true diva.

Ok let's be honest but out of the U.S Mya, Lil'Kim and Pink were not famous or even heard of. The song gave them the opportunity of their lives. So after the impact of Lady marmelade I bought Mya's \\"Fear of flying\\" cd because I found her good. The cd was good but nothing more than \\"good\\".So when \\"Moodring\\" came out I bought it and let me say that as soon as I heard the first song I found it very good, the whole cd is fantastic. It has great rythms, Mya's voice is also very good and the lyrics are strong and direct.Some other good songs are: \\"Fallen\\", \\"Hurry up\\", \\"You\\" and \\"Free falling\\".Mya took a long time to come back but it was worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't judge a book by it's cover!!","review":"I have to admit, when I saw the album cover for \\"Moodring\\" it got my attention, and I really wanted to hear it because if it looks good, it must sound good, right? Wrong! Thank God I heard it in a friend's car before I bought this crap! I saved $11 to spend on something else!

Once we like them, we buy the rest of the CD. But the rest of the CD is GARBAGE. Her singles SALVAGE a worthless CD.Vocally Mya isn't impressive anyway, but this is insane. True fans of Mya will appreciate her computerized crooning, but people who prefer real vocal skills will not enjoy this CD. Don't get me wrong, Mya is beautiful, but this CD is a letdown from the pretty good (considering it's Mya) Fear of Flying. Buy the singles, skip the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mya's New CD is like .... ewwww","review":"Well, her love may be like ... wo, but her new album, Moodring, is like ... ewwww.

But this album is a stinker."},{"rating":"1","title":"well the title of the album is nice","review":"As biracial mami myself I always liked that Mya was a little different. But I've never been that into her music. I decided to listen to this cd to find a track for one of my webpages and thank goodness I never bought this! I listened to every track and even a remix of hurry up with fabolous and even he couldn't save this album. I think she recieved a lot of great reviews because she has no problem pushing sexual boundaries both in the media and in her music.I kinda see why this album didn't get a lot of attention.

Waste of money people. Go and buy something worth it like Joss Stone's Soul Sessions. Now that girl has talent. Anyways, i'm not trying to diss Mya fans or anything or Mya herself but sometime's u gotta wonder. Mya's had some good songs in the past but i don't see her making any progress with this album.

I like how Mya had independent girl songs. Now, eveything seems to be very sexual and not have much point. She is still WAY more talented than Beyonce...but this CD was disappointing.

All I can say is that I am glad I bought this CD used for less than 5 dollars. There was only 2 songs that were worth listening to: My Love is Like Wo and Fallen. And I am sorry I refuse to pay 17 bucks for an album with 2 decent songs. And the musicians have a nerve to be angry because we download albums and buy bootleg. When they start making alubms that are worthy of 17 bucks then I will start paying full price. Mya has a decent voice at best and frankly needs to get beyond that teeny-boper sound. She is beyond 21 and frankly her music just hasn't matured. I like her first song My Love is Like Wo, bascially because the beat is unique. But the lyrics frankly aren't noteworthy.

Although she has not been in the music scene for a while since her 2nd \\"Fear of Flying\\" album, with her new 3rd \\"Moodring\\" album, Mya's style is sophisticated, and it is obvious that she has grown immensely in many aspects. Her music exudes confidence, positivity, sassiness, and definetely shows fans all of her \\"moods\\". In these songs, Mya's voice is delicate, yet honey like, while maintaining a sense of R & B. I highly recommend this album! My favorite song is \\"Things Come and Go\\", which features Sean Paul!

This cd is much much better. I am actually proud that her voice has matured and her lyrics are more realistic. The beats are really good. I refused to buy Mya's cds for years due to her high pitched voice and teeny bop image/lyrics. However, she is more pleasing to listen to now. Her best songs are Step, No Sleep Tonight, Hurry Up, and Fallen. Hopefully, in the years to come she will become even better. She should continue to write about what most women have thought, felt and/or gone through. And yes, some of us women have actually freaked when they were \\"late\\".

I like the entire cd, there is not one track that I dislike. My favorites are Like Woa, Anatomy 10n1, After the rain, (which sounds like a song in memory of Aaliyah) & more. Mya is definetly a sophisticated lady (track 5) & she is keeping it real & doing her thing.

It is not as good as \\"Play\\" but there are 4 tracks that are worth the price of this disc: \\"Novio\\" is haunting, \\"James Bond Theme\\" is a brilliant and witty rethinking of 007 music, \\"New Dawn Fades\\" from the movie \\"Heat\\" captures that film's hard edges perfectly while \\"God Moving Over The Face Of The Waters\\" (also from \\"Heat\\") is elegant dreamy and beautiful.

In fact, they appeared to prefer the catfish food a bit more.Their favorite was to suck blood worm out of their hiding. Since my pond is not filtered, it has plenty of that. If that still wasn't enough, they would dig around for vegetables. They would jump on the goldfish flakes if I offer it to them, but if they are still hungry, they would eat these pellets.So, my guess is it's all relative.

However, I really blame the editor for the mess. He or she seems to have run out of steam after about 100 pages and left the author to founder on his own.

Im givin it about 4.5/5 since it falls barely below 5. A lot of the tracks on here got really good production. The types of beats that Busta can rip on any day. Lyrically, Busta Rhymes does a straight job. Some songs on here are decent, but skippable also. Alot of the tracks are worth the whole listen.

It just says \\"Adhesive Pads\\" with no part number and the disks aren't visible through the packaging because they're sandwiched between the front and back cardboard packaging inside the sealed plastic outer packaging.When I opened up the first shipment it was a three pack of the permanent disks (there's a penny-sized hole in the middle of the pad, the temporary pads are solid).I had to do an RMA and pay for the return envelope.The replacement shipment was the same, incorrect, permanent disks.Why is this so difficult to get right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garmin swivel base mount","review":"I needed an additional hard plastic dash mount like the one that came with my Garmin GPS.

I had absolutely LOVED reading these three books and was looking forward to re-visiting them through the audio version. Unfortunately, the reader (Fiacre Douglas) ruined them for me. Not only does he read them incredibly fast...(so fast that you miss a lot of the dry humor in the dialogue), but he doesn't even try to change his voice for the different characters. If you haven't read these books, please do. They are wonderful. I would not recommend the audio version though.

Graceffo's style is raw and unique; he's able to tell the story of his time in the temple in a funny, blunt way.

A Must!","review":"Many singers have recorded Michel Legrand's songbook and nearly all with Michel Legrand's arrangements. You could say Mr. Legrand is tres creative to make things sound different but sometimes these covers really sound bureaucratic!However, Sarah Vaughan is the difference here. And it seems Mr. Legrand perceived it so that his arrangements flew to specially imaginative space. A wonderful trip with Ms. Vaughan in total command of emotion combined with master technique.Program opens with 'The Summer Knows' and Legrand wrote that he had never seen musicians cry right after recording. I tell you I also did when I first listened to it.This CD repertoire covers all material recorded by Vaughan & Legrand what includes a sensational rendition of 'Wave'(Antonio Carlos Jobim).So, basic repertoire is obvious Legrand material. Were you to choose one among the so-many obvious Legrand songbooks by singers, this is the one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sarah & Legrand","review":"If you are looking for those rare and brilliant moments in Music, this certainly is one of those moments.

Of course, you know that Stills, and Young went on to comprise 1/2 of Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young. But did you know that Richie Furay went on to form the fine country rock group POCO, or that Jim Messina is the Jim Messina from Loggins and Messina? Man this group was loaded and could craft great POP songs. If only they had stayed together.... In fact on Neil's latest album \\"Silver and Gold\\" he wrote a song called Buffal Springfield Again. He certainly sounds like he would like to get the boys back together for another musical romp!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buffalo Springfield - self-titled (Atco)","review":"Originally saw the blessed light of day in 1967, some oldie fans may not realize that Buffalo Springfield actual had several full length albums out. Can't believe these guys had JUST one hit. Anyway,this twelve track self-titled CD reissue has several should - have / could - have - been hits as far as I'm concerned. Cuts like \\"Go And Say Goodbye\\", the Beatles - like \\"Sit Down I Think I Love You\\", \\"Everybody's Wrong\\", \\"Burned\\", the jamming bluesy \\"Leave\\" and \\"Pay The Price\\" (with it's catchy riffs) along with their sole hit \\"For What It's Worth\\" all make this disc a keeper.

I admire her talent and creativity.I'm an independent video producer/director and have been writing for radio and television for 25-years.

In \\"The Successful Writer's Guide to Publishing Magazine Articles\\" she has presented good practical information in a clear, concise and entertaining manner, much like she does in the classroom. Shaw has a unique ability in that she is able to pass on good information while, at the same time, build confidence in the reader. Her methods are tried and true, and her information makes good common sense. This book is good reading for novices and professionals alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"By the fourth chapter, I was published and paid!","review":"This is a love letter to the author. My highlighter is on overload with this book. I stopped to \\"bubble\\" and out popped an article along the lines of Reminiscence Magazine about my mother-in-law's recipe box. Another one on weddings from the minister's point of view, maybe for Bride. Anyway, I wanted to tell you that I got a check in the mail for an article I submitted, and the only reason I dared to submit it was because of you. You challenged me, encouraged me, and I did it. I am now a PAID, published author! This is a dream come true. I want you to know that you make a difference in the lives you touch. Anyone even thinking of writing will feel the same after reading this book. Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"inspiring despite poor organization and sloppy writing","review":"I never return books. But after reading the first two chapters of The Successful Writer's Guide to Publishing Magazine Articles, I dug the packaging box back out of the recycling bin. After skimming through the rest of the book, I was rummaging through the trash for the packing slip. The writer may have good advice but I just couldn't get past the dull, flat writing and the disorganized content to find it. As another reviewer commented, it's inspiring to know that if the author of this book could get published, there's hope for the rest of us. Disappointing to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't take advice on writing from someone who can't write","review":"Even after reading previous reviews about the sloppiness of this book, I purchased it anyway because the reviewers found the content very helpful. But when I opened the book, I couldn't get past page 10-- no matter what gems of wisdom lay within, the mass of typos and incoherence make it impossible to justify finding those gems. The fact alone that Dr. Shaw has managed to sell thousands of articles convinces me that I can break into this field. The reviews at the front of the book laud her enthusiastic teaching style, which she may very well have in person, but on the page she just stinks. Even her examples of \\"queries that sold\\" contained weak and redundant sentences, such as \\"Please consider this topic, and thank you for your consideration.\\" Wha? There are so many books on this topic, I recommend skipping this one. Any good advice is probably found elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS NOT A CONCERT!","review":"The reviewer who commented that this is a great concert is mistaking this with a video release of 'Delicate Sound Of Thunder'.This DVD is a documentary and probably not worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patera is Awsome","review":"Pantera's album Cowboys From Hell is the best of one of the best Pantera ever.

It contians what remain to this day as three of my favorite Pantera songs: the title track (great riff!), Cemetery Gates (their best ever \\"epic\\"), and Heresy, a song that the band has unfortunately somehwhat ignored in concert. Psycho Holiday is a good song also. Indeed, the only one I don't like on here is Primal Concrete Sledge there's just not enough to it. Every other song is good. Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"of course it's 5 stars, that's what it deserves","review":"this cd is strange. high pitched vocals at least somewhere in half of the songs and they can get annoying in songs like shattered and the one after it. but those 2 songs have good instrumentation. primal concrete sledge isn't the greatest song in the world, but i love it cause the second half kicks ***. the cover's funny cause vinnie's holding what's prolly a sandwich and rex has a gun or something. worst thing about this album is their tight pants they're wearing on the cover. this album still rules tho. get it! now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BIRTH OF COWBOY METAL!!!","review":"Believe it or not, Pantara was a hair band and released metal magic, projects in the jungle, in the night, and power metal before CFH. However, they conveniently slipped them under the carpet at the release date of CFH. This album kicks major arse, nonetheless. Songs that stood out were \\"Shattered\\", Cowboys from hell\\", \\"the sleep\\", and \\"psycho holiday\\". All the songs were great, though. (Reinventing the steel is heavier, harder, thrashier, and more kicka** if that's what you want.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Pantera Album of all time....","review":"This album is as good as it gets I've been a Pantera fan for a while now... and man was I blown away.The two best songs are Cowboy's From Hell and Cemetery Gates.

Slipknot,Soulfly and Linkin Park SUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yep, it's a dud pressing.","review":"Like many others have said, Cowboys From Hell has some skipping issues. My copy skips horrendously during Medicine Man. What a let down. I definitely expected more for $24."},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredible display of talent for all music fans.","review":"This CD is incredible. It was the first Pantera album I purchased and was a real treat. When I bought it I was a big Metallica fan so I thought I'd give Pantera a try. I loved the CD so much I went back the next day and bought all the Pantera albums I could find. The moods and heaviness shift frequently and efectivelly. Pantera is an incredible band with many incredible albums, among them: Cowboys From Hell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their best album","review":"I have noticed that it has become popular for underground metal listeners to hate this band. This album however contains little to no tough guy routines that some of the later ones would rely on more often. Instead you get treated to a polished yet aggressive metal album. The guitars and vocals are stretched more here then on the following releases. For all intensive purposes, the classic heavy metal sound is all here. There is a couple duds (Primal Concrete Sludge, Message In Blood) but the rest is consistently good. I have also noticed it has become popular to hate any band that injects a bit of groove into their sound. If you aren't one of those overly picky nerds that thinks Black Metal is the only legitimate form of metal, then you might find much to enjoy here."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE COWBOYS BEST RIDE","review":"If you like Pantera,you have this, if not you need to listen just once, and i guarantee once will not be enough.Kicking off the album, Cowboy's From Hell will show you exactly what Pantera's all about.

Dimebag Darrell smokes on the guitar. His solos are ferocious, yet they have some melodic restraint. Anselmo even does some singing instead of screaming only. Strong songs include Cemetary Gates, Shattered, Message in Blood, and The Sleep. Vulgar Display of Power is also awesome. Never cared for anything after that. Buy this album, it is worth having."},{"rating":"2","title":"hell yeah","review":"though this album isnt a super cd , but pantera has so much damn energy, that alone makes this a good album that i really got into."},{"rating":"2","title":"The start of the band slowly getting angry!","review":"If you are a Pantera fan this is a must. On this album you can hear them really giving us a great Thrash Album. Phil really could hit some high notes. Dime show's off some of his best solo's. Rex kick's it in this one. Vinnie show's that he's one of the best drummers in the metal scene. Cemetary Gates is probly one of the best Balled's ever made. This is a real must for pantera fan's so buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good setup for their next albums","review":"Cowboys from Hell introduced Pantera to metal fans everywhere. It is, without question, an excellent album. However, it is not as strong as any of the albums that came after it. Heres why: 1) Phil's vocals often decline into that 'screeching', reminiscent of Metallica's 'Kill Em All'. 2) While the songs are fast and heavy, they lack the raw power of the later albums. Again I compare this to Kill Em All vs Master of Puppets or Justice. 3) The songs just don't stick in my head like the ones off Vulgar Display of Power or Great Southern Trendkill. Overall, this is definitely a worthwhile purchase, but if this will be your first Pantera purchase I recommend getting Vulgar Display of Power first. Though really, you should just get them all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Early 90s","review":"This album sees Pantera update from their 80s hair metal into a more tight metal outfit. Singer Phil looks Amish. Pantera is a Christian band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great 90s Thrash","review":"This is more \\"groove\\" but there is enough thrash metal in here. Pantera is one of the greatest metal bands in the 1990s and one of the most well known in rock . these guys really can rock hard!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Debut Album","review":"The band obviously didn't find there own, unique sound until \\"Vulgar Display...\\", but Pantera's debut album is still great. Between the crucnchy guitar riifs and Phillip Anselmo's screams, the band sounds very similiar to early Metallica. The title track opens with one of the best riffs the band has ever had. It is very similiar to classic Metallica, but it's still awsome. Still, the true excellence on this album comes with the track 'Cemetary Gates'. It remains one of Pantera's best songs of their entire career. It's not just a traditional metal song like most of the tracks on this album. It also has one of Dimebag's finest solos. His complex playing is displayed wondefully in that song. As a whole, this album isn't as great as Pantera's later albums, but it is essential for any fan of the band, or anyone who likes solid heavy metal. If you want Pantera's best, check out \\"Vulgar Display Of Power\\" and \\"Far Beyond Driven\\". Still, you won't be dissapointed with this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad mastering...","review":"I love this album.This new mastering is BAD.The high range boosted & the compression took away the snare and bass drum.AVOID."},{"rating":"2","title":"Damn good heavy metal from the South's most VULGAR cowboys","review":"Screw the other reviewer for ragging on Pantera. They are the premier metal band of the 90's. They are very original and are ANTI -Numetal. That reviewer is a yankee pig. Anyway on to the albulm. This album incorporates fine elements of thrash with great vocals from Phil. Dimebag is in my opinion the greatest metal guitarist of all time. Much better than Hammnet who kinda sold out and went more mainstream with his grinding following the Black album. The best songs on this cd are \\"Cowboys from Hell\\", Physco Holiday, the epic \\"Cemetary Gates\\", Message in Blood\\", and the heaviest song on the cd \\"Domination\\". On this album phil's lyrics are'nt as heavy as on Pantera's latter efforts but one can feel the transition into heavier music throughout the disc. Check out Pantera's other four studio albums and become stronger than all. R.I.P. Dime"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pantera fan in Michigan","review":"Sending love and healing to the Pantera family.

I highly recommend this to fans of metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first Pantera album worth owning","review":"Pantera had made a couple of albums prior to this, but they were mostly in the glam vein and not very good to boot. But somewhere along the line, the lineup came up with a much harder, more pure metal sound and ditched the Motley Crue look for a new feel, which emerged on this album. There is nary a bad track on the disc, and along with their subsequent releases Vulgar Display of Power and Far Beyond Driven, make for a trio of metal albums almost unrivalled in the early 90s, a period noted mostly for grunge bands such as Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and Alice In Chains. This is a wholly different sound from grunge; it takes you by the scruff and won't let go until the last track. Consider yourself warned, this is no album for sissies!"},{"rating":"2","title":"How do you rate awesomeness!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This was actually my fourth Pantera album I bought! Great Southern Trendkill being first, Vulgar Display of Power being my second, Far beyong driven being my third! But I think Cowboys is my fave! Its just got some classic on here and some concert staples. I love Plih's voice on this album a hybrid of Chris cornel and Rob Halford. Just a metal masterpiece from start to end, always with Dimbag R.I.P. I couldnt imagine hearing this in the 90s for the first time. Always rocks my face off, all killer no filler!"},{"rating":"2","title":"People already forgot hes dead?","review":"Its funny cuz 10 years after kurt cobains death people still seem to love him.

On this album Phil Anselmo takes a very different approach to the vocals then on later outings. He uses a higher pitched wail on some of the songs, and he sings alot more on here. Something that is a rarity on later albums. This is a classic metal album. Pantera fans who don't own this album; you will be dissapointed if you are looking for the brutality of the later albums. This is a great place to start to introduce new people to the band. Hightlights Include; Cowboys From Hell, Cemetery Gates and Domination"},{"rating":"2","title":"A true metal album review, written by a true metal fan.","review":"Ok, this was pantera's first album off of the glam [stuff]. Even traces of glam are found inside the album with dime's name being \\"Diamond Darrel\\", this repeats again in \\"Vulgar display of Power\\". To most this album is a must have. So lets take a look at the musical content. The first and title track \\"Cowboys From Hell\\" is a great metal song not so fast but at a somewhat high tempo. I beleive this song has the best written lyrics on the album. From there the album gets better with catchy coruses, if you listen to psycho holiday you will know what i mean. after domination the album gets less diverse. It make you think \\"what song am I on now?\\". But once you reach the song \\"The Sleep\\" it gets much much better. Then Pantera closes the Album with \\"The art of shredding\\". This song is a masterpeice. So in closing if you are a true metal fan or think you are, your not until you own a copy of \\"Cowboys from Hell\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE OF AMAZON SHIPPING!!","review":"I received all three albums in a box twice the size of the albums with NO shipping material inside (wrap, styrofoam, etc.).

Information on such things as venomous reptiles, heat illnesses, finding water supplies, is very sketchy. The other issue is how to avoid getting into a 'desert survival' situation in the first place, which this book doesn't cover in much detail. If you have any intention of taking any serious desert trips that involve travel away from populated areas, I would instead recommend reading the Ultimate Desert Handbook by Mark Johnson or Desert Survival Skills by David Alloway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it for Convectuoso","review":"Sure it's only in demo form, but if the version of Convectuso on Worship and Tribute is as good we're in for a huge treat in July.

I found it lacking in purpose and direction. I know there was supposed to be this big \\"revelation\\" in Venice, but it was never explained. All I have to say is don't waste you time. The book just drags and never goes anywhere. I am glad that I just got it from the library to try out the author.

I found it sweet, unexpected and fun. There are some great comedic moments; the male lead rather reminds me of a young Dick Van Dyke in that he possesses both boyish goofiness and great comedic timing. If you like a good romance and dogs, I think you'd like this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!!","review":"Don't waste your time... if you have morals then you won't like this movie. Boy meets girl who loves dogs. Boy pretends to love dogs. Girl gets a new dog boy can't stand. Boy beds girl to aggravate dog. This movie is too predictable and lacks luster and originality. Whoever thought of this plot lacks creativity. In the meantime most couples like to enjoy a good romantic comedy together but if you are female (like me) and don't enjoy another female strutting her stuff across the screen in her underwear you will not care for this movie at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book to start with","review":"The book is really nice.

Very confusing for anyone who relies solely on this text for test preparation, so keep a math genius friend on speed dial."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"The honeymoon is definitely over for Charles and Diana; she's bored, frustrated, and lonely. Then she meets a handsome army captain who becomes her riding instructor and then, her lover. Five years later, they part under sad circumstances.This made-for-TV movie is really awful. No attempt was made to make the actors look anything like their famous counterparts: Diana doesn't have her trademark hairstyle (or any sense of style at all), Hewitt, Fergie, and Prince Harry aren't redheads, and Charles is a foot taller than Diana. Both the trite script and the unconvincing actors are to blame for a total lack of chemistry between the lovers; everyone in the cast has the personality of a wet rag, giving the movie a completely lackluster quality.There are some beautiful, grand houses and sets as backdrops, but the story is tawdry and surprisingly tedious. It's based on a book to which Hewitt was a major contributor, so of course, he comes out a hero while Diana is an emotional mess. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Royal Romance","review":"Although the vendor supplied the DVD in a timely manner and the DVD was of the highest quality, the poor acting and chosen cast made it a disaster:"},{"rating":"1","title":"Princess In Love","review":"This movie had to do with Princess Dianas' life & a very personal matter.

The first two ingredients are SD Alchohol 40 and isobutane. It also has Propane in it. My 10 yr old daughter received it from a friend for a birthday present along with some other cosmetics. She had a severe allergic reaction to it. She broke out in severe hives and could not sleep. I gave her benadryl that night to calm the hives. Days later she had an Anaphylaxis attack. She broke out in hives again and her temperature shot up to 104 degrees. This product should be outlawed! Propane?

Do not recommend this for younger children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was super excited when I received the game thinking that it would be like another Clue game, but I was wrong. The game itself is fun, but you can only play it a certain amount of time before you remember each case (only 20 cases). The quality of the tokens are horrible, one actually broken when I received the game. The \\"Skeleton Key\\" and \\"Scotland Yard\\" cards are also cheaply made. To pay $16 for a poorly made game is just not worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful Set","review":"I've become a believer in Pyrex. What you see is what you get with this nice three-piece set with lids. I particularly like the loaf sized container. I have used it for baking, then put it (with its baked contents) directly in the freezer after cooling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the glass. Wish there were more","review":"I like these. I am trying to clean up my refrigerator and most of my Tupperware is round and wastes a lot of space. These are good. The allow you to see what is inside.

They are sturdy, dish washer safe, don't get stained, and you can also use the glass portion for baking small cakes(I never exceed 350 degrees). They fit perfectly in my fridge and I like these much more than I like the round Pyrex food storage containers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convenient Sizes and Secure Storage","review":"My husband and I love these containers because we are trying to avoid having our food touch plastic. By now most people are aware that there are chemicals in plastic that will leak into the food if not properly cared for. I bought these along with the round storage containers and we have gotten rid of almost all of our plastic containers. Pyrex makes very durable glassware. I have dropped them and not had any problem. You can also put these containers in the over, microwave or freezer which can't be done safely with plastic.I highly recommend throwing out the plastic containers and replacing them with Pyrex glassware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, maybe safer","review":"We decided to replace our plastic containers because of rumors that heating them in the microwave could release some chemicals on the food. Don't really know if it's true, but just in case, we got rid of them. These containers are heavier than the plastic ones, of course, but they are sturdy, durable and very good looking. We are very happy with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pyrex- what more can you say?","review":"Will be ordering more - the square/rectangular shapes take up much less room in cupboards and the refrigerator since they store with less wasted space than round containers.

They definitely, leak ... a lot. I'm disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap US Manufactured garbage","review":"I LOVE the OLD pyrex. It was the BEST but this new stuff is made in China and is garbage. If you are lucky enough to have some of the old containers all you have to do is hold them next to the new ones and you will see the difference. The old ones are clear and the new ones have a blue cast to the glass. For some reason the blue tint in the glass weakens it but somehow makes it cheaper to produce. From what I've read all colored glass is more fragile especially when subjected to heat but I have to tell you, it also chips with just regular use. I've never had any of the old pyrex chip. Also, the lids for the new ones are EXTREMELY stiff and very difficult to get on to the containers. I even had one lid split because it would not stretch. Somehow this new stiffer plastic is cheaper to make just does not make a good product."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love the Pyrex stuff - replace your plastic!","review":"These containers are heavy-duty glass, with heavy-duty, flexible plastic lids. Plastic is ubiquitous and said to be toxic. If you want to avoid microwaving anything in plastic, switch to some nice glass containers like these. I've had mine for over a year, use them constantly, and the lids are still just fine, and the glass is spotless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good product; horrible price","review":"As others have mentioned, these storage containers are very good, if a bit smaller than would be ideal. But the pricing is ridiculous. I bought them from Target via Amazon. With shipping, they cost just over $21, which seemed like an OK deal given that the list price is $24.99. A few weeks later I was in my local Target store, though, and saw that the everyday in-store price is just over $12! I guess in theory they could be listed for $24.99, but at your local Target, they cost only half that. So unless you are spending enough that your shipping from Target will be free, buy them in a store, not online, if you possibly can."},{"rating":"2","title":"an examination of the French character","review":"Translated from the French,244 p.the author was drafted in 1940 and captured by the Germans soon afterward.

Physically it feels so much better than the Rebel or the comparative Nikon. The rubber-coated aluminum chasis and smooth-working controls make it hard to put down. I recommend buying several 1Gig cards for it though. This weekend I took some autumn portraits of my cousin and his wife at the park. Using .tif and no compression, I only got 34 pics!

TYPOS, TYPOS, and MORE TYPOS!","review":"I have read all of Alexandra Sellers's books in paperback, and I've enjoyed them all. Imagine my surprise when I purchased them in the Kindle book format and found so many typos that it was difficult to get through the books. I'm not sure who is responsible, but someone surely has to proofread these books before they are sold. Since Amazon or the publisher has decided to charge almost full price (and in some cases full price) for Kindle books, I feel that we readers are entitled to more than a glorified rough draft. I'll admit that I have found errors in other Kindle books, but Seller's books on Kindle have been the worst. SOMEONE needs to proofread these books. Putting them out there full of errors is cheating the readers, as well as the author, and I resent it. I gave this book a low rating because of all of the errors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Well Done WWII Tale","review":"This is a fictional account of the intrepid Polish Resistance against the Nazi occupation of Warsaw. It's a simple account of one heroic resistance fighter, his incredibly touching love affair, and some gripping, almost unbearably tense encounters with various arms of the Nazi establishment. The book sheds a much-needed light on the Nazi depredations against the Poles, especially the mass executions at various intersections throughout the embattled city. There is glory in this story but there is also the sadness which comes with a brutal occupation by sub-human forces. This story has it all. Occupation up close and personal and the heroes who fought back with all they had. Wiggins has created a masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing book","review":"I ordered this based on reviews by other readers and the fact that Amazon showed it on a page with the likes of Alan Furst.

The only thing that kept my interest was my interest in European history during WWII."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm driving my boyfriend crazy...","review":"The only way I can review this game is from a spectator's chair. I have more fun getting a buzz on and yaking at my boyfriend to get through the various levels than if I were actually in the game. I want the soundtrack so that while I am cleaning my home I can bounce around like that manic ewe. It is as if the designer got a hold of one my past acid trips, scored it, and let everyone else in on the fun. Though I haven't actually played, it seems challenging, which I guess is important. Whether playing or watching, this is the SH#$! Give me more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't you agree on SOMTHING?","review":"Have you noticed that, while one person gives it 1 star and completed it in 1/2 hour, and one person spent weeks on it and gave 5? Well the answer is, this game is of limited appeal. If you're a musical fellow who loved parappa, found it quite hard, and is hungry for more, why not? If, however, you listen to the likes of Steps and Five, this game isn't for you.What do I think? Well, the Graphic style is great, the music is reasonable and I can play it for hours. However,like most games, it ain't as good as the original.If you like both Parappa and Um Jammer, see Vib Ribbon! The same guy, sense of humour, but with more......erm.......more. You get to play your own CD's and the disc music is......well, again, of limited appeal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well, ha ha ha...","review":"... A lamb playing a guitar!(Not a swipe at another reviewer, honest). It held me and my cousin's interest for almost several hours. Its fun, challenging, the graphics(out-dated 2D) have a certain goofy appeal and the controls are good. Since I don't own a Playstation(A Nintendo player since I was 6, baby!) trying to watch the screen and hit buttons that I'm not familiar with was hard. But after awhile I got it. Only one level has a bad song and thats the one with the insane, midget pilot. Even though the songs aren't stuff I'd want to listen(some are so '80-ish and stupid), taking part in them is a lot of fun. Single player is fun, less fun than multi-player though. I wish there were some hidden stages or something along those lines, but still, its fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Um Jammer Lammy","review":"Every thuo this is an old game I still think it's good for the kidswith hand,eye and memory skills."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened here?","review":"I was a big fan of Parappa the Rapper and I was seriously disappointed with this sequel. It's bad enough that you can beat it in 30 minutes, but what's worse is that you wouldn't want to! The music is just bad and that is inexcusable for a music game. Where are all the catchy tunes? I can't remember one line from this game, whereas I have all of Parappa the Rapper's songs memorized. It's missing those great lyrics found in Parappa like my favorite: \\"Sunny in my life, she's like a dice, I can't tell which way to turn 'till I spice!\\" Skip UmJammer and get Parappa."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book, don't waste your time","review":"Don't even bother wasting your time with this book.

This is one of the rare occasions that I have been literally unwilling/unable to finish a book. Chapter one was enough. Perhaps Arguelles is onto something that most people are completely unaware of, and is a modern day genius. My vote is that he is way out in left field, a little wacky. I was going to sell the book used, but noticed that his barely three year old book is only fetching about 4 to 5 bucks. not worth the effort. Unless you are a little off yourself, save your money and buy something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why isnt this on the radio?","review":"This album is further evidence of how tastless the rock music listners of today are. This album is SOLID MUSIC, thought out, honest, meaningfull, extremely listenable, and musically sound, yet has nowhere near the success (finnacially) that much less talented bands of the same genre have enjoyed. With this album, Feeder reminds us that solid songwriting and attention to the music, and some originalitiy are a sure-fire way to come out with a good album. This album doesnt recieve five stars simply because it isnt incredible. Five stars reviews belong to albums from Zepplin, Pink Floyd, and others of that mythical proportion, and, Feeder is not comprable. It doesn't matter, though, because these guys seem to foucus on writing good songs, and playing good music."},{"rating":"2","title":"sweetboy--from America, someday this year","review":"Great CD.

The Best.","review":"We used this book for 3 months as we lived in Buenos Aires with few, if any, complaints.Footprint has been writing its South America guidebook series for 80+ years. It is simply the most well-informed guidebook for this continent. Compared to Lonely Planet, there is more information packed into Footprint and the quality of the materials and printing are superior.The maps are a level above the competition, especially the sad, gray smudges that pass for maps in the Lonely Planet.

The best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended -","review":"We travelled around Argentina out of season using this guide and the Rough Guide, and found that we turned time and again to the Footprint Guide for reliable and up-to-date information. I broke my ankle in Salta, but thanks to this guide, we were booked into a fantastic hotel, and later spent a few nights luxuriating in a gorgeous and fantastic value for money estancia in Pumamarca, which went some way towards saving the holiday from disaster. If you're thinking of going to Argentina, go now, and take this guide with you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great stories about teens and parents","review":"I loved this book for its great stories about adolescents and their parents. The dialogue can be hilarious at times as these kids struggle to understand what's happening for them in the sexual arena, and Lynn Ponton seems to understand them at every turn where their parents can't. The subjects can range from \\"everyday\\" performance anxieties to questions about sexual identity, to wrestling with negative outcomes of sexual activity (pregnancy, disease), to finding oneself actually enjoying the pleasures of healthy sexual activity in the context of a healthy intimate relationship.Lynn Ponton is nonjudgemental about many loaded topics. I know my own kids will benefit from my having read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"From a teenagers standpoint . . .","review":"Is it just me or is Dr. Ponton trying to give teenage sexuality a bad name? (Like we aren't looked down upon enough as it is!) Every chapter of this book is filled with sexual extremes, which many teens are smart enough to avoid. Dr. Ponton is not \\"revealing the secret world of adolestcent boys and girls,\\" rather she is describing and analyzing the problems of unaverage teenagers that would need to see a doctor like her. The experiences in this book are uncommon to the average teen and therefore are hard to relate to. Parents gain no insight into teenage sexuality from this book either.I gave this book two stars purely for the entertainment value of the anecdotes Dr. Ponton's patients presents. I hope she's paying them royalties, because their stories are the only thing selling her book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for parents to share with teens","review":"When I read Dr. Ponton's book, the stories of her patients were so close to my actual experiences as a teen that I was thrilled someone had finaly \\"gotten it\\".I plan to give this book to my parents and my 16 year-old sister, and strongly recommend it to teens and parents to be used as a tool for more open communtication about some often difficult isses.The writing was simple, frank, and not too clincal. To anyone who is a teen or cares about a teen it will be an easy and engaging read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Provocative topic, but not too original","review":"Everything that could have ever been written about teenagers and their sex lives has been written. This book proves itself to be very trite -- covering ground that has already been traversed, offering very limited insight, and looking at very little new reserach. Not only that, but it does not include an index, so there is now way for readers to thumb through and find relevant information....Good organization could have saved this from the remainder pile -- it could have been another manual about sex. But alas, even that did not happen...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Jazz","review":"This is great jazz. Simple in instrumentation (drums, bass, flute, ukulele); and yet very rich and style and sound. It is smooth jazz with the phenominal stylings and skill of Lyle Ritz! He was and is a pioneer in jazz uke.If you like good smooth jazz it is well worth the money. Ritz provides a stunning performance for a first album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product; just wish it was cheaper","review":"I am very happy with this product. The optical quality is good and it has the perfect amount of field of vision for me - not too much convexity, not too little; I use it while working on my computer to see my baby rolling on the floor behind me in my office. (Not sure how well it would work if I wanted to see far distances.) I use to use a web cam to see the baby behind me, but this mirror is soooo much better. The clip and neck are sturdy - it holds the position you set it too.It did arrive with a faint scratch near the rim of the mirror, but its no big deal and I still give it 5 stars. I paid about $20 for it, I would buy more for other purposes around the house if they were cheaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Versatile, Flexible, Portable Security Mirror","review":"For me, the happy surprise about this mirror was how clear, wide, and far it's field of vision is.I was hoping that it would be well made and that the clip would spread wide enough to clip on 1\\" plus wide objects -- and it delivered on both of those counts too.The goose neck is fairly stiff but has plenty of flex to position the mirror just how you want it. It then holds the position you set firmly.The best thing about the mirror is that its portablity allows you to easily experiment with different locations.If you need a convex mirror like this to keep an eye on somewhere, but don't want to spend the big bucks for a commercial one or aren't certain yet, then buy this one. You won't be disappointed.The 7\\" diameter is surprisingly big. Personally, I would not buy any smaller, but check it out on a ruler and make sure you won't mind that size for your location."},{"rating":"2","title":"a fine clip-on mirror, but hard to attach to a cubicle wall","review":"I bought this mirror for an office cubicle situation to provide a view behind me.

I think $35 a year is too much to pay to pump water off my cover. I will have to buy a new pump and it will not be another of this model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small for the job.","review":"On line this appeared to be like the pump we had been using that had died. In fact it was half the size and could not pull the water out of the pool. It might be appropriate for a fountain of some sort, but not to take water off of a large pool cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow but functional","review":"This pump is certainly no frills, and much smaller and lighter-weight than one would imagine. It looks like a toy coming out of the box. The flow rate is rather slow, meaning that you will have to be very patient to pump a large quantity of accumulated water from a pool cover. But, almost surprisingly, this tiny gismo does get the job done, and seems unusually free from clogging problems.

His technique, tone, and approach scream Malmsteen, and his skill is at a similar level. However, his note/scale selections sound like stuff that Marty Friedman would play. The good thing about this cd is that it is not all out shred. There are some fast songs with runs that will make your jaw drop, and then there are slower more emotional songs that exhibit the writing abilities of this young guitarist. The bass playing and the drumming are average, but the guitar and other stringed instruments are the focal point. A good purchase for fans of Malmsteen and any of the other Shrapnel neoclassical artists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap, all been done before and much better","review":"Whats with these reviewers?

The information in those chapters provide a good introduction to OOP. At times, I felt the authors were hard to follow and found myself re-reading several pages especially in Chapters 4 and 5.

I think that the book is well written, and gives a nice topographical view of the Roman world from 44BC - the death of J. Caesar to 180AD the advent of Commodus (if you saw Gladiator, you know who he is). It's coverage of the whole Roman Empire, into economical, religious, and society is quite riveting, and well thought out. It is not a difficult book to read, and has short chapters, with headings for each section - this will make it easier for you to read, and follow along.He uses archaeological, and written sources, and does this quite well.

It just died for the second time in two years. The coffee side doesn't power on, maybe its as simple as a fuse but for as often as this happens the unit isn't easy enough to take apart. This unit only has a 1 year warranty, the first time it happened within the year so I had it repaired (had to pay to ship it to the service center of course). When I got it back the side plastic was popped off so I had to snap it back together, but it never looked the same as it did before I sent it in. Now it's dead again and out of warranty, I'm not paying to have this thing fixed. I wasn't even using it more than 3 times a week. A machine that costs this much should not last only a year or two. I'll buy another brand and send this for recycling. On the bright side, I'll no longer have to deal with the poorly designed pot that spilled coffee all over the counter every time we tried to pour a cup."},{"rating":"1","title":"Krups 2010","review":"I had this unit for 2+ years and it worked very well- no problems except the pouring lip on the carafe.

Then we started experiencing problems (as explained by others here) with the milk frother just popping into the milk. What a pain!OK...so we could live with that, because honestly, we only used the espresso side of it a couple times a month. However, last month the plastic cover on the coffee side snapped at the hinges and it stopped making coffee. Thinking the two problems were related, I took it apart and fixed the top with epoxy. Got it all back together....and.....it still does not make coffee anymore. There must be a pressure leak somewhere because the water doesn't even make it all the way up the drip tube...just steam.And, to top it off, Krups \\"Service Center\\" is a complete oxymoron. Impossible to get any service there at all, let alone parts. Time to get a new machine. No more Krups for me...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Espresso, no froth","review":"I was given this maker as a gift (though I chose it because it was economical), and am disappointed. The frother does not work. I have had boiler type machines that outperformed this one at a third the cost. The steam never builds up enough pressure to properly froth milk for cappucino. The espresso function is good, however, as is the coffee. I think it is probably too late to return the machine, so my friend wasted $200."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy","review":"The espresso side of this machine is a complete piece of garbage.

Krups would not honor the warranty but they gave me rebates towards another machine. So I bought this machine and was happy for a while, although the carafe leaks from day one (you must pop open the lid to have it not spill while pouring, an asinine design). Krups did not honor the rebate saying that I had sent in the wrong UPC although I was careful to look when I sent the materials in because I know that sometimes there's more than one UPC (and of course the sale receipt and coupon they gave me wasn't enough to honor the rebate). I did not keep the monstrous box, so I gave up on that.Well after a couple years this machine leaks now and my wife says that she has received small electric shocks from it. Bottom line, I warn you not to buy any coffee machine by Krups, and I will never buy another Krups product in my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tank Leaks, Poor Quality","review":"I think Krups cuts some corners on this one. Cheap parts, made even more frustrating by the fact that they do (used to?) make good products that would last years. The espresso part is awkward and difficult, and I've been a barista. The regular coffee side is also a mess because the actual water tank leaks. I contacted Krups, and they said they stopped making the machine in 2006 despite the fact that it is readily available & still being sold new in both stores and online. They said they wouldn't stand behind \\"such an old machine\\" regardless of when it was purchased. Beware! If you buy Krups in person, check the code on the bottom for the last 2 numbers of the manufacturing date. In short, don't buy this= poor customer service, unreliable product."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Repair Parts Available","review":"Sadly, Krups doesn't offer the most basic repair parts for this unit...including the plastic parts that are bound to break. They are also pretty nonresponsive, referring you to vendors that don't have the parts to offer. It works nicely for as long as it works but is quick to become a piece of junk. All they'd have to do is have a reasonable way to order a reasonable variety of repair parts...but, they simply don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I'd read these reviews first!","review":"I wish I had taken the time to read these reviews as I probably would not have bought this machine. I am experiencing many of the issues outlined in the reviews such as the poor frothing ability and tendency for the wand to fire itself into a jug of hot milk resulting in minor scalding and a huge mess. In addition the whole machine regularly disappears into a cloud of steam after using the espresso function and sometimes the drip side too. The filter gasket for pods leaks steam (thus losing pressure crucial for good espresso shots) no matter how small I cut down the pod.Basically I have been persevering with this item for months now such that I am unlikely to be able to return it. It is fatally flawed. I would give it away but for fear that someone will burn themselves using it!

Then it developed a large leak whenever the coffee maker was filled with water. I eventually took the back and bottom off to see if it was a simple fix. Turns out the plastic outlet fitting from the bottom of the water reservoir was all cracked and in pieces. A part of the plastic fitting had worked it's way into the tubing. I am on hold now to see if I can get this repaired under warranty, but honestly, probably be worth buying something else at this point. By the time I pay for shipping this, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 1 Year","review":"Coffee maker side works well. One gripe is that the carafe design is severely flawed so it's impossible to pour a cup of coffee without spilling everywhere. After 1 year, coffee maker side still works but espresso & frother don't. The pump turns on now and doesn't shut off when we switch on the espresso side and the reservoir that catches drips just fills with water in a matter of seconds and floods the countertop. No espresso or foam can be produced. It's a shame because this machine made an excellent cup of espresso while it worked and we really loved how easy it is to use. The frother was not as powerful as we'd hoped so we had to froth the milk at least twice to get a nice foam for cappuccinos, but in the end they tasted great. My father owns an expensive Gaggia machine and said that the espresso from my Krups actually came out better than his. I just wish it had lasted longer.

I called customer service, ship it in and a minimum of $30 for them to even open the box, and would not give any estimate of charges. All of the wires have been soaked over time and the plating on the bottom has corroded, screws are rusted, so this has been going on for some time. I will not send it back in for repair.

The width and heigth of the unit had to fit within that area. There aren't too many combo machines out there, but the Krups 2010 fits the bill perfectly. It's very quick at producing a good espresso and the coffee maker works great too, filling a 10-cup pot in less than nine minutes. One reviewer claimed the espresso head leaked. I haven't had that problem. Maybe he or she didn't tighten the head enough or they're tossing ESE pods in the filter holder without properly adjusting them. Who knows? I know you can spend a lot more for a standalone espresso machine, but for a combination espresso-coffee machine the Krups works just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Has Worked Great for 3 years!","review":"I've had this Krups unit for almost 3 years and have made countless pots of coffee and used the Espresso side multiple times with no problems to date (knock on wood, haha). I've cleaned the unit using vinegar to get who knows what possible build up could happen inside the unit. I've read other reviews saying they have had multiple problems but for me i guess i got the golden goose! I would love to get the new krups XP2280 in the future when this unit decides to expire itself, i love the programmable interface . Overall I'm very happy with the unit and what i have used it for which has been a pot of coffee every morning and a peppermint cappuccino 3x a week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I got this unit a year ago as a Christmas gift. It worked ok until 4 days out of warranty when one of the wires to the heating element on the coffee side fried rendering it useless as a coffee maker. When I say it worked \\"ok\\" before that I mean it, it didn't work great or good, just ok. At a glance XP2010 looks solid and well made for a home unit but the housing and water storage container(on the coffee side) is made of a cheap brittle plastic, the hinge for the coffee door broke within the first few uses. Within a couple months water started to leak ever time coffee was made, which I suspect may have had a part in frying the heater, causing a big mess on the counter every morning. I never had major problems with the espresso side, but it is slow to heat up and warming milk will take a good five minutes. This machine is too expensive for the quality, and I would recommend not purchasing this model.I would not purchase a Krups coffee/espresso maker again."},{"rating":"2","title":"XP2010 Combination Coffee Maker Expresso","review":"Am very satisfied with this product.

I went into buying this thing because I thought, \\"Wow, I'll never need a memory card again!\\" I was right, but I paid the price for it (literaly). The menu is hard to use, and when music is playing, the menu is really slow. The batteries don't last very long either. Some details of music can't be changed (like album, artist, and genre), so it makes organization of your music very hard. Because of this, finding music is even harder.

This is a new generation, a quantum leap forward at a very reasonable price. It will hold *ALL* your music, not only in MP3 format, but in WMA format (this compression tech is superior to MP3 and will supplant it) as well. Downloading from your PC is a breeze with the USB connection, and the unit's controls make individual song search & access fairly simple. The size is fine (though clearly the Diamond Rio, et al, is a smaller pkg), about what a portable (Walkman-style) CD player measures. Battery life is okay, and headphones are marginal. Its one drawback is its moderate volume on playback; if you want to really hear the music on the subway, it may not rock your world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speechless","review":"I just got this item 6 hours ago and I am already blown away.I traded in my ridiculously featureless Philips Expanium for this thing (and an additional $200 :)) and couldn't be happier with the decision.

I've been using WMA format, since I can't get the files back off the unit, the extra compression pays off.Navigating menus is a breeze and the bundled software is incredibly intuitive.Here are the negative points: 1. No shuffle options (hopefully changed in future firmware?) 2. Battery life is rumored to be short (haven't tried them yet)The positives are so numerous, I can't list them.

I am very frugal with my money, so I figured with the creative name, it has got to be a great product. The first few times I used it, it was great..then the malfunctions kicked in. The music would just stop right in the middle of the song. I wasnt sure if it was because I was jogging or what the deal was. But it was as if the Hard-drive just crashed. So, I haven't used it since. I don't know if mine was one in a million, but I will never buy another one of these Jukeboxes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jukebox fails to act like a jukebox","review":"While the idea of storing 150 CDs on a portable player may seem cool, it's not if you have a poor interface for listening to your songs. For starters, the Nomad does not have a \\"random\\" or \\"shuffle\\" feature, which is common on most CD players. You have to listen by artist, album, genre, or take the time to create a custom playlist. The other big problem is you can load MP3 files onto the Nomad, but you can download them to another machine. So if you plan on mapping this player to your network and using Napster to upload and download songs to the Nomad, you are out of luck. You will end of owning a 6 GB harddrive that has only one way to load or remove songs: you have to use its customised \\"Creative PlayCenter 2.0\\" software."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm melting (what a world)","review":"I was so excited when I bought this, thinking about how many songs I could put in and listen. I enjoyed it for about a month. However, after a night of charging the batteries, they faded after one song. No problem, I had a backup set, or so I thought. I had never used them so I plugged them in to charge up overnight. My dogs woke me up about three in the morning, barking at my desk which was smoldering. I quickly uplugged the jukebox. I checked the batteries, and they were in correctly (I have photos). I beg you, DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM."},{"rating":"2","title":"6 Gigs of music!","review":"At last, the 6 Gig Mp3 player finally showed up!I don't care if the batteries last only four hours.

Then this Jukebox will be worth every penny!Pros : -6 Gigs, duh. -Fast upload. -Easy to use.Cons : -Rather heavy, but it doesn't weigh more than my CD player(Panansonic with metal body). -Plastic body that scratches easily.-For people who has slow connection, buy a cheap Mp3 player instead, because you will download for months until you obtain 6 gigs of music.At the end, there are some features missing from what I expected(random selection and smaller body), but 6 gigs...

(I only used it at home and did not subject it to any unusual wear.) I mailed it to Creative Labs for repair and they said it could not be repaired and was out of the 90 day warranty. So now I have wasted $. I would be very careful about purchasing a device this expensive that is unreliable and has such a short warranty."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Few Drawbacks, but Definitely Worth It","review":"If you are wondering if it is worth the money, it is. There are a few negative aspects, such as battery life and headphone output. The batteries don't even last 4 hours like expected, so I bought an extra set of the Kodak rechargables. The headphones are quiet, but I experimented and it's like that with your average pair. So unless you have extremely good hearing or loud phones you can't hear with background noise.What everyone says about the extreme storage is true. It's awesome to be able to carry hundreds of songs wherever you go. And the company did put out a software upgrade for the machine, so not being able to rewind/fastforward or download songs to your computer from the nomad is no longer a problem. I think that in the future they will make a remote control available, hopefully not very expensive. The car adapter is still in the makings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy customer support","review":"I bought a Jukebox in September and spent some time loading all my music on it.

Stop, change songs, even the volume - you are forced to wait for it to happen* Slow download from computer to device.* No ability to skip forwards or backwards WITHIN a song.I say wait for the technology to improve or get another unit that addresses these problems.

I would even buy another if it was improved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't recommend this item","review":"While sound quality and storage capacity are quite nice, the abysmally poor interface makes this player next to useless. The keyword when using the buttons is slow! Even something simple like changing the volume to the headphones shows quite a lag, and isn't always available. Scrolling through your playlist is slow, everything is frustratingly slow. Add to that the huge number of things you can't do, and features you'd expect to be there but aren't (like delete a single track from the active queue, or play in shuffle mode) and my impulse is to junk the thing.The PC-based software for managing your playlists is also very poor, nonintuitive, and lacking in a great many simple features that would make it a lot easier to use. I wish I had the room and time to provide a complete list.On the plus side, the sound quality is very good, storage space is ample, and the device itself has a nice look, but I was very disappointed with this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"noisy","review":"I loved this stepper.

Anthropologist Nancy Frey has managed to bring the experience to vivid life conjuring the sights, sounds, emotions, exhilarations and disappointments of modern pilgrims as they trek across Spain in search of themselves, God, happiness or whatever else may be meaningful to them. Frey follows hundreds of pilgrims during and after their walk and tackles the questions of what happens once people go home and they trace their lives back to their points of origin around the world--Brazil, Germany, UK, US and, of course, Spain.

The worst of these is the jam session for \\"Hyacinth House\\", which sounded better on \\"L.A. Woman\\". Other than that, the new spins on originals are good listening. The demo for \\"Summer's Almost Gone\\" is great,as is \\"End of the Night\\".Then there are the new entries, the most wild and entertaining being \\"The Insane Song\\", a new mix on the old \\"A Little Game\\". \\"Orange County Suite\\" is a soft, yet long, ode to Jim's love Pam Courson. \\"Black Train\\" is a fine song for the first five minutes or so, but drags on a bit too long.

The incredible combination of a melody and an aggressiveness, of a wall-crushing power, and a fragile beauty makes Ill Nino really something to listen to, and to enjoy.God Save Us, and What Comes Around are really great hits that are known widely. The most melodic, still heavy enough, tracks are perhaps Unreal, No Murder, and Predisposed. If You Still Hate Me, Nothing's Clear, Liar, Rumba, I Am Loco, Rip Out Your Eyes, and /Revolucion are full of energy and heaviness, and readily please anyone who're used to some heavier music.

Are they trying to be Sepultura? Or are they trying to come into their own as a thundering 6 piece orgy of anger and contempt? Honestly, I don't exactly know. Their music, heavily influenced with latin drums and dripping with pre-teen angst, does warrant a second listen. They are talented musicians, and it shows on each and every track, but the lyrical content of the album may leave some fans wanting. I noticed another reviewer quote \\"This new life has brought us this new knife\\" line from the disk's opening track, God save Us, and honestly, it does not get much deeper than that. However, those looking to feed their internal strife will find that this album will fill that spot in their collection quite nicely. Ill Nino shows promise, they just need to define what they want to be. Heavy and angry, or heavy, angry and lyrical.Standout TracksIf You Still Hate MeLiarRip Out Your EyesI am Loco"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent record.","review":"I bought this record because I have always liked the band.

Standout tracks for me are \\"What comes around\\" \\"I am Loco\\". I did however have a problem with Amazon's shipping with this which was SLOW. That and the price is considerably high than what you can get on Ebay. Just saying. Don't let it stop you from supporting this kick ass band but I would not go with Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the better nu-metal bands around today.","review":"Ill Nino is a nu-metal success. They perfectly tied the Latin music theme with heavy, headbanging beats, engrossing melodies, and lyrics that sound from the heart. The lead singer's voice seems quiet but yet presses you with its meaning, and makes you feel the emotion they convey. Songs like 'Unreal' and 'What Comes Around' are (in my opinion) the most engagaing, and 'Rip Out Your Eyes' is a heavy one for Tool and Slipknot fans. There's something on this album for everyone. The Latin theme is genuine throughout and really adds a certain enjoyable touch. If the music doesn't get you, the lyrics will. Ill Nino is a band with skills, and deserves recognition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This CD is unbelievable. I loved it just by listening to it only once. The only problems I can see are1. Lyrics - They aren't excellent, and could use some improvement.2.

That might explain why, as soon as I fired it up again, it leaked again. And again. And again.

This is a common theme for these machines so obviously there's some type of fatal design flaw. Someone should bring a class action lawsuit. Oh, and the carafe made it almost impossible to pour a cup of coffee without spilling...it was comical. It's sad, I want a combo machine but I don't want to spend $1000.

This coffee spills onto the countertop, in my limited experience apx. 1/3 of the amount of coffee I've expected to brew in the pot ends up on the counter (and today into the drawer below the counter and the floor). Spout on the caraffe also is tricky, unless it is poured very slow, the coffee dribbles down the side of the pot and again... onto the counter.

The espresso portion overheats itself and NEVER has pressure enough to push out 2 oz of espresso. REALLY DISSAPPOINTED with the customer service & product. A very painful $300 to part with.

Very reluctantly, they threw in a few free coffee filters in the deal. I wish I had read other Amazon customer posts, that indicate that not even the CEO responds to customer service complaints.They also said they had no information on troubleshooting the machine \\"because we just introduced it.\\" It seems that any decent machine testing would check to see that you could turn on the machine.

I thought that with the purchase of this Krups unit I'd be moving up in the world. Boy was I disappointed. The steamer has a detachable nozzle which frequently pops off while frothing milk, splattering everything nearby. The Salton had a 4 shot capacity while this makes only 2 shots at a time, and weaker at that. The Salton for its $99 price included a carafe and steamer jug. You'll have to purchase these separately from Krups. Krups recommends purchase of a separate water filter for the water reservoir for the espresso unit. When it's in place the pump can't draw water through it. I brew espresso every morning. I don't understand how anyone could rate this product favorably if they reguarly make espresso. However the coffee unit works well. I've never written a review for Amazon before. The poor quality of this product motivated me."},{"rating":"1","title":"customer beware","review":"I have used this maker for 5 months daily--primarily for the espresso feature.

The directions to operate the machine are very complicated; and finally my machine is broken and not working. I have followed all directions in terms of cleaning, which requires disassempling a filter and so forth. Very time consuming. I do not recommend this very high-maintenance machine.

After plugging it in and attempting to use it, it now does not light up to signal that it is ready to make coffee or espresso and just makes a lot of noise. Nothing works except for the hot water option. I will be calling Krups and demanding a refund (it was purchased directly from their website). Save your money. Since we did not have the machine for over 3 months one of our employees brought in a $30 espresso machine she had purchased at target.

I took this back to Bed Bath and Beyond and exchanged it for another one. Got home, set it up, attempted to make an espresso and the pressure was not strong enough to push the water through. After 5 attempts and a half bag of espresso wasted, I boxed her up ready to be returned again tomorrow. My husband said give it another shot but after reading these reviews, forget it.

Then it just stopped working. I opened it up to see if it had a fuse or something, but none is apparent. Since it is out of warranty it sounds like the costs to repair and the likelihood of having a good functioning machine afterwards (based on other reviews on this site) are not worth the effort.

I love espresso, but won't make it with this because of all the steps involved.

It worked for about 1 year, and then began giving us fits of various sorts. When simply making coffee, the water runs out of the overflow reservoir--and not just a little bit of water. We had to begin placing 2-3 towels around the bottom of the machine and/or on the floor anytime we hit the start button, otherwise we would return to a pool of water on the counter, which eventuatlly pooled on our hardwood floors below. Ridiculous. Recently, the electronics seem to have gone bad. The display either remains bright blue--it should be dimmed out with only the numbers/symbols displayed--or it blinks epileptically and makes a ticking sound until it is unplugged. Pretty expensive item to only last 1 year (of course just past the warranty). DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY."},{"rating":"1","title":"expensive piece of junk!","review":"The espresso side of the machine doesn't work. No water comes through for espresso, also can't froth milk or get hot water. I've been reading that this seems to be a common complaint. I've found some people who have replaced either the valves and or the flow meter and it has fixed their problem. I'm going to have my husband take it apart and see if either of those should be replaced. Both items will cost about 40 dollars so I'll give it a shot. If it doesn't work then I'll just keep using it as a coffee maker only till it dies. I'll never buy a krups product again. Another friend of mine only drinks espresso and had their top of the line stand alone unit. It died as well, a few times ,before he finally gave up on sending it in or replacing cheap parts and bought a different brand.

I have had to replace the pot two times because it is made of such thin glass, But i think i replaced my rug more times because it is almost impossible to pour a cup of coffee without leaking all over the floor.

Then one day...no power...I have seen this from so many other comments that I truly believe it is a defect...considering the price! Krups is not willing to take any sort of responsibility, so I will avoid purchasing from the company. I really can't believe it hasn't been taken off the market with the amount of poor feedback.

Because I got it at a Bargain price (50). I bought the unit from a guy who didn't like expressos and only used it occasionally when receiving guests + he never used the expresso feature.

The esspresso machine turns on and nothing happens. Keep in mind , this is four different machines with the same result. Water comes out from the bottom. The blue lights flicker , and we try again. Tonight after trying to make esspresso for 15 minutes, I got frustrated once again, and went to the internet to look at reviews of what others thought.

We had another combination machine from krups that was over 10 years old and I wanted an updated look. This machine is PRETTY, looks great sitting on the counter. That's about all it's worth. Truly, I'm sick about it. The coffee part broke after a year, I have had to make due and it has just slowly been dying. The espresso part actually still works fine. It literally shuts itself off with the TWO HOUR timer before coffee is done brewing (yes, you read that right, it is taking over 2 hours to brew a pot) and even when I try to make 3 cups it is lukewarm. I'm on year 2 with this machine and have been trying to suck it up due to the price but I'm done. I would have been willing to try to stick with krups, but as other reviewers pointed out their service support is awful. I would have to pay $40 to $50 just in shipping to get it to the service center and then pay MORE to have it fixed.

The people in Krups customer service are very nice, but what good is that if Krups can't make this expensive coffee maker work? First the electronics (or the pump) died. I sent it in for repair, and after more than a month, they sent a new machine. However, the new machine leaked from the Espresso side from the first day so I had to send that one back too. Then I waited over a month again to get it back, and the service center replaced two electronics boards and didn't fix the leak. <sigh>. So back it goes for a THIRD TIME! All in all, with all the shipping, etc, it's getting close to 6 months. Seriously, if it wasn't so expensive, I would have just thrown it away by now. Save your money!

After about 5 months of regular use (it's not like I'm using it to run a cafe or anything) my espresso maker quit on me. Support was helpful, but only after a few lengthy hold times. To my surprise the service center sent me back a brand new machine. Sadly, I'm writing this review after my second espresso side failure, this time out of warranty, to caution shoppers.The espresso maker works well. As other reviewers have noted, the steamer nozzle does have a tendency to pop off.The coffee maker has always disappointed me.

Also, in less than two months it is leaking water from somewhere. It has never worked since that first weekend. It makes decent espresso. That is the best part of it. The coffee it makes doesn't compare to my old Bunn. Thankfully, the store I bought it at is very forgiving with returns without original packaging and the receipt.

To put it bluntly it never worked, it would quit midcycle and blink, this behavior was described in another review of another Krups machine so it wasnot a fluke. The supposed great frothing attachmnet flew off twice while steaming, splattering milk everywhere. The lid on the carafe is also very cheap although the filter assembly seems well built that is the best thing I can say about it. I two felt the controls weird and the instructions incorrect and hard to follow.

We already had to trade it in after using it only once because of some sort of electronic malfunction on the espresso side that just made the digital screen blink on and off, nothing in the troubleshooting guide fixed the problem. Now a month after using the new one, its espresso pump is loud and noisy, sounding like its broken. Also for some reason or another it won't send the water all the time through the brew head to make the espresso. It ends up going into the overflow container to be dumped out. But then wait alittle bit and it starts to work fine. Its been going for the last couple of days, but its such a iffy thing. On the plus side it does look nice!

We're not getting another one.The same failure happened each time (no power whatsoever) and according to a quick internet search it is most likely the power supply board.

My opinion is that the setlist is just ok. No versions of songs here blow me away.The big plus for me is that one of the two covers is Cities (Talking Heads).

Honestly, it seems a little weak, and I can't figure out why. I really like Mikes groove, and it is a good Mike's groove but it feels like it needs more. I just can't put a finger on it. This is a good CD to have and I do listen to it offten but I never am quite satisfied with it. It just needs more. It feels like the band was playing well but didn't have a ton of energy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying","review":"\\"Cities\\" and \\"Lawn\\" boy could win an award for most annoying lyrics of the year. Hee hee, those, Phish guys are so funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype!","review":"Phish is one of the most overrated bands ever, their original songs lyrics are usually really dumb inside jokes that you won't get unless you have wasted a large amount of your time listening to these guys. The only good parts are when Trey and Page rock out hard on other peoples songs (Jesus Left Chicago, the Keith Richards' riff from Can you hear me knockin, and Doors the end rift with Careful with that Axe from Floyd). The bottom line-this is still better than 99% of commercial music and there is some virtuoso playing to be heard here but spend your money on some Hendrix, Galatic or the Doors instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome, unique instrument","review":"Love this thing.

Lessack's voice soars yet retains a softness, caressing rather than belting the notes and effectively merging lyrics and delivery. The opening song \\"Dreamers\\" sets the album's lyrical and musical tone--great music performed perfectly. Check Lessack's delivery of Manilow's \\"When October Goes.\\" If you don't sense the song's bittersweet combination of reminiscing and anticipation, you're not listening. Then listen to the album's centerpiece, \\"Dreamscape.\\" An incredible work that has been recorded by several artists; Lessack nails it, however, creating what other artists fall short of. Other favorites include \\"Storybook,\\" \\"Much at All,\\" \\"I'll Imagine You a Song,\\" and \\"Right as the Rain.\\" However, the album provides such a complete experience that listeners will want to listen to it as a unified work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful voice, except too many selections sound alike","review":"I enjoy Lee Lessack's voice; it's so smooth and comforting. I really adore his ''Moon Is a Harsh Mistress'' and ''Endless Night'' from ''Lion King.'' On the other side of the coin, there's a sameness to his ballad-heavy selections. And I wish his song choices were more original. For instance, Lessack does ''Storybook'' from ''Scarlet Pimpernel,'' a gorgeous tune, but it's a longtime signature song of Tom Andersen, who sings it with more urgency and thrilling high notes on his CD, ''The Journey.''"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with orchestrations","review":"This was not what I expected after reading the other reviews. The voice; not up to a professional and the orchestrations were at the very most uninspired.

When it was printing all garbled the tech support for Bixolon, who makes this for Samsung, said that my usb wire was a usb adapter and that the wire had software in it. So I got a new wire. The tech worked remotely on it for about an hour and still it didn't work. He said he thought that the printer probably needed a new interface card and that he could \\"sell\\" it to me.

The most interesting and useful section of the book is that pertaining to feats and Fighting styles. while some of them are clearly going to need some tweaking for my campaign, they have generally be thought through very well. The pantheon of Drow presented in Plot and Poison should covert easily enough to the standard D&D and Forgotten Realms pantheons. Over all, a useful book. the book is presented well, though the title font could have been a bit clearer as I find myself searching through the text to try and decipher the title. My favorite idea is the shield-based fighter, and I will be employing that in my campaign for sure. Good job guys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect","review":"Plot and Poison is an awesome book. When I read it, I was extremely impressed for the most part.Other than minor details like some of the Font, it was a great book.

It gives many interesting details for concocting Drow villains to challenge your PCs. It includes a number of presige classes, tons of feats, and a goodly amount of monster stats and templates for constructing some truly vile and deadly foes. It also has quite a few new magic items that are quite useful such as Boots of Spiderkind, Gloves of Deftness, Quiver of Sharpness. Details are given for deities of the Drow, but the usually accepted Goddess of the Drow is conspicuous by her absence, I suspect for copyright reasons. In her place is a different, but similar, deity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ughhh.....","review":"Once again, WotC's D20 system claims another casualty. This book carries on the crass misportrayal of the Drow as a race of dominatrixes in Boris Vallejo strap outfits, whose primary vise of their universe is sexual perversity. They mutilate the Drow pantheon, and while much of the artwork is indeed beautiful and well-done, there is a particular emphasis placed upon depicting pointless nudity and fetishist situations. Much of this book, I found sickening, and it wasn't the graphic descriptions of violence.That said, there ARE some useful things in the book, like a description of Drow name honorifics, and some of the aspects of society have thankfully not been tampered with by the fanboys. Some of the subraces are interesting, particularly the Drey, and the martial arts styles are a blast. Just.....avoid the bits about the Drow society centering around leather and whips, and please keep the mind out of the gutter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great but Beware","review":"I,ve been waiting years for this recording to be re-released. It's in my opinion there best album since Spooky Two. With veteran originals Gary Wright and Mike Harrison the vocals are really at there best. Mick Jones from the band Foreigner is with them on guitar and his musical influence is definitely felt. There's no writing credits on the sleeve and I no longer have the vinyl version but I remember that Jones helped on the writing. There isn't a bad song on the album.Here's where the bummer comes in. The sound is of bootlegquality. There's PLENTY of distortion. On two songs \\"This time around\\" and \\"Holy Water\\" the distortion really ruins the pleasure of listening to these great tunes. The album was put out on a German label called Progressive Line not the Edsel label which did a great job of remastering the other imports that I got of the Tooth. Still it's great to have and it's very listenable, just be ready to cringe from time to time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Karaoke- NOT","review":"The only song I wanted from the cd was Rockstar.

I'd heard such great things about the author that I was very very excited to start reading this book. I was more than let down by this book. I didn't even finish reading Angels, and that's rare for me. Don't get me wrong, the man's a talented writer, but a horrible storyteller, and if you don't have both you're worthless to me. I've been told that Denis Johnson's short stories and poems are better than his novels, so I plan on checking out Jesus' Son. If you want to learn how to write reading Denis Johnson would probably be helpful, but if you want to say something ignore this book. Read Ask the Dust by John Fante for great writing, and great storytelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful literature of the forlorn","review":"Beaten down and living for the moment, Denis Johnson's characters scrape out a wretched life of drugs and alcohol, pipe-dreams, and daydreams._Angels_ is a world of bus depots and scurrilous strangers, of people who can scarcely see past the haze of their cigarettes. It is a lonely world of randomness and drift. Some might say Johnson's characters aren't \\"3D\\", but that's because they're so richly flat. And when Johnson takes us into Jamie's descent into madness, it is a mind-bending trip.Yet somehow, Johnson's writing left me exhilerated and happy.

Once we figured that out, we discovered that NONE of the pictures that he took turned out. The pixel quality is so poor that it's worse than even e-mail quality.

Using these, that takes much of that problem away (any transporting in and out of sleeves, regardless of quality can damage cards if done very frequently). The quality of these sleeves is superior to most anything you'll find on the market at the moment. The plastic used is high quality and is soft and flexible. Clarity is also a big deal if you display cards openly as high-quality, clear sheets can really make mint cards \\"pop\\".

I've looked for it ever since my 8-track version wore out and was ecstatic to find it at Amazon. But it just ain't the same 25 years later, without the drugs. White Witch's proto-metal feels too pretentious these days. Still, I find myself humming some of the tunes and am glad to have it back in my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tool Tshirt","review":"I bought this shirt for my husband, and he really likes it.

Even if you are a die hard GBA/SP fan like me, I would still recommend a SNK Neo Geo. You can easily pick up games for this system at a fraction of the cost of other games. The graphics are really good, and the overall feel of the system in my hands is good. I really like the 8-way joy stick. Overall - just a very neat system that is often overlooked. SNK rules!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute Fun","review":"A great-looking consumer toy, this tactile, solid-feeling handheld benefits from having SNK's range of Neo Geo games behind it. Although quite obscure in the US and UK, the console has great back-up in Japan. Look for 'Faseli', in particular, and excellent 'Mechwarrior'-esque game.There are two drawbacks, though. On the one hand, you don't get a software bundle with the console, ...................................... Secondly, there's the Game Boy Colour (and forthcoming Game Boy Advance), which is cheaper, and has a wider range of titles."},{"rating":"1","title":"a gamers review","review":"i remember getting this from my friend back in the day i have some complaints well first of all the system's durrability drop it one time and bam! you will here something loose inside then my other complaint is that it only has like fighting games that are just knock offs of street fighter and mortal kombat my conclusion dont buy it it sucks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is one of the worst GPS units","review":"The coordinates are slow to load, I bought a GPS unit so I don't have to make U turns.

However, there were only a few songs that I liked the first time through on the new album. I consider \\"Musicforthemorningafter\\" one of my all time favorite CD's, and can listen to it over and over. I actually wasn't such a fan of the album my first time through, either, however I knew I absolutely loved \\"Strange Condition\\" and \\"Life on a Chain\\". With this latest effort, however, I feel that there is not any song, save, well save nothing, there is nary a song that is destined to be great, unfortunately. I do like PY's style, and can only hope that the next album can measure up to the first. But then again, he isn't Eddie Veddar!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Trite","review":"I bought this cd and sold it back the same day. MFTMA had it's sappy moments, but overall I think it is a great cd. It sounds like he is trying to make a hit out of every song on DIF.

Then i put it away for a while and listened to other things. Well finally...I tried again to discover what some call a \\"timeless gem\\".

Such a great debut could only add to the pressure of trying to create a follow-up album. Day I Forgot shows a more straight-rock record, with minimal use of any electronic elements that were used (and done so quite well) in mftma. PY sounds confident and more sure of himself this time around, and he has the songs to back it up (\\"Come Back Home\\", \\"Crystal Village\\", \\"Burrito\\", \\"Man in Uniform\\", \\"Long Way Down\\"...just to name a few). Definitely pick up a copy of this cd for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as good as the first - possibly better....","review":"I think this is an excellent follow-up to an incredible debut. I loved it after listening just once. What makes this album possibly better is that it is more upbeat than the previous one. My only complaint is that track #4, \\"Carlos...,\\" doesn't seem to fit in with the album, but I can live with that. Every song is very listenable and has a great sound!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Something Different","review":"I cannot call this album a sophomore slumper. It would have to be terrible to deserve that description. It's not terrible. Day I Forgot is a good listen. It's a little more raw, as opposed to the \\"commercial\\" catchiness of MFTMA (come on now, I LOVE MTMA, but it's true. \\"Strange Condition\\" was used in several movies). \\"Come Back Home\\" is probably going to be the first single off this album. It's a very good tune, sounding more akin to MFTMA. The rest of the album sounds very personal, almost like a week in the life of Pete Yorn. It seemed almost like I was listening to a singer who decided to write some songs about his life and make a CD. Pete Yorn is a very talented, obviously emotional singer. Day I Forgot is a great vehicle for his talents. He's showing us that he doesn't have to deliver grandiose, commercial productions like MFTMA every time he releases a CD, thankfully. I believe he's got more in store for those who enjoy his music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Since When Is Consistency A Crime?","review":"It is possible that Yorn decided to \\"play it safe\\" with his sophomore release, but \\"Day I Forgot\\" isn't anything close to a slump. If he would have made another \\"Music For The Morning After,\\" critics would have bitched. I he was to drastically change his style, he would be seen as a poser. It may take a few times to get acquainted with the new tunes, but this really is a classic album. Anyone who can't hear the quality of this project should take the time to listen, then relisten. For those of you considering purchasing this album, do it, then follow my advice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting Album","review":"I have both musicforthemorningafter and Day I Forgot, and I have to say that this is the superior album between the two. Sure, it's less alternative-indy-edgy-whatever, but this album will haunt you. After one spin I knew I was hooked. The really catchy stuff like \\"Come Back Home\\" and \\"Long Way Down\\" are good, but what gets me are the really melodic and sad tracks like \\"All at Once\\" and \\"So Much Work\\" and \\"Turn of the Century\\". I also like the rockish tracks \\"Carlos\\" and \\"Burrito\\", they make me smile. I couldn't get by without owning this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good....Just not as good","review":"Obviously not too much can measure up to MFTMA but this is a decent record. It does sound a little like a contractual obligation album though...not too much that's particularly ear-catching.

This album's pretty short...throw something extra on besides that ridiculous home video!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing sophomore","review":"Pete's debut MusicForTheMorningAfter was absolutely brilliant.

I thought it was a phenomenal album and even better than the first (though the first is phenomenal in its own right.) If you liked the first album you have a good chance of at least enjoying this one. \\"Day I forgot\\" is a little more melodic and less edgy than \\"music for the morning after.\\" Like the previous album all of the songs are very enjoyable but there are some real gems.

It is worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Music for the Morning After here","review":"A bit of a let down after the fantastic debut album.Lyrically simple and trite,musically a pale shadow of his previous effort.The stuff that sounds the best is reminiscent of Morning After.Check out Josh Rouse,a similar artist with three fantanstic CDs and the last was a masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment, but with hope","review":"Pete Yorn's 2001 album \\"Musicforthemorningafter\\" was a masterpiece of a debut. It seemed to exist on a Zen plane of music--never hyper-saccharine, never mindless, always imaginative--which is amazing for a freshman effort. Unfortunately, \\"Day I Forgot\\"'s songs seem to either unimaginatively update their predecessors, or they become either \\"emo\\" or mechanically-written rock songs. Keeping in mind that further listenings may narrow this two-year chasm, I would tentatively keep the possibility open for another star or two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Day I Forgot is unfortunately easily forgotten...","review":"I have had this album since it was released back in April 2003 and feel it's only fair now to give it a proper review after having absorbed it for quite a while.After highly anticipating Pete Yorn's sophomore album, \\"Day I Forgot\\" didn't immediately grab me at first like his brilliant debut album \\"musicforthemorningafter\\" did, but didn't want to give up on DIF too soon for the sake that my expectations were probably too high.It has now been 7 months and DIF unfortuantely just doesn't have the same lasting power and impact that Pete's brilliant first album has to make you want to keep going back to it.Other than 3-4 decent songs on the album, Day I Forgot doesn't seem to make its way back to the CD player anymore as it has instead found it's way to the shelf.Hopefully Pete's 3rd album will have the same power as his debut."},{"rating":"1","title":"sophmore slump","review":"just another sophmore slump offering after a decent debut, nothing catchy here, and if you don't beleive me check out how many are selling (or not) in the used section of amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Sophomore","review":"Pete's debut MusicForTheMorningAfter was absolutely brilliant.

The first two songs are fine and then it's all downhill from there. I have listened to this album a few times, but it has never really caught my attention. His first album was much memorable. What is up with the song about the burrito? Lyrically this is pretty bloody awful. The blush is off for me. The honeymoon is over."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Day","review":"Much criticism has been awarded this latest disc from the freshest ear in contemporary Pop/Rock. For those who feel this disc is a watered down derivative of Yorn's last album, and therefore not a progressive step, they are missing out on one of the sharpest pieces of music released this year. Interestingly enough, no one points out the constant retreads of critical darlings Weezer or Radiohead, but then again, Yorn just might not be weird enough to qualify as cool. Props to Yorn for making music that is listenable, vibrant, lyrically succinct, and melodically driven. Crystal Village and Come Back Home are highlights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeper","review":"Geez, you'd think they were talking about Jack Johnson with all these \\"mediocre\\" reviews.

Pete gives us song after catchy, discovered song. The album is as cohesive as the first (and probably a little more so; it manages to be substantial without sprawling).Pete is a great songwriter and musician and has created another emotive, one-of-a-kind album. I can't wait for the next one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not meet expectations","review":"To give you a little background, I once said to a friend, \\"If I could have made any album ever, I would have made musicforhtemorningafter\\" (Pete Yorn's debut album). Sure, the statement is a little strong and I may have been drunk, but the point remains: PY's first album was incredibly beautiful, earnest, and just about note-perfect.This album is not. I had high expectation for this album--they were not met. There a couple very good songs, several mediocre ones, some poor joints, and 'Burrito.' The very fact that PY wrote a song called 'Burrito' and sings it with a straight-face means I should get my money back. I mean, listen people: the song is called Burrito! Unbelieveable.So there it is. The 'Intro,' 'Come Back Home,' 'Crystal Village,' and 'Man in Uniform' are good additions to the PY oeuvre. The rest is unnecessary--just like this album. Save your cash and check out The Shins, Interpol, or British Sea Power if you want something interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Special","review":"I'm not sure where the buzz about Pete Yorn comes from. His voice and his songs are average at best. He's also fairly limited as a singer, using the same monotonous vocal style on every song. It's interesting to me that record labels rave on and on about how an artist must possess something original and special to get a contract and then sign someone as mediocre as Pete Yorn. Do yourself a favor...skip Day I Forgot and get the new Radiohead's new Hail To The Thief CD instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUCK!","review":"Musicforthemorningafter was a great CD.

Mike has a very consistent album, with each song taking you on a musical journey that you won't regret.

Usually Sony has reasonably good products, but this one really is a piece of trash. It is advertised as a recorder for lectures and meetings, and as a college student, I thought this could help me take better notes. Wrong!!! This recorder can only take sound straight from your mouth into the mic at close range, but if you are interested in anything other than your own voice, you're out of luck with this model. I tried it out in one of my classes - a class held in a small room with no windows in the basement of a library (don't get quieter than that!!) and the recorder managed to garble every word of the professor, while picking up an amazing amount of roaring noise which is apparently either above or below the human hearing level, since it seems to not exist in the real world! Sony should be ashamed!! Please, if you intend to buy a recorder for lectures or meetings, don't buy this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent recorder with great capacity","review":"I bought one of these probably a year or two ago and at the time the 150 minute capacity far exceeded any others in the price range.

However, I normally keep the recorder hidden in a jacket pocket or in a pocket in my wife's purse, and it still does a decent job! I especially like the real-time clock (so I know the exact date and time of the recording) although it would be nice to have a seconds counter. (The elapsed time counter will show seconds but the clock does not.) Battery life is good but nowhere near the 10 hours of recording life listed. Buy some rechargeable AAAs, you'll need 'em.

It's attractive, it stacks, it pours well, and it's light weight. I have not used the lid, however I appreciate the inclusion as it would be useful for some people I'm sure. Now that I've had the set about six month, I am noticing that the red lettering (which is a little hard to see anyway) is wearing off. Up until now, my biggest complaint would be the red lettering. But I can see that the set will eventually be useless as far as accurate measuring is concerned. I'm very disappointed as I looked around a long time before choosing this set, which was not inexpensive. Also be aware that it cannot be washed in the dishwasher, nor can it go into a microwave. Needing to handwash was okay with me, but the microwave restriction was limiting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has many problems.....","review":"I bought these because I wanted a liquid measuring cup larger than 2 cups and the stacking ability appealed to me.First it is a little strange to be able to peer down into the cup and see the measurement. The plus is that it is on the side as well.The lid only fits the 4 cup measurer which for me was the cup I have used the least.The most upsetting aspect of these cups is that the red writing has not held up. I have never washed them in the dishwasher and yet the writing on the most frequently used 1 cup measurer is now illegible which has made it useless for measure.After this experience, I have decided that glass still makes the best liquid measuring cups.Do not waste your money on this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"wearing out","review":"I like Zyliss products. We have the garlic press, pizza cutter, chip clips, etc. But these measuring cups haven't held up. They're not microwave-safe, which is fine. But they do claim to be dishwasher safe. But after less than a year of regular use, the measurements are wearing off the cups. And apparently this isn't because we put them in the dishwasher, because another reviewer, who hand-washes his, is having the same problem. I'm disappointed.

However within a couple months, all the red text and measuring lines have rubbed off of the cups, rendering them useless. There aren't even notches or raised numbers underneath the red print, so there is no way to salvage them as measuring cups. I never put them in the dishwasher, and used them just for home cooking and baking purposes....hardly abused them. I see another reviewer had the same problem with the print rubbing off. Zyliss should invest in better manufacturing and design before putting a product on the market. Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be tempted to buy these because they are Zyliss","review":"I am so frustrated with these measuring cups. Yes, they stack nicely, and yes, they are easy to read. But the design of the pour spout is sub-par. It is tolerable on the 1 cup, but it is nearly impossible to pour from the 4 cup without the liquid dribbling down the side of the cup and spilling. I have tried pouring quickly and pouring slowly ... it is just too much effort for a measuring cup! The lettering is wearing off and the acrylic has cracked in spots (although they don't leak). I've had them for a little over a year and they look awful. I have loved most of the Zyliss products I've bought, but these are awful.

I am horrified at Andrews' views so much that this is the first book for which I am writing a review. I am a born again Christian, I know my bible and love the Lord but and am sickened by Christians who take this viewpoint, and sad to think that other people think this is how Christians operate. Andrews' advice to a friend about his daughter, and the description of him and a male teacher \\"FORCING\\" a 6th grade boy to submit to corporal punishment 2 or 3 times in a row, then each time forcing the boy to put his arms around Andrews' neck to hug him back, is SICK. MY ADVICE IS - DON'T BUY THIS BOOK. I cringe at Christians like this, and feel very sorry for their families and the people who are influenced by or affected by their viewpoints. The only reason I gave this book one star is because I couldn't give it zero or minus stars.

I expect to get about 2 years of use in a 1200 gallon fish pond operating a waterfall and pumping about 7 feet vertically to a pressurized filter. They have a high flow rate and put a good volume of water through the waterfall. The pump does have a tendency to clog with acorns, plant roots, leaves, etc. and has to be cleaned weekly to maintain volume. There is no way to use a prefilter since the inlet is a number of slots in the bottom of the pump. It will shut off if there is not a sufficient flow through the pump.

The replacement seems to work, but it skips songs still unlike the other two MP3-CD players(which never skip). First of all, I am disappointed in the review that [Amazon.com] gave because it says that you can use AA batteries. There is no external battery case to use AA batteries like the iMP-350(Sonicblue might sell it as an accessory later). This player does not always recognize my MP3-CDs like the SP250 and iMP-350. The only good thing is the sound quality is the best out of all 3 MP3-CD players. The rechargeable batteries that did come with the player take 6 hours to recharge.

It has now been almost a year since I sent a broken player in for warranty repair or replacement.

In a nutshell it was merely an abridged version of the aforementioned book and added NO NEW information. It was easy to read, and easy to follow, but omitted some of the basic background information that their other book included.

Another important fact about this book is that it is an extremely careless attempt. David Stuart Ryan seems content in skimming over most events he recounts rather than attempting to discuss any of them in depth. So what��s the big secret according to Mr. Ryan? He offers nothing more than a pseudo-psychological, amateur, freudian analysis. Ryan claims that since John Lennon didn��t grow up in a ��normal�� family setting he was perpetually in search of an adept mother and father figure (Cynthia, Yoko and Brian Epstein served as candidates). On another note, if the zodiac��s your thing, you��ll love this book and will be drooling over descriptions such as ��Cynthia��s virgoan faithfulness,�� and John��s ��hedonistic libran inclinations.�� Enough already!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a miracle!","review":"I never imagined I would see this \\"albumn\\" available as a CD.

My only problem with it is that it is written for women. I understand that Brenda Waggoner specializes in ministry to women and that this book would make a great study book for a ladies' reading group. I also understand that it touches on an area concerning women where there has been much erroneous teaching. However, it has been my experience that struggles with dominance and submission are not gender specific. Many women have control issues and many men are recessive. Also, while the majority of illustrations in this book are gender specific, the Scriptures, quotes, and outline certainly are not. This book would be of value to people of both sexes. Many people, both male and female, both dominant and recessive, could benefit from wrestling with the statements made in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your ordinary Christian self-help","review":"With passionate caring, Brenda Waggoner delves into a dense area of Christian struggle. Not just for women, and not just on the obvious topic suggested in the title, this book probes your heart. Going deeper than most self-help Christian books, you can receive guidance from Brenda if you are ready to spend real time with each chapter. She offers scripture to meditate upon, and questions that initiate your own inner exploration. Perhaps most importantly, she opens up her own life struggles to the reader. She comes to the book not just as the therapist that she is, but as the woman she is, who became the therapist. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"about the book","review":"its great and is very educative.makes one really understand the word racism and prejudice"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Renata","review":"To say that these 12 disks contain some of the finest singing ever committed to disk is no exaggeration, but a simple statement of fact. Historical fact. In the 100 years (more or less) that Puccini operas have been around, only a few sopranos in each generation have been the equal of Renata Tebaldi. One cannot objectively say that anyone has surpassed her. Some opera lovers find her peerless in many of these performances. Personal tastes in singers vary, but no one ever sang these roles better. Few anywhere nearly so well. There is not a single note on any of these recordings that is not heartfelt to the core of her being. Like Maria Callas and Franco Corelli, she was luminous, gargantuan in her talent that personified an age. This is one of the great compilations."},{"rating":"2","title":"if you like gabber you should own this Album","review":"Originally i found this album several years back in a drum-n-bass music store in NYC.The heavy basslines and speedcore drums make this album a must own for fans of hardcore/Gabber.With Featured artists, Rob G, lenny D, DJ Pual, Nightmare man.This album was almost impossible to find for years and remains one of my favorite hardcore albums to date.A word of warning though if you don't have a decent audio set up this album can blow speakers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"I loved this book.

At first, it seems to be a rather typical P.I. story, featuring a stalwart hero with an overdeveloped sense of justice a la Mike Hammer. But slowly, over the first half of the book, Zeltserman starts revealing ugly little bits of the \\"hero\\"'s psychosis... and by the time you're halfway through FAST LANE you begin to realize you're reading about a real messed-up bastard. As it all plays out toward the inevitable end and Johnny Lane's predicament gets worse and worse, you almost want to cover your eyes. This is pure psycho-noir here, expertly told, as if Jim Thompson or Charles Willeford had taken a stab at a Mike Shayne type novel.

And when I finished, I was nothin' but confused. Scott Hahn's audio Bible studies have changed that. In fact, his works played a large role in my conversion many years ago. The beauty of this series is the duo of Scott Hahn and Jeff Cavins. For part of each of the thirteen sessions, Jeff takes you through the Bible in chronological order, concentrating on 14 books of narrative history. Then Scott dives deeper into the theological meaning of the stories, drawing on the Catechism, the Early Fathers, and early Rabbinic literature, and present day scholarship, including his own.Let these two wonderful Bible explorers lead you on a journey through salvation history you'll never forget.

Not for beginners. Has the merit of not being too verbose. It deals mainly with the syntax of C++. And, yes, while it certainly covers OOP, this may be why some other reviewers say it is not a good OOP book. The thing is, if you have start explaining the language at the lowest level, syntax, then this necessarily takes up space in the book.What some may notice is the lack of diagrams, whether UML or flowcharts or whatever. There is relatively little coverage of higher level design, from an OOP standpoint or any other, for that matter.Plus, unlike some more recent programming books, which use multicolours on the text pages to draw the reader's attention, this is very much a traditional text, in plain black and white. Nothing wrong with that, but some of you expecting a more \\"popular\\" style should look elsewhere. But if you knuckle down and read this text, you can benefit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time or money","review":"I was required to buy this book for a class. I was very disappointed by it from the very first chapter. The author throws up some really convoluted code, and then barely explains what he is doing. Rather than presenting a problem and suggesting how to use C++ to solve it, the code itself is presented as the problem to be solved ,as in, \\"try to figure out what I was thinking when I wrote these lines of code\\". Even the typical \\"Hello World\\" program was much more complicated than necessary, giving the impression that C++ I/O is more difficult than it really is. I ended up buying other books to complete the course, and would not recommend this book to anyone trying to learn object oriented program concepts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Stack Up","review":"This text is definately not for new programmers, but even seasoned programmers will be lost in space. The author takes a very simple approach to some topics, and then quickly goes into examples that do not make sense and have no meaningful explanation (if any explanation at all). I have read texts on Object Oriented programming and C++, and this one fails to unite the two in any meaningful way. There is a healthy sampling of exercises at the end of each chapter, but I could not find the solutions anywhere online. I emailed the author and asked where I could get the solutions, and he graciously replied. Unfortunately, he sent only a short message that said there were no solutions. Did he mean the exercises are unsolvable or that the published solutions are not available? This response sums up the content of this book. I suggest looking elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look elsewhere","review":"This book is one of the most poorly contstructed quasi-textbooks I have seen. I had to buy it for a C++ class, and have found the following:1) The text does a bad job of explaining topics fully.2) The end-of-chapter questions are written so poorly that they are not able to be done without finding out their hidden meaning.3) The appendices are incomplete.If you need a real C++ or C book see Deitel and Deitel and leave this waste of trees alone. I find myself constantly having to refer to \\"C++ How To Program\\" to figure out my programming projects, and it comes through every time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book but not for Beginners","review":"Before tackling this book I would suggest having a basic understanding of the C++ Programming Language.

The author mistakenly assumes that the reader is a highly advanced computer scientist, thereby leaving novice programmers totally confused. Techinal terms are bandied about with inadequate definition. The author finds it more important to throw out concept after concept rather than attempting to explain each one clearly and thoroughly. As such the entire book reads more like a research paper than something one would expect to learn from. The chapters are poorly organized. Examples start out attempting to showcase a concept but almost always end up including something that hasn't been covered before. It is often necessary to refer to another book on the subject just to understand something in Pohl's book -- which begs the question, why use Pohl's book in the first place? There are definitely much better books on the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please...DO NOT get this book wrong.","review":"Don't get this book wrong. This is not a book that teach about C++ language or a reference. This is a book about Object-Oriented Programming in C++ language. This means you will need to know C++ well enough before read it.The contents of this book is fine, cover a lot of OOP ideas, and could be use as a good OOP tutorial, since it provided a way of think in OOP.For readers who said this book is imcomplete about function declarations, please make sure that you really read this one, not just skimmed pass it. The function of page 7 is actually the declaration, he defined it later on page 9. And the \\"hello world\\" compiled and ran fine with my VC++ compiler, as well as the GNU compiler on Linux.

Vinnie has strayed a bit from an all-neo classical writing style, but the change is a step forward in my opinion. On this CD, Vinnie has struck a perfect balance of neo-classical shredding, well constructed melodies, driving grooves and a sweet mixture of tones on his guitar. It's nice to hear such a variety of songs, even the acoustic \\"Never Been To Barcelona\\", is a strong link of this rock-n-roll chain. Vinnie is a SUPER nice guy as well! Buy this CD!

If not for the music, then the artwork on the cover!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More Typical Shred-Fest","review":"It's hard to understand the enthusiasm that I've seen so far of this album by the reviewers here. They must all be hardcore fans who have followed Vinnie Moore since the 80's. I still have Mind's Eye and Time Odyssey as benchmarks for what neo-classical is (as well as Yngwie's Rising Force and MacAlpine's Maximum Security). This album is just your typical neo-classical fusion fare with mega amount of chops, bland melodies, and PERCEIVED feelings or emotions based on individual taste. I, for one, do not hear anything really worthwhile here. Vinnie Moore might have as much or even more speed and physical chops than Vai or Satriani, but certainly not in the brain or in the heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"By far Vinnie's best work...","review":"The Maze is surpassed only by Passion and Warfare as the finest guitar work ever recorded.This CD is simply phenomenal. Vinnie shines on this CD like never before.While Vinnie has always demonstrated a precision that is second to none, his playing has lacked a certain emotional quality, that very few players can bring forth in their work. On The Maze, Vinnie captures that emotion on every track.His ability to incorporate completely different styles throughtout the CD, and even blend them flawlessly within a given track, is simply brilliantIf I had one complaint about this CD, it would have to be, that I believe Vinnie borrows to heavily from Steve Vai on certain tracks. If you are a Vai fan, you will pick up on that immediately. It is for this reason, that the reviewer who claimed that Vinnie blows away Steve Vai, is someone who's opinion should not be taken seriously.If you play guitar, or even if you love guitar, buy this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A-MAZE-ING","review":"Simple put, an all around, astonishing, amazing instrumental album. I'm not a big listener of all out guitar albums, really Vinnie Moore and Steve Morse are the only one's i can withstand, all others are just show-offs. But Moore has technique, charisma, and a knack for killer songs with out all the faster than lightning fingerwork. Yeah, faster is good, but make some sense of the songs. Vinnie's finest since Mind's Eye, and good support from fellow shredder and labelmate Tony MacAlpine on keyboards. A must own for all rock lovers"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Return of Vinnie","review":"After releasing a poor cd, Moore releases \\"The Maze\\" with collaborations from the Monsters Tony Macalpine on the keys, Shane Galaas on drums, and super bassist Dave Larue.

She then went on and told me that Dean does not work on children anymore nor anyone under the age of 18. She said she would mention it to him though and call me back. I waited around all day with no call back. I figured eventually she would call back and give me an answer one way or the other. I never got a call back. I was left with hard feelings. The person who gave me his office number did tell me about the cost. It is very very expensive. He only has office hours a few days a week now.

Having lived in Brooklyn I very quickly noticed references to non-existent places such as a \\"tunnel running from the Prospect Expressway to Ocean Parkway.\\" I overlooked these as possible artistic license. But when Kraft tells the story of how, in 1973, his friend Buddy tries to get him to profit from the \\"talking car\\" by going to Atlantic City to \\"hit the jackpot\\" I drew the line. Kraft says he \\"knew intuitively\\" that his gift should not be used in such a manner. Well, Mr. Clairvoyant, your spirits should have told you that casino gambling didn't even exist in Atlantic City until 1979! What a disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A touch of money maybe.......","review":"I read the book only because at one time I had an appointment with him and the process was to read the book before your visit. I also saw the movie. Impressed by neither. In fact, the movie was incredibly insulting to anyone with reasonable intelligence.I was aware that for 2 visits (which I was scheduled for) would entail a large amout of money a visit and was only payable in CASH. While I was feeling hopeless from a devastating jaw injury which left me with multiple problems...I wasn't stupid. As a true believer in God...I was certain he wouldn't give an ability like that to someone who would charge such outrageous fees.

He is able to give realistic advice on how to encourage your children to learn the values you want them to without preaching to the reader (parent) his own values. The book is very readable with interesting and helpful scenarios. I couldn't put the book down and even read sections to my husband, who will be reading it soon. The illustrations are very creative. I think this book should be read by every parent and parent-to-be. It is a great gift for expecting parents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Music","review":"There is no melody, no rythym, no meter, no lyrics, etc... There is just a long, slow, annoying drone. 3 long songs all droned. It is the sonic equivalent of painting on a canvas with a basketball. If you think that's art, then you probably think this is music. One thing I noticed though, is that it seems to be effective in keeping the cockaroaches away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!","review":"This will be the third time I have tried to post a review of this unacceptably bad album, and I suppose I have been too harsh, because neither of my previous efforts have been posted. Lets keep this one simple. This is not music, plain and simple. I purchased this due to glowing recommendations from other reviewers on this site, and was terribly disappointed. It basically consists of massively distorted (and detuned) guitar and bass monotonously droning on and on for nearly an hour with no coherence, structure, or anything approximating the actual ability to play an instrument. Call it performance art, experimental noise, whatever. It's simply not music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome GPS holder","review":"I had another type of GPS holder and it kept releasing my GPS on the dashboard.

And the ones that peaked at #54 or lower are just as strong as the No. 1s and Top 10 hits on here. It is funky, soulful, danceable and spiritual. All the hits such as Booti Call, Girlfriend/Boyfriend, No Diggety (which they won a Grammy Award for), Before I Let You Go, and many others are on here. Perhaps the most dramatical song on here is the last one The Lord Is Real, which is so soulful, moving, had me crying, and sounds as if it was recorded in a church. This shows the group at their best and Dave Hollister can sure be SAANGING it at the closing part of that song! Excellent closing to a compilation album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like","review":"I was familiar with this group and enjoyed some of their songs. However, this just didn't do it for me.

Though a good tune without good lyrics can leave you feeling empty, Davis too often has good lyrics without good tunes that are better thought about than listened to. Still, \\"Lullaby\\" and \\"Blame it on Me\\" are worth a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intoxicatingly genuine","review":"Sweet - with depth, heartfelt and genuine.

It has definitely found a special place in my heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money - buy the single.","review":"It is hard to understand how a woman with such an interesting voice could create such an uninteresting CD. 32 Flavors is definitely worth checking out, but by the single and save yourself some money.

I had \\"Blame It On Me\\" for 4 years and only liked 2 songs up until that point. Now, it's one of my favorites. She's one of the most underrated artists out today. It took a while to grow on me, but I'm glad it did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Morning CD","review":"The first time I had ever listened to Alana Davis was on the Mod Squad Soundtrack. To be honest I believe she was the best track on the entire CD. Her voice both soulful and hypnotic enticed me to purchase Blame It On Me. It is one of the few CDs I can listen to from beginning to end, 32 Flavors being my favorite track. I typically play it in the morning as it is the perfect wake up, stretch, and sing in the shower CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blame it on me","review":"This cd is is the only cd that I own that I would never ever get rid off.. so get it, it is really really good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"save your $$$$$$$$$$","review":"I wholeheartedly agree with \\"raging fish Mike\\" that her covers are much better than her own original songs.

It'll be way more satisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great gift for your girlfriends","review":"I buy this as a gift for my music loving girl friends. Soulful, yet friendly, a cd to put in your car and have at your fingertips when you need to feel. Her interpretation of 32 Flavors is right on (but check out Ani DeFranco's if you want a real jolt.) Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"why all the hype?","review":"one of my friends RAVED about this album and told me i had to go get it or i was missing out, so i did. let me tell you, i should have bought it used for $1.80. i also should have realized that when people are willing to sell back a CD for less than two bucks, there's a reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocrity Defined","review":"I had heard good things about Alana Davis' work, and eventually made my way down to the record store to pick up a copy. Hmmm. Well that was a mistake. Her style is inoffensive and fairly bland and her lyrics border on teenage poetry. Her voice is not bad, yet she does not seem to channel it in any direction except for that of a mundane background cocktail singer. She does have potential, but she lacks originality or gravitas. Unless you'd be happy paying to hear a small-town Edie-Brickell cover band, I'd avoid this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A CD that should definitely be in your collection","review":"Alana Davis is one of the greatest jazzy folk singers around...I have been a huge fan since I heard her debut with 32 Flavors. She has an incredible voice. It's hard to imagine singers like Joss Stone get more attention when Alana Davis surpasses Stone's talent, by far. Once you hear this CD you'll understand. Buy it and then get Fortune Cookies, you will love them both!"},{"rating":"1","title":"completely flat and uninspiring","review":"I do think that Alana Davis has a very pretty voice, but someone should teach her how to use it. I don't think she sings so much as drones, she seems to have no vocal range at all as far as I can tell. The songs all sound exactly the same to me - flat and boring. Even as background music this album annoys the crap out of me. The sad thing is that I can tell people are going to view this as a good album, and that makes me sick. Get some originality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruined it","review":"Alana ruined Ani DiFranco's \\"32 Flavors.\\" I'm a huge Ani fan, and listened to 32 flavors by Alana, and was thoroughly disappointed at how different and... how much worse it was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go and get this NOW!","review":"Stunning music and smooth vocals! All the songs are good. This is not a comercial pop album about love and the stuff you hear on MTV. I would recommend this over Alicia Keys, even though that is a good album as well. She doesn't have your typical radio-friendly lyrics, but they match well with her singing and the music and are a welcome change from the stuff you hear on the radio. There are some life lesons to be learned in her song but I prefer not to analyse the lyrics to much and just enjoy the song as a whole. At the very least, the music makes you feel good without going into cliched phrases.Did I mention she plays all the acoustic guitar parts as well as wrote/co-wrote all of the songs! How many MTV friendly artist can say they write and play their own songs. I can't wait to buy the new album. If you like Lisa Loeb, Alana Davis is a more soulfull version with a voice to match! This is one album I'll be listening to for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Promising Debut","review":"The songs on Davis' album are as diverse as her referenced \\"32 Flavors.\\" A personal work, the album allows listeners to walk alongside Davis as she makes her emotional journeys and transformations. The album content is diverse and it reveals the multi-faceted aspects of Davis's heart and mind. This is a promising debut from the singer/songwriter; her future projects will have high expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mismanaged","review":"Alana has potential and could do so much better than this and her other albums. Her voice is good, but WHO lets her do so many covers? Also WHO lets her choose those album covers? I do not blame her for this. She's just been given bad advice by some idiot(s). You wonder why she hasn't taken off? Because she hasn't found a manager or producer who will take her to the big league."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Proper Place in History","review":"Alana Davis has no soul and no range. How dare anyone compare her to Joni Mitchell?!?!? I think saying she is a poor man's Norah Jones would be generous."},{"rating":"1","title":"32 flavors...","review":"Alana definitely has some talent, but the fact that she goes and covers an Ani DiFranco song fundamentally without RBR's permission, and then turns it into a teeny bopper hit is a bit argh, shall we say angering.

There are numerous sightings or locations listed, but only extremely brief details about each (usually a couple of sentences).There are some statements that make me think the author wasn't too critical or thoughtful in screening the information listed--In one case, witnesses are quoted as hearing the whistle of a sailing ship blow. Don't count on being able to locate specific places, even for listings such as stone circles. Very little information or specifics are provided in most cases.As the previous reviewer stated, Mexico is ignored. The rich heritage of \\"mysteriousness\\" in Hawaii is also ignored, though this is more geographically justifiable.

From Masafumi's wonderfully sung and emotionally written verses and choruses to the heavily driven yet irresistibly catchy guitar rhythms, the band's sophomore outing proves what many people knew before; AKG are a musical force to be reckoned with, with the power of a 100 watt freight train backing them up.

However, Jo Clayton did do a good job of getting the reader involved with the character (it doesn't hurt that she's a really sexy fem with lots of power).

You have to lift them a bit sometimes to slide them in, which can be difficult for small children. But it's not a huge deal. The drawers didn't slide very well at first but I took them out and rubbed a candle over all the parts and now the wax helps them slide really well.

He is learning to blow glass. Very interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black and White pictures?","review":"Quite a disappointment. Most of the pictures are in black and white, you can hardly see any detail. I really like looking at finished glassbeads and sculptures. But this gives me no inspiration at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Just OKAY!","review":"To the naive public this book is great! Riddled with typos and inconsistant captions this book is not ideal for understanding formal flameworking. The book includes information about the masters and their techniques but trivializes their skill by including no-names and wanna-be's along side. A good amount of important technical information is provided, but through a string of often choppy inconsistant paragraph fragments. This is an excellent PICTURE BOOK leaving a lot to be desired from the academic artisan. Is a great reference for suppliers. In many cases the information falls short of being cohesive and understandable. Recommended for the glass-goer. Recommended for the amateur glassblower (for inspiration). Has popular appeal void of substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stepping back in time","review":"Reading Karen's book, \\"Remembering Woolworth's\\" is an opportunity to step back in time for those of us lucky enough to have known Woolworth's while growing up. I loved visiting the fish and canaries, drinking milkshakes at the counter, and looking through the make-up dept. Reading her book is like strolling down the aisles again, bringing back a flood of nostalgic memories! Alas, a shopping experience too soon gone in our American culture. It is fascinating to know the history and the vision behind this successful business. In depth research and a great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dream theater meets Deicide meets Yes..Great Album","review":"Yes Into Eternity have definately crossed all boundries of music(metal)and done it very very well.They have managed to keep just enough variety for both progressvie rock fans and death metal fans alike.This album is full of classic riffs(amazing solos),amazing drum work,out of this world chorus's and just about anything else you can conjure up.You never know what direction one song will take after the other,the singing goes from gruff snarls,to raspy screams to Glenn Bentonish growl's,then goes straight into a chorus that would have Geoff Tate(queensryche) and Jamies Labrie(dream theater)shaking in there shoes.The harmonies in each song manage to sound different but you can still hear the uniqueness of each one.This is a great album from beginning to end,so if you like progressive metal with a more brutal melodic touch then this album is definatley for you,it'll please DT fans and Death metal fans all the same,so pick it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine thought..but it doesn't work","review":"Some things just doesn't mend.I'm talking about the strange mix of growl and clean and extremly light vocals...To me it just sounds goofy and it's pretty laughable..Strange contrasts is NOT the greatest way in creating music..the only extreme band that has managed to make something good with it is Opeth.But as my topic regards, the whole idea and content of this record is a fine effort, and therefore it can escape with two rating stars..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best of it's genre...","review":"OK, so Into Eternity are Canadian (lol)... with that in mind, they're good (I guess), but they are so negative. I listen to a lot of metal, and most of it (if not all of it) is negative, but Into Eternity are just trying to fit into the genre, and they are kind of fake. I think that this release would've been awesome without the annoying sing-along style of singing that they embrace to the fullest. The sad part is that on their self titled release, their lead singer sings higher than the chick that is featured in the song... just keep that in mind if you are thinking about buying this CD. I would highly recommend Night in Gales - Nailwork instead of this CD if you want to listen to catchy metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent","review":"This album would have easily been 5 stars if Into Eternity would have dropped the wannabe-death metal vocals (sounded closer to metalcore/hardcore screaming to me, which is obviously very lame.)Other than that, very good release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like...a dream....","review":"This band is sooo damn awsome. They combine elements of all my fav. types of metal to form the perfect style, but it dosnt sound like most genre bending bands do, it flows perfectly.

This is an amazing prog/death album, I cant imagine a true metal fan not liking this cd..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good Mother's Day gift (or any gift for that matter)","review":"I recieved this iron as a gift. First 5 seconds are great: it's fun to play with the up and down system, but after that it just get's in the way! The system makes the iron a lot bigger than normal irons, and a lot heavier too. It also takes a lot of effort to move because it's so bulky. I do not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feet are a nusance!","review":"I do not like this iron. I am a quilter and use irons regularly, so I thought i would give this iron a try. I am very dissapointed. When setting the iron to the side, you have to make sure it's dead-center on the ironing board, otherwise, it will flip right off the board. The back foot was resting half-way on the board causing it to become unstable. But that is not the worst of it. The water tank capacity is good for about half a shirt (but perhaps that's because it leaked the entire time)! Even with the iron set to the hottest setting and the steam lever turned to off, it still dripped! Once I even came back to my ironing board and the entire reservoir had emptied onto my ironing board and floor!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks water on clothes","review":"Lifting mechanism is clever and worked fine for us. However the leaking water and inconsistent steam was awful. If you move it quickly as you iron, water can splash out, and even if you go slow it will dribble. Sometimes it will start steaming uncontrollably regardless of what steam setting you are on. Way to take a nuisance chore, and make it awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"LEAKY IRON","review":"I bought this iron and I am so disappointed. The water just runs out of it. Like others I read reviews about this happening and I chose to ignore it and bought it anyway. Now I am going to have to buy a different iron. I wish I could contact the makers and complain to them big time about this problem. Water also leaks out of the Rowenta irons as well. I have had 2 of them and I wish I knew what kind to buy that actually works good and does not leak. Please be warned!! I wish I had paid more attention to the comments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with Oliso Iron","review":"I am an avid sewer & crafter; purchased the most expensive of this line; the iron blew up after 20 days, sent back for replacement which I think all they did was replace the cord & sent back to me; does not steam well or will not get hot. Really disappointed in its performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes Ironing Easy and More Fun","review":"This is the nicest iron I've ever used. It seems very well made and sturdy. The blue see-through water reservoir gives it a very modern look. It glides really nicely on the fabric. The steam seems more consistent and stronger than other irons I've used in the past. The \\"steam burst\\" feature gives a very powerful blast of steam that is great for tough wrinkles. The Auto-Lift feature is really cool and slick. It made the task of ironing more fun...a smart, high-tech iron! I believe the auto-lift feature definitely improves the safety of ironing too. The Auto-Lift feature is my favorite part because it is something different that I never experienced before. It is nice to just push the iron to the side without having to stand it up vertically. I also really like the status light, the way it uses different colors and flashes to indicate the iron's status. I find this very useful because it lets me know exactly when the iron is hot enough to use...no more guessing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your time and money by NOT buying this iron","review":"I have nothing positive to say about this iron. It weighs a ton and, it steam is inconsistant, and the lifting feet pop out intermittently.The first iron I recieved was defective. I didn't heat up. I spent a lot of time going back and forth with this no-name manufacturer until they finally sent me another one. I received it yesterday, and this one leaks water all over the place! So have to return this defective iron too!I sincerely question the positve reviews on this site. They are all so glowing and nothing seems ever seems to be wrong with the iron. When there is really nothing to like about it. For example, how did the previous reviewer know there is a newer version coming out? That's suspicious! Where do this figure for cutting your ironing time in half??? It doesn't iron your clothes for you, and titling an iron on it's end isn't any slower than waiting for lifting feet to come out. I don't trust this company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"I have a retreat facility and I also teach quilting, and in the last 8 months, I've purchased 8 of these irons for classes. So far 6 have had to be returned. Some lasted for a few months, some only a few hours. First they would stop going up/down, then they'd stop heating. Nothing unusual about the way they were used. When I returned the first 4, the company replaced them quite happily, and said something had been 'revamped' and the replacements wouldn't give me any problems. After 1 month, 2 of the replacements have died. I'm down to my last 2 and I've had it with these.It's too bad, because, while they were actually working, I loved them!Diane in Texas"},{"rating":"1","title":"It looks better than it works","review":"This iron is a toy and not practical for everyday ironing.Pros:featuresappearanceCons:poor performancepoor qualitybulkyPoor performance: steam is inconsistent. Although the dial is turned to maximum, the steam burst button spits out more water than steam. Soleplate does not glide over surface like the name implies....they should call it Touch & Drag to be more accurate.Poor quality: it has a very \\"plastic\\" feel to it, this iron is made in China. Rowenta is made in Germany, and the quality shows!Bulky: It's such a lug! When maneuvering the iron around button areas and along the collar, the iron is so heavy and massive, that it makes it a chore. Smaller lighter-weight irons are much easier to get into the \\"tough\\" spots than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Work!

This iron was a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"EZ Ironing","review":"I love the fact that I do not have to lift the iron up and place it on its end.

However, when I saw this Oliso iron, and the incredible price, I decided to give it a try. This is a high-quality, yet weird, iron. It does an excellent job ironing. It takes a little while to get used to the legs that come out of the bottom of the iron whenever you take your hand off of the handle, but it kind of makes ironing fun (well as fun as ironing can be!). I do worry about some of the other reviews that state the iron does not last long, but for the price I think it's worth the gamble."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST Iron I've ever used","review":"This iron isn't worth more than the box it's shipped in. Not long after I plugged it in, the lifters stop working. They stayed retracted as if my hand was touching it. I didn't realize it wasn't working until after a dark spot was burned into my ironing board! A day later it started working again and after about 10 minutes of use, the lifters did the same thing! It gives you a false sense of safety so you leave it horizontally, however this thing is likely to be the CAUSE of a fire not prevent one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"This iron was quite a disappointment. It is very heavy. It drags, so it wrinkles what I just finished ironing. The steam is quite weak. Sometimes it drips water. For a hundred dollars, I expected at least a half decent iron. I had to go to walmart and buy myself a thirty dollar iron. My thirty dollar iron does everything the Oliso does not. It has great steam pressure, is very comfortable, does not drip and definitely does not drag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ironing is already bad enough...","review":"...and Oliso found a way to make it even worse!Honestly, what were they thinking when they came up with this one? !? \\"Let's make a hot iron and knock itself off your ironing board and onto your feet!\\" I think they've achieved that!WARNING: Unless you place this iron square and centered on your ironing board, it is likely to knock itself off your ironing board!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SAVE YOUR MONEY AND FRUSTRATION!!","review":"I bought this iron, and it worked less than 5 minutes. I got a rude man at customer service, told me to return iron where I bought it. When I told him I got it online, he said the damage must have been caused by shipping. Warranty does NOT cover shipping damage! Told me I could pay to ship it to San Francisco, they may or may not cover it, might send it back in 6 weeks. When I tried to ask him what would make the light start blinking yellow and ticking loudly, he told me in a rude voice that he was NOT technical support.

Yes it will go in the dishwasher, but it cooks unevenly, burns the outside of food while the inside is still uncooked. Worst of all I end up fighting with it just to get it turned on. It usually take me 2 minutes of fiddling with it to get it turned on. The knob is terrible. DON'T BUY IT!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Returning this Today","review":"Probably good for boiling water but you can't cook a steak on this. Gets extremely hot over the center area which is solid with no open grating over the flame area and food sticks and burns. I tried to use only the outer grated section of the grill but anything touching the center just attaches to the solid top and burns. You would do just as well cooking with a blow torch!The grill top is fairly unstable on its supports to begin with and takes a balancing act to properly center it. The meat sticks and pulls the whole grill top with it when you try to turn it and this alone can be a safety hazard as well.The only good feature is that its easy to clean the burnt meat off the grill top before returning it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Grill","review":"This is a nice grill to use for parties or for your family! The price is just right and it is just the right size. Not too heavy, not too light! The only thing not good about this is you have to buy the propane canister yourself. That isnt expensive though. Its a nice grill overall!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop! Don't buy it!","review":"Don't buy this grill! My husband and I bought it for camping and it is one of the worst Coleman products I have ever bought! Simply, it doesn't grill evenly!

Keep shopping and buy something more expensive that will work better. I'm sorry I went cheap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT Buy This Grill","review":"I purchased this grill to take tailgating and spent $41.50 for it. We set it up first at home to test it and could not remove the legs to pack it back up. Thinking the grill was defective, we immediately returned it for another one of the same.This grill will be a downer on any tailgate or party. You will find yourself in a fit of rage as you try to gingerly press the legs in (but not too far), carefully balance the metal pot rack, and then hope the top grilling tray does not fly across the parking lot every time you try to flip a burger.The burgers burned, the chicken charred on the outside and was pink inside, and one of the veggie skewers almost burst into flames. I would never purchase this product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Small portable grill","review":"The grill is a nice design, a bit on the small side. The electronic ignitor on it only worked one time and then became non functioning.

He really likes this grill for it's packability and ease of use and clean up."},{"rating":"1","title":"not bad as a portable stove","review":"I found the grill top to be a waste of time, too hot in the middle and too cold on the edges. As a stove top with a pot or a pan this can't be beat. It heats up easy and quick. Overall, not bad for camping or fishing, but it has limited uses."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWSOME LITTLE GRILL FOR CAMPING","review":"Took this grill camping for six people and it worked great. the burner does take a little a time to learn how to use, but man does it fire up. if you cook steak, you have to stay away from the very center of the grill and put them more toward the edges of the grate. this will keep them from burning. people that gave this grill a bad rating dont know how to grill and want to blame it on something. cooked six ears of corn (wrapped in foil w/olive oil, pre cooked in the oven at home) six 6once thick sirloin and a pot of soup. had a big foil tin to keep everthing warm. perfect, portable, lightweight, cooks great!! nice job Coleman!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I got this and immediately chose to return it. Yes, it is light - but it has a flimsy feel to it. The included instructions did not match up with the grill that was in the package. The one on the package was much simpler but there were things mentioned that were not in the box. The size of the grill is also way too small - at most you can cook a couple burgers or 4 hot dogs. I would be leery of trying anything substantial. Go for the portable gas Weber if you want a take-along grill."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the best design","review":"Received this grill as a gift... the grilling surface is poorly designed and has a lot more surface area for the food to stick to. Add that to the uneven distribution of heat, and you won't be too pleased with your meal. It also lacks a lid that you can use while grilling; it does come with a plastic lid, but we've only used it to cover up the food still stuck to the grilling surface after packing it up after tailgating, etc. don't waste your money on this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing for Coleman","review":"Heading out on an extended camping trip and thought I'd upgrade from the cheep $20 grill. Wish I'd got the cheap $20 grill. The heat distribution is very poor, super hot spot in the center even on low. OK for quick grill items or used as a burner for boiling. Love the size and portability, and it cleans up quickly, but it is suppose to be about cooking. From now on I'll buy a Weber."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this grill!","review":"This grill is no good. Sure it burns a nice flame, but it localizes it right in the center and worst of all, there is no lid so all of the heat remains in the middle and then escapes with the wind! You end up burning steaks because it doesn't retain the heat. What a waste of money. I tries it twice and then I trashed it and will locate one with a cover on it.It's probably good for hot dogs and thin hamburgers, or heating items in a pot."},{"rating":"1","title":"not portable","review":"I never did get to take my grill camping because, once we finally got the legs inserted into the (plastic) holes in the base, we could not remove them to be stored inside...The grill with legs inserted will not go into the bag.

This book was a great disappointment and does not have the depth and thoughtfulness the author shared with readers in previous titles. I found the Muse theory rather flimsy and non-inspirational; there are some exercises to stimulate the reader to make collages and other activities, but the book lacks the inspirational qualities that would encourage the reader to pursue these exercises. The content is pretty slim and surprisingly, the quality of the paper and images included in the book are rather cheap and faded. That is not the author's fault, but Tarchers', but it does detract from the book and the readers' enjoyment.While I cannot recommend this book, I do recommend Arrien's other books if you have not read this author's work in the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Introduction to Creativity","review":"I never knew what The Nine Muses really represented.

And also the book states that Luke carries a blue lightsaber, which he hasn't carried since Empire. Remember he built a green one after he lost his first one. Ok, so it's a little picky.

I read the books out of series because that is how I acquired them and started with the Thrawn Trilogy. I was enthralled in that series and read the whole trilogy in less than 2 weeks. Then I found a copy of this book at the Goodwill and bought it with high hopes. Once I read the first chapter, I knew I was in for a long read. This books reads almost like a fantasy novel with the force witches being the main foe on Dathomir. The author makes Leia out to be a whiny little princess snob, C3PO as an annoying droid who all of a sudden has the ability to play music, and not to mention Luke as a know it all Jedi knight bent on the \\"light side\\" of the force.

Ya' know this stuff does happen, it was a fling Isolder said what she wanted to hear, what I don't belive is she fell for that line \\"I fell in love with her from a distance.\\" Yeah, right. The second biggest complaint is how Han reacted, how would you handle it if the one peson you loved more than you loved your self suddenly didn't love you back? Would you be calm and rational? or would you freak out and do what ever was necessary to get them back? I think what Han did was romantic, and that Leia could have been nicer about it. also in this book(or maybe it was one of the others? I can't remember)it says \\"Every time Han put his life on the line it was for her, Leia couldn't, no wouldn't belive some one could love her that much...\\" I rest my case, the defense rests, bring in the prosecution"},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS A WONDERFUL BOOK WITH A GREAT PLOT!","review":"I can't say enough good things about this novel, in my opinion this is one of the best Star Wars novels produced to date. It was refreshing to say the least to meet new heroes and villians, and also experince our old favorites in a new light. Also the fact that we see very little of the Empire made for new and interesting reading. I was half expecting a sappy romance when I first picked up this book, but was suprised to find out that it had just the right mix of action and a little bit romance. I've raved about this book so much that even my mother has started to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Force is strong in this one","review":"Compact, tightly woven story of how Han and Leia come to terms with their relationship. Han Solo is at heart a rouge and a \\"scoundrel\\", but also a man with a great devotion to duty and respnsibility (as well as Leia). His actions in this novel do not betray these personality traits as others have commented. Luke becomes more powerful on Dathomir than even he expeted he could. This was one I finished in 2 days."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Star Wars novel.","review":"I loved this book. Dave Wolverton really hit it right this time. I haven't been able to put this book down. This book was probably the best(Star Wars)book I have ever read. Not only was it exciting and packed with adventure, but there were no typo's. It held great information about the Star Wars universe. I could really picture this books storyline in my head. From the beggin-ing of this book to the end, I could find nothing wrong with it. I have read about 8 Star Wars novels and this was the best 1 yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, Leia is making wedding plans, only problem is...","review":"This is the book where Han and Leia finally make plannes to marry. Unfortunately, Leia is not considering Han. A Hapan prince offers his hand to Leia and along with it the rule of sixty-three planets and enough resources to get the New Republic up and running smoothly. Han doesn't like this and, well, sort of, um, kidnapps Leia. Luke and the Prince Isolder pursue them and any more would spoil the book. Altogether, a hilarious and yet serious look at the Force and the dangers of using it, as well as fulfilling the relationship we all knew had to be from the start."},{"rating":"2","title":"this book is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"i love this amazing star wars book this book is on par with the hobbit i love reading star wars books!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Book...","review":"I thought this book was a good addition to the Star Wars universe. I love the Dathomir Witches and Teneniel Djo. The Hapans were interesting and Isolder was one of my favorite characters. Overall, this book was great and deserved 5 stars except for the mis-characterisation of Leia and Han (especially Han) in some parts of the book. Han was never THAT dependent on Leia and in this book he can't live without her for 2 seconds. But as I said, the rest of the book (including the very well-done ending) makes up for that.-Murl"},{"rating":"2","title":"Court this book cause it is the best","review":"I LOVED IT I LOVED IT I LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!

With an excellent mix of ground and space battles, as well as the intrigue we've all come to expect from any SW book, you should find Star Wars: The Courtship pf Princess Leia an easy read and very enjoyable.Dave Wolverton did an excellent job as a new comer to the Star Wars Universe.

The book has dumbed down and juvenile plot lines, oversimplified themes, and watered down versions of the familiar characters which have become so iconic to the star wars sagas. It is like taking your favorite movie and turning into a sitcom with poor writing, making the characters betray their true selves, and personified by high school actors. If I thought it would go over I would start a petition to ban Dave Wolverton from ever writing another star wars book, or any other book, for ever!!! or better yet have him take creative writing classes from Timothy Zahn. I sakd good day sir!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Star Bores","review":"Dave Wolverton is an okay author. I read some of his other stuff (this includes other SW short stories he did for the Tales Of series,) and liked them. But it is so obvious that he is in over his head in this one. Take the plot: When Leia goes to marry another man, Han kidnaps her and drags her off to a planet he had won in a card game (!?!,) which turns out to be inhabitted by a race of force-sensitive witches(!?!) who keep Rancors as pets (!?!) and battle more another tribe of witches. Now, is it just me, or is this a little silly? This ultra-politically correct book tries not to insult any minorities, but manages to offend it's majority: the Star Wars fan. Admittly, Wolverton had a hard job, making a novel out of the premise of how Han and Leia wed in the Thrawn trilogy, but Steve Perry had an even harder job with Shadows Of The Empire and he managed to pull it off.

And I'm only 11!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the betrayal of princess leia","review":"Did Dave Wolverton ever read a star wars book? Has he seen the movies? HE totally destroyed the relationship they had at the end of the movies. Leia was *NASTY* to Han, dropping him the minute someone \\"better\\" came along. She acted as if he had no right to get upset as if they only dated once or something. Han acted whiney but who could blame him? They were totally out of character. Especially Luke. If i were Han I would have made Leia come crawling back on her hands and knees."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't believe it.","review":"I can't believe that the strong-willed but kind princess we met in the movies is reduced to this nasty, snobby, selfish twit, who would dump Han the minute \\"Mr. Perfect.\\" came along. She deserved to be smacked across the face throughout 90% of the book. Did Han have to *always* be refered to as scruffy? Especially next to Isolders \\"exquisite beauty\\". Please. After the end of ROTJ I cannot believe any of this could happen. I mean I could not believe that I was hoping that Han would dump Leia. She did not deserve him. Han, the real Han from the three movies ( not this pale imitation) would not have stood for all the garbage he was put through. And as for kidnapping her? Please, she was not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Captivating and Unbelievable","review":"I will premise this review in saying I could only get through the first 50 pages of this book before I put it down. The characters seem shallow. The love story is boring and unbelievable. After all Leia and Han have been through, the epic love story of the original trilogy, she just will consider leaving him for some strange prince she does not even know? It really quite angered me. I refuse to read a love sory of Han's jealous rash behavior. I wanted to read the books in order after Return of the Jedi so this came shortly after The Truce at Bakura (which was superb). I am not going to finish this book and am going for the Thrawn Trilogy by Tim Zahn instead. I would not recommend this book to someone looking for epic action. It quite frankly seems like a bad romance novel that does not belong in the Star Wars EU. 2 out of 5 only because the author can write well, just a lame storyline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"The romantic plot might be fine, and the development of the new characters was ok. The portrayal of han and leia was terrible. Their behaviors and mannerisms weren't even close to accurate. Ruined the book for me. Looks like I'm just going to have to rewrite it myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality Fan Fiction at best","review":"This honestly was a huge disappointment considering the author is considered to be of pedigree.Both Han and Leia were written appallingly out of character and whilst the premise was quite promising, the execution was nothing short of dire.This is dreadfully written fan-fiction, gussied up with an official cover and a publisher behind it. Save your money and just rewatch Empire/Jedi if you are looking for a dose of Han-Leia romance, because the scenes between the two in this book come NOTHING CLOSE to capturing the chemistry and sizzle between those two, whether they were throttling each other or making oogly eyes at each other in the dark corners of the Falcon."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Star Wars book by far!!!!!!","review":"This book was so good! I couldn't put it down. Now I must admit that I am a huge Han and Leia fan. After I saw the movies, I went out to see if they had a book that went in to the Han and Leia relationship more. This was better than the movies because it went into more detail. I also thought that Teneniel Djo was a really cool character.I reccommend this book to everyone who has ever watched Star Wars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written, and captivating","review":"Although I've only read one other Star Wars book( The Paradise Snare: Han Solo Trilogy ) I thought it was extremly good, and well written. One thing I don't like about Star Wars, are the names. Some are hard to even read let alone say them. Other than that fact, I LOVED it. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good and entertaining.","review":"\\"The courtship of princess Leia\\" is a quite good book with some interesting persons and ideas. The Hapan consortium was a positive surprise, with their great power and prince Isolder is a good new addition to the already wide gallery of characters in the Star Wars universe. I found Han Solo's desperation to be genuine, regarding Leia's soon-to-be engagement to Isolder and the sabacc-game was actually quite exciting. However, I did not like the idea of the witches which seemed a bit too medieval to my taste. On the other hand the wicth-idea works, and Gethzerion is an OK villain. Personally I prefer Zsinj who, despite his relative absence in the book, represents the empire with an \\"Iron Fist\\". \\"The courtship of princess Leia\\" is a good book which is recommendable, and I liked reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite up to par with other Star Wars books.","review":"Although this book had a half-decent storyline, I felt that many aspects of the book weren't \\"Star Wars\\"y. For example, part of the greatness of Star Wars lies in the fact that groups of people (for example, Jedi) can be made up and yet seem so real to us. But in this book, there was one group of people called the Witches of Dathomir. To me, witches just don't fit in Star Wars. Second, this book was based on the premise that Han and Leia had been in love before, but were in danger of splitting apart. The third Star Wars movie showed a very definite love between Han and Leia, one which this book holds in very low regard. These and other aspects of the book made the story seem less relevant to the Star Wars universe."},{"rating":"2","title":"I PLAIN LOVE THIS BOOK!","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read (and there's alot of them). I highly reccomend this book if you are a Star Wars fan like me."},{"rating":"1","title":"a silly and boring story","review":"The author doesn't seem to know anything about the characters or the story. Leia would never consider marring anyone else even for the new republic. I couldn't believe she would just brush Han off like that. And Han would not turn into such a needy Whiner. Luke also was a dissapointment. He and Han are best friends and yet he doesn't defend him. Aweful Book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best STAR WARS book out there","review":"This is by far the best star wars book ever writen. The plot is fast moving and very exciting.

This is a great book, but be warned, it is extremely addictive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"The main part of this is : should Princess Leia take the rich boypolitical marriage, for the good of the Republic, perhaps, or marry thescruffy Solo, who is far more likely to piss her off, and many timesmore capable of rescuing her from hordes of stormtroopers, evil empireslords, or other assorted bad guys that may be roaming around thegalaxy.Throw in some odd Force wielding women for no apparent reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Man was if awful!","review":"I found this book to be just terrible. It was certainly not written to keep how the Star Wars characters act. Leia, Han, Luke, and everyone was written as if they were some 60s war protesters. PLEASE. I was throughly disappointed with this book and don't understand how it could have ever been included in the Star Wars series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"This book was an okay Star Wars book, but it had some faults. The chracters were protrayed pretty well, that is up until the end. I think that Star Wars fans should read this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh, can I have a refund","review":"Get this book from the library only if you are really bored. I liked the Leia/Han sparring and relationship in the movies. I like stories that focus on characters. This book failed to hold my interest because Leia, Luke, and Han were out of character. Luke's and Han's friendship was ignored and Leia came across as shallow. I never believed that Leia actually cared about Mr. Boring Prince or that Han would behave in such a childish fashion. Luke's actions towards the Force Witches did not make sense. There are much better SW books out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Luke's power is finally shown","review":"While I'll admit Han was a little out of character in this book I must also say it's among my top favorites. Why? For one thing I was beginning to wonder if Han and Leia were ever going to get around to marriage. Also, this was the first book (and practically the only book) that did full justice to the Force. The Emperor had been worried about Luke's abilities with the Force, right? Darth was always talking about how powerful Luke was; and Luke was barely a Jedi at the time! But this book showed what the Force can enable a Jedi to do. In one instance Luke floated himself to the planet's surface. (Okay, okay, he did get beat up by some girl but the fight was handled realistically.) My favorite part was when Luke singlehandedly flew the ship, took out those sun-blocker things, and stopped the Nightsisters from escaping! Now that was powerful! That's when Luke truely became a Jedi!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the better SW novels","review":"Great!, this book was what you call a nice surprise! I read 'children of the Jedi' just before I bought this novel and man, what a relief to see that great SW novels are still being written! The story never got dull, and the planets, characters and sofort that have been added are all a worthy addition to the Star Wars universe. I do have so critism though. For instance, I really can't believe that Leia would run of with some other guy so easily. And what are the Imperials actually doing exept getting killed? And why do Luke's powers appear to be greater than they were in novels that took place later? But aside from that, a great book, Zahn, Anderson, move over."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHERE'S THE WEDDING?","review":"THE COURTSHIP OF PRINCESS LEIA is a really good book.

Puh-LEEZE!Not only was the premise not plausible, it wasn't even well written. The characterization was nothing short of inaccurate (Han Solo gambles away the Falcon to win a planet for Leia... right!) and the storyline was fragmentary and elusive.And the worst part was the ending. I'll leave it to you to discover, but don't expect a thrill or even logic. I'm not into corny in my Star Wars books. Stick with Timothy Zahn."},{"rating":"1","title":"The boks was a gross disapointment","review":"First off, what the author was trying to do while writing this book is unknown to me, but he managed to break time lines and protray the characters so horribly I'm suprised Lucas Film let him get away with it. 'King' Solo? 'Cuse me, in the Han Solo Trilogy it clearly mentions Han did made a through search for his ancestery and could find nothing except a possible great aunt, the change in his last name the auothor mentions is impossible, Han did know his own last name until the Wookie who cared for him on the Trader's Luck told him in was 'Solo'. Leia, in all her princess ways, would never have been so 'difficult'. 8 years with Han wouldn't be thrown aside after 2 minutes by Isolder. I wont even go into how appauled about how the author chose to protray Luke, cause it might just never end but let me just say this one thing. Atleast he could play Artoo right! (that was sarcasm if you missed it)I'll give the book one star, cause I liked the cover art. Thank you =)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"This book could have been a lot better if the author had managed to keep the characters in character. The major premise of the book is that Princess Leia might marry some guy she's just met in order to seal an alliance between his mother's government and the New Republic. This despite the fact that she's clearly in love with Han Solo. If that doesn't seem bad enough, Han responds to this by kidnapping- kidnapping! -Leia in order to talk some sense into her.I'd really like to give this book half a star, or no stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this book!","review":"By far the worst and most uncharacteristic of all the SWnovels. The very thought that Leia would dump Han like a sack ofpotatos the second a seemingly 'perfect' guy came along and wanted to play footsie make my stomach turn! The perfect guy! C'mon, It's Harrison Ford we're talking about here! And let's not even discuss the planet of women who keep men as thier slaves. It's fine if Mr. Wolverton wants to write about his perverse sexual fantasies but a) I wish he'd keep them out of the Star Wars universe and b) he should really try to achieve some sort of better understanding of the way women think and act before attempting to write a novel about them. What I was hoping for from this book was a beatiful romantic epic with echoes of Han and Leia relationship in ESB, what I got was this misoginistic trash. No thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of The Best","review":"Really good except for the ending I wanted to know what Han and Leia's wedding went but all I got was half a page!

But I was most disappointed that their wedding was barely even a page. I mean wasn't their wedding the whole point of the book?Thats why I gave it a 4.

I think that their wedding should've been a whole chapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say junk?","review":"This is the worst Star Wars book I have read. If anybody wants to read this don't spend the money, get it from a library. The charactrers don't even act like themselves. Please, can you see Leia marrying another guy after she and Han connected in ESB and ROTJ? I don't. The author obviously didn't do his research on Star Wars. The only redeeming quality of this book is it created the Wraith Squadron books for X-Wing. At least Wolverton made one good character, that being Zsinj. Also can you imagine the Falcon destroying a Super Star Destroyer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worthy of the name \\"Star Wars\\"","review":"I was reading through the other reviews of this book, and I was amazed to see how many people gave it high ratings. This book completely lacked the Star Wars magic and the well-written style of some other books. First of all, the references to witches was a little strange. Aren't we in the Star Wars universe here? Did they even HAVE witches? Another thing I didn't like was the competition between Han and Isolder. Han and Leia have a solid relationship at the end of RotJ, and Han is jealous of some over-bulked, non-intelligent prince? And furthermore, so jealous that he knocks out Leia and kidnaps her? Totally un-Star-Wars-like.

That is, except for political prisoners, witches, and oh, yes Rancors.WHY!!!!Zjinsi learns of this, brings his SSD around to the system and they have a good 'ol battle. It had its moments, not many, but it had them.

He may become powerful but he isn't yet. The Prince Isolder was a bit too ego manic for me. The only character a slightly liked was The Queen Mother, she was bitchy, in a good way.

Not Menards, Lowe's, Home Depot, the local hardware store or Amazon. We have one bad zone and we're afraid to try to fix it because we can still water the other 5 zones with the spare fuse.

Very satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thorough Study of Great War Soldiers' Religious Inclinations","review":"Cross and the Trenches (CT) offers an exhaustive and skillfully written survey depicting the spectrum of religious faith and doubt both at and behind the front lines during the First World War. Schweitzer tracks the complicated fault lines along which the church and Christian faith - both in organized and internalized form - fed into the horrific experiences of Great War soldiers, and, more importantly, how the religious beliefs or lack thereof taken into battle by these men blossomed, festered, solidified and evolved under the most trying of circumstances imaginable. For those seeking to understand the complicated role that faith played in the lives of Great War soldiers - and in the societies at large from which they came - The Cross and the Trenches offers a invaluable first hand record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way Way better than Shakira!","review":"Every song on this album is fantastic. With a voice so expressive and lyrics that seem simple at first, but become more and more complex everytime you listen, I put Sacha Nairobi right up there on the top of the Latin music scale. She should be WAY more famous. Each cut has somthing different to offer and Sacha even changes her accent a bit to fit the lyrics she is singing for example on \\"Los Tambores.\\" And \\"Puro Cuento\\" and \\"Raquel\\" talk about the trials of love gone bad with a real sense of humor. And let's not forget the ballad \\"Silencio\\" - beautiful. And you know if you just can't get your visa to the USA one day, well, just head to my house for a fiesta and forget all your troubles for now. I love this CD and try to listen to it at least once a week, and this is coming from someone with a REEEEAL extensive Latin music collection! You won't be disapponted with Sacha."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read for any age group","review":"Randy Howe has written an extremely interesting and compelling book about the flags of the 50 states.

There are few 'real' ghost stories, and unnecessary time was spent on questionable parts, like Three Mile Island. At sixty some pages, I wondered, is this all? The places are bewildering to out siders like me but the map helps. Author has a light style and makes easy reading. There are far better ghost books out there, search! Even if they aren't under 7 bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suffocating love","review":"This book is not for the faint of heart. It is a deeply disturbing tale of a girl who feels that her parents only have love for each other. She feels outside of their love. Her remedy for this is as an adult to have a child of her own and love him exclusively. This love becomes an obsession and leads to destruction.Beautifully written, but definitely a tough subject matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loverboy","review":"I enjoyed the near-melodic quality of the author's prose. Redel took a difficult and unusual character who would normally be dismissed without a second thought, and by the end of the book, I was more understanding and compassionate, almost rooting for the main character. I admired the lyrical choice of words and expressions. The ironic ending left me troubled and thoughtful, as I think it was intended. I liked the book so much that I immediately ordered her collection of short stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mother love run amok","review":"Loverboy creeps up on you even though you get plenty of warning that the narrator, mother of the year, is possibly a half a bubble off plumb. She's got a few hang ups. There's her problem with speaking in contractions. There's her tendency to kiss her son a little more than she ought to. She's got some serious separation issues and things start to escalate from there. You figure it just isn't gonna be one of those happily every after books. That said, it was haunting and beautifully written. As a mother with far less child lust than this poor woman, I could relate in \\"moments.\\" Moments that sieze your heart and render you stupid. But uh, insanity is something else. Which is what makes the book so creepy, so enticing that I had to stay up until the wee hours to find out exactly how this would all play out. Not well, I was sure. I'll stick this one on the bookshelf next to Steve Martins' Shopgirl. Small but packs a good punch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Victoria Redel - A terrific new talent","review":"A must read for every woman that is a mother. Beautifully written and thoroughly captivating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting, disturbing, beautifully written...pay attention!","review":"The author uses several literary devices to tell the story of a mother's intense love for her son. The transitions from her present to her flashback runs smoothly and strangely logically. I am not a big fan of flashback and flash forward but here they work. The work is well written and reads often like poetry. As the story pans out the reader will begin to predict an unhappy ending but one can not truly believe the disturbing ending until you read it. DO NOT READ the ending first!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tragic mother's love","review":"I couldn't put this book down. It is so touching even tho the subject can be distrubing because of the obsession the mother has for her son. Yet you understand what she feels and how she so loves her son she doesn't want to share him with anyone and not even have anyone in their world. This is a recipe for disaster which the reader knows is coming but still shocked when it does. The mother is so desperate to have all her son's love just for her, she smothers him and he rebels. She is unable to cope with this. I could see how this could occur when a mother has a child. Book was remarkable in that you take pity on the mother instead of being angry at her."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've got to be kidding!","review":"So many books utterly ruined by their endings.

The chapters, though, are mercifully short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgetable","review":"If you're a mother perhaps you'll like this. But does that mnake it great literature? I read this because a friend suggested it; what I didn't know though is that really its audience is meast only to be that tiny Oprah/Rosie crowd that only want to read books within their own tiny worldviews. I couldn't fit myself into this story, couldn't figure out why I should care. The writing at times is not only bad it's downright sloppy, so that didn't help either. I didn't like this book, sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning!","review":"This book is a triumph -- beautifully written, controlled prose, fascinating characters.

I hook this bad boy up to the televisions in my hotel rooms and I have a spare one for my apartment when I'm home. There's an optional RCA video extension incase your tv doesn't have an S-Video input and there's also a usb connection for charging while viewing. The image quality is standard and honestly, I wasn't expecting HD images here. I was actually shocked at certain tv shows like 30 Rock and Heroes where the quality seemed almost equal to standard tv viewing. Overall, I can't say anything negative about this monster link.

Apparently Apple changed the video output on these devices that only is supported by the cable through Apple. You will get audio perfeclty but no matter how smart you are in setting up electronic devices, no video will ever show up. So sad that we get ripped off by these companies and they do not even help you over the phone and no customer service to assist you. Shame on them for doing business in this great country of ours.

Ultimately, I blame myself for not reading the reviews for this product prior to ordering else I would have known that despite the product's claim, this product does not work with the newer iPod Classics. I have had such good performance out of Monster products that I did not think twice about ordering after reading the product description which did not mention that the iTV Link does not work with new iPods.

The video looks fine (I have a 28\\" HD FP and the quality is somewhere between TV and DVD quality), make sure resolution of movie file your playing isn't too low for a big screen TV. My original batch of movies I loaded up were at the lowest, and they looked like I was playing old VHS tapes.2. I highly recommend you get the charger adapter. Once you load your iPod up with your movie files your only going to get 3-4 hours of video before it tuckers out. It would have been nice if the charger just came with it... this is one of the pricier cables anyway.Overall, I'd say the product is worth it, and I would recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too good to be true","review":"I ordered this product with great expectations, only to be let down. This cable is still sitting in the box for a week now because I tryed for about 2-3 hours to get it to work. There is no phone number for assistance so your on your own. I was really excited to see my I-pod on tv but that didn't happen. Other reviews said just plug it in. Not the case with me. I might be doing something wrong but I have hooked up many electronic devices in my time and I tryed everything from the line-in, line 1 and 2,the tv out switch and settings on ipod, even hooking it up through the vcr audio/video. I tryed other tv sets, switching the plugs around, etc. I don't know what it is. I am going to give the wire one last try this week then I am sending it back. After all was said and done between the next day shipping and upgraded wire this product cost more then I wanted to spend and more time then I wanted to take to hook it up.

Yuck.That's one reason why I love this cable so much! This one is awesome quality! Great picture and great sound! The cable is thick and so long I don't even need a remote! The picture quality is wonderful. I know there are cheaper cables out there but the this one works the best.

I finally returned it to AMAZON.com (with very little hassle & excellent service!)& ended up buying the APPLE version (twice the cost, of course)& it worked like a charm.

I'm giving it 4 stars, because I had planned to turn the shelves upside down for the keyboard and misc. storage; however, the tubes on the corners are slightly coned shaped so that when the shelves are installed differently than the picture, the cart is not as sturdy.

When we put the microwave on it the microwave crashed to the floor. I was so angry that I threw that cart away because the entire cart was bent.

This is a very dangerous item and should not be advertised as a microwave cart in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Sturdy","review":"My husband and I put this on our registry because we were going to be living in a small apartment and needed the extra space. Friends of his mom bought it for us, and when we tried to put it together, the middle shelf broke. Also, the wooden top just kind of sits on there, it doesn't bolt in or anything. It doesn't have enough support on the bottom and the materials are not heavy duty, so I wouldn't recommend putting a microwave or anything else remotely heavy on it, but as extra storage for light items, it would be okay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good price, good item!","review":"My bofriend and I were moving into a small house with no counter space and knew that we needed something to put our microwave on. I had gone on Target.com to see what they had and was dissapointed to see the bad reviews for this particular product. The other day though, I couldn't beat the price so I bought it hoping the people who wrote the bad reviews had put it together wrong. This product is great! It holds our medium sized microwave, our toaster on the slide-out rack and our quesidilla maker on the bottom rack. The four hooks on the side are great for our hot mits and hot pads.

I would highly recommend buying it and making sure that you read the directions carefully."},{"rating":"2","title":"Price is right","review":"This item is good quality for the price.

I placed the microwave, (a small one) on the cart but when I moved it, the shelfs popped off the black pieces causing the whole cart to almost collapse. I finally re-enforced it with, would you believe, duct tape. (I will securing it with hose clamps.) I could take it back but this is the type cart I want and could find none other like it.

It seems to be ok holding the microwave, but wobbles when I touch it, and I didn't dare use the casters, as there is no way to secure them and they kept falling out while I was trying to get the thing to stand properly on them. I don't see this being a piece that will hold together for any amount of time. This is a somewhat heavy item for a petite person like me to handle, and it's tempting just to throw it out and shrug off the $, instead of making another trip, but I'll probably end up taking this back to Target for a refund. I'd put zero stars if I wasn't prompted to rate this with at least one star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great as a small mobile island for the kitchen!","review":"We got this cart orginally for our microwave while selling our precious house.

Can't wait for the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buff raises the bar for the intense sub thriller yet again.","review":"I just finished reading this last night, and all I can say is I am floored. I could not sleep until I finished this, it was just the best thriller I have read in a long time.This is Joe's second novel following the exploits of the Jeffrey Fuller and the crew of the USS Challenger, and the action is even more gripping than in the first. The conflict is ratcheted up to a whole new level, and the tac nukes fly even more freely.What a grim conflict, what bold heroes, what great characters.Joe is the master of near future sub novel, I now measure all others against his work. Tom Clancy eat your heart out. The only downer about this book is waiting until he finishes his next book. I might recommend you read his first book before reading this one, but it should hold up on it's own just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Entertaining, Fast-Paced Read","review":"Thunder in the Deep was the first Joe Buff book that I have read and it was good enough for me to make his first book, Deep Sound Channel, my next read.I picked up the book because he has been compared to Tom Clancy. Since I have read and enjoyed Clancy's novels, I thought that I'd give Buff a try. While I am glad that I did, I found that the comparisons to Clancy were unwarrented. This is NOT a bad thing. Clancy's books are much deeper and have a much wider scope, often containing political or social commentary that he ties in well with the rest of the story. You won't find any of that in Thunder in the Deep. The result is a book that maintains its pace throughout and keeps the action coming. This is not to say that the author is any less a writer than Clancy, just that the book is a different type of read.I'd recommend this book to anyone who likes Clancy, military or combat novels, and especially people who enjoy techno-warfare."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great story!","review":"This writer is without doubt one of my favorite writers!

Try Ralph Peters.......relatively unknown (?) but great."},{"rating":"1","title":"One redeeming quality","review":"Thunder in the deep boasts one saving grace. It is so fast-paced, so easy to read, that you don't realize just how bad it is until you've finished reading it. In fact, you might have a good time reading most of it.Once you turn the last page however, you are likely to feel the way you would coming out of Rambo 15. Why did I just read that again?In short, seen from a cool mind, the book has nothing (past that quick fighting pace) going for it. Characters and settings are inexistant as an integral part of the story. The plot is so bloated with holes and miraculous apparitions saving the day that you'd think Reggie White just went down the buffet line.If you really have nothing else to read, this won't take long and you may not throw up. Otherwise, pass..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads Like an Arcade Game!","review":"This was my first (and last) Joe Buff read. Picture yourself playing a submarine \\"shoot 'em up\\" arcade game. Now put that game into print and this is the final product. Mildly entertaining.....if you played this on an Xbox or PC. Virtually no submarine warfare tactics and lets not forget that we all KNOW the US Navy makes it a habit of dispatching sub captains to go ashore in Seal raids. What a farce. Skip the read and find yourself a good game if this is your style. Don't buy the book if you think you are getting a good novel on sub warfare and naval tactics! The story line was thin as well. Purely Duke Nukem!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, trite, and boring","review":"I invested two hours in reading this book, and then decided thatlife is too short to read anything so bad. The story consistsof endless successions of tactical nuclear explosions. Strangelyenough, these seem to have no side- or after- effects. Justbig booms, which the good guys always survive while the baddiesgo up in bubbles. The author has taken the worst cliches of allprevious submarine warfare novels, added flat and unbelievablecharacters, and carried on for way, way too many pages. Thereare better thrillers out there, don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frighteningly Prescient","review":"Buff's second book is even more powerful then the first. The concept of a future surprise attack buy an evil enemy axis using weapons of mass destruction has been rendered even more plausible by the September 11th attack and the President's State of the Union Address. Meticulous research, compelling characters, beautiful descriptions, exciting and engrossing plot. Highly recommended. Really ranks up there with \\"The Hunt For Red October,\\" and \\"Run Silent,Run Deep.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredible - truly unbelievable","review":"What a disappointment. Great theme and an accomplished writer combine to produce this fantasy of multi-nuclear explosions in the deep, where the odd few thousand casualties at each detonation is commonplace, except that our hero somehow manages to avoid annihilation on eleven different occasions. A series of unexplained,unbelievable,neo-political military scenarios spoil the book for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting and frightening","review":"In the world of the 21st Century where warfare can erupt anywhere and in many different forms, Joe Buff brings a frightening scenario of undersea nuclear warfare to the reader. The book captures you on the first page and rivets you to your seat as the fast-paced story keeps a never-ending river of excitement roaring across the pages. Great characters, outstanding plot, an exciting story of a future we hope never occurs. But, then we never expected 9/11.CAPT David E. Meadows, USN..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Submarine captain meets 007 meets Rambo","review":"This will be my last Joe Buff book, there has to be some credibility in the main character actions. Is hard to believe that Jeffry Fuller with his sub and crew can do all the things they did, from kidnapping a German minisub, to infiltrating an ultra top secret enemy facility and stealing its most valuable assets, to sinking dozens of enemy ships and aircraft with sub on SURFACE!There is something call fiction but other completely different is what I witness in this book where all missions where impossible and kamikaze, but always somehow Jeffry Fuller manages to sort it out successfully, in the end I lost the edge I had at the beginning, I believe some balance will be a nice addition if not all credibility is lost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I couldn't get my flowers to grow before i started them in these peat pellets!

A harpsichord represents classical grace. That is the prblem with 'the museum mentality' so common today when it comes to classical music. I enjoy baroque music played on museum instruments because the style lends intself to historic performance. However, it spoils it when certain instruments are played because the focus is on history rather than grace and beauty of sound.Not only is the piano used but it sounds like a rather tired thin sounding old instrument that once stood in the corner of a bar or pub! It is a shame because it ruins an otherwise charming set (albeit a museum rendition)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rene Jacobs has done it again","review":"For those who bought Rene Jacobs glorious recordings of Cavalli' s La Calisto and Caldara' s La Maddalena ai piedi di Cristo, this recording will be no surprise, for it is obvious that this Belgian artist is one of the finest conductors around. And his way with Mozart is just as winning, he makes us hear new things and have us on the tip of our toes. His cast is excellent, headed by Veronique Gens sounding better than ever, here surely is one of the great Mozart sopranos of the XXI Century. Everybody else is great in this recording, but if that were not enough, the nice people of Harmonia Mundi include a CD-ROM that is a marvel in itself.

It was the kind of purchase where I listened to the cd for 5 seconds in the store and immediately bought it. I don't regret it, in the least. Case & Mark's harmonies are tight without being cheesy. Their voices and playing sounds great together, and I even like the spontaneous \\"office party\\" sound that other reviewers complain about.

It is easier to simply walk your way through the menus, rather then try to follow the instructions. Anybody can 'get it' by walking through the menus and following the prompts and options. This allowed me to chuck the instructions. 2) The water input uses a compression coupling, so it is mandatory to have your spigot turned on full force, otherwise the coupling seal leaks.

Sadly, my experience on the later point says that is not true for this griddle. No matter what approach I took to heating it up, items always came out unevenly cooked. The portions near the center (those over the burner) were nicely cooked and brown while anything over the corners were no where near cooked. I tried all sorts of ways of heating it up. Turning the burner on to medium-low for 10 minutes before hand, turning the burner high before cooking at then turning it down, leaving it on high. Nothing provided satisfactory results unless I was constantly rotating the items cooking, which I've never had to do on other griddles. Overall, very dissapointing.(I can't comment on the grill side as I never used it.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"uneven heating","review":"I was so excited about this pan but it just doesn't heat evenly, at least not on my flat-top stove. I have other Lodge products that I love so not sure why the heat isn't dispersing. Maybe it works better on other range styles. I ended up getting the 10 in round grill pan and the 10 in round griddle to replace this. Both of those work great."},{"rating":"1","title":"rusty","review":"I received this item with a stain of rust and glue from the label. I tried to scrub it, and it became even more rusty.

Will go for a Weber griddle again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grillin","review":"This grill was a lot bigger than I thought it would be. I originally thought it would be a tight fit on my range but it turned out to be bigger than the burner but still fit perfectly.

It was definitely more than I thought it would be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Nightmare to clean, now it seems to have a rusty look at edge.

I use it mostly for egg omelets and pancakes. Its easy to clean, is sized about right, nice lip on the edge, and generally works fine. I'm holding off on that fifth star because it does cook a little unevenly on my stove-top. Its a bit hotter toward the center where the flame hits. Not a big deal.

It was uniformly black and free of rust. I still gave it a 90 minute bake at 350 lubed with shortening. I'm using this piece under the worse possible scenario, a ceramic top stove. Since there is no direct contact with the burner surface all heat transfer is radiant. This requires a 15 minute preheat time to allow the majority of the cooking area to be uniform in temperature and do it in 2~3 stages, not all at once and here's why. The first time I preheated this grill I monitored it with an IR thermometer. The center rose to 350 while 1\\" from he edges it was still at 80 Fearing this might lead to a fracture, I backed off and started slower. You'll also need to use 25% more heat to maintain the desired cooking temperature versus a cast iron skillet doing the same task. Overall it's a practice make perfect learning curve."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for experts, good for beginners","review":"This book's scope is its strength. Not only do you get chapters on Scotland, Ivory Coast, and Egypt, but also Greenland, Alpine Music, islands in the Indian Ocean, and the Gulf states. Geared more toward the musician or the academic, beginners also can find this valuable. Its weaknesses include the uneveness of the contributions. Some include detailed histories of cultures, others focus on the local scene. Also, some music is determined to be world music in some chapters; in others is not. For example, Greenlandic rap is world music in Greenland, but only French regional music is included here. Also, I noted that music that supported oppressive governments in the Soviet Union and Serbia received only passing mentions. On the whole, I would recommend this book to academics, musicians looking for new sounds, or people trying to learn more about other cultures. (P.S. Please include the publication date in your discographies!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best World Music's Guide released since today","review":"Walk inside the universe of World Music is not easy. You have the feeling to moove in a jungle of names, titles and unknown instruments. A Guide is necessary to understand and help you for orientation.

From the 1994's first edition the new release is more rich and reflects the high number of World Music records released in the last five years.

I'm really disappointed as I had high hopes for a book coming from someone like Mr. Pybus.

Marlie is a very sympathetic character. I also liked the relationship between the two detectives, Dane and his partner.A favorite scene: The first time Dane and Marlie meet at the police station. Dane's a skeptic, but Marlie's seen such skepticism before and knows exactly how to put him in his place.THE BAD: I don't have anything bad to say about this book.THE SEX: LOTS of sexual tension.

Dream Man is a wonderful book with great characters. An absolutely wonderful book to read. I highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Howard's best [and she has plenty of good ones]","review":"I have read all of Ms. Howard's books and I have fallen in love with all but one. This is one of her best, in my opinion. A psychic with a traumatic past recovers her abilities due to a gruesome murder and meets an esceptic cop whom immediately suspects her as accomplice to the crime. From there, these characters grow to love each other and solve a series of murders spanning a decade and many states. I love the main characters, I love the plot and I plainly love the way Ms. Howard writes. It is obvious to me that she does a fair amount of research on the background of her characters and what legal or whatever issues are of importance to the development of the story. Many of her secondary characters fairly beg for their own stories [Hint: PLEASE write about Alejandro Trammell!]. There is also enough humor, both subtle and obvious, to balance the blood and gore of the darker scenes. This is a book for one sitting, impossible to put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not one of her best!","review":"Yes, I think the storyline was okay, but Dane was WAY too macho for me. The way he kept calling her \\"babe\\" drove me insane! I found it very hard to like the characters in this book. I am a huge Linda Howard fan and I was disappointed with this read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book!","review":"This was the first book I've read that entailed psychic/paranormal phenomena and it totally got me hooked! This book has totally scared the **** out of me when I first read it. I thought the scenes between Dane and Marlie were awesome and totally hot! Their fire burns the pages. I've had this book for a few years and I still read it 4-5 times a year. It's that good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Do you believe in empathy?","review":"This is the second book of Linda Howard that I read, it was better the other book (Mr. Perfect) but this one is not bad at all, you will laugh when you read it (it has some internal jokes) and you will have a good time reading it.At the end of the book I have my questions, if Marlie was so angry with Dane, how he convinced to go to bed? The epilogue is [not good], but you will laugh when you will read it.This book is not a page turner but it will keep you interested in the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOT","review":"I only pick up this book to read on the plane and could not put it down. I even wished that the plane ride was longer. My first Linda Howard book and certainly not my last. The characters were very real, I thought Dane was just as sexy as any man could get. Steamy love scenes and a story line that keeps you reading till you've finished. Two thumbs up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of the 5 rating!","review":"I am not even close to halfway through this book and I am ready to return this book. I am an avid reader of Romance suspense and the build of romance between the two is just lame. and I agree with the other reviewers, Dane saying babe is annoying! If you love Judith McNaught, Julie Garwood, this book will disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilling tale","review":"The author's plot is chillingly told. The herione is believable. The detective is capable. Altogether a great read. In fact, I have read it twice already.

A \\"feel-good\\" story.","review":"I really loved reading this book. In fact, when I finished reading it, I did not start on my other new Linda Howard book at once, because I re-read it again. The characters were so breathtaking that after reading it I felt so good. The plot is so different from other books I've read. Linda is really one of my favorite authors, in the league of Jane Ann Krentz, Elizabeth Lowell & Nora Roberts. How I just wish that all of Linda's books are available here in Manila, Philippines. That's why when I went to LA, California last summer, I bought as much of Linda's books as I could see."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"This was a amazing book. I couldn't put it down.

I read the reviews (over 75 in all) of those that didn't (approx. 10%) and I can understand their reasons. But they are not mine. I loved everything about this book. Any time I pick it up I become emersed in the story again. So be careful. As one reviewer wrote, \\"It's the type of book you will call out sick for\\". :) LH at her best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"scary, fancinating, sexy","review":"Dream Man is another of Linda Howard's suspense/romances. And once again she has created an intense plot that mirrors modern society so well that when you surface from the book, you have to shake off the feelings that the book engenders. Howard likes to create strong women whose vulnerability is societal in nature. In other words, she is a psychic and gets no respect. Her heros are also strong, warrior-like men whose only vulnerabilty is the heroine. And her antagonists are real enough to be terrifying. I really enjoy her books and, if you are wondering, never even have time to break them down like this while I am reading. I am way too engrossed in the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointing","review":"I bought this book based on the reviews here -- wow was I dissappointed! It is so unrealistic it is amazing.

As soon as my husband put it together, one of the drawers broke (on the outside where you can see it). Also the drawers do not close properly and the cushion is cheap looking. The bench is also not very sturdy. I know it was only the price but it's not even worth that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad buy !!!!","review":"The bench is not functional. Break easily. The cushion is cheap, cover shrinks when washed.Strongly recommend not to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, but disappointing!","review":"I had my eye on this bench for my front hallway for awhile. I finally bought it last week on sale. My husband put it together easily. The trouble came when you sit on it. The top only is a cheap thin piece of wood (which I didn't pay attention to originally). Of course it cracked after 5 days. It was cracked by just sitting and changing shoes (the person only weighs 195 lbs.). Now I have to return it and find something as cute but made better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice Piece!","review":"I bought this bench, along with the 5-drawer chest and 2 end tables this week. I was looking for something stylish, but didn't have a lot of extra cash to spend. I had some trouble assembling the drawers, but my boyfriend had them together in no time, so it may have just been my lack of experience. We're using the bench as a coffee table. The cushion looks kind of cheap, so I'll recover it to go with our sofa. My only other complaint is that you can see the particle board (or whatever that stuff is) sides through the slats in the wood. But I think it's definitely a good deal for the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stylish storage space","review":"This unit provides a great deal of subtle storage space in a charming window seat. It held my 240 lbs. husband, no problem. Build time did not take long (especially with a cordless drill), although I highly recommend examining the 4 bamboo drawer pieces prior to building in order to match the colors. Otherwise you may end up with one drawer lighter, and one drawer darker due to the nature of the wood stain. Can't wait for more additions to this style!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value, functional","review":"This piece is a great addition to my room. I'm a student, and the bench is a good place to store some extra books and have a place for guests to sit when they are in my bedroom. It's true that the quality could be better, but I think it's a good value for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy","review":"This is the worst piece of furniture I have ever bought. I had my knee on it and it busted right through! Now we have a big hole through it and NO..I am not a big person! Then I washed the cover and now it won't fit over the foam inside. Also the foam tore into pieces when I tried to get the cover off. DO NOT spend your money on this..it's cheap and it shows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely poor quality","review":"I put 2 of these benches in my nook, looked good until I sat on them. The surface on which you are supposed to sit is very very week, it cracked (no I am not heavy set - less than 140 lbs). I took it back to the store, they agreed with the poor quality and that it was broken. They refuse to take it back and give me a store credit, they insist that I take a replacement since it is past 3 months since I purchased it. What good is it, the next one will break again after I spend an hour hour to put it together.Strongly recommend not to buy this if you want to sit on (even for a short while)"},{"rating":"2","title":"great for my entry way","review":"totally love this item as it's a great storage for my children's shoes. perfectly matches my &quot;island&quot; theme living room. kids love the cushion bench as it makes it eay for them to sit and put their shoes on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I had listened","review":"I wish I had listened to the reviews I read. It looks great after recovering the seat, but cracked under the pressure of 120 lbs. If a rail thin woman can break it, what's the point?"},{"rating":"2","title":"But for an Even Greater Appreciation of the Art of Goya--","review":"While I learned much from Hughes' opus, at book's end I was still left with the same nagging question I had at the beginning: But with the exception of his \\"Disasters of War,\\" for which the answer is obvious, why is Goya's art still attracting so much attention today? I subsequently found the answer in a 288-page gem, one whose title suggests that it does indeed go beyond the focus in Hughes' book. To those who want to learn yet more about the art itself, I highly recommend Prof. Fred Licht'sGoya: The Origins of the Modern Temper in Art (Icon editions)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fascinating subject; non -fascinating treatment","review":"Not very well written, but the author is an art critic, not a biographer and has no novelist's skiills either.And I don't buy his implication that Goya was completely \\"normal.\\" His \\"dark\\" images are pitch black and his decorative works are mostly wimpy, when they're not dealing with bull fights, rape and/or murder.Nice illustrations, when they're not too tiny, but I'd rather invest in a proper picture book if I'm paying that much for a paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Couldn't Have Said It Better","review":"I was going to write a review of this book, but after reading S Calwas's opinion, I am going to refer the reader to it; I concur on every point made. Although I am enjoying the book, I have been distracted by the poor editing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable reading","review":"Usually I look for the artist's art in a monograph book, not his story (assuming the art itself would tell it more deeply anyway).But his writing is enjoyable: humorous, down to earth, cynical and sober, yet you feel through all this the passion and ambition of Goya.I find the his sober treatment of Goya as a not-so-idealistic fellow to actually inspiring - that he achieved what he did WITH all the real-life compromises he had to make.Makes you laugh at the ridiculousness of people's meanness, wickedness, arrogance, and downright cruelty. You laugh because you cannot cry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent case, nice bang for the buck!","review":"Excellent case in my opinion. I especially like its fairly small size, as a lot of server class cases are just too big and awkward for daily use. I added two 80mm fans, one in front and one in the back for some extra cooling, works excellent at cooling the hard drive which heated up quiet a bit without the fans.Although the color is not black it still looks great and has a nice finish to it. Few things i I found a little odd were lack of support for some motherboard scrwes on my ATX Abit BH-7, and also to connect the front USB there isn't a standard plug but about 5 individual pins which I had to connect one by one for each one of the 2 front USB plugs.Still overall this case looks great has a nice power supply which doesn't make too much noise, and has enough room to acomplish any day to day tasks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black or Bronze?","review":"I ordered a black case and the description and pictures even said black.

Being a farmer's wife, I related easily to her tales of life as she \\"passed through the gates\\" on the ranch. What an interesting format. The book touched on the important past as well as present rural issues that make that life unique. The author comes across as a strong, independent, and thoughtful woman--someone who respects the power of the past and is interested in the future. The clash of technology and ranching is also explored in a sensitive way. It was a great \\"journey\\"--going with her as she rode the ranch--a vast empire of land that holds special significance to her and many others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Protect your neck.","review":"This sword is great. It hangs on a nice wood plaque. It is heavy and a good replica.A.F.& A.M"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Come On\\" by Billy Lawrence","review":"Billy made her debut onto the R&B scence in 1994 with her first cd \\"One Might Say,\\" which is a melodic blend of jazz, soul, and R&B. She came back in 1997 with her second album entitled \\"Paradise,\\" giving rise to the popular dance-hall gem: \\"Come On,\\" released to single. If featured rap by the legendary M.C. Lyte at the beginning and end of the song, smoothing out it's corners nicely. She delivers a flawless performance and the single comes highly recommended. The other songs on Billy's second release aren't like \\"Come On,\\" so don't go out and buy it thinking to hear hip-hop flavored tracks. The rest are more or less love-ballads and slow-tempo songs. The single, however, comes highly recommended. So if you want a truthful and informative review just look for the signature name atop other rap, hip-hop and R&B reviews at Amazon.com. ~Peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Many points of interest; heavy dependence on fan magazines","review":"Some rare photos, plus this book contains the CAB report on Lombard's 1942 plane crash ~ interesting. Matzen relies heavily on contemporary fan magazine articles profiling Lombard, which do her a disservice of sorts, since they more than likely originated with publicity handouts from the studio or her press agent. Filmography is quite thorough. Overall, an intriguing addition to the library of any Lombard enthusiast. (Beware the typesetters' chosen font -- VERY tough on the eyes!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrought with error...","review":"I consider myself a pretty intelligent person. Some of the questions on the practice tests were phrased in such a way that the correct answer could be any number of things including more than just one on the list. There are various gramatical errors throughout the book. It seemed to me like the whole thing was rushed. If you want to get this book, I suggest getting accompanying material. I personally don't trust the book to the point that I would invest my future in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well laid out, but could have more","review":"I was very impressed with the layout and information given in the different tables. It is easy to read and makes it easy to tell what the changes would be for different ammo types.However there is only a limited list of weapons. The Weapons Locker has about 750 weapons (including gernade launchers and some other weapons) compaired to the 250 in this book. I would have liked to see a bit more of the different types of weapons added to this book.If you don't mind a bit smaller selection of weapons and don't need every type of gun under the sun, then this is a great book. If you like to have the veriation and guns from the past and prototypes then you may want to look into the Weapons Locker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice, but incomplete","review":"This book is excellent! For each weapon covered, it goes into great depth. It has great subcategories, ammunition types and nice summary tables for everything. It makes a good distinction between handguns, long arms and installation weapons (like machine guns). The only real problem I have with it is that it's not complete enough. It doesn't have enough specific weapons. I suspect this is because it goes into such depth for the ones it does have, so the writer didn't have room for more. Still, a great addition to any campaign with lots of guns!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Got It","review":"Beware of buying anything from Gamers Aclove. They have horrendous service.

In the end this book was not worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"SORRY THAT I PURCHASED THIS BOOK","review":"I have bought Heather Van Vorous' books regarding IBS -- They are fantastic and I thought that buying THIS book would give additional help! The book is virtually useless. . . The biggest negative about this book was the advice on loading up on wheat fiber -- which can cause horrible reactions in IBS patients! In addition, this team could not have researched the reaction of people with IBS to dairy products -- including yogurt -- Be smart and buy Heather Van Vorous' books -- they are simply wonderful and will help manage this condition!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Original guide to IBS","review":"This book is one of the best books to come along in years on IBS. It is written by a team of specialist which address the complexity of IBS. It brings together a gastroenterologist, a registered dietician, and a psychologist. The most original contributions are written by the psychologist, showing how mind-body approaches and awareness can go a long way to helping those with IBS. The book also helps you diagnose your unique pattern of symptoms and develop a treatment plan to address them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Celtic Music Lovers","review":"If you love Celtic music you will enjoy this CD.

There are about 6 short talking tracks here which are separate from the music tracks accounting for the longish tracklisting. Have no fear you get 50 mins or so of music of normal hard bop duration, 6-8mins plus the 11 min. Blues of Hope. There are a couple of original ballads included as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Year","review":"Sara Jean Underwood provides a great opening with two clips that are not on her video centerfold.

She rivals Sara Jean for best face & hair in my opinion.Monica Leigh would be my 3rd favorite for the year.Cassandra Lynn & Tamara Witmer were both better in still photos than in video format. Def. disappointing. Conversely, Athena Lundberg & Raquel Gibson seemed better in video than I remember from their photos.Overall I think Kara Monaco is only about average but she can do her sexy strip-tease at my door any day. Actually she better come in so the neighbors don't call the police on her I guess.This year didn't have an overall dud which is always a nice touch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does it work","review":"My dog has hip arthritis.

The setting and the historical information about the holcaust was used beautifully to show how a person who has been through a tragedy can learn, grow, and change.

I expecially liked the descriptions of the Holocaust Museum in DC and the use of the holocaust survivors to help the main character come to terms with her own tragedy. A very good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"This book was one of the weaker christian books I have read recently. My major complaint was that the plot was extremely predictable from the very beginning of the book.The only one good thing about the book were the author's descriptions of the Holocaust. The use of these characters who experienced the Holocaust was successful and the description of the museum in DC was phenomenal. But because this wasn't the major part of the plot, it didn't make the book an excellent one. It also didn't seem to be woven in very well with the plot.The book also lacks content in spirituality.

You are shown what your keyboard controls are & they are simular to 18 Wheels Steel Pedal to the Metal.To be personally honest, even though the graphics are not as great, I like the options available on 18 Wheels Steel Pedal to the Metal & more user friendly (although it leaves a lot to be desired).In short: if you are looking for decent graphics, more realistic actions/movements & if you like to figure things out, this is a game you will like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its a good Semi Trucking Game","review":"I do like the SEMI Games all from Wheels of Steel.

However, the material does let moisture in if rained on so I would be careful and try to keep it dry.The only other problem I have had with this bag is tha, one of the clips that connects the shoulder strap to the bag broke.

Most of the people who buy garbage like this are white \\"educated\\" folks who probably feel guilty over being caucasion. It's very easy to avoid problems with the police, don't screw up !! But instead we'll continue to tie cops hands and second guess their every move. But the ones doing the second guessing would be too afraid to do an officers job. How ironic.

Instead, I found a dreadfully boring account of the author's tepid exploration of this cultural trend. He didn't seem quite interested in the topic himself--just kind of aimless, self-absorbed and bored enough to wonder.

There is almost no research beyond his descriptions of a few \\"urban tribes\\" that feel like they are part of some crazy new phenomenon. In one section where he tries to get philosophical, rather than researching actual philosophers, he actually paraphrases high school papers he found on Google (with no citation at all). Then he has the audacity to criticize them. \\" Much of what [Aristotle] came up with was unremarkable\\".

The instruements are pure craziness(and really heavy), and the vocals are very good as well. It does have some problems,though: it wasn't long enough! There are only 9 tracks, and 8 with actual music.

Thirteen years ago, I was in my first year of Columbia when I got pregnant and Sara's journey was mine. I waited too long so adoption was the only recourse. I gave my baby to a family I thought was going to support me, and while they didn't move away as Sara's adoptive family did, they did cut me off, and the adoption agency wasn't much help, nor were all the people telling me to just move on and forget about it. And years later, I took my vacation time at my job and my savings and I did find my baby--who is no baby but a twenty year old college student. I loved, loved, loved this book and I got totally lost in the characters and the beautiful writing. I truly think it should be required reading for all kids, and all adults even thinking of adopting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fast, engaging read","review":"This is a book you will tear through. I was drawn in from the start, and my interest never waned.Sara, pregnant at 15, gives birth at 16 and opts for an open adoption. The adoptive parents, Eva and George, are, predictably, more charmed by Sara before the birth. Once baby Anne enters the picture, Sara's presence becomes more of a burden. Sara's youth and confusion over her emotions and predicament lead her to make some questionable choices that drive a wedge into the open adoption.Leavitt makes some choices that I questioned. Years pass whenever it's narratively convenient, an unbelievable coincidence allows for characters to be reunited after more than a decade, some characters, most notably Sara's parents, are paper-thin. Still, Girls In Trouble is a character-driven novel worth reading because the characters doing the driving are ones you'll care a lot about."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Astounding Novel, True to Life","review":"This beautifully written novel brims with life -- or, rather, lives. Somehow Caroline Leavitt manages to convey all the complexities of a fraught situation - an open adoption that ends up being more complex than any of the principals could have imagined - with clarity and focus and an incredible empathy for each character. As the novel progresses you grow to care about, and more importantly, understand, each one of them, though all have faults and foibles. Like real people, these characters act out of desperation and hope and love and anger. Leavitt's realistic dialogue and acutely detailed description are pitch perfect. This book lives and breathes. I loved reading it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"On par with...","review":"...Barbara Kingsolver! Girls in Trouble grabbed me the way the Bean Trees did. Only this isn't Caroline Leavitt's first novel, you've got 7 more to enjoy after she hooks you with the latest. I do not use the word \\"hooks\\" lightly. I read Girls in Trouble on a flight from Los Angeles to Denver, and for the first time in my over travelled life was disappointed that the flight was not longer, long enough at least to finish this gripping story. Most every one has asked themselves a question that begins with, \\"How would I feel if...\\" and most women have asked themselves the question, \\"How would I feel if I got pregnant?\\" \\"What would I do?\\" It is admittedly one of the most personally and politically charged questions of our time. In Girls in Trouble, Caroline Leavitt involves us in the both agonizing and joyful struggle of one girl's attempt to answer it. For immediate purchase and enjoyment only."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this book!!!","review":"Girls in Trouble was one of the best, most engrossing novels I have read in a while. The pain felt by both Sara and Eva and George is so real I could feel a heavyness in my chest while I read this book (even sneaking a quick page or two at work). Several parts broke my heart, but it was a pretty real idea book. Not much sugar coating. The only think I sort of secretly wished was for Sara to have been able to gotten back together....call me a hopeless romantic fool. R"},{"rating":"2","title":"I want to give it a 4.5 star rating","review":"I liked so much about this book. First and foremost it's gripping, and had me hooked after the first few pages. The story is essentially about a couple who arrange to have an open adoption with a 16 year old high school student. From the beginning you can almost hear the \\"oh oh\\" of wondering if this is really such a good idea. The story is told from different characters points of view, something that works particularly well here, and I found my empathies changing as each person got to speak to me. How does it all work out? That's where I take away the half star - it's just a tiny bit too neat. I highly reccommend this book, but be warned, you won't get much else done until you've turned the last page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down!","review":"Caroline Leavitt is personally responsible for three consecutive nights of very little sleep! I simply couldn't put this book down. The characters are so beautifully drawn, their emotional lives so real, and their complex circumstances so gripping that I found myself thinking about them long after I had completed the book. What's really wonderful is how she is able to show all sides of the open adoption issue, and how it affects everyone involved. She doesn't pick sides and she refuses to simplify, providing the reader with complicated characters and complicated circumstances that allow us to identify with each character whether we agree with them or not. It is a truly exquisite book and a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful! Could Not Put the Book Down!","review":"A wonderful well written book. I could not put it down!

Although I had not heard of Lori Copeland, I purchased this book based on the information provided on Amazon.com. I found the heavy christian themes very off putting. I read Andrew Greeley novels but they are not as heavy handed as this. Of course an author has the right to use any style they wish, but my real complaint is with the publisher and Amazon for not properly portraying this novel. If you are looking for a christian-centered mystery, this may be a book for you. However, if you find christian spirituality and themes offensive, avoid this book.

When I saw this book at a used bookstore I became excited! I had heard wonderful things about the author and I was looking forward to reading this story. What a sad, disappointing, slow, and overall awful book! The main character is so shallow and flat it was hard to get through the pages. I don't know a mother who would let her 30-year-old daughter come home and waste her life away eating. Oh and well I'm am on the subject of eating, why did the author put so much into what the characters ate. She even described in great detail the kinds of cereal. Also there was a lot of talk about the pets. I didn't care about a dog that died or a cat that decided to run the household. I was saddened by how lonely Maude was at first until I realized that it was her own fault. At least Stella had a bridge club to attend.

Playing this game, I found this game needed some work on the physics of car crashes. The impact of the vehicles weren't realistic at all, the collisions felt more like you were playing bumper cars than experiencing a real crash between two vehicles. The guns and missles add a certain arcade style to this game I did not like. Some tracks are difficult to maneveur around as well.

The quality of the video overall was extremely poor, looked like those old extended play VHS videos, with many sound dropouts. The first episode didn't even play all the way through - the DVD may be damaged, although it looks OK. I tried it in 3 different DVD players. The menu options didn't work correctly either, took a lot of playing around to get it to another episode.Overall I was disappointed, the show was not too bad, the Camel commercials were amusing but the quality of the DVD made this purchase a very poor decision. Yes , I could probably return it, but the costs of returning it and the hassle of getting a correction far outweighs the cost of the original DVD - next time I will be more careful."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Adventures of Topper ...

But still, they keep rolling up and don't sit on the skin.Another thing i really don't like - the area the patch can cover is pretty tiny. i'm size 3-4, and i don't have that many areas i need to cover but in order to cover them all on by legs and butt i need at least 8-10 patches to cover everything at the same time ( i've put just 2 at the time though). I can't even imagine how many of them a larger woman would need.The gel is great though. So, if you are considering the product, my advise - go for the gel.

Black was actually very good to say the least I am very impressed.Kaia deals with the struggles of being a black sheep in her own house. At an early age she realizes that she is not her mother's favorite daughter and witnesses tragedy at the hands of her mother. What should have brought them closer only edged them farther apart. After meeting Aaron, Kaia feels safe and secure until yet another tragedy leaves her lonely and pregnant. If she can't count on anyone she knows that she has her friends. But Kaia also realizes that when tragedy strikes you see who your real friends are.Can Kaia get over the wedge between her and her mother? Can she provide love and support to her baby all by herself? Will jealousy ruin a childhood friendship?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Wonderful","review":"I read this book and was not interested in it in the beginning.

Good Job Tracy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GO TRACY GO TRACY","review":"I am going to read every book this author puts out there. After reading White Lines my interest was peaked.

Kaia is the main character in the story she goes threw many trails and tribulations threw out the story. The painful death of her father who her mother killed right infront of her eyes, the isolation of her sisters, and the betrayal of a friend just to name a few issues that confront her in her life. It seems like everyday it rains on her and she'll never have a chance at true happiness. Threw out the book you see the transformation of a girl to a woman who is finally free.This book is worth reading and is no disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black","review":"I think this book is awesome. I read at least 2 books a week, and I can't help but comment on this book. Tracy Brown out did herself. This book shows how hard times can hit a person (Kaia), but God never puts more on a person that they can't bear. I find this book to touch on the streets as well as true friendship, and for once an upstanding man, baby father. I also noticed how the author showed a great relationship between brothers Aaron and Keith.

Was a touching movie about service dogs and how they help those who often cannot do for themselves. Did wonder what happened to the dogs who didn't make the cut. But do appreciate the producers of this movie showing real live service animals doing what they do best helping those with physical limitations.

This video follows a group of recipients during and after a \\"training camp.\\" The recipients range from small children to adults.What is so right about this video is that it shows the ups and downs of owning a SD. Many people think that it must be easy and fun to have a SD, and this video shows that that is not always the case. Some of the match-ups are wonderful, and others don't work out. In each case Canine Assistants is there to help their recipients and dogs find the best possible resolution.This is a great video, and it is appealing to all audiences, whether you are disabled or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great look at amazing dogs and people","review":"This is an incredible look at service dogs, the people who train them, and the people they help.

I am an adult who had a terrible time with \\"traditional\\" knitting books, and found this clear, simple and loaded with nicely progressive projects that take you from the simple knit stitch to making a sweater in the blink of an eye. The projects are so fun. I've enjoyed making them and can't wait to teach my kids. I like this book a bit more than the Klutz Knitting book because it takes you a bit further into more difficult projects, but Klutz make a darn nice little kit and the book is great (albeit a bit more limited) - another favorite of mine!

I'd forgotten what my mom taught me when I was 12, but this book explained things just right for me. I have a collection of knitting magazines that I regularly drool over (LOL) but that I've never actually made anything from. When I saw the spiral rib sock pattern and saw that it was done with double pointed needles, I knew that if kids could do it, so can I. Now I see that I was right!The book has a natural progression from beginner projects to those a little more advanced, and has lots of pictures with colors sure to appeal to kids and teens alike. I love this book! I'm almost finished with my first sock!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for a child or a beginning knitter!","review":"This is a great book, I wish that it had been my first book when I started knitting at age 7, but I still bought it because it has fun easy projects that my kids would love and would be easy to teach them using this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe it's just me??","review":"Maybe it's just me. I usually catch on pretty quickly with most anything in a creative sense, but knitting just doesn't seem to be one of the things I am able to do well. I have checked out book after book from my library and no help. I've studied tutorials online and no help. So I bought this book thinking if it were written for children and got such rave reviews from grown ups as well, then maybe it would help me! No such luck! The directions seemed pretty easy, but I guess I am a visual learner and the pictures just didn't seem to help me out at all!! It also seemed like it was thrown together awkwardly. I don't know, but I'm glad I bought it used and only paid a total of about 6 dollars for it!! It was a let down from the reviews I read on amazon before buying it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Left - Handed People!","review":"If your left - handed this book is NOT for you.

Th intructions make it seem very challenging!!!!!! I don't reccomend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"the knitting/purling method is overly complicated","review":"I'm surprised that no-one has commented on the overly complicated knitting/purling method used in this book.The book shows only one way to make a knit/purl stitch, and it's slow and torturous. You insert the right needle into the stitch as you normally would when knitting or purling, but then you hold the point where the needles intersect, pick up the working yarn with your free hand and wind it around the needle. Then you pick up both needles again and complete the stitch as usual. This method would frustrate any child, enough to get them to stop knitting altogether."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids Knitting","review":"This book presents learning to knit in an easy-to-understand format.

He is an accomplished finger knitter! The \\"two needle\\" technique proved too difficult for him at this time, but having always wanted to learn knitting myself, I decided to give it a whirl. Finally someone has written a book on how to knit that even I can follow. The projects in the book make great gifts, especially if you have appeciative kids or young friends. When I progressed to making a sample of various stitches I did need the hands on advise of an experienced knitter to guide me through the instructions but more to boost my confidence that I wasn't missing something. The instructions and illustrations throughout the book are very readable and a lot of fun. The book also concludes with a great, comprehensive glossary of common abbreviations used in commercial knitting instructions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amy Carmichael","review":"Carmichael is truly an inspired writer.

Left me informed and in a great mood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Had in Mind","review":"I bought this book because someone recommended her kid wrangeling book and as I am newly pregnant I figured I would start with Bun in the Oven. The book starts with the author laying out her pregnancy history in a diary format and she explains all the negative things going on with pregnancy. She was drinking and smoking a week after conception because she didn't know she was pregnant, but she had been trying to get pregnant, so I don't know why she wasn't being cautious.The author recommends some other pregnancy books to read if you are pregnant and I would guess that they would better for a \\"first\\" book to read when you find out you are pregnant. This might be an amusing book to read if you already feel you know everything you need to know. The authors negative attitude about her pregnancy was a real turn off and there was no where near the amount of information on the pregnancy that I was expecting. I will not be finishing this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought I'd love it but I was wrong","review":"I really looked forward to this book.I thought I'd enjoy the humour in it as well as learn a few things.Essentially I find the general attitude of the author as very negative....the author must've really hated finding out she was pregnant/being pregnant and then having the baby.There are a few giggly bits in it but certainly nothing to rave about.As for information it's sparse, most of what it contains I've gotten from my monthly pregnancy magazine subscription."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad information in this book.","review":"This book should get zero stars because the author makes false statements. She claims that a vegan diet is not adequate for a developing fetus. This is completely false and the author should not be making statements that cannot be backed by proof. I would seriously question her ability to offer any legitimate information on pregnancy. Not only have women successfully completed their entire pregnancy on a 100% vegan diet, but people are also raising incredibly healthy vegan children. I myself am vegan (30 weeks pregnant) and am having an incredibly successful pregnancy. My prenatal care provider is extremely happy with my progress as well as the baby's progress.

Now that I bought, I honestly do not recommend it to anyone. The book starts with questions and multiple choice answers for everything then you find the answers a few pages later.There are no explanations for the answers or how the stuff works.Basically it is a look and memorize book without any theory of operation or coaching on how things work. The paper is cheap and the fonts are small, hard to read. Instructions are confusing. I do not recommend it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"hmmm","review":"this is not a needed purchase for the afoqt. there are only a few pages pertaining to anything found on the test."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice prep","review":"Got this book for my husband because he applied for the union and had to review test material.

But not got to be a huge fan because it was of course directed at girls. But I heard good things about Tsubasa and that it had something for us guys too. So I gave it a chance and was tottally hooked.Of course during the second season it does get a little weird. But still very good.Volume 12 is perhaps some of the best of season two. My question is in the anime they act as if at the end of the last episode on the disk it's the end of the series. Is this true? Im very much wondering due to I cannot find any hint of another disk comming on amazon.So anyways enjoy the series!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much more","review":"I debated whether to keep this \\"study guide\\" or to return it for a refund. I expected it to be similar to an AP study guide; it does not contain much more than what you can find on the ETS Praxis website. There are only 12 sample test questions on-line, whereas this guide does have 120, the number on an actual test. So you can practice the test with a 2 hour time limit, simulating the test conditions. And if the questions cover the scope of the \\"real\\" test, it would give you an idea of what areas you need to study more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately, not much here","review":"I just purchased the downloadable version from ETS. You'd expect more from a study guide put together by the same people who created the test. It claims to be 90+ pages, but between all the blank pages and rehash of what's available on the website, it's more like 40 pages of information. There are 120 questions and the rationale for their answers. That's the meat of the guide. Skimpy."},{"rating":"2","title":"there is \\"hot sauce\\" and then there is TOBASCO","review":"I have been a longtime user and a huge fan of Tobasco sauce for at least the past 13 years. I cannot get enough of it, it is flavorful and spicy and makes everything taste excellent. I use it for cooking and as a general condiment, it's also a perfect salt substitute because this adds a punch without as much sodium as table salt. Tobasco is especially great with chicken, seafood, beef, barbecue, Italian food, Asian foods, Tex-Mex, eggs and in sauces, casseroles and ground beef recipes. I always keep at least 2 large jars in my kitchen (a 12 ounce and 5 ounce one) that are literally used multiple times each day. It doesn't make foods \\"hot,\\" instead Tobasco just adds to the natural flavors by enhancing what you're preparing. I will never touch or try another hot sauce because nothing can compare to the rich and full flavor of Tobasco. Tobasco is absoltely the best condiment that will ever enter your kitchen and mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected. Inappropriate for young teens.","review":"I was very diappointed in this book. I bought 8 copies for a teen support group at my daughter's middle school. There is a whole chapter dealing with sex, and has absolutely nothing to do with managing diabetes. For example, it goes into detail (a whole page) on how to use a condom. The book would be great if this whole chapter were taken out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not great","review":"My daughter loves this book and brings it to me over and over and over. It's a lift the flap book with one poorly designed flap - the front door and the front of the little log cabin. The problem is that first you \\"open\\" the door then you lift the flap of the front of the house. That has lead to ripping. Still worth buying though, if just for \\"playing\\" peek-a-boo with Carrie."},{"rating":"1","title":"phony balony","review":"Besides being self-consciously, but poorly, written I thought this writer was disingenuous. She begins the book talking about how poor her memory is and goes on to recall every detail of her life, down to what people said and wore. While she does not idealize her mother she also does not comment on the remarkable neglect she suffered at her hands, and furthermore does not acknowledge how important were the only two women who seemed to have cared for her, her paternal grandmother and stepmother. I realize that coming from a mixed background does not make things easy for a person, however, this writer does not make clear what her particular problem was. Her drug use and promiscuity seemed to be in large part due to the lack of involvement of her mother, and her 'poor me' attitude more to do with her character than her circumstances. And then the surprise at the end - the coy way she tells us she is a lesbian - just one more unexplained event."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"Why would a publisher consider such a wandering, whine of a book? Were the author not Alice Walker's daughter, I'm sure the publisher would have passed on this one. I'm not suggesting there isn't room for another mixed race exploration. But with standards like the Color of Water, Walker's poor-me tone just doesn't wash.Given the editing problems in this book, one can only guess at the original manuscript. After so carefully describing the male genetalia of her many male lovers, how is it possible that the reader is supposed to be content \\"knowing\\" that the author is a lesbian.By the time I finished this book, I felt cheated that I'd spent the time on this poor excuse instead of something more enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"another whining memoir by priviledged kid of famous parents","review":"This book is a long laundry list of complaints by an author who turned to promiscuity and drugs to deal with the usual teenage anxieties. She takes no responsibility for her poor choices. She blames all her turmoil on her genes, on her family, the culture and on and on. Hardly a role model for any struggling person trying to live with heart. The book is repetitious and pretty boring. I think the author ought to live another twenty years before writing an autobiography of any kind. SHe is just out of her twenties. And it shows."},{"rating":"1","title":"If her mother weren't Alice Walker......","review":"This is a rather mediocre report of growing up in the 70s and 80s. I don't think it would even have been published if the author's mother weren't Alice Walker.I think the younger Ms. Walker is bright and writes well, but there is no great reason for reading this book. Unfortunately, I've never read any of the magazine articles written by Ms. Walker, but I will be looking for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Takes a lot of ego to write your autobiography at age 31.","review":"All I can say is if you want to waste $20 and about 5 hours of your time, buy this book. You'll learn of her torrid past, her victimized youth, her stolen audi. Its a mixed up story of an over-indulged youth in a world gone amuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only Good for the Dish on Alice!","review":"Like many others have said below, boring, shallow, and only published because she is the daughter of the famous writer Alice Walker. The only redeeming feature of the book is the delicious dish on her mother. My goodness, Alice Walker certainly lives up to every horrible stereotype of the self-involved second wave feminist. The details invite a reappraisal of the meeting of the personal and the political in certain strands of feminist lit. In this sense, the book needs to be read as the latest installment, albeit somewhat less glamourous, of the ungrateful daughter's nasty tell-all genre, a la Christina Crawford and B.D. Hyman (daughter of Bette Davis). More useful as tabloid material for eggheads rather than general enlightenment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leave the writing to her mother","review":"Blah blah blah! Sorry, but I was expecting so much more. Maybe I went into this book with a larger expectation for Rebecca, but this is anything but an inspiring story but more of a multi cultural child whining that she had to move a lot.

I thought that I would get a really good book but boy was I wrong. My big question is \\"Where in the hell was Alice when her daughter needed her?\\" I guess she was writing those other whacked out books after Color Purple. This girl has issues that most of my biracial friends never had to deal with..ex: like a mother who was never there.

It is very refreshing to read a book that is extremely open-minded and openly discusses the taboos in multiple cultures. Excellent book! Highly recommened. I liked it so much I am looking to read more books written by Rebecca Walker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique perspective","review":"this book is a unique view of the world from a young persons perspective who in addition to the struggles of being an adolescent, this mixture is spiced with the familial racial/social and religious factions that aided the further disorientation of self. what it says is that 'it is not easy'. it is a challenge to be multidimensional in a world that wants desperately to be able to categorise and quantify you, as well as your thoughts.Rebecca Walker had experiences that mirror many of those felt by young girls and women growing up in America, yet had discrepancies that are not so common.The combination of these factors develops into a read that takes you inside the personal space of a single girl and a whole family with its divergent and sometimes contradictory egos.I am thankful for the chance to take a glance into the honest and challenging self."},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting to know Rebecca Walker","review":"This a beautifully written novel on the life of a biracial, bicultural, young person.

I was impressed with Ms Walker's writing skill and style and would definately recommend it. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Profound Truths Here","review":"A very sad book but not for the reasons the author intends. According to Walker, she has rhythm because of her black lineage (which of course makes her incredible in bed). She can withstand the cold because of her white blood. And she is a neurotic, overanalytical mess because of her Jewish heritage. Has the dialogue about race and religion progressed so little that someone of Walker's keen intelligence would try to pass off these inanities as profound truth?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny but not odd","review":"Having several friends who fit the description of the title, I was glad someone finally wrote a book about it. Why is being Black and White such a problem in the world? You really don't hear of books being written about people being Asian and white or Middle Eastern and White, etc.... Then add the Judaic faith to it all and we have a situation that seems to be worthy of writing a book. However,I enjoyed it because the writer was honest in her experiences of what is was like being raised in Judaism. Many accounts were funny, yet sad. I read the book several years ago and just recently passed it on to a friend who is Black, White and Jewish. She too enjoyed it, and stated the author hit home with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was expecting so much more from a book that deals with being biracial. I found the book shallow and was waiting for some experience she cited to make me really feel what it was like to be both black and Jewish. The only thing I felt in the end was that it was no different than being a mix of anything or even just feeling that you don't fit in, like so many teens do. A very disappointing book from a woman that I'm sure really has much more to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puerile Kvetching...","review":"... This is an easy read because there isn't much to it! Rebecca Walker's book plays the same monotonous teen sex and drug scenes over and over,different chapter, different city. In \\"Black, White and Jewish\\" Rebecca Walker hints at her attraction to her female friends and one prepubescent lesbian sexual experience but she never gets to how she went from all of her \\"hetero\\" exploits to her current lesbian status..."},{"rating":"2","title":"See It For What It Is","review":"I finished the book last night and loved it. Rebecca's writing style is inspiring and beautiful. The story was engaging enough for me to finish in two sittings. Every life is worth a novel and we should all be so lucky as to write ours down for others to read. Many of these reviewers are judging Rebecca's choices or her parents emotional distance or accusing the book of being published only because she is Alice Walker's daughter. But there are thousands of books published each year by not so famous children. Rebecca could have rested on her duff and done nothing, but instead she used her talent as a writer to heal something inside of herself by telling her story. Read the book for what it is - an interesting account of one woman's coming of age, one woman's account of being biracial in America, one woman's story in a sea of millions. I applaud her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Survival, and Triumph","review":"This is a riveting account of a child struggling to understand her place in the world. As a \\"movement child\\" of two loving parents, Rebecca knew who she was and owned her beauty. After he parents' divorce, she lost that identity and began a struggle to overcome the identity assigned to her in the communities she bounced between while growing up in a cross-country joint custody journey. She chronicles the colorless love of those who stood by her throughout it all, and evidences the racial discrimination that most White Americans today deny. She is a virbrant voice for all women who came of age before aids, in the early eighties when sexual expectations were extreme. She paints a rich portrait of the spiritual effort to bridge cultures between her Jewish father's affluent world, and the inner-city world she lived in with her mother. Not only will this book be valuable to anyone interested in cultural diversity, but it is a tribute to all of us who have fought to find ourselvs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Certainly not what I expected","review":"As the mother of two bi-racial children, I bought the book to understand what it was like to be \\"Black, White and Jewish\\". Perhaps I was expecting too much but I didn't expect to hear of one's drug use and sexual relationships at a young age etc. I don't believe the book spoke to it's title at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"schmaltz","review":"Schmaltz is literally \\"chicken fat\\" but it refers to something that is kitsch and gooey ... this book is unreal and amateurish when it could have been something a lot better. It is not easy to be black white AND Jewish....but it is a different world now and there are a lot of mixes...How about White Japanese and Jewish and she opened the first Japanese Kosher restaurant in New York City. There was so much to say here and none of it is said...just schmaltz - chicken fat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the universal biracial experience","review":"I'm also black, white and Jewish and was hoping to see myself in these pages....alas, I did not. I did relate to one or two things but for the most part, I found the book lacking.It is important for biracial literature to be out there in the marketplace but readers should note that there are many aspects of biraciality and that this book is not the universal biracial experience; particularly since she is someone of a very privileged background - daughter of a writer and a lawyer, a Yale grad, a worker on a movie set as a teenager. That's pretty rare for anyone, regardless of what race the person is.Furthermore, while she is very open about her biraciality, she is very vague about her bisexuality. Why? Perhaps that is her next book..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promise unfulfilled","review":"This book looked promising. At first, I didn't realize Rebecca Walker was in any way related to Alice Walker. I picked it up, because it appeared to have a multi-cultural, bi-racial theme: a story about someone growing up bi-racially and multi-culturally. I didn't realize it was going to be about the life and times of Alice Walker's daughter from her perspective as a \\"movement\\" child. While she probably wasn't looking for it, she did gain some sympathy from me, but in the end, I felt she was able to get a book deal because of her connections, her privileged background, and I was left empty. I did not get a real feel for who Rebecca is nor for her deeper experiences. Just as she seemed to do with those in her life, I felt she was trying to get attention with shocking tidbits of her life. This book is not a keeper. It has been passed around to a number of my friends, a number also purchased it, and we have all basically been left pretty disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"completely forgettable","review":"Given the slants on the traditional coming-of-age story, I was astounded at how boring and shallow this book was. After 50 pages, I no longer cared what brand of jeans Walker was wearing, what color her current boyfriend/best friend was, or what drugs she was taking at the time of their relationship. Her teenage escapades blurred together because not a single character was developed and explored. Nor were Walker's feelings of ambivalence other than a few token tries thrown in here and there. She goes from someone who apparently did anything to fit in to a high school senior militantly proud of her African American identity. And we are glad she has apparently resolved some major issues. However we are left with absolutely no clue as to why. In the end, I couldn't figure out if I was missing something or if there was simply nothing to miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun and so easy -","review":"Very nice picture book. Not much info on greenhouse growing but good info on greenhouses of ten years ago. The newer greenhouse have been left out.

American Tobacco, the Mississippi case that launched the mid-1980s barrage of legal attacks on big tobacco and led eventually to U.S. settlements of more than $200 billion. As they read about the assault on Brown and Williamson, cinema buffs may feel they are revisiting The Insider with Al Pacino. The book combines a walk-through of the day-to-day legal procedures and motions with a look into the lives of the major players. This well-written volume presents the tobacco case like an engrossing true-crime story, although some readers may find it has too much detail to hold their interest. We [...] recommend this fascinating book to most general readers. But while executives searching for principles to apply to their own companies may find themselves captivated, they won't find much here that is generally applicable."},{"rating":"1","title":"The first part of the New Testament is missing","review":"This is TNIV Church Bible edition printed by Zondervan.

Then there is a brief portion of Judges and then on to 1 & 2 Samuel and then 1 Kings again. Needless to say, I will make sure and flip through the entire Bible the next time I order one from Amazon, since I'm way past the 30 day return period now.

However, there are parts that keep this Patric Swazye flick from being given 4 or 5 stars. One is that fact that the film is rather contradictory on several points, which I will leave to you the viewer to discover. Another problem is the simpicity of the film. A man is in jail for his wifes murder; he is acquitted; someone trys to frame him by killing associates in the same manner his wife was killed; in the end, he is proven innocent. The same plot as a thousand other films. This movie seems to have striking characteristics seen in \\"The Fugitive\\", but it simply goes too far. Not a high recommendation.GOD BLESS YOU !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Made for Television","review":"This movie was made for television; instead of a major rent, or buy movie.The beginning is interesting, to the middle of the movie.

After all, we all know for sure what a lemon the Yugo turned out to be. Unfortunately, the rest of the book basically amounts to a third grader taunting another classmate. Why go after the Datsun b210? Because it rusted a bit? Cars are made of metal! They all eventually rust! The 210 was one of the most dependable cars ever built. Even the author recognizes the fact that the 510 would have started after a nuclear war. In other words, if you're looking for an in depth look at some of the worst cars ever built, look elsewhere. Porter decided to pick random cars out of his imaginary top hat, and dissect them with all the wit of a 4 year old.

At times the series is dark but all around anne bishop pulls off a great story."},{"rating":"2","title":"An improvement","review":"I've read all of Anne Bishop's fantasy series, as well as The Invisible Ring. The Black Jewels Trilogy disappointed me because of the lack of characterization of villains, as well as the extremely powerful protagonists.For the most part, this series easily surpasses the Black Jewels Trilogy. The characters are convincing - even likable. Each book in the series offers two new protagonists as view-point characters, which is especially nice if you don't particularly like one of the characters. The villains are sufficiently cruel, but so are some other characters. The Fae, especially, impressed me with their unique personalities.Of Bishop's writings, this series is second only to The Invisible Ring. It deserves a lot more credit than it usually recieves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up to her other books at all","review":"Having read and absolutely adored the Black Jewels trilogy, I assumed this series would be more of the same, and was eager to get my hands on a copy. Little did I know how much of a disappointment was in store for me.I was expecting the rich, dark fantasy/romance of her other books. What I got was a trite, cliched romance novel with bland characters I simply couldn't make myself care about in the slightest. There was nothing redeeming or interesting about any of the characters at all. Even the story wasn't good enough to keep me going--it read as nothing more than a cliched, Wiccan-oriented retelling of the so-called Burning Times. Yes, this could have been interesting were it done properly, but as it was...Anne Bishop is not a terrible author, but this is a terrible series. I honestly cannot say I would recommend it to anyone. If you want a good read, pick up Daughter of the Blood or Sebastian. Don't waste your time with these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not As Good As The Black Jewels Trilogy...","review":"...but still good. Why? cause it's got the flair that makes Anne Bishop's writing soooooo unique (and good).Now, personally, I luv Aiden, the Bard, and like Morag, the Gatherer of Souls, and Death's Mistress. Now although the story's main character is actually Ari and Neall, I'm not terribly fond of either of them than just simply liking them cause they're against the 'Witch's Hammer', who kills Morag in the end *sniff*. Opps. Shouldn'ta said that.But, honestly, Ari and Neall's relationship may last, but it's sooooo mundane. Aiden and Lyrra, if they ever get together, however...I think they've got a good chance. Especially since Lyrra already luvs Aiden...Oh well. Even though this book was great, I hope more mention of Aiden comes in Shadows and Light. Even though I'm only 11, I know what makes a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good...","review":"Okay, so not *riveting*, but very good. 5 stars means my kids can Magic Marker the walls as long as they leave me alone so I can read, so this one got a 4 IMO. I did read the Black Jewels trilogy first, and would give it a 4.5. I would not say the Black Jewels is much *better*, just a different style & story that I liked a little more. My biggest complaint with this series was trying to figure out which in this series was first! (It's Pillars of the World, #2 is Shadows and Light.) Definitely recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"totally disappointed","review":"I had to force myself to finish this book. The characters never developed enough for me to care about them. God I miss Daemon and Satan. Ms. Bishop, please bring them back! Pillars Of The World is totally different then Daughters and I guess that's the problem for me. All the characters are weak and boring. I'm not used to characters like that coming from the mind of Anne Bishop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Easy","review":"This book was very good. Too bad for me I made the mistake of thinking the beginning set-up. So I was rather attatched to Lucian and Dianna. The people you adore from the start, with the exception of Neall and Ari, you despise at the end. I had never thought of the Fae(or elf like creatures) in a bad way before. But these people really change your mind rather quickly. I reccomend it, and the one that comes after it, but I warn that the one that comes next has very little to do with Neall and Ari :o( But it does offer other stories that are almost as touching :o)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pillars","review":"This book was great. Anne Bishop quickly became one of my favorite authors with her Black Jewels Trilogy and The Invisible Ring. I enjoyed this book very much, but I thought that the characters could have had more depth and witch power could have been explored more. I guess she's leaving that up to the next two in this series.

I was actually surprised that it even made it into a second season the way the series took a dark turn towards the end of 1st season. Still, having said that, I was glad when Fox did finally bring it back for a midseason replacement (I guess they called it). The stories were well thought out and written, even made Jason Priestley's character look like he wanted to switch sides once. It would definitely have been better programming (maybe even better ratings) if Fox had allowed the season to finish. Such a quick end to things although I did sort of like their Christmas cliffhanger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best show ever.","review":"Tru Calling was such a great show. FOX, however, cancelled it after two amazing seasons. I really don't think they know what they're doing. Eliza Dushku is probably one of the best actresses ever and the show was growing so much.

They switched the night of the show constantly and kept it off the air for so long they lost a lot of viewers. Who really would rather watch a tv show about a blonde bimbo *Paris Hilton trapsing across the country than a show that actually has meaning is beyond me, but whatever floats your boat. The comic blend off making death a light matter made the show watchable. Sort of expecting a full second season like all other people I am glad they actually did one good thing and put the episodes they did air on DVD. Thanks Fox for finally doing something right!"},{"rating":"2","title":"PLEASE BRING BACK TRU CALLING!","review":"Tru Calling Season 2 is a wonderful continuation of the Fox Show Tru Calling. I just wish that this included some sort of conclusion of the entire season. The last episode ends with the audience feeling like we are still in the middle of the season. It already is a let down that Fox cancelled the show. The creaters of Tru Calling could have at least completed the season. OVERALL, I love the show!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the same old stuff","review":".Tru Calling consistently did better with each succeeding episode, and the much abbreviated season 2 continued to do so.

I agree with all the other people on this site and that is it never had a chance to get better, I mean it was great to begin with, but it only went for two seasons. The second season only had 5 to 6 episodes on it. I'll Buy it of course, but It was still so Dissapointing to here that it never got a chance thats all. Please someone put it back on the air. Please! Thanks for your time. Later!!!!!!! ( I would give it 20 stars if they had them)."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did it get this far??!!","review":"It's a bad show. Badly conceived, bad writing, bad acting. It never should have gotten past a full first season, much less a second, even one this short.

It gets off to a great start with the Season Premiere that provides momentum for the remaining episodes. Having Jack challenge Tru at every turn brings up so many more possibilities. And having Jack have a mole is a nice touch. There's even a step up when it comes to the emotional stakes.It is now that I would start recommending it to people. Of course we know it got cancelled (probably prematurely). Shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"A watch over and over movie","review":"Tru Calling is a great show.

No complexity, no evolving mythos, nada. The last few stories of the first season, and a couple of second season stories showed promise, but the rest were not worthwhile. A series that was sabotaged by an underdeveloped premise, and uninspired writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where are they selling this??","review":"First I want to say that I LOVE TRU CALLING.

It covers how to put dents and dings in your models, how to put dust, dirt and grime layers on them, and a lot of other techniques. There are tutorials in almost every chapter, which can be applied in almost every 3d package. There are also appendices at the back with information on different materials, metal, plastic, and rubber, giving all information neccessary to recreate them using procedural textures.

I would definitely recommend it to anyone who are chasing after their dreams but are too shy too. It made a difference in me and I think it would definitely make a difference in you!

Also was very much like the old WWII news reels...I even think they used the same narrator:) Was not what I was expecting, If you are craving a more true to life coverage of the Vietnam war, I would recommend saving up your money and paying the extra for the \\"...10 thousand day war\\" series also available here."},{"rating":"1","title":"USA TV fragments","review":"Should have red previous reviews.

I got this bell to help me keep track of her whereabouts, thinking that if it was called a \\"sportsman's bell\\", it would have a loud, clear ring that would be audible from quite a distance. WRONG! The bell has a high pitched tone and can only be heard from maybe 100 yards away. Also, the tab that loops on the collar is somewhat short so doesn't fit easily over the collar buckle. I bought a cheaper bell from my local feed store that has a longer collar attachment and also a clankier but more audible tone and I am a lot happier with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Purchase it!","review":"I am going to start purchasing this whole series.

Maybe when he is older.After a few readings, I happened to notice that in one of the illustrations, all the children sitting it out were colored, and the ones playing (4 square or duck duck goose, I can't recall) appeared to be white. And I flinched. I don't pay much attention to the illustrations but my son studies them. I can't help wondering what he's picking up and filing away.Caveat - I didn't study it that closely. Just noticed a difference in color.Anyway, it is a great book for young children who need some tips on how to join in and play.

I found it difficult for myself, because of the way the author spells things out, which is exactly the way they're supposed to help you. I got mixed up because I'm now used to pronouncing Japanese words with Japanese vowel sounds, but this book emphasizes using the English pronunciation, which again is the entire purpose of their teaching method.

They are pro vegetarianism, veganism really, to an extent that I think is excessive, even though I agree with most of what they say. However, they need to take a deeper look at the role of carbohydrates and fat in health, given recent research, in my opinion. They are very down on meat, with good reason, but lump all kinds of meat together, including fish and I believe a more sophisticated treatment of this topic is warranted.

I would really love to know what happened.. Did they find the lifesource? Did they make it home? Did Elie (if that's how you spell his name) kill himself after 2 weeks so that the ship had enough power to make it all the way to where it was going?

And why not? The old format wasn't working anymore and the writing was on the wall, clear as day.How can you call yourself a true Stargate fan when you get a top-notch serious SG show, and you hate it.

It has nothing to do with either series which came before it, nor the movie. It is full of utter stupidity, and they wasted time, talent and money making this crap. I hope to god this isn't the end of Stargate, but thank god it is the end of Stargate SGU.

I never could get past the total acceptance of the changing body thing by family members. The whining by suposed adults was way annoying too. I kept waiting for something exciting to happen, but even the excting things were somehow boring. I'm not sure how they managed that. The brooding commander had way too much agnst to be believable as a leader.

Endless interpersonal conflict, school dedications, cheating wives, hysterical men silenced by macho women, gardening, I'm-smarter-than-you playground talk, repetitive trips to yet another star. Most infuriating was the endless blather about Destiny's mission, whatever the hell it was supposed to be. The soap in a tin can series was mainly the fault of scripts written by people with no understanding of the core principles of sci-fi: People in unimagined situations that elicit wonder.

My mother in law picked up a huge Little Tikes set with ramps, cranes, and tunnels at a yard sale and they loved it. I bought this smaller version hoping it would fit the bill as a replacement to the set she has at her house, but in a smaller form. I was mistaken, as they've probably spent about 10 minutes playing with it in the last 6 months. It is made well, but they just aren't interested in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that interesting","review":"Reviews are great to check before you buy. This toy was received as a gift.

Everyone loves them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Great for Sure","review":"This is such a disappointment. I was so excited to get it because I had seen it on Baby Einstein. My child could care less. The airplane should move easier, and you have to really push on the buttons to make the lights come on and to make the sounds work. It might just be mine, but the red light only works when it wants to. When I took it out of the box my sister and I just kept saying, \\"It has to do something. It just has to do more than that.\\" But it doesn't. PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as entertaining as we thought","review":"This toy was interesting to my toddle son for the first 30 minutes it was in the house. Since then, he hasn't played with it much at all. You have to push the red, yellow and green lights hard to make the noise, and the plane doesn't do anything. The only thing my son enjoys from the toy are the car and the train that came with it. He loves rolling them down the slope of our futon chair. I must say that this toy does not live up the Little Tikes name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Child won't play with it","review":"My son got this for his first birthday.

He played maybe 15 min. with it before he got bored. He's had it for 1 week and has played with it maybe 2-3 times. He does like the toy car and train that comes with the set. Before you spend your money, let them test drive at the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"take a pass","review":"I think the idea is good, but it just isn't made right. The two vehicles that come with it are supposed to roll down the hill, but they don't! You have to push them, and just the right way, to make it work, not something any baby could do. Also, the sounds are fun if you can figure out how to make them, but I prefer the baby to earn a response other than just noise.

I had never used FrameMaker before. The tutorial touched on all the main features of the program, providing a comprehensive overview. However, the tutorial is lacking in several ways. For one, the lessons give you steps to follow to accomplish a specific task, but does not explain the why's of these steps, resulting at times in confusion as to why something was done. Also, the lessons often integrate various functions into one long step, and little attention is paid to one particular function. Many individual functions are never even covered. (This last aspect of the tutorial is, again, why I believe that this tutorial primarily serves best as an introduction to the program.) Yet used in conjunction with the FrameMaker User Guide, Classroom In a Book serves as a simple and handy counterpart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't expect to be up and running after doing these lessons","review":"I faithfully completed all the lessons in this book then attempted to create my first FrameMaker document from scratch.

I am a software developer by trade and I am an experienced Word user, some would say a power user.This book gives an overview of the basic features of FrameMaker and leads the reader through exercises on existing documents.

Then Mura really foes into discussing the struggles of Asian-Americans today. Problems of fitting in, and sexual stereotypes.

He put words to very deep, very vague feelings that I have carried and that a lot of asians growing up in this society probably have as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"The author lets it ALL hang out.","review":"Which means he opens himself up to be criticized for being a (reformed) porn-meister, internalized racist, disaffected tourist, and all-around vanity plate/jerk.

This DVD attempts to cover far too many topics and doesn't really do any of them justice. (I just don't understand why a \\"Beginning\\" instructional DVD has to throw everything and the kitchen sink at you instead of focusing on a few key topics and doing them well.)

Honestly, the only worthwhile take-away from the DVD are some of Abe Laboriel's riffs."},{"rating":"1","title":"abe ought to be ashamed of himself","review":"I thought WOW an abe laboriel dvd after veiwing a few minutes of it I wished I had not.

How is this helpful for beginning funk bass players? There's no technical direction in this DVD at all. After having watched it, I am no better at playing the bass guitar than I was before I watched it. Sure, Abe plays a few incredible riffs, but you can get that for free on the web. I don't remember ever being this disappointed with a DVD in my life.I'm sorry Mr. Laboriel. You're still my favorite musician and I respect the heck out of you.

He certainly has a way with words, but his protagonist's angst is laid down with a trowel. I also found the character repellent. I normally like literate heroes who can wield allusions well, but this guy's no Spenser.What bothered me most is that the case that was supposed to be under investigation was submerged under the weight of the main character's misery. It's as if the author only occasionally remembered what the book was about. That's a shame because my primary motivation for reading it, is because it deals with the notorious Magdalen Laundry. I don't think this theme was prominent enough to be mentioned in the title. This book should be called An Addict's Ruminations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good news Bad news","review":"The Garmin III+ does everything the ads say it will and It's fairly easy to use. Some book work is needed ,but it's fun stuff. If you like maps and navigating you would have to look pretty hard to do better than this model. Now the bad. The software you might have to buy is way too expensive and the ads lead you to believe you get a external ant. You do not. It costs almost a hundred bucks and you need to have it to get the most from the III+ model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Imagine Driving Without It!","review":"I travel frequently for work and have spent my share of time trying to find my way around town.

I no longer search for client's offices, resturants, and hotels - I am able to drive like a local resident, going exactly where I need to go. I have saved countless hours of driving time, as well as eliminating loads of agrivation of driving and can't imagine driving without it.

The GPS III Plus has detail maps that can be uploaded to it, and programs like Street Atlas from Delorme add the routing before you leave the house or from your laptop on the road. The III Plus from Garmin is top notch and you get lots of time on batteries or use it with the car cord and sandbag for your dash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never Get Lost Again!","review":"I first used this while vacationing in New Hampshire on Lake Winnipesauke. Since the lake is so big and everything looks the same when you are in the middle, the GPS was invaluable in telling me how to get back home. Plus the maps of the lake all have the coordinates of the buoys -- so you can punch them in and have an instant navigation aid.On the downside, my unit seems to take a while to acquire a signal - usually longer still when in heavy brush/woods. However I realize this is a built-in limitation of GPS units as a hole."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was just about to buy it but.....","review":"I was already getting out my credit card when I was made aware of the fact the Garmin has no intention of supporting its products and consumers with mac based downloading capabilities....

Being my first GPS this one has always been my favorite, but the small amount of RAM is a bit of a problem for me these days. I typically use the MAPs from the ROM, but I also have several regions loaded from Garmin's Roads and Recreation CD--though not as many as I'd actually like. The features on this unit are great and the screen is very visible. With the bean bag mount, you can position the screen for the available lighting without any trouble. If you're thinking of taking this hiking, I would recommend the eMAP (8 Meg of RAM) or the ETrex Summit (better outdoor features). For heads up vehicle navigation, the GPS III is the best choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good GPS package!","review":"The Garmin GPS III+ is a very competent performer, and has worked well in any kind of weather, even on the dash of my truck! It is very sturdy, and I frequently use it mounted on the handle of my bicycle with no trouble. It's built in maps are sufficient for most travel applications, unless you do a lot of secondary road travel, then you will need to buy the CD and download the detailed maps. My only complaint with this unit is the size of the screen. It is very hard to make out detailed locations on the screen while traveling. I find that if I'm in a pinch, I'll have to stop somewhere to really look closely at the unit. Other than that, it is a fine performer! I would recommend the 12V power adapter cord with this unit as battery life is good, but it will use up 4 in a 10 hour day."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Modern Classic","review":"The Family (why they keep listing it as \\"Family\\" I don't know) is truly a modern bluegrass classic. With the range of its compositions, the precise execution of the McCoury boys and the genuine emotion pouring from each track, The Family matches and even surpasses the best bluegrass recorded to this day. I find it strange that not too many people have latched on to what a perfectly balanced and exquisite piece of music \\"A Far Cry\\" is. I would like to nominate it as the new state song for Virginia. As for \\"City Of Stone,\\" it is as moving a song of soul-searching and redemption as you will hear in any genre---not to mention a clever metaphor.

It is holding up very well, after 30+ trips. My favorite features are: 1) the telescoping handle which slides up and down with incredible ease 2) the removable sleeve that protects my laptop in the bins at the airport 3) Plenty of pockets that make it unnecessary for me to carry a separate purse.

What are the other mountains like nearby are they taller, shorter, or the same height? Which way is Jerusalem? Is that the Dead Sea off in the distance? What can be seen from there on a clear day? What cannot be seen because the mountain is too low? What is the land like there for farming in comparison to what is across the river?

Tecumseh came closer than any other before or after him to saving his people from total destruction by the whites on the eastern frontier in the early 19th century. In the end, Tecumseh's death is not just a loss in the Indians' long struggle against the Americans, it signals the death knell for their way of life, as their defeat in the War of 1812 sealed their fate on the North American continent.

First, I think that it's a delightful way to tell the story of the Ramayana. This classic Indian story teaches a great deal and is sometimes hard to understand with out a guru. \\" Sita Sings the Blues\\" brings the story into the present day and punctuates the pain of life's dramas with great \\"blues\\" songs. The ending of the \\"Ramayana\\" has puzzled me for years, until viewing this film. Sita becomes a self realized soul! What a wonderful example for all women and spiritual seekers. Highly recommended! Invite friends over for a fun viewing and powerful discussion. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sita please sing some more!","review":"Bring it on Amitabh Bachchan and move over Shahrukh Khan, there is a new modern stud in town, Ramayana in the internet sensation Sita Sings the Blues. It is easy to sit down and fall beneath the spell of the animated multi media film. However the strung together story that switches between the modern day and the ancient past is more then the Powder Puff girls 20 centuries ago. The film takes on an old popular Indian epic legend and stirs it up creating a film that transforms the story into an Indian diaspora feminist epic narrative. Exciting for all audiences, the film takes music from Annette Hanshaw throwing the audience into a Bollywood mind set, but captured into the American past. If you want a film that is full of complex dimensions but also a film to giggle along with your friends, I suggest sitting down with the romantic tale of Sita and Rama."},{"rating":"2","title":"My little doorbell","review":"Hanging on my door.

The bogus cover appears to be a badly done color copy, very underexposed, poor reproduction--Jay seems to be standing in a dim photography darkroom with nothing but the red glow of the film-safe light reflecting off his skin and fiddle. The sheet music pages inside have the feel of inkjet paper with poor ink fill in several areas.

By a series of circumstance they end up in the care of a fellow Scotsman as a payment of a debt owed.Only this Scotsman was told Avery's brother, Sir Payton Murray, raped and left his sister pregnant. He then decided that he will seduce Avery and force Payton to marry his sister to restore her honor. The problem is the passion between them flare although Avery tries to withstand.On the trip back Avery and Gillyanne save and heal many of Cameron MacAlpin's clan. This therefore earns them a deep respect. Cameron still believes that his sister is wronged and although wants to keep Avery he lets her go in exchange for Payton.

People on here are saying \\"they are not as good as uggs\\" but for the price these boots are compared to uggs I'll take bearpaws any day. I have ever owned ugg and I don't ever interned too. I live in maine and my bearpaws keep my feet war and dry. Just be sure to weather proof them.

I echo the sentiments of Julie Pierce, in that the use of Gorecki's 3rd Symphony in the film, particularly at the end -- played without any other sounds or dialogue -- is one of the most effective (and, emotionally moving) uses of classical music I have ever heard in a film.The film and the music cannot be separated; you see the one, together with the other, and you cannot forget either.We live about 10 miles from where Alaska flight 261 went down off the coast of Ventura County, California, about a week ago.See the film. Listen to this soundtrack.

I thought they had split up, but here they are again, so this is a no-brainer, I know I'm going to like this one....but playing it now as I write this, I find it quite a letdown. It took 8 years to produce this? The same band that gave us the glories of \\"Cake\\" from out of the blue, with the witty lyrics and chiming choruses, the album I played over and over for weeks after I bought it?The problem is, none of the songs stand out at all, just one fey and low key song after the other. I wish I could say a song or two did stand out, but it just washed over me, like elevator music. These guys have plenty of talent, so what happened? None of the songs seem to get started, rather like a continual intro that has been stretched into a 3 minute song. Even after a couple of listens, it doesn't really come together. And that's a terrible waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trouble Sleeping ?","review":"They're back stronger than ever. A little more Mature,and a little more Mellow.

After 8 years, many trials and tribulations and a bit of luck, amazingly enough, TCS picks up right where they left off. It's almost as if you can sense the karmic sensibilities of their return in the echoes of each song. These guys have put together a beautiful piece of work that I would agree with the band as being their best ever. The sound is more mature and maybe a bit more subdued, but the vocal harmonies and musicianship are as gorgeous as ever. In this age of either overproduced or gratuitously raw music, \\"Weightlifting\\" evokes an overall \\"live life in earnest\\" feeling that comes across as remarkably genuine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really nice!","review":"I got these for Christmas with a bracelet from Silver Insanity and they're both beautiful.

The Garmin is definitely a more versatile unit, having the ability to upload/download topo map waypoints and routes. However, the color display is difficult to read unless facing the light source. I am also not completely satisfied with the contrast adjustments for the colors. When you get a good contrast with one, the others seem to be \\"washed out\\". I would like to see more icon symbols that are related to hiking rather than boating. The icons can save time in establishing an easier method to find a saved waypoint. Overall however, I would say that this unit is very user friendly and has a much better use (with power saver) of battery power.

The writers really had to shove a lot of plot into those 3 hours but they do a very great job. Some great action scenes, a few plot twists. Its all great.some thoughts: 1. Chiana's character doesn't really get much of a send-off does she? 2. We find that Grayza is hugely pregnant at the begining of the movie, but nothing ever becomes of that. 3. The \\"traitor\\" is discovered but her character's motivations really don't make sense if you think about some of the things she says in the course of the movie. I get a sense the writers needed a traitor for the plot to work out and they simply wrote her character in to perform that role."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very basic DVD","review":"Of course the 182 minutes are great, but there's not much for DVD extras.

If you like Farscape it is a must have. If you have never seen Farscape buy this DVD but do yourself a favor and get 1-4 first.There is a very nice A&E set that is priced more then fair( looks as good as any of my Bluerays in an upconvert player).I loved the entire thing more then any Star Trek, Battlestar Galactica, Andromeda, Earth Final Conflict, Lost, and so on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scorpius returns","review":"Wow, what a great ending to a really fantastic show.

Consistent with the rest of the production episodes. Acting, writing, and effects are also consistent quality in keeping with the series.What I didn't like which plagues the whole series is the almost constant fake swearing. It gets real old after the first episodes and adds no entertainment value. The sprinkling of adult partially disguised sexual content is what would be considered \\"edgy\\" without going over the top which compared to \\"Lexx\\" is mild, is still too much for my taste at times. For those who cannot watch anything without strong sexual content throughout, it should please them.I didn't like one of my favorite characters killed off near the end of the series and replaced with two very poor characters which were retained in the movie which weakened it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Had to have it for my collection","review":"Already had the whole series, just needed to fill in the missing pieces and this was it.

The \\"pregnancy\\" scenes were so poorly done that I wondered how the actors could keep from laughing out loud while doing the scenes.

So, recently, we acquired the full series Boxed Set, which leaves Peacekeeper Wars out. Considering how the series ended, it did require a follow up, to tie all loose ends and give the series some closure.That was masterfully achieved by The Peacekeeper Wars. If you're a Farscape Fan or just a Sci Fi enthusiast, and didn't see this DVD yet, it's a must have alongside the Farscape Boxed Set.Now to hoping Sci Fi will ever do the same for Stargate Universe, which also ended in a very disturbing way for anyone following the show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not arrived","review":"To date, I have not received my order.

So I ask: why do these publishers make you wait one year or more for the paperback? I can see it's to force the impatient to get the expensive hardcovers, but don't they fear lost interest from those who will not buy those. I can't remember how many series I've left behind because I couldn't wait or lost track of.I can understand the wait for the author to complete another volume in the series (and I wish they would write a little faster...!!!), but then to wait again for the paperback to come out gets maddening....!!!

I'm glad I discovered it one day be accident because once again Kevin J. Anderson has given us a rollicking fun sci-fi novel. No, this isn't Asimov or Herbert, but not every science fiction novel has to be. Sometimes you just want to have some fun, and Anderson does a great job of giving us just that. Where Anderson really excels is in the political and palace intrigue; from the Mage-Imperator's unholy deal with the hydrogues to the battle of wills between Chairman Wenceslas and King Peter. King Peter especially shows the most growth of all the characters in this very large cast It does drag a little in the middle, but the last 100 pages are a riot; and the final pages set up a possible new threat that should make the final two books in this series very interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving To Majorca","review":"What a super book -- beautifully written, and with a marvelous tale.

Nothing compares to this product. I could not believe how amazing my hair looked and felt!

This book touts itself as a full guide to living in Japan. This could not be farther from the truth. Lacking specific information about the process of finding a home, work, etc, it's basically a dreary account of all the difficulties that await you in Japan, with an intense focus on the psychological trials, which the book seems to portray as inevitable. Worse still, the only advice offered in coping with the pessimistic, matter-of-fact list of challenges is shockingly trite. I do not know why these two authors wrote this book, because it really seems as though their objective was dissuading people from living in Japan, rather than offering solutions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing unique","review":"I'll have to enter a dissenting voice, here.

That saccarin-sweet story lasts, unfortunately, almost halfway through the book. The rest of the GHOST stories are interesting and a welcome relief. I think Mrs. Fiedel is a fine writer--but if she wants to write a book on her loving husband--then call it as such for those people who would love to read such a story and those who don't (me) will not have to purchase it and be disappointed.

I also found that many of the stories actually incited lust within me. They were to illicit and descriptive for me. Which is obviously destructive to my sobriety. I would strongly recommend \\"He Restoreth My Soul\\", by Donald Hilton. I have read it twice, and it has lifted me up every time I have read the words it contains.

The book serves as a memoir of his four decades in the field of anthropology and brings together two areas of the world where he has built his career. Noting the similarities and differences of working in Indonesia and Morocco, Geertz draws comparative aspects of these divergent cultures. Known for his 'thick description' which was made Bible in the \\"interpretation of cultures\\" (a must first-read for understanding his theories), Geertz uses it some, but doesn't overload the reader here. The uninformed reader can still enjoy the behind-the-scenes-look at one of the foremost anthropologists of the 20th century and not get lost along the way. For the Geertz fan, it is a must read, if nothing for his funny anecdotes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used filter was given","review":"The filter that i got was used and not new.

No keyboards, no slow parts, no singing; just blast beats, slayer beats, and riff after riff of the essence of simple musical evil. This is a good listen and good to put on a mix tape, but I find myself getting tired of putting the whole CD on (and it's not that long). For people who think all of the bands I just mentioned are great and you can easily tell the difference between them, then definitely pick this up. For people like me always looking for something new; this is not it. This music has been done.That being said, this is still a very good black metal album from a good solid band. It sounds evil and not silly. That is always a good thing in my book (unless a band is TRYING to be silly, which is fine. I like Fantomas and Mr. Buingle)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Single","review":"This is a great single to collect.

It has that big back-beat with a good vocal rhyme sceme. The guitar solo plays against the riff perfectly and is one of my favorite \\"heavy\\" solos from this band. On the downside, the song seems to be performed with too much restraint and it makes me want Metallica to just break free and ROCK like we know they can. This is typical of Metallica in the studio. (Where's the new LIVE album?) Actually, Side 2 IS a live recording--Ain't My Bitch. This one rocks. They perform it faster and more aggressively here than they did on the original studio version (found on Load). There is the occasional \\"off\\" note--especially in the vocals--but it is delivered in such a fun way that you just don't care. It makes you remember why you loved Metallica in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the REAL Metallica?","review":"A half way decent song from a not so decent album.

Too many comparisons have been made to Enter Sandman, another song that will never hold a cndle to Master of Puppets or For Whom the Bell Tolls. a good band selling out for the next generation, which isn't a total loss, just a loss for the older generation who knew of Hetfield and Ulrich when Mustaine still walked amongst them with Cliff Burton or even Ron McGovny.

Her technique of relating aspects of the Atlantean civilization to contemporary developments is thought provoking and stimulating and should prove especially profitable for those readers who are newcomers to Atlantean studies, and the inclusion of post-Atlantean civilization may prove refreshingly new to those more acquainted with Atlantis material. The structure of the book is also helpful in providing the reader with easy access to particular areas of consideration, making it unnecessary to search laboriously through the text for scattered references."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book is an Abomination of Alleged History and Raped my Mind","review":"The most horrendously fictitious book I have ever encounterd. This book rambles on with the most profound exacerbations and fabrications I have ever seen. At one point Ms. Andrews informs the readers that Atlanteans wore bright purple robes and tranported themselves through the air using their mind. Rubbish and hogwash. As a serious student of pre-columbian civilizations and ancient history I found this book to be a fantastical sojourn into the land of make believe. Do not waste your money, time, or neural impulses on this book if you are a serious academic, curious amateur, or anyone interested in the facts and evidence behind Atlantis. You will be sorely disappointed.

Her own research is not very convincing and is very suggestive. I hope there is somewhere another book about Atlantis that is more scientific..."},{"rating":"1","title":"May pass for fiction","review":"Very dissapointing. Description of book indicated a very serious look at Atlantis. But what I found was more of story based on fantasy. The descriptions of atlantean society architecture, and military were based (and then stretched) from descriptions from Cayce and telepathy with individuals who passed away 10,000 - 11,000 years ago. What little information that was based on historical records or modern research was weak (if not distorted)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clap-trap","review":"This should be \\"Insights Into Logical Fallacies\\".

She's a Law professor.Someone should tell her that the Atlantic fault is divergent, that is, pulling away from each other.

I had hoped for an insightful, archaelogical, historical, and geographical review of the possibility of Atlantis.

I should have read the reviews more closely and saved myself ten bucks. I believe there could have been a lost continent of Atlantis. However, I doubt seriously it was the idyllic new-age paradise presented by Ms. Andrews. If you are serious about learning more on Atlantis, don't buy this book.

Some of them'll tug on the heartstrings, and loads of them are just plain fun (Louis Prima's 'Just a Gigolo', Perez Prado's 'Cherry Pink and Apple Blossom White' with some really crazy trumpet playing). 'What's New Pussycat?' (Tom Jones) is one to memorise and do at the karaoke sometime (like I did).

Once Ironheart entered the picture i had hopes for a really great romance too.SPOILER HINT: There were some clues of love between Aurore and someone else but i took it to be family affection.Anyone the ending is why I gave this book a rating of 2 stars. The ending is a little confusing because i think the reader does not want to believe that happened. Even though that practice was used back in those times, it is utterly GROSS AND DISTURBING to fathom that today. I can see how maybe more mature concerning historical customs people would give this book a good rating. If you want to read a very different retelling of sleeping beauty i recommend Robin McKinley's Spindles End, which has an excellent romance and more imaginative take on sleeping beauty, it is alot more descriptive and alot longer though. The Storteller's Daughter by Cameron Dokey is an completely awesome book which i would give 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth reading","review":"I was very disappointed by this book. I hoped that it would be something that I could sink my teeth into and enjoy. However, it was somewhat boring in parts and dragged on in the beginning.

We met Ironheart who was cool, but Aurore didn't marry him in the end!!!!!!!!!! she had to go marry her cousin who was a jerk to her anyway and then all of a sudden she loves him??!!! meanwhile Ironheart finds some odd girl to marry. It was truly annoying and disappointing.the most annoying part however, was the fact that Aurore was asleep for about two seconds which completly destroys the story of Sleeping Beauty.overall, the disappointments in this book far outweighed the good things."},{"rating":"1","title":"good book, bad ending","review":"This story is a retelling of an old classic. It is new and exciting to read. It's not just the regular sleeping beauty story. I liked it a lot, until......THE ENDING!!!! I dont understand why it ended the way it did!!! It was distirbing to me. I don't think I'll read this book again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Well this is a book that really isn't worth reading. It is a poor attempt to retell the story of Sleeping Beauty. It builds you up on one realtionship, then on another. It didn't have a prince in shining armor or an independant, spunky girl. Plus the ending didn't make any sense and was very disterbing. It really wasn't worth it.The reason I gave it two stars insead of 1 was because it was original. It retold the story of Sleeping Beauty so that you'll never think of it the same, and not in a good way. Please don't waste your time and read this terrible book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful retelling","review":"Dokey's version of Sleeping Beauty takes everything that is familiar about the tale, and adds her own little twists. I love these more mature fairy tales because they are not afraid to go againsat some of the traditional fairy tales and make them brand new. The book was given a four though, due to some editing errors. But they are minor and don't truely detract from the novel. It's a shame that the story wraps up so quickly though, it would have been nicer to go a bit deeper at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"~!Love it!~","review":"I liked this book.

It takes the story of Sleeping Beauty, now named Aurore, and how at the age of 16, instead of pricking her finger, strange happenings afflict the whole kingdom where she lives. She decides to leave and enter the nearby Forest, where no one dares set foot. It is here that she meets Prince Ironheart, who is on a quest as well. The two band together to try and break their curses.

Yet in the case of Cameron Dokey's \\"Beauty Sleep\\" that sentence carries much more than Cinderella could ever imagine.If you read the other reviews for this book, you might already agree that the story is wonderful. However, the ending is truly such a surprise. It is NOT a typical fairytale ending. It is NOT what one might assume.

Overall this was a great season with its 13 episodes. They made some changes this season to try and save the series. I accept this and was not too bothered by it. The Major changes are his Lightmans ex wife is not in this season. FBI agent Benjamin Reynolds is no longer part of the cast. Loker is more cynical this season and is thinking about leaving the Lightman Group. And they seemed to try to focus more on Jillian's sex appeal.Other than those changes it was basically the same. I loved this series and am highly disappointed that Fox killed the series. The science behind the lies and the fun of them showing real people reacting in the same manner they showed on the fictional characters on the show was incredible. Me and my wife loved pointing things out to our friends when we noticed their lies.

However, there are much better alternatives out there, for a little bit more to pay. And as I'm about to expose, you get what you pay for.The main factor detracting from this product is weak bass. This comes as a result of the included 4\\" LABTEC Subwoofer Driver. Yes, you heard correctly, a 4 inch driver. My brother purchased the system and wasnt happy with the bass at all, so we took the subwoofer assembly apart. Lo and behold, behind the Plastic and Cardboard that makes it appear to house a 8\\" Driver, there is a wimpy 4\\" cleverly disguised. The low-end manufacturer Labtec is clearly stamped on the driver. Feel free to pry yours open, if you don't believe me.I hope this isnt a sign of what is to come from audio products.

I am not an expert electrician, but I know enough to fix and work on items that I own and I was completely blown away by the fact that something inside the internal power box fried. The speakers were plugged into an APC power unit so there is not a chance that the speakers could have recieved a power spike.

It was a very reliable and cost effective setup. Some improvements have been made in this particular version.The main plug into the Woofer used to be a 'shove it in' affair, and my connection in the woofer got loose in my old speakers and it caused a short. I have a friend that had the same problem. They improved it by having it screw into the woofer like a monitor screws into the back of a computer. This is a big improvement and will stop the cord from wiggling around and causing a short. This also keeps it from pulling out and losing connection to your woofer. BIG IMPROVEMENT.The sound is great. The cost of a bose system is several hundred more, and although Bose sounds great, it is not several hundred dollars better.This is a great deal for the price, and I love my set up. Your games or MP3's sound totally great and you will love it.BUY IT."},{"rating":"2","title":"HIGH Quality","review":"Forget the \\"bang for the buck:\\" these speakers are simply a bang. The sound quality is phenomonal. If you don't have a 5.1 sound card, get one, these speakers go so well with one. Little things i didn't notice in movies before are suddenly clear. Unlike other speakers ive heard, the bass doesn't drown out the voices in movies. These speakers are worth more than the list price, and amazon.com offers it for less than 50% off."}]`),N={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:O},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},H={class:"card-container"},M=["disabled"],C={key:0},B={key:1};function x(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",H,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",B,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",C,"See more"))],8,M)):b("",!0)])}const W=d(N,[["render",x],["__scopeId","data-v-570b4732"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/10.md","filePath":"library/10.md"}'),R={name:"library/10.md"},G=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{L as __pageData,G as default};
