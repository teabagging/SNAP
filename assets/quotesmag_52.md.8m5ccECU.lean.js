Gentle Warmer Maybe....","review":"I have been using the same space heater for years to take the chill out of rooms which have poor heat supply during the winter. The old unit I've used wasn't great but it did the job, (till last week when it failed). I bought this \\"fan\\", the Vornado yesterday and gave it a test. It doesn't get hot, seriously. It gently warms the air at best, but not enough to consider it a heater. You can honestly hold your face right up to the unit and never feel more than warm breeze on your cheeks. And as for the fan, it's not even good at that. I am still looking for a quality unit but this is not it. I hate returning things, but this units going back. Save yourself the hassle..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fan motor burns out","review":"Bought this $100 unit in Sept 2010. It was great while it lasted BUT after 2 weeks of operation on its 2nd Winter the fan quit blowing. I noticed the fan output getting weaker and weaker for a week and then finally it just quit. I would expect much better quality for the money. It only made 1 full winter season.

When they work, they do a great job without using a lot of electricity.The first one stopped working after the first year. Just pulled out the remaining one and plugged it in, it does not work. So we got two years from it.Since this is basically a $100.00 heating unit, think it should last longer than this.We used these to supplement central heat, not in place of. As we are in GA, only gets cold about 4 months of the year. It is a big disappointment that the units will not hold up to even this moderate use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unit stopped working after a few months","review":"I purchased this item in March 2010 and it worked very well from March through May. Once it was may, it was warm out, and the heater went into storage for a few months. I just took the heater back out this winter in October 2010 and turned it on. Upon doing so, I started noticing a very burnt smell. At first I figured this was normal from being in storage a couple months, but then it got worse and worse smelling. After a couple minutes I inspected the unit and noticed the fan was barely spinning. It was turning, but nowhere near the speed it should be; this lack of airflow was causing the heat coils to get very very hot to probably a dangerous level. I have now stopped using the unit.I contacted live text support online and was given a phone number to call. So far the phone number has been busy and no answer... I will continue to try..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty thermostat","review":"This product produces enough heat to keep me warm and toasty. In fact, the manual says for the user to start the heater on \\"6\\" (highest setting) and then gradually lower it to a cooler temperature later. This cured my problem when I thought it just wasn't producing any heat. Unfortunately for me, the thermostat seems to be poorly programmed and the heater and fan will constantly flicker on and off as if it detects the heat as too high for one second, then too low the next. This causes a lot of noise and aggravation, especially when you're trying to sleep at night. Is this product worth it? I don't think so. It never should have made it to market without this simple problem being corrected. According to the reviews here, Vornado seems to put out a lot of faulty (even dangerous) products and I would not recommend purchasing any of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 for heating, 1 for reliability","review":"I have bipolar feelings about this heater. On the one hand, it is a fantastic heater that effectively warms a room, and has an automatic thermostat that really works. In terms of heating, it's great.On the other hand the design is almost ridiculously flimsy. The first one we had broke entirely within a week of use (thank goodness for Amazon.com's easy return policy). The second one has given us a lot of good heat, but the on-off switch broke after about six weeks. I can make it work through this strange gerrymandered solution, but now it sparks, in a frightening way.If it weren't so scary, it would be a joke. Like the type of heater you'd use to warm a haunted house.In all I can not recommend this product. Its a great heater, but its unreliable, and well, actually sort of terrifying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extreme Fire Hazard!","review":"This was a major rip-off. And also a safety hazard! After only 4-5 months of use, the heating element burned through the wiring on the fan and it shorted out. Sparks shot out of the socket, even when it wasn't on when I plugged it in. The plug isn't even grounded. Spend your money elsewhere and stay safe!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working in 10 days","review":"I was very happy with this model Vornado for 2 years until I ordered a second one.

It just wouldn't heat up a normal sized bedroom (and I don't live in a really cold part of the country), so I called them about it. Great customer service - they paid for me to ship it to them; said it was probably a defective heating element. Got the new one back . . . still wouldn't heat up a normal bedroom or office. Called to send it back again, and, upon my request, they sent me this upgraded model. It still just won't sufficiently head a room (10x10), but it works great in a 4X5 bathroom, set on high, auto. My opinion is the Vornado is simply not a good product. They have good customer service, but it just won't warm up a room nicely, and it gobbles power - every time I turn it on, my lights dim."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product","review":"I have tried most of the different types of space heaters out there for our unheated laundry room, but this one is by far the best. I set the temp I want and the fan on auto and it does the job quietly and efficiently and it is not an electricity hog. You can put your hand against it anywhere and leave it there with barely a feeling of warmth. If the room were not a comfortable temperature, I would't think it was on. What do I call it? Perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works Great...Then Not At All","review":"I have two of these machines. I live in a small studio, and they do a terrific job when they work. The trouble is, they both stopped working--one after a year, and the other after about six months. I turn it on, the little red light goes on and then nothing at all happens. Very frustrating. I get the idea from reading these reviews that others are having the same problems. Both financially and ecologically, these devices are too much of an investment to be a quick-use disposable. I hope Vornado does some serious rehabilitation to their design or their manufacturing process--whichever is at fault."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product did not match the color and quality I expected!","review":"This product is more of a fan than a heater!

A couple of notes:1. It definitely doesn't produce tremendous heat. I would have thought that it would have generated more heat based on others' feedback, but not to be.2. When you have it set to AUTO and the heater reaches the temperature you set, instead of turning off the fan and heater, it just shuts down the heater (the fan continues to run). I would have thought the entire device would have shutoff to save electricity.3. One thing I did love was that the chassis/grill never got hot (maybe because it didn't produce strong heat). I have 2 kids and I was looking for something that would be safe if they ever touched it.4. It was really quiet.I had hoped for better results but I'll be returning it to get my $100 back."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT PRODUCT!","review":"Not sure if there was a faulty batch that other people here received, but this will be the 3rd season using this product.. and it is the perfect answer to heating up a small room quickly. A Large room does indeed take more time, especially if there are open doors or wide openings in the room. It is not meant to be on 24 hours a day so maybe thats why other people are having trouble. The internal thermostat ensures you won't be wasting any more energy than you need to. About to buy my 2nd one right now.."},{"rating":"2","title":"USA made vortex heat","review":"After dealing with cheap chinese made often unsafe heaters from big box stores, I selected this Vornado heater due to its features and the fact it is made in USA.I find it heats very well and I like the idea that it will only run at a high enough level to maintain set temp. The dial selector is much easier to understand and use than the digital setup.The fan is quiet on low, it bit louder on high. I notice the grill on this unit is tighter than on my ATVH unit and airflow seems a bit slower.Due to the fact the element does not glow red, this heater should last a good long time. It is cool to touch, even at full blast.For those who insist this unit heat their entire home, be advised it will comfortably heat a 245 sq ft area. I can run this unit in my living room of my townhouse down to about 19 deg outside and it will maintain 70 degrees temp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Product Support","review":"I just purchased my third Vornado Vortex Whole Room Heater in three years. The shortcoming is with the heating coils...the base of the coil breaks, the coil becomes loose from its mounting, representing a potential fire hazard. The unit must be factory serviced at...nearly the cost of buying new...I like the design controls and quiet operation. The VH2 heating coils are identical to the earlier VH model, so I don't expect these to last any longer - less than a year - before they represent the same hazard. Vornado warranty offered no re-design or retro-fit solution. This is a potential fire hazard so if you buy this, keep an eye on the coils for any breakage or insulators that have come loose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke twice.","review":"This heater blows out warm heat and is nice when it works.

In a 50x50 room it did not increase the temperature after several hours by even 1 degree. My clock gives me the indoor and outdoor temperature and yes I even tried moving it.This week I had a slight water leak in my basement. I placed this heater on the maximum settings next to the water on the carpet for several hours. No change!I also have a regular Vornado fan and it's already broken since it's made out of cheap plastic. It barely moves the air and doesn't help at all.Vornado products are way overpriced.Believe it or not I went and purchased a cheap metal heater for fifteen dollars and it's way better. I feel MUCH safer with it on as well.I'm glad it works so well for many. It just doesn't for me. Save your receipt just in case!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for 2 months and then stopped working","review":"Definitely not worth its price. I bought this back in December and it's only February and it's already broken. The heat doesn't really circulate around the room so I still have to turn up my thermostat to keep warm. The fan has stopped spinning after a few squeaks. At first I thought it was because it has been overheated so I turned it off and turned it back on a few hours later. It continued to squeak and a few days later the heater/fan stopped working altogether. I do not recommend this product and I felt like I wasted 99 dollars and I can't even return the item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Heater","review":"After reading through several good reviews brought this one from Costco.com and it turned out to be the worst purchase I had made.This heater does not even heat the immediate surrounding in my living room even at 90 degrees setting on the thermostat.Also, after using for 3 weeks I got an electricity bill of $500, which really scared the hell out of me.

We had ours for about 2 months before it stopped working. I'd heard about the recall (faulty switch) but procrastinated on taking action. Then it quit so it seemed a good time to send it back (my labor and box, their freight bill). In the meantime I bought a $17 one at a box store that worked fine - not real senstive, but quiet and steady. I just got the Vornado back and turned it on. It filled the job-site trailer with a haze that reminded me of burning plastic army soldiers - not that I ever did that..... We'll see how long before I have to plug cheapo back in."},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesn't work. At all.","review":"Since my central air/heat unit malfunctioned three months ago, I've purchased three space heaters. The first was a tiny, $13 fan space heater from Warm Fusion which warms the air in a small room, but is useless in larger spaces. The second was a $35 fanless heater from a company called Wexford, which warmed large areas very well but died after less than a month. Today, desperately needing a heater and with almost every store in town sold out, I purchased the Vornado, having had good experience with the brand in the past.It is, hands down, the worst piece of garbage I've bought in a long time. All its functions seem to be for show; they make no difference. Worse of all, after 6 hours, the heater hasn't even warmed up our small bedroom. It's worse than the inadequate $13 heater. It blows tepid air at best. Three inches from the face of the fan, the air is absolutely cold. Now I'm out over $100 dollars and I'm absolutely freezing.Please, be warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vornado Heater","review":"This product was not up to past Vornado standards. It did a poor job of heating to 2 areas where tried. It was also noisy. I returned it for service. They replaced the motor, which was in stock, but could not complete the repair because they had no replacement power cords. At that point, I requested a refund which is in process. It takes 5 minutes to buy on line, but takes 5 days to process a credit card refund, go figure.This company has provided quality products at quality prices, I hope they are not going the way of so many American companies, failing to meet even mediocre standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke in under 1 month","review":"I wanted model EH1-0028-06 (the one highly rated by Good Housekeeping with the digital display).

I'm taking it back and ordering the other model online."},{"rating":"1","title":"Underwhelmed","review":"I recently bought two of these heaters at a local retailer. I tried them out in our bathrooms since they stay a little cooler than the rest of the house. They did a fair job at best of heating those rather small areas. The heaters put off a lukewarm wimpy breeze. A hairdryer would be more effective. Needless to say, I returned them promptly since I don't think they are worth anywhere close to what I paid for them ($100 a piece). Don't waste your money on these heaters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive and safe, but not effective","review":"For $100, I expected it to be twice as good as my other $50 space heaters. But it isn't. It puts out warm (not hot) air and seems to keep the temperature in my 20' x 20' living room at about 64. If I'm lucky, the temperature will rise very slowly by one degree about every 30 minutes. But it never gets much past 64.I did find that if I blast the oven for a while and keep this heater on, the house gets to 68 and stays there. I guess the trick is that this type of heater doesn't really heat a room, but rather maintains the temperature of an already warm room."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent product but the fan konks out after a year or so.","review":"I purchased 2 of these and one lasted about 1 year and the second one lasted 2 years. I call Vornado to complain that they didn't seem very reliable, and they gave me a good deal on 2 new ones so I got 2 new ones. After barely a year, one of the new ones I got, konked out. The problem is always the same: the fan stops working.When they are working well, I have no major complaints, but when the same part keeps failing every time, you know that the part wasn't designed right. I'd like to rate this higher but the reliability is unacceptable. I have a $20 el cheapo space heater that I bought at the local hardware store and it just keeps on working (doesn't have all the fancy temperature settings), but the fancy stuff is not what is breaking on the Vornado space heater, it is the fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"broken in 6 weeks","review":"I have, in the past, been a huge fan of this style Vornado heater.

When I first set it up, I was pleased with the picture...clarity, sharpness, blacks and colors; however, when I started using it for my photography (which is my primary use), the screen turns a blue tint, then changes to pink, then a light tan. It makes correcting photographs nearly impossible...no flashing, but a gentle color change.Fortunately, I purchased it at Sam's Club and they will accept the return. I have not decided which monitor I will purchase next, but no more Westinghouse for me. Possibly Westinghouse doesn't have the proven experience yet. Previously, I had a flat screen 19\\" LCD NEC and was extremely happy with it, but after 4 years it died.Any suggestions from readers who also are photo nuts??? I would appreciate your input.

Lacks DVI input, requires DVI->HDMI converter for digital input from most computers. Also has VGA, component and composite video inputs, but converting digital video signal to analog (VGA) results in fuzzy picture. Wobbly stand.Now for the clincher: the unit died after one month. Westinghouse support is terrible. Three week wait to receive a replacement model. For an item this expensive, you would think Westinghouse would take better care of their customers. I do not plan to buy from Westinghouse again - by comparison, my NEC monitor has lasted 5 years and is still going strong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good gloves","review":"I got these gloves for my husband for Christmas.

Then the \\"raised lip\\" is apparently placed around this sheet and fused in place. This process is evidently very sloppy, the effect is almost as if black roofing cement has been brushed over the seams. The machinery or molds that form the sheet also seem to be badly worn and/or dirty...the liners are spotted with many small bits of debris, and some of the \\"diamond plate\\" pattern is badly distorted, as if it was damaged by heat during the process of fusing the two pieces together.

After sampling every other chai tea available, I can say with confidence that Oregon easily makes the best product. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars as opposed to 5 is the high sugar content.

It's all getting to sound by-the-book and it doesn't always sound like he's happy to be making music. There are two great songs - 50 Ways and My Little Town; and the title track, while subdued and downcast feeling, has a spooky, dreamy atmosphere and heartfelt vocal. Have A Good Time *might* sound better if he had someone else sing it, i.e. a female. To hear him wail away in a whiny falsetto for the WHOLE SONG is only slightly less grating than Prince's 'Kiss'. No wonder Art Garfunkel did all the falsetto stuff on the S&G albums. The rest of it is not bad, but suffers from blandness. No real catchy hooks or anything to make you remember the music.

The Dio era was great. Born Again with Ian was great. I personally enjoyed Seventh Star. But the downfull began with one man Tony Martin. Tony Martin Black Sabbath suffers because the albums might have one good song, and the rest is crap. On Eternal Idol, The Shining is a pretty decent song. But the rest of the album is pure filler. Same with Headless Cross, the title track was good, the rest of the album mediocre at best. Now we get to TYR and the whole album sucks. In the entire History of Black Sabbath, Tony Martin stands out as a sore thumb and a very bad mistake. Granted the man can sing, but he doesn't belong in Black Sabbath."},{"rating":"1","title":"The beginning of the end.","review":"Tony Iommi should have quited the band while there was time.

The album passed through the hands of THREE (!!) producers: Jeff Glixman, Chris Tsangarides and one Vic somewhat; two bass players (Bob Daisley and Dan Spitz), two drummers (Bev Bevan and Eric Singer). The result was a somewhat dispersed album, with good tunes, average tunes and mediocre tunes. Singer Tony Martin was a plesant surprise, but one can clearly see that he's singing like the guys that sings for Yngwie Malmsteen, for example..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ozzy vs. Martin and Dio","review":"I agree with some of you that Tony Martin and Ronnie Dio are great singers but to say they are better then Ozzy that is a comment not even worth saying. They have extremely different styles and to say Ozzy cant sing like those two is wrong because he can... Its not the style he likes so he doesnt sing that way... This is a descent album... better then most 80's music(My oppinion of course)... I believe Ozzy is much more talented then Dio or Martin...But dont count them out they can hold their own quite well"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Eternal Idol!","review":"Tony Martin's debut behind the mic is excellent!

Along with Headless Cross, the Eternal Idol represents the best of that era. While Ozzy was garnering sales for straight ahead commercial metal like the Ultimate Sin, Tony Iommi had assembled a killer band, including the Dio-esque Tony Martin on Lead Vocals and the legandary Eric Singer on Drums. The power of this assemblage is immediately apparent on the opening track of The Eternal Idol, \\"The Shining.\\" This song is catchy without compromising its power and creepiness. Iommi's playing on this album is top shelf, and standout riffs include, \\"Born to Lose,\\" \\"Lost Forever,\\" and \\"The Eternal Idol(title track)\\" This album, as with most Tony Martin Black sabbath albums, will appeal more to fans of the Ronnie James Dio-era stuff, than it will to the Ozzy purists. It is however, essential to any Iommi disciple or Sabbath completest. Killer stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Solid Debut With Personality","review":"This is a solid debut album for Tony Martin, an excellent vocalist in his own right, even though his voice brings back memories of a certain singer named Ronnie James Dio. This one rocks, and the heavy tone of the music will get your blood moving. This is a definite buy if you're a Sabbath fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gillen's ghost, Martin's major debut","review":"If you can accept Black Sabbath as a revolving group concept, there are a lot of great songs to be found in the 1986-1995 period. Ray Gillen (Badlands, Phenomena) originally worked on the writing and recording of this album, then left. Tony Martin came in and re-recorded the vocals. Among Martin's stronger performances, The Eternal Idol also boasts some of the better non-Geezer writing on Sabbath records, especially \\"The Shining\\" and \\"Hard Life to Love.\\" Either this or Headless Cross are probably the best of the Martin albums, followed by Cross Purposes (Geezer's back on that one), with Tyr and Forbidden bringing up the rear (but not bad at all). Cross Purposes Live doesn't count. Also, there is a version of this album with the Ray Gillen vocals available out there, worth the premium to have that one too."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of their best..","review":"Excellent Sabbath album. Iommi is in great guitar form here- some killer riffs.

I have a real problem with books that read, \\"And then an event happened that changed their lives forever....\\" instead of just telling the story and surprising the reader with said event. The first few times it happened I was forgiving and kept on....but by the 16th or 17th time I was insulted and threw the book across the room. That's just bad storytelling in my book. :) This is one of the only books I have started and not finished....and I was a few hundred pages in.

If you enjoy this book, more power to you. I just could not take it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am giving it two stars because some parts were good","review":"I really enjoyed NY, wasn't too thrilled about London, figured Sarum was a prequel and it had a lot of 4 stars.The beginning of the book pulls you in, and than the building of stonehege was just ridiculous. I never knew a stone mason built stonehedge :) Anyway, I continued on, the characters, just like in his London book, were confusing. At the end I skipped the last 100 years and read the last few chapters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Use it to torture P.O.W.s","review":"this book was written to torture Honors British Literature students. It's lengthy with pointless historical tidbits... if you're reading this book, you've got to be obsessed with british history already, so why bother with length historical information? And you'd think the book would be able to stay afloat with it's character insights, but they just come out cliched. The gay priest, the nymphomaniac native, the athiest turned monk, the stupid slut, the tortured artisan, come on! We've seen this stuff before, and written ten times better to boot. The dreary 1000 pages used in the printing of this novel could have been used for a better cause...toilet paper for third world countries is a great example...but since it's already too late, I've discovered my copy of Sarum is extremely flammable and doubles as an excellent torture device."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"I was forced to read this abomination unto mankind for 11th grade English class over the summer. This wretched behemoth of a volume took me a full month to read, and during this time I conemplated suicide several times (especially while reading through the 300 page section on the Protestant Reformattion). In short, this is the worst book ever written. Do not waste even a single cent on this godawful piece of crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a read!","review":"After finishing this terrific read I topped it up with a visit to Salisbury Close and Cathedral.It doesn't get much better than that."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Novel of All Time","review":"An epic spans generations, but Rutherford spans the ages! From cave man to Twentieth Century in an engaging walk through time, Sarum is so well researched and so full of fine detail, you feel as if you are there. This is one of those books that you think of long after the final page is read. You miss the characters. You see the settings in your mind. Educational and so enjoyable, Sarum made me an Edward Rutherford fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding! Masterful combination of history and fiction.","review":"Just finished reading this for the second time. As a transplanted British/Scottish American I found it to be a book that grows more interesting with each reading. Fascinating English history and very beliveable stories of 5 realistically portrayed familes are traced over the years. The geographical descriptions of what may have made the British Isles what they are was a particularly intriguing lead-in to the story. I need/want a hardback copy of this book! Help!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I read the rave reviews and this sounded like a book I would love. I did enjoy the beginning, the prehistoric period, the building of Stonehenge and the cathedral. After that it all went downhill. I was very confused with all the families, where many had the same first names over generations. It finally became a chore and I put it down at about 550 pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Epic Journey You'll Never Forget","review":"Edward Rutherfurd takes us on an epic journey with this Novel. We start at the end of the last ice age and follow five families through the history of one place, Sarum. Because it is an island, it is more, but not altogether isolated from the rest of the region. The relationship between the families is a crucial and sometimes life threatening part of this saga.We follow the Wilsons, Porters and Masons through the erection of Stonehenge and rise and fall of the Roman Empire. Rutherfurd uses factional events to guide fictional families through the millennia as the story seems to enfold around you while it emotionally bonds to the characters. Rutherfurd had me so involved in the story that I was somewhat sad when it ended. I will definitely be reading his other novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exceedingly clever idea, awkwardly written, badly punctuated","review":"This novel provides for me a palatable way to get a history of England, and I am determined to see it through. I have been reading it for months and have gained insight into why a previous reviewer found it such a slow read: The author violates almost every guideline for good writing, including changing points of view and introducing jarring incongruities. One can almost always tell what's to happen next because he telegraphs it well ahead of time. Punctuation is haphazard and inconsistent. I can't get into the story for tripping over bad writing, but the history he provides is worth it. Let's hope he rewrites, using a good editor and copy editor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get this man an editor!","review":"Long and dreary, wordy and blurry. Not uninteresting in parts, but in order to capture an \\"epic\\" scope, Rutherford relies on widely disjointed episodes, fragmented and compromised by bad fiction and worse history. Run on sentences and poor syntax are hallmarks of this books style. I finished it just because I don't like to quit. On the other hand, my wife reads all of his books. Despite this, we have a sound marriage. Even she thinks his prose is long winded and bloated, but she is a first class Anglophile, and so feels she must defend this exercise in tedium. I think it is much too long, and I like Finnegans Wake!Don't read the next sentences if you're going to read this book anyway. There is one continuing thread throughout the book. It peters out about 4/5ths of the way through. It just disappears. You follow the freakin' thing through hundreds of pages and there is no denouement. Just disappears from ken. For this alone, I hate this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED IT, WILL CERTAINLY READ HIS OTHER BOOKS....","review":"There are a lot of great things about this book and a few I would have changed.

Every character actually has credibility and depth. The monuments method of construction is highly credible.Brilliance of this type needs recognition.Little else needs to be said."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful survey","review":"This book is a wonderful survey of life in England, covering an enourmous sweep of history, and yet focusing in on individual lives and tying the pieces together in a compelling way."},{"rating":"2","title":"The History of England, from beginning to current","review":"Sarum was definitely an enlightening novel. I, myself, had to read it for a World History class, but what a pleasure it was. Not only did I learn about everything you'd need to know about England's history, but it was entertaining as well, something you very rarely find with such books as these. I highly recommend it to anybody who has interest in history. What was really great about this novel was the sections. You could pick up on one section, and not have had to read any of the other chapters, although it helped when it came to family ties and ancestry. I loved this book, and I'm almost positive you will too, with an open mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended for those who enjoy historical fiction.","review":"I read this book three times while living in Pakistan. Now, while some would argue it was out of boredom and a need for anything written in the english language, nevertheless it is an pleasureable read.What I enjoyed most about the book was, unlike many historical novels, the focus remained on a geographical location rather than one person.The only negative thing I can say about this novel is that I found the implication that \\"one cannot escape their past\\" to be a bit condescending.Unlike other reviewers here who say that they lost interest as they continued on with the book. I did not find that the case, I was interested to see how the characters were connected to certain interesting ancestors/descendants...so while a particular area of the book might have been less interesting than others, it was still interesting to see how the characters in that area were descended.A good read recommended for anyone who enjoys historical fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love historical fiction but this was not for me!","review":"I am just putting it out there that I am an avid reader, I love historical fiction, and sweeping epics are my favorites. I read a couple of books a week and I cannot remember in recent history not finishing a book. Sarum is slow and contrived. A great way to learn history? Not quite. Try actually LEARNING history. It is much more interesting. The author's style was so annoying that I found myself skipping pages, then chapters, and then finally slamming it closed late last night after getting to page 500 or so. The author uses big lead ups such as: Then two things happened that would forever change their lives... He continually introduced paragraphs like this that ultimately had little to no pay off other than minor plot twists. I wanted so much to like this because I find the underlying idea of this book very interesting. The writing style totally put me off, I found it mind-numbingly slow, and the characters completely forgettable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tapestry of life","review":"This book needs to be read and reviewed by every child in school.

It is one of the best books that I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read!","review":"I have read this book three times, and each time I am captivated! Rutherford takes us from the very beginnings of time, and weaves the story of Britain's history in an exciting way that keeps me turning the pages.His family lineages carry the story lines forward through the ages -- a technique that I really enjoyed as I read!I travelled to England and visited Salisbury Cathedral after I read SARUM the first time -- it gave me a greater appreciation for the people of that land, and for the beautiful cathedral itself!I highly recommend SARUM, it's one of my favorite books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, enlightening, and marshy","review":"I, too, picked up this book while visiting England to learn more about Stonehenge, Salisbury Cathedral, and the areas I saw. The stories were interesting, though feebly tied together. My regret was that he would pull out of the story to give a history lesson, instead of letting the story tell itself. I am still recommending this book, but only to people who are true Anglophiles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular depth.

Every now and again the channelI am streaming plays a Replacements song and it never fails to shock me. I typically dropeverything I am doing to give it a good listen and truly appreciate it. This album was thefirst album I purchased when I was first introduced to Paul Westerberg and his way with words.Alex Chilton, Nightclub jitters, Skyway ... these three always stop me in my tracks.

My only complaint is that the cd needs remastering bad. \\"The Replacements\\" never found huge success, and might not have wanted it, but they've influenced countless bands for sure.

Compared to Tim or Let it Be, let's face it, two of the greatest rock records of all time, Pleased to Meet Me sounds pretty hollow, overproduced and mechanical. The drumming is absolutely soulless, Tommy remembers all his bass lines, and Bob's guitar wails are replaced with session-man riffs that smack of too much rehearsal and not enough release. \\"Valentine,\\" \\"Skyway,\\" and \\"Nightclub Jitters\\" are great songs but overall it's the beginning of the end for Westerberg and company."},{"rating":"2","title":"For all ages...","review":"For those of you who loved the Narnia Chronicles, this book is for you.

It balances on the line between the adult and child audience and never seems to insult the reader's intelligence.I cannot remember the last time I was so taken in with a book so simple. And that is why the tale is told so well. It never strays from its path, and gently takes the reader along.\\"Raphael & the Noble Task\\" holds all the magic of those bed time stories we loved when we were little, but now cannot remember.And best of all the Gargoyles are not cute, nor silly, nor over-the-top ferocious.

And while some of the language was a bit of a stretch for him, he enjoyed and understood the book thoroughly.How often do you find a book that you can truly enjoy reading with your children!

But the situation got even worse, it turns out that they sent me the cheaper gift set with the aluminum box and not the wooden one. Called their support back and they said that they had no more of the wooden gift boxes left so they sent the aluminum ones.

I got an old-fashioned residential answering machine that tells me they will return my call in few days! I don't know if those people who have written those wonderful reviews about the product have been paid by the company or not. Maybe they have. Maybe this could be a good product if the fan worked and you wouldn't need to call their customer service.

The humidifier fan is actually very quiet but loud knocking woke us up repeatedly during the night. I would give this humidifier the highest 5-star rating for its use as a humidifier.

Similarly to the film LORENZO'S OIL, Maurice takes a confusing and \\"hopeless\\" situation wherein little hope is offered for her child and turns the \\"establishment\\" on its ear by not giving up.

This book is full of hope, courage, wisdom, and honesty and I admire this mother so much. She paints a view of autism which is, from what I'm finding out, painfully accurate but beautifully written from the heart. The faith, hard work, and unending love come through page after page. If it were my call, and my call alone, my grandson's routine would be modeled after the intensive sessions described in the book. It explains behavior modification clearly with it's strengths and weaknesses as well as some other treatments for autism. I have given this book to other family members to read and take comfort in the possibilities...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book - but has some flaws","review":"Oh my heart ached when I first encounted the term \\"cured\\" as described here. It's a good book - it's well written and I was barely able to put it down to cook dinner. Poignantly written and pleasantly hopeful.My main disappointment about this book is that it doesn't navigate into public school systems. In this book, the couple's children were diagnosed very young and they had the money and resources to provide individual care and training with their children (an option that few of us have). I KNOW they did a tremendous amount of work and effort to get their children to \\"cured\\" but that's not what many of us can expect or are even led to even hope for...but it offers hope.It's on my must-read list for anyone new to PDD/Autism, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let Me Hear Your Voice","review":"This book is too biased and giving false hopes to desperate parents of children with ASDI have a big question to the author.Where are her children now?Show the evidence they truely recovered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"This is a really good book as it's very interesting, moving and exciting at the same time.

I do have a child with developmental disabilities. Ms. Maurice's story validated so many of the thoughts and feelings that parents experience when coming to grips with their disabled child.As an advocate for children with special needs, I've seen the intensity of the educational programming discribed. I've seen parents struggle to emulate Ms. Maurice's program both successfully and with some failure. She makes no promises, she simply tells her story. It's real, it's powerful. This book is a must for anyone considering discrete trial training of their child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written by a haughty affluent - not for me","review":"Honestly, this was the first book I read when we found out about our son. There are some good things in it to prep new parents about troubles, doubt, and other problems to expect that I found helpful. But, wow - she's so privileged, so wealthy and connected, I couldn't relate to anything else she wrote. Who has a nanny for 1-2 kids, when she doesn't work? And I don't know how truthful she is because she doesn't even use her own name. For any/all parents new to autism, or those just looking for hope and someone whose story you can relate to - I'd recommend Child's Journey Out of Autism by Whiffen - written much better, and by an average person that any father, mother, family member or friend can really relate to. That's the one to buy and share around. This one, and the other written by the celebrity, are like glancing at an Esquire magazine on the grocery shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful book! a lifesaver","review":"I wish that I could give this book 10 stars.

I also want to point out that my son was very affected by Autism and now is almost recovered and I am a financially challenged mom who used donations, volunteers and myself to do what Catherine did with her financial resources.

That scattered bit reading might have something to do with my blah feeling of the book overall.There is very little action, hardly any suspense, though those are balanced by a few good twists.The romance is blah, the characters are fine...semi annoying but fine.She's a good writer, great even, but some of the dialogue had the distinctly \\"eh-that was dumb\\" feel to it.Is it a worthwhile buy? Depends on your tastes.Is it a worthwhile read? Yes, if you like the slow, meandering type romances."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Rush Of Wings","review":"I was blown away by Heitzmann's book \\"Halos\\" and had high expectations for this one as well.

When she runs from said problems she meets two men she likes and both of them want to be with her. I didn't care for this story for various reasons. Rick has this supposed strong faith and then decides to ask Noelle to marry him after a few weeks together knowing she is not a Christian and has no desire to be. He thinks he can 'fix' her. Then when she leaves, he gives up his faith and everything and Morgan is the one that saves her and she responds to his kisses as well??? I do not feel any love or connection between Noelle and Rick....she's basically using him and I had a nasty taste in my mouth throughout this whole book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Book the 2nd time around!!","review":"I began reading this book and got a strange sense of déjà vu. The further I got into the book, the more I knew what would happen. Was the book predictable?!? No I have read it before. But I remember the first time that I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I enjoyed just as much the second time through. I would recommend this book to others.Noelle St. Claire is fleeing from her own fears. She leaves her wealthy upbringing and finds herself on a horse ranch owned by Rick Spencer. Along with Rick at the ranch is Morgan (his brother). As one brother tries to win her love (at the beginning) the other sits back and wonders about her secrets. She longs to be free of her fear.

You don't want to let them go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotionally charged","review":"I found this book on Amazon for my mother, since she had read the book that followed this one, In the Still of the Night. It helped her understand the second book's characters and events surrounding their lives. The story revolved around three men and one woman who only wanted to paint and be left alone. Although she came from money, she was very talented and sensitive; her father had lost himself in his work after his wife died. The trauma that happened at a very early age shadowed her relationships and almost destroyed her. The two brothers were both interested in this beautiful woman, although one was bolder in his approach and confidence. It was a deep and moving story about poor choices people make in their lives, and finding a source to hold on to during the difficult times of life."},{"rating":"2","title":"a page-turner!","review":"A definite page-turner in my book! I could not put this book down until I finished it. Each page was filled with suspense- I just had to see what happened in the end!I really enjoy books that are well written and engaging. It seems lately I have been selecting books that follow this pattern. It is delightful to be able to read a book and be so immersed in the story that I can not put it down!Noelle has some pretty major flashbacks during the course of the book which is the reason she fled her home in the first place. There are so many levels to this book and so much that happens to Noelle, one can not help getting sucked into the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping Tale, Great Read","review":"Gripping. As with many good reads, I read this particular book right up until bed time, and finished it as soon as I awoke. Had I not been so tired, I certainly would have krept back downstairs to finish after everyone was settled into their beds. I could not put it down. I was particularly impressed with Heitzmann's treatment of a very difficult subject. Her ability to sort through the emotions of the character and the healing process made the book believable, tragic, and inspiring all at the same time.I was fascinated to realize that this was the first catholic book I have ever read. This was the only disconcerting part of the whole book since I am very much not Catholic, but this downfall was certainly overcome by the strength of the plot and character definition. I would recommend this book to anyone, and I might even read it again. Just to ponder the depth since I read it so fast the first time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond Fiber","review":"Super Seed has a really nice mild cinnamon taste. Chock full of omega 3 fatty acids from flax and chai seeds. It has sprouts and probiotics. This really helps with my gut flora with its anti-fungal (natural cinnamon) and probiotic ingrediants and I find it really helps stave off (TMI alert!) chronic yeast infections that I'm susceptible to. However, I do find that it's not that effective in keeping me regular though it does help alot of people. I love to mix this with my very own green drink mix which includes: Garden of Life's Perfect Food Raw (or BarleyMax by Halleluja Acres), Acerola Cherry Powder (Now), Navitas Twister Super Fruit Blend of goji, pomegranate and acai and Navitas Maca powder. I mix it all together in water and chug it down. Yumm!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Fiber Ever!","review":"Super Seed is without a doubt the best fiber supplement I've ever tried.

It definately does not smell natural. The taste is not the same as well. It seems the company has altered the recipe in some way. I will give it one more try after this, but if the same, will stop using. Why would they mess with what was such a great product?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Delicious but gassy","review":"I tried this product, and its at a great price so no problems there. Also, I like the flavor and dont mind the consistency it creates when mixed with your beverage of choice. My only complaint is the horrendous, noxious gas that it creates....and I dont mean from one use, I have taken all but two servings, one serving a day for a month. I thought it was something else causing the gas at first, and then I thought my body would get used to it, but I finally decided I would stop taking it and maintain my other supplements....this was the only thing I dropped from my morning routine and the gas went away that day. So its pretty clear to me at least that I react this way to this supplement. I have had other fiber supplements without this effect. I also noticed a little constipation, even with increased fluid intake.....so all in all delicious but gassy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tasting source of fiber!","review":"I put a scoop with my protein shakes every morning in a blender: 1/2 quick oats, 1 scoop Optimum Nutrition double rich chocolate whey, B vitamins, and this.

I can only see using this when baking like muffins or something. The fiber smells like a mix of spices kind of.

It is a quality product but its just not for me I guess.Ok i had previously given it 2 stars and just tried drinking this with milk. and... it was even worse than with water. I was gagging the last bit down. I have NO idea how anyone gave this more than 2 stars. I mean It was like drinking chunky milk. It mixes horribly too.My suggestion- don't buy the bigger container if you've never tried it. I regret doing it... what will I do with all this fiber??????Im now using Swanson's Tri-Fiber. For the people who have tried this and dont really care for it, I would recommended that.

I am giving it 2 stars just because of the nutrition facts and ingredients list... but otherwise I would only give it 1. While I don't mind the cinnamon taste, I can't stand the texture. I've mixed it with many different liquids (including water) and the thickness is out of control. It reaches almost a gelatinous state, which makes me gag.

It gives you a ton of fiber from varied natural sources. However, I just can't stand the taste. I bought it to put in my morning oatmeal, but I find myself choking back half a bowl and throwing the rest out. I'll try baking very small quantities in bread until I run out so I don't have to taste it, but also don't waste.Its definitely worth a try to see if you like it, although as another reviewer said, it is expensive for the amount of fiber. I would argue its worth it to pay more for real food, but I have to stick with plain ground up flax and oatmeal for now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick, easy, tasty way to get fiber","review":"I bought a container of this product a few weeks back as a way to bulk up my protein shakes and get extra fiber into my diet. Since then, I've also been using it with oatmeal. I will warn you though: the fiber soaks up a lot of water so don't be afraid to add extra water to your hot cereal after you stir this in.

It also gave me a stomach ache and didn't make me feel very well. I took it with a full large 12 oz. glass of water and tried the doses according to directions - for a week I tried. I did not find it beneficial. I know other reviewers have found this item very helpful but for me, it seemed to be very sticky and slow my digestion down. It has a cold element to it and makes my stomach feel like it has a cold slow lump moving through it. I hope other people get a better response to this product than I did. Good luck!At least with psyllium and a table spoon of aloe vera juice, and a teaspoon or two of Flax see oil, I was regular."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clumpy and hard to drink","review":"First I must admit this product smells excellent! You would think it would taste good, but it definitely did not. The weird clumpy concoction it made in water was definitely the biggest turn-off. I was impressed with getting fiber from food sources rather than synthetically like the Bebefiber that I normally use, but that product is just so much easier. You can mix it with anything. Also, there are 80 calories in each scoop of Super Seed which is not great if you're used to the 20 calories from Benefiber. This product is extremely well rated by everyone else, so I would give it a try and see if you like it for yourself. If it is your cup of tea, I'm positive there is nothing more healthy that you could be drinking. I'm definitely disappointed that I didn't like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convenient for fiber-packed dessert","review":"I've tried flaxmeal for its fiber value but couldn't get past the taste.

I really like that it incorporates fiber from a variety of healthy sources that I normally would not be able to get from my current diet.

I was trying to find a book that would help me shoot better home videos. This is not it. I'm not a beginner as I try to tell stories with my videos. But to me, this book would only be useful to a film student. And even then, I just don't see that much extra value it adds. I'm mad at myself for reading the whole book instead of cutting my losses.

If you follow the instruction and wisdom that Barry has stuffed between front and back covers, I guarantee that your video images will stand far apart from the average weekend shooter. Packed full of clear, concise photos to accompany the read you can't go wrong. Although I've taken videography classes, this book serves as a great refresher and reference. Barry also gives you technical advise thats easily digested. There is way too much information in this book for me to pinpoint one particular segment (although I have MY favorites), but if you are a novice to intermediate shooter buy this book like, yesterday!The Five C's of Cinematography: Motion Picture Filming TechniquesGet the book, get your camera, and get focused!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"This book was a very painful read. It was redundant with too many clichés, and the dialogue fell flat. I never really got a feel for Hope's situation, and didn't particularly care what happened to her. Matt was a recluse, irritating jerk. The writing was poorly done, and it didn't \\"show\\" me anything. I never got to a point where I could ignore the narrator's dull voice.

Then a torrent of memories came flooding in...and the \\"forever\\" she dreamed of was washed away.

That changes were needed to paychology's paradigms was first proposed by Carol Gilligan a student of the renowned moral rsearcher Lawrence Kohlberg. She and subsequent small informal groups of women extended the world's knowledge and understanding of difference and undercut the assumption that women's moral reasoning was inferior to that of men.

You lay it out there and tell it like it really is. It was BY FAR the most down-to-earth, real life material on parenting I have heard/read in my 17 yrs as a mom. I have read books by the score on parenting and they always made me feel that I didnt quite measure up to the book's ideal,(more guilt).Your words have provided great insight, comfort, and reasurrance that it's Ok not to fit societies mold of maternal perfection.

I doubt that all these issues relate to every parent but i don't doubt that every parent will have experienced certain parts of this book for themselves.Thank goodness i was able to read this book while i am still in the decision making phase. It does come across as quite negative but there are any number of books skewed towards the positive. I believe you have to take it all on board and use what you can.

In the last ten years, I have heard Dr. Jeffer's \\"if the parent is happier, the child will be happier\\" argument used to support decisions to divorce, decisions to remove children from the state in which the other parent resides for the removing parents' convenience, and decisions to simply not work with the other parent for the child's benefit because it is too inconvenient or frustrating. This \\"me, myself, and I\\" mentality is not what parenting is all about."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Author is the Brat","review":"So we all have struggles as parents, but this book is so negative and selfish. I'm a single mom and I understand hardship. But most of the things the author complains about are the kinds of things that you feel and then get over. Where's Mrs. Jeffers joy in life? Apparently in just making sure she doesn't have to do anything she doesn't feel like.This book is good for people who don't want their lives to change if they have kids OR for people who like to wallow in self-pity. It is not a balanced book on the pros and cons of parenting--only the cons and the cons from the perspective of a overly self-occupied mother.Having kids is about doing something bigger than just serving yourself. If you don't want to do that don't have kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Opening up a dialogue","review":"This book reassures those who are silently despondent over childrearing that they're not alone in finding parenthood so very, very much more difficult and disappointing than our society allows us to admit. Jeffers is correct to point out the insidious dangers of the conspiracy of silence around this issue. Her views are sure to enrage some, but the raw truth of what she unearths is priceless, especially the quotes from parents who finally admit their ultimate frustrations. A societal dialogue (confession?) on this issue is badly needed right now, and this book is the perfect starting point for discussion."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would give it 0 stars if i could","review":"As the mother of a 9 month old who doesnt sleep well or eat well, I know about the trials of parenthood, but the author takes her parenting hating views and says that everyone has them and no one would have children if they knew what it was like. despite my son currently pulling at my leg for no better reason then he is bored and wants my attention while he is crying while i am trying to write this, i would do it all again because of the love i feel for him. maybe i have the lbp (love being a parent) gene she claims exists, but she has the hbp (hate being a parent) gene, giving her kids up when they were young to their father after divorce and being happy about it. she is one of those people who shouldnt be a parent, but not everyone has the same feelings and experiences as she did."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for me","review":"too much shooting and clearing the table and not enough direction on the shot making. pretty disappointed.

It includes highly detailed histories of the various ship classes and a great deal of information. This sets it apart from the 1922-1946 edition, which feels strangely empty because it contains little in terms of history of individual ship classes and drowns the reader in facts and figures.As such, the 1906-1921 edition reads much more like a very detailed history book than its successor, while giving us the same amount of facts and statistics, and is all the better for it.I recommend it without reservation to fans of naval warfare, provided you can find a copy..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Conways all way.","review":"The best book of it's type.

These knives have multiple uses--not just slicing for Asian-style food, nor, for that matter, just for thin slicing.

But my son had less than zero interest in it. Although it was easy to grasp, it was hard for my son to get in his mouth (which is pretty much the point of any toy or teether for him).

Great colours and very robust. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Son doesn't care for it","review":"This was one of the first items we were given when we found out I was expecting. I was excited to receive it as I thought it would be a great toy. It was colorful, easy to grasp, light-weight, and made noise.

So many things to hold on to and mouth!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Infant Toy Yet!","review":"I got this toy at Buy Buy Baby for $15! I had seen this on Amazon, but when I went to the store, I put it in the hands of my 3 month old who immediately started to play with it. It was magical. Because of the many loops he was able to grab it right away and use his feet which I could see made him feel good. Not to mention the noise it makes when you shake it is a nice reward. Since then I noticed that he has become a lot more confident with other toys as a result of this toy. Before he was pretty frustrated with most of the other toys I gave him such as the \\"keys\\". I would say that this toy made him a lot more coordinated as he has learned to play with it. My son is now 4 months old. Highly recommend! I'll be getting this for future baby gifts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting toy","review":"It is soft and has many thin tress, which is easy for baby to grab and bite. You can hear sounds when shaking. It's fantestic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT","review":"Our twins love this. Our son sits and uses it to teeth on and it pretty much quiets him down as soon as we get it out. He likes to flick it around and hold it too. Our other twin doesn't like it as much, but this could be because he hogs it all the time. I would definitely recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps him interested","review":"I bought this for my son when he was about 4 months old and he plays with it all the time. He's now about 6 months and not bored with it. The rattle, bright colors, graspable pieces, and mouth-friendliness make this a winner for him. Other babies have tried to steal it from him at play groups, so I guess that's a good sign too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings out the Incredible Hulk in my four-month old","review":"Okay, that didn't come out right. This is a POSITIVE review of this very handy, tactile toy that will probably withstand considerable abuse from your young 'uns. My son finds the colors attractive, and the design makes it easy for him to grab the toy. In fact, he loves to grab it at both ends and tries his hardest to pull it apart, resulting in loud grunts and shouts (and a little frustration!); hence, the \\"Hulk\\" reference. Good exercise for him, I should think. Another good toy I got him isBaby Einstein Bendy Ballbut that one's a little heavy and not amenable to chewing or exercise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!!!","review":"My 3.5 month old really loves this toy.

It's our go everywhere toy at 3 1/2 months old!","review":"If you are considering buying this toy for a little one who is just beginning to grasp things, I definitely recommend it. It has become our go-everywhere toy! My little guy just likes having his fingers wrapped around something - it soothes him to hold on to this thing. I bought mine in a baby store and the cashier literally had to scan the tag from my little one's hands. He loves this thing. He holds it in his carseat, stroller, even at naptime sometimes, just to have something to hang on to. It has a gently rattle sound and it's pretty pliable. Now that teething has begun, he likes to chew on the curved pieces and it's so easy for him to bring this to his mouth. I am thankful that I have this and am definitely a fan! Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yummo!","review":"That title sums up my five month old's opinion of this toy. It has a wonderful rattle that isn't annoying or loud. My daughter can grasp any part of this toy and easily put any part of it in her mouth. Apparently it can also be refrigerated to make it cold but we have not yet tried it.As with any toy, parent supervision is necessary. It is possible to get little hands stuck in the larger parts although it doesn't seem painful and may actually help with dexterity at the infant figures out how to extract an arm.Bottom line, it is a wonderful toy. I would recommend it for any child who is learning to grasp things."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT PRODUCT","review":"Pros- This one is really really good. Flexible.

He has some special needs, two of which affect his play are distal arthogryposis and far-sightedness. He can easily see the bright colors, and even though he clenches his hands partially, this toy is very easy for him to grab onto and bring up to his face. He loves chewing on this toy. There are no detachable parts so he can safely chew on it. He also can toss this toy since it's light weight and easy to grab.

I am a first time Mom, & I wanted to get something that he would like & other experienced Mom's thought were great. Well, my son LOVES this toy. He can easily get his little hands around the loops & he loves the bright colors. He does get a little frustraited when he can't get it into his mouth the way he wants it, but I think it's because his motor skills aren't developed enough yet. All together, I think this toy is great. The only reason I didn't give this product a 5 star review is because he gets aggravated with the toy where he can't get it in his mouth, & because of the small ball/rattle feature inside the red square at the center. This rattle only works half the time, & I usually have to smack it really hard against my palm to shake the ball inside loose."},{"rating":"2","title":"My baby love it.","review":"My baby just love to hold it and bite it. ha ha The material feels good and very colorful.

The WInkel and a crinkle book were the first toys that my daughter really played with. The Winkel is nice because the loops are soft and flexible. She loves to chew on the loops. It is light enough that she can pick it up and it can be held in a variety of ways which is great for a baby learning to grasp things. Lately, at almost 6 months, she will laugh like crazy when we sit on the floor and I toss the winkel between my hands or drop it and let it bounce on the play mat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made in China","review":"The product appears to be colorful and perfect for a teething baby, HOWEVER...I bought this solely because it came up when I searched for \\"toys not made in China\\".

It does not hold her interest at all. Her first tooth is coming through now (at 7 months) and I put it in the refrigerator overnight and then gave it to her. It was barely cold after being in the fridge all night and became room temperature almost immediately.If she hadn't put it in her mouth, I would return it. The only positive thing I can say is that it is relatively easy for babies to hold (although it is a bit heavy for when they first start holding things). My baby much prefers her Sophie the Giraffe and Freddie the Firefly."},{"rating":"2","title":"great first toy","review":"Really pleased with this toy. It was one of the first toys our daughter was able to really grasp on her own and play with. The large loops made it easy for her to whack around, make noise with, and get into her mouth for teething. Its large size (relative to her!), but light weight has made her work on passing the toy directly from hand to hand (a developmental milestone), rather than via her mouth. We also like that it doesn't pose a suffocation hazard and can be left in her crib for her to play with when she wakes up. (If your baby won't grab at it too much while feeding, you can also use it to prop a bottle -- we did anyway...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stimulator","review":"My five month old boy loves this toy. It has a subtle rattle to it. Seems safe. No paint issues.

However, I was disappointed when it arrived without a working rattle. There must be one tiny little pen-sized ball in there, and it makes noise only if I vigorously shake it - can't really justify this as a \\"rattle.\\" Also, while it is easy for little hands to graps, my baby holds it for about 5 seconds before losing interest. I've been retrying for a month now, and she still hates it.

By that point, he wasn't really into passing a toy back and forth between hands. Though this toy is fun to look at, it is not a manipulative toy, so the parts can't be moved or adjusted to make it look different, which I think would appeal to an older baby. As it is, my son looked at it, turned it around in his hands, then tossed it and looked for something else to play with.The manufacturer's recommended age range was up to 18 months and that is very misleading. At 15 months old now, I think my son will only be using this to throw at his brother!

His study moves beyond the rhetoric of the printed page and into the actual real life practices of the early church. He shows how Jesus was the co-recipient of worship with God in a way that the earliest believers didn't feel violated the monotheistic scruples of Second Temple Judaism. In fact, they saw devotion to Christ as obedience to God."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased opinions obvious","review":"The only reason a 5 star rating by 8 individuals can be justified, is not on readability or clarity. It is transparently obvious that, the only criteria was support for their theology. And all reviews say as much. An alternative theory to christology is hailed as the answer to Christs identity with the same enthusiasm as vitamins cure cancer. Anything but orhtodox medicine is hailed as a wonder therapy. Anything but that Jesus is God is here hailed in five stars! The bias is not even veiled. This verbose and out on a limb, interpretation as fact epic work gets a 1 in my rating. Time could better be spent on more honest less ego centric theory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overturning Bousset","review":"Hurtado wastes no time in upsetting the German-historical model of Wilhelm Bousett. Bousett has postulated that the high christology of the NT was a historical progression in which the earliest Christian communities did not whole to the idea of Jesus as Lord and God. Hurtado shows how the earliest evidence in the NT points to the fact that not only did people like Paul hold to this high view of Christ, but this view had been in place for sometime and in fact had no time to actually develop; it had to have been in place from the beginning. He goes on to explain in chapters 3-6 that the Gospels (Jesus Books) express high christological language consistent with Paul and in place from the beginning. Even Q does not differentiate from what is found in Paul and other texts."},{"rating":"1","title":"one boring lesson","review":"For starters the production quality of this tape is very poor.

This album is far from his most accessible, but certainly amongst the most fascinating. Because of it's acoustic nature, The Green Man probably has the most in common with Stormcock. But the philosophy behind the two records couldn't be further apart. While Stormcock had thematic undercurrents of anger and isolation, Green Man celebrates life as only a grandfather could. With Green Man Roy we find Roy aged like a glass of Oregon pinot noir, with just a bit cork floating in the top. If Roy keeps going like this until the end of his days, he'll never go wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly sensuous masterpiece!","review":"Roy Harper is a gem, isn't he? I guess it was actually a great idea to record The Green Man only with acoustic instruments and no drums. One can appreciate his full potential, charm and wisdom better. I'm not sure whether Roy needs a full backing band as it usually tends to leave the music a little less free. Roy is just perfect on his own though credit should be given to the few guest musicians who contributed great parts this time 'round."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grumps san frontiers","review":"\\"Men between the ages of 35 and 54 are the grumpiest group of people in history.

His lines are lame, anyway.Here's a sample of \\"Bored to Death\\" humor: Upon bumbling across an AA meeting, Schwartzman asks one of the participants if she knows where he can get a drink to kill some time. Here's another: His agent, played by Ted Danson, comes down with a herpes blister on his lip. He has to give a big speech in a couple hours so he gets Schwartzman punch him in the mouth to \\"obscure\\" the blister.

I found a lot of interesting historical information. But, I have to say I was puzzled by the author's quick dismissal of texts found in the Bible.For example, regarding the beheading of John the Baptist, Crossan says, \\"Antipas's execution of John cannot be explained by a simple appeal to Mark 6:17-29, even if one took that marvelous fiction as historical fact.\\" And after simply quoting the story from Mark, Crossan says, \\"Mark's account is best seen as his own creation.\\" Huh? Why? He never says why. Then Crossan says that 200 years earlier in Rome, a Roman leader had a person beheaded at dinner just to please his guest. And Crossan says the author of Mark is basically copying that story. But this is all just the opinion of Crossan.I would have liked better reasoning in a book like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard Read","review":"When I first heard of John Crossan, I thought he had some pretty cool beliefs (from the summaries I read).

Oh well, I guess its more for the learned theologian, not the spiritual seeker...."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Way to Begin A Long Process","review":"The best aspect of this work is its readability. For someone interested in the historical context of the gospel, Crossan's short work is a great way to begin.

However, this book definitely planted many ideas for follow-on study, which was what I was seeking."},{"rating":"1","title":"frustrating and one-dimensional","review":"Simply put, this book will not solve any of the problems it presents. If you want historical proof of Jesus, consult another book. Crosson's job is to explain away the Jesus of faith to make it easier to ignore the central message. A Zen-Jesus who says cute things compels no one to follow him. If you want to believe in Jesus, consult the Gospels. Just don't compromise for Crosson's milque-toasty Jesus who looks more at home in the politically-correct society this book is published for than the 1st century nation he lived in. There is no scholarship behind this study, and no archeology to buttress his opinions. It merely begins with the assumption that the Gospels can't possibly be telling the truth, and continues from that point. Nothing wrong with that, but a little honesty up front would have been refreshing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, good Lord.","review":"I get very tired of reviews that say things like, \\"The value of this book is that it makes you think and ask questions -- look at how it's made the other reviewers react.\\"Stupid, stupid, stupid.

This album is good in a sense that it demonstrates that Luis Miguel has a qualified voice, among the best shall I say. However, the interpretations are very stale and among the most boring in terms of dynamics and tempo. I am not impressed with the repetition that Luis employs in all the songs, it is merely repetitious and a little boring. Luis Miguel is among the best singers of all time, but if you want a quality album and the best voice you can listen, get \\"Yo soy aquel\\" from \\"El monstro de la cancion\\", the spanish RAPHAEL, who was undoubtably the best voice in Europe and all over."},{"rating":"2","title":"very useful and intersting","review":"I travelled Corsica with a rented car.

In fact, it's just another rant about how great the NewT Economy really is.There is virtually no analysis of how the driving forces of capitalism chews up people's liberty, how Wired magazine pulled all their original ideas from Holland, how the magazine's float went pear-shaped, or how actually working there really was for the non-celebrity staff.Another book written by Americans for American Porsche Boxster owners and sad Ann Rynd sychophants.Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts well, gets tedious","review":"Ms. Borsook's book starts out well, makes some good points, including the basic idea that the prevalent libertarianism associated with high tech culture is selfish, misguided yet a growing force in America today. Her insights from attendance at various high-tech events were particularly interesting. However, I have given up in the middle of her chapter about the magazine \\"Wired\\", which is based on her personal experiences and oh Lord does she grind the ax to the nub.After a while her writing style also gets extremely tedious: paragraph-length sentences full of jargon-laden descriptives, high tech turns of phrase and dependent clauses. Maybe you need to write that way for magazines to get as much information as you can into a short space, but in a book it really starts to wear."},{"rating":"1","title":"amusing","review":"If you believe the early days of Wired were innovative and spoke to and about high tech culture you might enjoy the author's rants.

Having a story about a kid that doesn't like his name so he changes it to \\"Blue Avenger\\" is stupid. If anyone changed their name to something like that they would be considered a lunatic. Also, what is up with his \\"superhero\\" costume? A blue fishing vest and a blue towel around his head, people would think that he was a terrorist. Another thing is that what 16 year old kid want to be a superhero anyway. That is something little kids want to be.Something else that bothered me about the book was about how it goes on and talks about things that have nothing to do with the story. Who really cares what happened at the same time that David decided to change his name to \\"Blue Avenger?All and all I think that this book was the worst book that I ever read and I do not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alexander Jablokov's \\"Carve the Sky\\" is a winner","review":"Carve the Sky is the only book by Alexander Jablokov that I have read. It was a great story and I want to read more stories by him.The setting for Carve the Sky takes place several hundred years in the future, humanity has spread throughout much of the solar system and each place has developed its own distinctive culture. The characters are highly intelligent and complex individuals whose outlooks and actions are influenced by their cultures. The futuristic settings and the characters in this novel are as interesting as the story itself (maybe even better).If you liked Frank Herbert's Dune books, I think that you will like Carve the Sky as much or more. Highly Recommended.."},{"rating":"2","title":"A glorious story.","review":"I started reading this novel while I was spending 11 days in the county jail for harrassment, which only means I said something someone didn't like, but I was moved to another unit before I could finish the book. I liked it so much that I had to order a copy. Jablokov was an author I hadn't read before, but there were almost no other science fiction novels there. The mid-24th century was a good choice of setting, and the characters were believable, but starting the novel, one literally has no idea how things are going to work out; many other SF authors - including my favorites - tend to stereotype themselves, and their stories become predictable. Ozaki as a brilliant, tragic figure was marvellous.Eleven days locked up eating the swill El Paso County, CO calls \\"food\\" was a rather high price to pay, but I'm glad I discovered this book.

I guess I can buy some epoxy and fix it as the other reviewers did, but I suspect it will break at the same point again. Orbit designed the plastic piece with too narrow a diameter. Since the timer is spring operated, it takes some torque to set it. This amount of torque causes the piece to break. What is the point of taking Orbit up on its warranty? The replacement will break after a few uses too. The designer must have done minimal or no product testing. I bought another timer, evidently the Melnor, although the my timer has no brand name anywhere on it.

It worked well, though it shuts the water off more aggressively than the gentle stop of our Gardenas. Thus it went well for the first season. But in the second season, every once in a while it would stick open. At first I thought it was my error, but then one day after finding it running many hours after it was set for 30 minutes it became clear that it was sticking. Too bad, but our water is much too expensive to risk to this timer."},{"rating":"1","title":"my first 1-star review. Unusable as a water shutoff!","review":"I've never given a 1-star review, but this thing just does not work properly. The problem is a really dumb one - the hose connector (female threads) doesn't hold properly. The result is that it pops off the hose, and water then runs freely. Making it worse, it held fine as long as the timer was \\"on,\\" but when the timer shut off, the increased water pressure popped it off. Fortunately, I was just using it to trickle water, so not a disaster.The reason it doesn't hold is that someone was trying to save 2 cents worth of plastic. It only has 2 threads (the spirally thingies that go around inside). Minimum number is 3 threads, and to make something leakproof you need 4. The male end (on bottom in the Amazon picture) has 5.I don't know why everyone else isn't reporting this problem. Perhaps they changed the design. Perhaps other people connect at the faucet rather than at the hose, and for some reason it holds better there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pleased","review":"I had several of these same items for a number of years and I knew to expect good service from new ones.

A Thing Of State only mildly holds your attention. Too little happens over long passages to keep you engrossed. On a few occasions I even thought about giving up on it. While Drury continues to demonstrate his strong knowledge of high level politics (although you might not agree with his personal opinions), my basic reaction to this is WHO CARES if he's not telling a story that sustains my interest. Save your time and money and read something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Nation and an Author in Decline","review":"Drury has become a lot more cynical since his \\"Advise and Consent\\" days, when chummy senators protected themselves but ultimately protected the country from its worst traits. In \\"A Thing of State,\\" Drury proceeds to berate Bush, Clinton, and their nameless successor for being all talk, no action, and for selling out America's foreign policy dominance for a shot at reelection. He condemns voters as having the attention span of two year-olds, and (remarkably) produces a conspiracy among a trusted group of Arab-Americans in Washington -- a description that is reminiscient of the racist paranoia that gave rise to the Japanese internments in World War II. Drury hits the reader square in the face with his message repeatedly to the point where you just want him to shut up. Still, it's a compelling read and a thought-provoking message, although one wishes he'd concentrated more on character and story -- as he did in previous works -- than on lecturing us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teddy Bears","review":"This was a delightful book that shares the importance of teddy bears in the lives of young children.

The inspirational readings are quite good. It helps to have 2 versions of scripture written out on the page so you could do the study w/o your Bible if you wanted to, not that I recommend that.

The stearing with the wi-remote is a tad hard to get used to but once you do it almost seems natural. The game gives points for crashes, slides, jumpes and much more and is fun for both hard core gamers as well as non-gamers. The graphics are good but not great, which is fine since the level of fun makes up for that and the game woul probably would be worse if the emphasis was placed on graphics. Only two people can play at a time and honestly the game isn't much fun with two people, its best as one player game. But if you like fun races like mario Kart or Off Road then you will love this. If you like realistic races like Need for Speed and such, then you won't like this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Newbie Game","review":"This game is fast-paced and action packed.

Tiltling the remote like a steering wheel to blast your way through enviroments pulling off awesome stunts and soaring trough the air at enourmous hights delivers a fun and action packed expirience. However, Excite Truck isn't able to live up to it's full potential simply because thier isn't enough content. With only 6 places to race, the game doesn't have much variety and can get old. Also the multiplayer is totaly underwhelming. Since only two players can take part, the racing isn't nearly as intense or fun as the single player mode. Still, Excite Truck is still worth a purchase if you own a Wii just because it's REALLY fun to play.Gameplay:10Graphics:8Sound:8Lasting Appeal:5OVERALL:8.5"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissatisfied with the Seller","review":"I ordered \\"Excite\\" for my son for Christmas. When we tried to play it, the WII would not recognize that the disc was inserted. We popped the disc out and when we looked at it, it had a couple deep scratches and a tiny chip out of the side.

Excellent game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Throwing trucks doesn't get old...","review":"This is a great game for the Wii and a blast to play against another opponent on split screen. Thankfully, this game actually splits the screen down the middle (vertically) instead of horizontally like a lot of games and seemed to strike a healthy balance between visibility and screen clutter. The tracks are fairly straight-forward but there are hidden routes that take a little bit of hunting to exploit and gain time.One of the cooler aspects of this racing game are strategy points that you drive through that \\"change\\" the course...literally. The next 1/4 of a mile or so of road will shift and completely change moving either up or down like a massive, mind-controlled earthquake. If you time your hitting of these just right you'll \\"throw\\" the other trucks that you're racing against and gain bonus points - very, very fun in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT for kids","review":"I bought this for my 10 and 4 yr old boys and they absolutely love it. They have played it non-stop for 2 days so far. The oldest gets the 'B' ratings that unlock new vehicles/colors/tracks, and the 4 yr old just plays. It is a little FAST but the youngest caught on to holding the remote and steering just fine.

I wish I could change my angle of view slightly at times but that may be a setting I never saw.Playability is where this game shined.

I liked Burnout 2 on the Xbox, but that was mostly because of its crash mode. How much fun can you have driving in circles over and over again? Yeah the courses change and there is the competition aspect, but really in the end you are just sitting there holding down the accelerator button and tilting the controller. There's no real strategy, suspense, or thinking. Oh and the physics are weak. Explain to me how a car can turn in mid air with no wheels touching the ground?

The flying trucks and loud music were annoying. Luckily, we rented the game to discover this instead of paying for it.

This album has several referencesto \\"Dreams\\"...perhaps an acknowledgement to dreams he had then realized having finally made it \\"on his own\\" after a successful run with Rainbow & Black Sabbath.As a lyricist, imagery is Ronnie Dio's strongpoint...*Dream Evil* is abundant with it...and the music compliments those words perfectly.One of Dio's finest works.-Dan07-20-02"},{"rating":"2","title":"No Vivian, but still worth it.","review":"A typical Dio album with good songwriting and good music behind, but if you heard Dio's first 2 albums, you get a sense something was missing: Vivian Campbell.

Good replacement for Campbell but the guitar work is not all that great. 'Last In Line' is the last good album Dio made: avoid 'Sacred Heart' and everything released afterwards as it just doesn't measure up in music and the 'magic' lyrics just simply become lame.

Although I remember the sound of the original CD being quite flat, this remaster is a real improvement.On this CD, Dio went for more of a \\"secular\\" approach, abandoning much of the doom-and-gloom and D&D metaphors to display a more mature sense of lyric writing. I especially like \\"Naked in the Rain\\" and \\"Overlove\\", the former of which could have easily been a single and the latter of which inlcudes a highpoint guitar-wise. Other highlights include \\"Night People\\", \\"Sunset Superman\\", and \\"When a Woman Cries\\". The chosen singles/promos, \\"All the Fools Sailed Away\\" and \\"I Could Have Been a Dreamer\\", were a bit overrought - a choice that surely hurt the record's broad-based appeal."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"The audio quality of this collection of tapes is horrible.

American Sign Language actually originated in France. You need to do more research when you decide to publish a book that is absolutely useless and, is an affront to the Deaf(Not! hearing impaired).

Another shabby sari crash-landed in Regency London would have driven me out of the multiplex, but I was kept in my seat by one redeeming moment - when Becky Sharpe wins over the snobs with a song, Crimson Petal.

Students find it accessible and it is sufficiently comprehensive to meet the needs of most instructors.I would prefer a book that introduced topics in statistical inference after statistical association, but I suspect that this is a preference that is peculiar to me and the way I introduce material, some of which is not included in the book. Moreover, the order in which Levin and Fox introduce topics is the same as used by most other textbooks of this kind.My only serious reservation about the book is the brevity of the section on regression. However, I recognize that introductory courses rarely cover this topic in depth, and many do not even introduce it.All tolled, this is a good text, both informative and student-friendly.

I can't think of another cd I've heard recently that has annoyed me more. First off, the singer has adopted a style that wails in off keys, somewhat reminding me of English folk ballads, with lyrics that are undecipherable and unlistenable. It is sort of a personal poetry that somehow she thinks might be interesting to others but really is a lack of good songwriting skills. This kind of singing is both self indulgent and very limiting in range. The only saving grace of this cd is the group of musicians which carry the recording. They are quite good and very melodic but are constantly killed by the singer's agonizing quality.

Sure, he's boldly promotional about his achievements and about those of his company, Viacom - but as someone who came from humble beginnings to create a tremendous empire through intelligence and hard work, he can afford to indulge a bit. He gives credit when credit is due and pulls few punches when it is not. What is perhaps most remarkable about his story is that the most exciting part did not begin until he was into his 60's. It is a good read, offering insights into corporate politics, negotiation, and the recent history of the entertainment business.

Why buy a book whose best picture of reality comes from looking in the mirror? Where is the beef?? The book is more publicity for Redstone than an honest work of journalism. Perhaps Restone should take his title to heart, because as an author I am sure he is winning, but as readers we lose out on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I agree with the other reviewers Sumner is too much of a bragger to make this story enjoyable. Also, I thought he would have discussed more in detail his childhood and how he grew into the powerful man he is today. His story always is focused on his accomplishment yet never touched on a single set back or defeat. He bragged about his Harvard education, his power over Barry Diller at QVC, and he even bragged about how he changed the way Viacom was pronounced. Give me a break.

Marty can do better, and he has."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS WHERE I STOPPED BUYING MARTY STUART'S ALBUMS!","review":"IN THE BEGINNING............I thought Marty Stuart was going to be one of the few young keepers of the traditional flame. After all, that's what he preached and mostly performed. However, things didn't turn out that way. I guess the almighty buck won-out over the real love for traditional country. I'm being generous, rating it as one star.

Both superficial signs of good content. At first, when I found the book to be so ploddingly bad, I thought it must be me. I mean, how could the author of so many published works be this bad?Alas, all I can think is thank God I'm done with the thing.It's like a never-ending Vanity Fair article that is short on substance, long on psychobabble assumptions, wrapped in the presumption of societal importance. The author compounds the reader's misery with the added tedium of a dull book report on Zelda's novel.Toward the blessed end, the author notes that perhaps the worst tragedy of Zelda's life is ..... dying in the hospital fire. Stupid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece","review":"Yes, this is the best Smith's album to me. I think its the most emotional piece of work they released. Knowing what was riding on this album, and knowing what was going on while they made this album makes it much more clearer this is thier best album. Not a bad track on this. Sorry, if I don't put God Save The Queen, above this. Sad that this album is underrated, overlooked and misunderstood...."},{"rating":"2","title":"7 stunning songs, 2 good songs and one awful song....","review":"The Smiths last album spinns off with the magnificent 'A Rush And A Push And The Land Is Ours', one of The Smiths more experimental songs...no guitar on this one I figure. 'I Started Something I Couldn't Finish' wasn't that good, but OK. From now on to 'Paint A Vulgar Picture' it's great songs all the way though. The groovy jam 'Death Of A Disco Dancer', pure pop songs as 'Girlfriend In A Coma' and 'Stop Me...', ballads such as 'Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me' and 'Paint A Vulgar Picture' and the forgotten 'Unhappy Birthday' makes a fantastic album. The magic dissapears though, when 'Death At Ones Elbow' shows The Smiths at their worst. 'I Won't Share You' mostly sounds a bit out of tune, and never really make it to my ears since I've pressed the 'STOP' button before 'Death At One's Elbow' have gotten a chance to destroy the day...this album could be their masterpiece, but fails due to a poor ending..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well, I'd trust the band members over anyone else...","review":"If it makes any difference, in the latest issue of Uncut, take 104, Marr states that the band always thought 'Strangeways' as their strongest record.I personally think 'Meat is Murder' was best, but I remember listening to Strangeways very heavily in 1987, and having a complete feeling of sadness, because you knew it was over. Not because it was poor in any way, but because the mood of the record was so alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please them! Please them!","review":"I consider this one of The Smiths most experimental cds. This is particularly evident in the first couple tracks. They are unlike anything else the group has ever released. Morrissey does some wonderful things with his voice in those two songs as well. The rest of the cd is pure brilliance. Only The Smiths can release a cd where ever track is a winner. Instead of going out with a bang the cd ends with a surprisingly soothing number called \\"I Won't Share You\\". While I hate to have to rate their cds, this is definately one of the top two in The Smiths collection (the other being \\"The Queen is Dead\\")."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Album from an Essential Band","review":"Before the Smiths split they delivered this fine piece of work. I would hesitate to call this their best work, only because I can't decide between this, The Queen is Dead or Louder Than Bombs. I would say however, that this is the deepest of their proper studio creations. The band is at their musical peak, expanding the Smith sound through use of piano and Johnny Marr streching out his guitar parts, while Morrisey delivers his most convincing set of lyrics. It is hard to beleive that this is the sound of a group about to implode. Several songs are among the best that the group had released including A Rush and a Push, Death of a Disco Dancer, I Won't Share You and Paint a Vulgar Picture. Better to go out on top I guess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smiths saved the best for last, well, sort of.","review":"Strangeways, Here We Come offers two of the best Smith songs ever written. Paint a Vulgar Picture is by far the climax of the Smiths' artistic achievements. It stands alone as the song that all other Smiths' songs will be measured by. Girlfriend in a Coma is similarly brilliant. At only two minutes, this song stands as \\"pound for pound\\" one of the greatest of all time. The other songs embrace the same brilliance that we expect from the Smiths, yet somehow don't have the same impact as the \\"lesser\\" songs on other Smiths' albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"Most of the Smiths fans I've met tend to disagree with me, but I rank this album as equal with the Queen is Dead. From the opening, haunting lyrics of \\"A Rush and a Push...,\\" all the way through to the end, this is a masterpiece! \\"Paint a Vulgar Picture\\" is a classic track -- one of the very best ever from the Smiths/Morrissey."},{"rating":"2","title":"It just doesnt get any better","review":"This is numero uno for me and The Smiths. Maybe not as catchy sounding or witty as other albums, Strangeways is by far the most intricate and delicate of the bunch. Thats my usual tastes anyway so maybe Im biased.

To me, I got the unfortunate image of Ms. Voelker wearing a black leather leotard and practically barking orders as if speaking to juvenile delinquents, not aging baby boomer folks or those with chronic health conditions in need of a therapeutic relationship with their mind, body, heart and soul. (She says things about peace and love, but I hear rigidity and austerity.) There is no mention of 'breathe, relax, feel, observe and allow'. I feel that her pacing of the instructions are contraindicative to relaxation, digestion or assimilation of the proposed exercises and their benefits.As a Kripalu Yoga Teacher, I would not share this CD with any of my students or wish to be considered in alliance with Ms. Voelker's particular style of teaching."},{"rating":"1","title":"DF 4033 TRANSLATOR","review":"I misplaced my manual if I ever had one.

First off, when you eject a DVD, the tray does not even clear the roof of the player the entire way, so if you have a 2 sided DVD, the top of it gets all scratched, and since they have yet to develop a scratch resistant DVD this is a very bad thing.

I haven't found a region hack for the little Akai yet (I have other machines for that), and so far it won't play my old SVCDs acceptably (ditto). That said, it scores high for two things: Performance/price (when there's a $10 rebate) and adjustability-- the Akai is the only cheapie I know of that has BRIGHTNESS, CONTRAST and SHARPNESS controls that actually do an effective and useful job. The Akai uses a Mediatek chipset (1379? looks like it) that many inexpensive DVD portables use, which means a simple GUI that's easy to navigate. That CONTRAST control comes in very handy with JPEG files, which tend to be very contrasty. So far (2 months) the machine has been reliable and easy to use.

The book doesn't flow like a story, but is more like a summary/overview of the three most recent Star Wars films. The best aspect of the book are the color photographs - one big picture (or two smaller pictures) on each page.The least fortunate aspect of the book is that it's mostly for hard-core fans with a good memory, or for those who've seen the films recently. I found that the part of the book I enjoyed the most, was about the plot I remember the best - the circumstances around Luke and Leia's birth and what happened to them later.

The problem is that it does this when there is adequate power and, as in the last 3 units, this one will not reset. It is totally useless. I had always been a fan of APC but it is my belief that the quality of their product has gone down hill and I will never purchase from them again.

To top it off there are more F-bombs here than a def jam hosted by Chris Rock, and not nearly as many laughs.

The characters are cartoonish, the plot is ridiculous and incomprehensible and the writing appalling. This is supposed to be a comic novel, but I don't recall that I laughed one time reading it. I guess there would be some justification for a self-indulgent piece of foolishness like this if the proceeds from sales were going to some worthy cause, but there's no indication of that that I could see.

It's like saying rich folks don't need to worry about the environment, and money is an abstract concept at the this age anyway.

I had problems already with Liam going to steal it, though I could nearly justify it with the back and forth the Beastie had, between the English and the Scottish Lockharts. But then Ellen's actions were truly despicable, no matter how desperate she was. And she was a pretty poor mother too.I thought long and hard about whether I thought I was being biased because of the genders, but I just really didn't like Ellen at all. Liam deserved much better.

I was disappointed by the thin plot line, lack of depth in the characters, and the repetitive prose (if Liam referred to Ellen as an \\"angel\\" one more time, I was going to scream). Although there was adequate background on Ellen, we never really understood what made Liam tick. The author repeatedly referred to the fact that he was a soldier, as if that completely explained who he was.

However, there were just too many things wrong with this story. First of all, does the heroine not have any idea where her child is? How does Natalie manage to spend so much time alone with Liam, a strange man? That seems odd. Second, how does Ellen just jump into bed with Liam with such abandon, becoming a major nympho after 9 years of seclusion from the world. I can see where she might want some companionship, but after all, this is SUPPOSED to be regency England. Isn't she the least bit worried about the possibility of getting pregnant?

Of course then when you are finished, you feel like you want to keep reading.Seems to happen with most of the Ted Dekker books I've read.Good mystery with lots of twists and turns.Also, not sure why but this book goes by different titles - like he wasn't sure what to call it at first, and the book jackets are always different."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Ted Dekker book so far","review":"Ted Dekker presents a valid picture of the oppressive Saudi culture and its cancerous brand of Islam: Wahhabism (which, by the way is their chief export - not oil).The reader may be incredulous at the treatment of women as portrayed by Dekker, but he does not overstate the case. In my book, I portray similar treatment of women in the Muslim countries of Egypt and PakistanThe Y FactorDekker brings the book to a satisfactory conclusion and demonstrates the refuge offered by Christianity.My only disappointment in the book is a contrived interchange between the protagonist and his chief antagonist near the end of the book.Overall, this is a great read and is a stark reminder of the worldwide danger represented by Wahhabi Islam.

In trying to integrate action and suspense with religion and prayer, the book ends up being neither a good thriller nor a convincing religious statement. There are, as mentioned some inconsistencies--in actuality, the number of possible futures would be nearly infinite--and the book definitely makes Christianity look good at the expense of Islam. Also, it contains several ridiculous cheap shots at evolution--if Seth is such a genius, why does he subscribe to this \\"intelligent design\\" crap?--and a ham-handed promotion of Fox News. This book actually is not a bad read for a while, but it quickly gets bogged down in religious dogma. In short, if you want good Christian writing, try C.S. Lewis; if you want a good thriller, well, take your pick. If you want a heavy-handed, clumsy combination of them, buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it appears w/ a hidden agenda","review":"I picked this up in the local library, thinking it looked interesting. A modern love story with some sci-fi twists.The religion themes, at first, were fine -- after all, it's impossible to write about the Middle East without them.But by the back 2/3 of the book, when the power of the 'God of Jesus' is being rammed down my throat and the options of another god are being thrown away, I got fed up.I'm not a fan of authors who hide religious themes behind the pages of mainstream fiction. If you're going to be a 'Christian' writer, stand up and be proud about it.As for the writing, eh. It wasn't page-turning, edge-of-my-seat excitement, even before the jesus part was being rammed, repeatedly, down my throat.I wouldn't recommend this to a friend, and I won't pick up another Dekker work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needed a lot more attention","review":"The careless writing in this surprised me, especially in light of some of the other reviews.

The writing starts off well, and the author's research is evident. I liked the message that prayer is a powerful force, but he rapidly degrades into hitting the reader over the head with fundamentalist Christian dogma. The chasing is protracted and Seth's ability to leave Cheyenne Mt. doesn't really hold up. The plug for the Fox News network is pretty obvious and ridiculous too. Don't bother reading this book to give you any revelations about your faith or anyone else's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cover makes no mention that this is a Christian novel","review":"I feel kind of ripped off. I thought this was more conventional sci-fi adventure, but when the hero writes an equation in a college classroom proving intelligent design I went, uh oh. First there was no explanation of the equations, no science, it was just posited as if by magic. The whole concept of science proving there is only one ordained possible future is silly and made it very hard for me to take this seriously or even with a modicum of interest. The other part of the book dealing with the harsh world for women in Saudi Arabia was better done, but the characters seemed just that, not real people.

When news of her father arrenging marriage for her she becomes desperate and runs away to the United States in search for the freedom that she desires."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting Action and Deep Truths exposed","review":"What a book, I was thoroughly entertained and challenged. This book brought to light the problems that are in the world of Islam. The harsh reality of Islam is exposed through this wonderful book.

This book will surprise you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kept me glued to my incline bike!","review":"The incline bike at the gym is the only spot the mother of two preschoolers can get a book read! This was a great, suspenseful novel. Very interesting view into the House of Saud. Challenged our ideas about a lot of issues. My book club read this, and we agreed it was a real page turner. The premonition idea was fun and added a dimension to the average boy meets girl, boy saves girl type story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Writing, Intriguing Story.","review":"Ted Dekker is, and has been for some time now, the recognized master of the thriller/romance sub-genre within the genre of Christian fiction. He is an awesome writer, and his books are impossible to put down. Everone knows this already, but Blink represents an intense new styling of fiction excellence. Blink is about an Arabian princess trapped in the life of the palace, a life which she despises. She wants freedom. She doesn't want to have to marry through a forced, arranged union. She doesn't want to have to wear the covering that her country's laws force her to wear.Enter a handsome young American man with a heart as big as Texas and a soul as free as California. I don't have to tell you about the romance element of the story, but I feel that I must tell you that the spiritual liberation presented in the story is far more important than the physical liberation. Blink is an excellent Ted Dekker novel, and I recommend to everyone. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless pocket crowder","review":"Save your money.

I brought it home thinking it was just a virus, but it did it again. Unfortunately instead of throwing it away then, I made the huge mistake of thinking it was another virus, only to have it happen again. My 'platinum' membership at CompUSA was worthless because they told me that since they couldn't replicate the problem, they weren't going to do anything for me.

This can be both a blessing and a curse, as trying to stay true to the original game module does require a linear, game-like approach to storytelling that can make it feel a bit claustrophobic at times. Kidd's effective use of humor in the characters' dialog and relationships is what makes it worth reading, and eventually worth reading again. The ending wasn't what I expected - not the way the party arrived at that point anyway - but it leaves room for further adventures with Jus, Escalla and their misfit friends if Wizards of the Coast ever see fit. I hope they bring Mr. Kidd back to do exactly that, since there is a lot of room for something other than more Dragonlance short story collections in the Wizards lineup."},{"rating":"2","title":"the prodigy","review":"this book felt like an analysis of my life. any child who was thrown into a level of the education system that could be considered above there 'class' will surely be able to relate to this story (try being a working class kid in an elitist private school!). a nice balance of captivation and realism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only discusses fondant and sugarpaste techniques","review":"This book does not illustrate any techniques used with piped icing.There are some beautiful cakes but they are decorated with either poured or rolled fondant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine if you like fondant","review":"Like many cake decorating books published in the UK, this book's cakes are not apt to have broad appeal to the US home baker. People who grew up with Aunt Betty's buttercream icing and Mom's frosted cupcakes after school may find the taste of the sugarpaste (rolled fondant) covering used on nearly all these cakes unfamiliar, too sweet, and with a stange texture. Most of the cakes are lovely to look at, but there is not a single one in here that I would actually make."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wanted more!","review":"My first meeting with Mr Gaiman has been through an amazing and rather gruesome adults-only rendering of snow white, on audio-CD, read, better, acted wonderfully by a woman with a warm warm voice. This collection of tales is rather different. These are indeed tales for children, but not for all children. The tales are still rather dark, but I bet most young children would enjoy them. All the stories are read by Gaiman himself, and he is a wonderful reader. He plays each character really well. He's possibly better than Martin Jarvis, who is one of the best audio-book performers around.The only problem of this CD is that... it is too short! You will find that a couple of car trips to the office will be enough to reach the end. But it's worth it, and I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good fun","review":"On this collection, Neil Gaiman reads several of his short tales. What a great imagination and vocabulary!

This is simply too good to keep to myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who wrote this?","review":"I am thoroughly disapointed in the money I wasted on this Dean Koontz slap it together knockoff.

You would be bettor off spending your money on something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definition of contrived","review":"I'll never get the hours I spent reading this book back. I regret that. Thankfully, it was a short read.I've enjoyed Deaver's Lincoln Rhyme books - but this one (not a Rhyme story) is, simply, awful. The plot is textbook contrived - I wonder if Deaver wrote it for a bad writing contest, and published as a joke. The characters lack any development, and none are likeable. With one exception, each of the plot twists was predictable. Even the descriptions failed; no one could figure out the inside of the mental hospital (not surprised that the heroine couldn't, either). Major plot items were dropped or simply left unexplained.Save your time & money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and unbelievable","review":"This was my first audiobook by Deaver and it might be my last. While the overall premiss was all right the story just got to be too corny for my liking. give me a break every victim survives? Okay maybe one dies but the return of Megan's boyfrined was beyond fiction. The only character which i cared about in this whole production was Matthews himself and I'd wish he had killed Tate in the end. In my opinion it would have been just. Still, we have to have our predictable endings all tied up in a nice bow. No a complete bore and the RLV (repeat listening Value) of this audiobook is poor. Don't buy it but borrow it or rent it. Not a great thriller I'll stick to James Patterson from now on. Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"SO IT'S NOT HIS BEST...","review":"...even at his most mediocre (which this is NOT, by the way), Deaver can outwrite most of the genre writers out there today. \\"Speaking in Tongues\\" is a fast-paced, suspenseful thriller focusing on Tate Collier and his estranged family. Sure, there are some cliches but they certainly don't underwhelm Mr. Deaver's incredible writing abilities.This book doesn't have the usual trademark plot twists that have abounded in books such as \\"Devil's Teardrop\\" and the Lincoln Rhyme series, but there some sufficient surprises to satisfy the Deaver in all of us.The change in the characterizations of the Collier family is believable, and especially Bett, who turns out to be quite a heroine. The addition of Joshua as Megan's lover is also a nice twist, and the scenes in the abandoned mental hospital are effectively creepy.So chill out and enjoy the chills!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I am soooo disappointed","review":"This is what I would call a \\"it just so happened\\" book.

Does that make me a loser? Anyways, Iv'e never read any of Deaver's books. But i really liked this one. I hear you people ripping on the book because it's not how the author usually writes, and I start to get mad cause I'm gonna defend it right? I liked the book. Well i guess I'd have to be an avid reader of his books to really be dissapointed. Well i know he writes those Lincoln Ryhme novels, yeah...well I'm not much into series' books. And isnt that guy handicapped. No offense, it's probably still interesting. Whatever, i just really liked the book. I guess you just have to enter into the authors works to really be impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time and money.","review":"I am a big Deaver fan and didn't even think twice about buying this book. I will never again do this without reading what my fellow Deaverphiles have to say. It was almost as if someone else wrote it. There was none of the suspense and cunning I have come to expect .You never cared about ANY of the characters. The actions of the \\"Dr\\" were so unbelieveable that the storyline (revenge) became very predictable. Deavers' trademark twist at the end was lame. While everyone can make a mistake, I wonder where the editors' mind was when he/she gave the go ahead for publication."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK I guess!","review":"I thought this book is okay. It's not as great as Bone Collector or Devil's Teardrop. I suggest though, to borrow it from the Library, save your money on this.

Speaking in Tongues is such a book. I cared little for the characters and found the novel second-rate.

I am not crazy about the subject matter when it involves children (even if they are at the teen stage). Should have paid more attention to the info at the back of the book. And I definitely don't need to have obscenities every sentence. My mother always stated that people who swore constantly had nothing of interest to say.

My time on this earth is too short to waste reading this type of material.So I am a prude...Karen Sadler"},{"rating":"1","title":"Below average story.","review":"This book has to be one of the most simplistic of Mr. Deaver's works. He is a top-tier suspense writer, however this book falls well short of his writing abilites, as have been evidenced by his other books. If you are thinking of starting your first Deaver novel, please check another one. The book's action is well described, when it occurs. The actions of the antagonist are beyond belief; they make all the ancillary characters look stupid, and All the characters can't be that stupid. Even the protagonists in this book are problematic; it is hard to make a connection with them, and I almost found myself rooting against them. If Dr. Matthews were a little more plausible, then I might have been pulling for him. As it turns out, Megan is the most sensible character in the book. I do not regret reading this book, however it is not a great one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best - and previously published in 1995","review":"As noted on the copyright page of this book, it was previously published in England in 1995. \\"Gee, I wonder why it was not published here?\\" I thought. Because it is not that good of a book is the answer. It was obviously released to take advantage of his success with \\"Bone Collector\\" and the Rhyme series. This is book is not about Rhyme nor is it nearly as good a read as the books in that series.There are no likeable characters in the book (some would say they are \\"flawed people\\" - but they are just not likeable). So you really don't care much about what happens to them - which in most ways is pretty predictable. There is a small twist in the last part of the book that is a little surprise, but that it about it. I found myself glad that this book was rather short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Boring, Boring,","review":"I thought this book was exceptionally boring and skipped 75% of it.

Luckily I didn't buy the book. I borrowed it, so I decided I'm not going to bother finishing something I'm not enjoying.

Well, I'm a bonified fan now and have since read all the Lincoln Ryhme series books (which are GREAT books!) Although this is not a Lincoln Ryhme series book, this story unfolds and captures the reader within the first 20 pages and continues throughout the end. As always, Deaver's writing style totally capitulates the reader into the story, enticing the reader throughout the book until the end.

Just to make sure I wasnt the only one who had this oppinion, and I had no musicial taste whatsoever, I invited 8 friends over to listen.. The highest rating given was two out of five.. 40%! (which would be a failing mark in a music school exam) To say this album is 'not worth buying' would be an understatement. You'd have to pay me to keep it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero star if possible","review":"To all those people who disagree with the two reviewers who say this singer uses a fake accent! You are wrong they are right. I (in the past) have lived in Ireland and that's what she sounds like. Not Australian. And I know an Australian accent when I hear it. That being said. Apart from her phoney and fake accent, the music isn't good at all. It's too folksy and bland and I don't believe she can be a big force in the United States. She'll never be mainstream. I just don't think she has the skills. Sorry. Boring cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible voice","review":"Doesn't matter what kind of accent it is, that voice is just dreadful. She is like the female Bob Dylan. Can I put a negative star on this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused :-(","review":"I think both I and Missy Higgins are confused. I'm confused as to why if she is Australian, does she sing with a Scottish/Irish accent, and she's confused as to where she comes from if she sings with a Scottish/Irish accent. The music is to folksy and weird for me, but this accent thing is the main reason I can't stand her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Missy is dinkie die true blue","review":"This CD is just awesome..her lyrics are fantastic and her singing voice has a sarcastic edge to it that makes it so Aussie I can't even explain it.I can't believe all this babble about her accent being fake. She is from Melbourne, a city founded primarily by free Settlers, as opposed to Irish Convicts in Sydney and Hobart. The free settlers were often of Scottish (as well as a Irish and a few Scouses) decent which makes the Melbourne accent slightly different to Sydney, its more nasal, like a Kiwi accent is.. So for all you babbling on about how a freakin Aussies sounds (I doubt many of you seppos (Americans) know the word is pronounced Ozzie not Ussie, like Ozzie Osbourne and or how to actually pronounce Melbourne) all the Aussies are saying she is dinkie die true blue mate (and yeah thats means really Australian)..so why not listen to us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bubbles in Glass","review":"I sent the first one back because it had bubbles in the glass.

The wit of Terry Pratchett is timeless and funny, but this book as a whole was missing the full package. Moist starts out in trouble and running from the law. He quickly finds his way to the local post office and in a world that holds letters that are older than he is. These undelivered letters begin to talk to him and he feels the pressure to get the post office back up and running. The clacks are a mechanical method for transmitting messages and have taken over for the post. Moist spends him time chatting up the papers and press to try and get the post office back on top.The characters are lovable and quiet human. The government bureaucracy will ring true regardless of time. The story line however, is not one of Terry's best."},{"rating":"2","title":"even better than the usual Terry book","review":"wow, I am a fan of the dsicworld novels but thought this one really stood out.If you work in industry particularly in America then this us a great read.

I have most of the books in my library.Moist Von Lipwig, is my favorite of all Pratchett's characters. Or, maybe the Golem Parole Officer, or the Ware-wolf Police officer, or the 6'6\\" dwarf, or ape librarian. No, it's Moist.Not always laugh out loud funny. Certainly chuckle out loud. Now I eagerly await for the promised third Moist book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun read!","review":"This was my introduction to Terry Prachett and Ringworld. I think I chose a good place to start. The book moves along nicely and the characters are strong enough to want to follow.

Not by Terry Pratchett, or at least not in my book (or in any of his). This is not my favorite, but it was fun to read and quick. It's true there's nothing as funny in it as sapient pearwood luggage, but the general story is amusing, and I enjoyed the characters.Lord Vetinari sets a scoundrel the task of reopening the Ankh Morpork postal service, and much treachery ensues. Lots of golems in this one. This book is sort of a take-off on corporate corruption, and it's fun to see how Lord Vetinari handles the problem. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a good one to pick up","review":"Moist Van Lipwig, a notorious criminal, finds himself before Lord Vetinari who provides him with a couple of choices: die or become postmaster general. His choice to live sticks him with reviving a post office that has languished for decades. He also inherits a mad old postman and his bumbling apprentice.This is one of those books where delightful madness, lighthearted jokes, and masterful parody swirl into a wonderful tale. Hats off to Mr. Pratchett.The characters are fully developed and possess amusing quirks. I especially liked Lord Vetinari who is a most malevolently benevolent and brilliant despot. I think it helped that I listened to this as an audiobook. The voices of each cast member was excellently done.If you haven't read a Pratchett, this is a good one to pick up. If you have read Pratchett and enjoyed him, this is definitely one you shouldn't miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grupo Batuque - Samba De Futebol","review":"Those Brazilians really love their football -- just listen to the announcers screaming in the interludes of Grupo Batuque's album SAMBA DE FUTEBOL. While the tracks themselves are worthwhile, they are, oddly, not as compelling as the insane football babble. A few standouts here and there: the pleasant female vocals and mid-song tempo increase of \\"E Ruim\\" or the melodic chorus on \\"Soberana.\\" Many of these tracks don't show the technical polish that would be apparent on their later albums. While this gives them an aggressive, raw feel, it also makes them sound like field recordings (the not-quite on pitch vocals of \\"Ole Ola,\\" for example). Many of the tracks lack development, which makes you think of a street party that you'd wish would end so you can get some sleep. The actual field recording interludes don't help, either.

It is 2/3 Sylvia-on-Sylvia and 1/3 \\"audience participation\\".

Pay attention when she makes assertions that the audience member contradicts (\\"No, my father was 6'6\\" and had black hair\\" to Sylvia's seeing a \\"little guy with blond hair\\" etc.) There are very few \\"direct hits\\" among her assertions. Sylvia first tries to backpeddle the assertion to the circumstances provided in response; if that fails, she changes the subject, rather than admitting she was wrong.

It lasted about three months before the top elements - essential for broiling - failed. As others have reported, it takes an age to heat up and is a complete time-waster for toasting. But what can expect for a few bucks?The limited warranty that comes with the item only covers returns to the manufacturer, with shipping both ways being met by the customer. (Amazon may have a different policy.) As this amounts to more than the cost of the toaster oven (the cost of shipping and handling back to the customer is itself $18.95), I'd guess the manufacturer is not expecting many returns.So save your money and look for something more expensive and better made.[Later] In fairness to Bed, Bath and Beyond, I should mention that they took back the toaster oven and refunded my money with very good grace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failure as a Toaster","review":"I bought this to replace a very inexpensive Toastmaster that I thought didn't look nice on the counter.

Unfortunately I waited the 10 minutes and still very little color or toasting. My 10year old black and decker toaster oven is sooo much better than this. I mostly use a toaster oven to reheat pizza but with this machine a hairdryer could have done a better job. And, no my toaster is not defective it does get hot but it takes forever to do so.

So before you call it a bad cable, try removing and reinserting the connectors.The technology is a classic CD4017 design with a 2-transistor multivibrator for the clock instead of the usual 555 timer. Search google images for \\"CD4017 cable tester\\" if you want the circuit diagram.Cold solder joints on the battery connections may be the cause of some of the complaints about this product, as battery wires can easily come loose.

They paid for 8 LEDs on each half of the unit, could it really have been more expensive to just light up the properly wired contacts, and leave some combination off to indicate an error?I understand that this item is cheap, but it need not have been so stupidly designed. This item was instantly donated to an unsuspecting recipient."},{"rating":"1","title":"Up Up Up in a puff of smoke","review":"Looked like a really good deal and I am in the process of a house remodel and wiring. The first chance I had to test this was unfortunately 32 days after I purchased it. I inserted the 9-volt battery and turned it on only to see it light up for a second, pop and then see a puff of smoke. The instructions are in very broken English as if interpreted from Chinese (which the writing on the unit is in Chinese).I have contacted the merchant \\"HDE\\" but have not heard anything back and will update feedback if I do. I received it on time but just wish I had tested the unit sooner and could have returned it under the Amazon policy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work","review":"The product arrived in one piece.

Do not buy, unless you have a weird sense of humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and effective","review":"Sure, it's not built to survive a car driving over it, but if you're just looking for a simple and very inexpensive circuit tester to make sure you got all those teeny wires into the right slots and punched in all the way when wiring up your house for ethernet, this will do the job admirably. Plug a cable end in one half, take the other half to the other location and plug it in, turn it on, and if everything's good the little lights will march down the display in sequence, over and over. To test a jack, just make yourself a short length of cable (test it with the tool first!) to plug between the jack and this tool. The tool even comes with a little storage bag big enough to store that homemade 3-inch cable with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOA - Dead on arrival","review":"Well, maybe not dead, but it does not work. One light blinks and that is all. I tested it with several cables and always got the same one blinking light.

It probably isn't stout enough to stand up to years of abuse by a network technician, but it gets the job done and you can't beat the price. The RJ45 jacks on the tester are not great and don't seem to let go of the cable very easily, but it works fine if you are careful. I would buy it again if it broke, especially for wiring in the walls that would be a pain to troubleshoot otherwise.Just a word of warning, the T568A wiring diagram in the instructions incorrectly labels the white orange wire as a second white green. Make sure you double check the wiring diagram prior to crimping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Perfect...","review":"Works perfect.

While the lights when fron 1 to 8 on the powered part, they went from 8 to 1 on the remote unit. I tested this on several straight through cables that I new were good, and since the behavior was consistant, I decided to deal with it.The 3rd time I turned it on, the powered unit light just burned steady and the test lights no longer lit.Since shipping cost more than the unit, I probably won't return.

This came as a package with something else I purchased and luckily this item wasn't the thing I was really wanting out of the package and have a good one here at the house or I would have been a bit ticked off.This is then cheapest plastic item I've ever held in my hands. I wouldn't suggest anyone buying it. Although I did get two 9 volt batteries out of the deal, but they are pretty cheap too.

Lacking in construction quality - but I didn't expect a Fluke for the price. Biggest gripe is the on/off switch is difficult to operate and feels like that will be the point of failure.

The characters are so real; we have all known an Annie, Nick, Blake, Izzy and Natalie at one time or another. Because of Hannah's impeccable talent,one instantly becomes so absorbed with this story that they are oblivious to the world around them. She creates an intriguing, comfortable blend of romance, death and alcoholism; a difficult combination to merge into a thought-provoking, compelling story. Unable to set the book down, I was quite saddened when I finished it because it was over."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVED this book!","review":"I enjoyed On Mystic Lake so much that I'm rereading Part Two.

If you read a lot its kinda the \\"same old thing\\" -- woman loves man, man leaves woman, woman finds another man with a child to nurture. This is the first Hannah book that I've read so I'll give her the benefit of the doubt that she can come up with an original story line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor character development, bad dialogue","review":"I bought this book based on the glowing reviews here. Big mistake. This book has an interesting premise and plotline. However, it is near fatally flawed by stilted, unrealistic dialogue (the male protagonist, especially, spouts dialogue that sounds like a teenage female's fantasy of what a man should say -- not even the most sensitive Alan Alda type would say this stuff) and poorly developed characters. Maybe Hanna has improved through the years (I don't know and won't find out, as I won't buy another of her books), but this book is NOT good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could not put it down","review":"What a page turner.

It is enjoyable to find a MODERN romance that is great to read instead of just the historical romances.

It was very realistic and the characters were totally relatable. Don't pass this one up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Unoriginal","review":"Having seen the reviews of this book, I was hoping for a great read. Instead, this book is an amalgam of every single romance I've ever read. It's completely unoriginal and predictable. I've read so many stories of women \\"going home again\\" after a setback, the wounded man/child, the town filled with stores with too cute names, the friends/sidekicks who are cariacatures instead of characters.The heroine goes home, meets up with her long lost love, heals his emotionally damaged child (what a surprise!) and \\"finds\\" herself. What a joke, the woman leaves LA only to find herself in the same role she held before, wife and mother. Oh, except in this book, she wants to open a bookstore.This book was a cliche from beginning to end. I won't buy another book by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO MANY ADJECTIVES!","review":"I have always loved Kristin Hannah's novels but this was simplistic, predictable, and the characters had no depth.

The dialog was so predictable and incredibly boring. The characters were really not well developed. We got a perspective from each point of view yet, the whole story seemed incredibly flat.

Those same husbands did the same as hers did in the the book. .All the characters in this book were richly drawn' their weaknesses,their strenghths, their ability to fight their way out of their misery so admirable. I was moved to tears many times. Surprisingly, even the husband, whom I loathed in the beginning for being the selfish rat he was, made a tear fall when he came to realize he was never going to change and had the courage not to hold on to Anna anymore. Every woman over the age of forty or who have been married a long time, should read this book.

Life is tough, disappointing, sad, maddening. Maybe a small child could be excused for her tears but relying on tears page after page to relay the characters' feelings is a cheap gimmick.

Gurney was a master of the song setting but this release does not do his splendid contributions to song literature justice. It is too similar in tone throughout and lacks the sparkle, color and intensity that other interpreters draw from Gurney's music. More disappointing and disturbing than the recording, however, are Michael Hurd's program notes in which he feels it necessary to repeat the irresponsible suggestion the Gurney suffered from syphilis. This information was presented to the public in 2000 without being carefully researched or documented and has, unfortunately, found its way into print too often as an explanation of Gurney's mental illness. Gurney did not suffer from syphilis or shell shock or paranoid schizophrenia.

Why sell a camera that you can no longer buy film for?! It came from Adobe Camera and when I called them to get a RMA#, they asked why I was returning it. When I told them - no response - but I did get my money back for the camera and the extra film I purchased.

The brush is easy to hold, and has a bit of a fan shape to it.The only thing that I can say is bad about this brush is it's huge size but at the same time that's what i like about it .

Three cheers for brevity!Anicius Boethius (480 to 524) wrote \\"The Consolation of Philosophy\\" long ago while he was awaiting his execution. Boethius covered all the key points in Myers' book long ago and was more eloquent. Myers' does not really give you a guide book for living a happy life. He says, \\"The essence of happiness is pausing to savor the gift of our present moments.\\" There is so much more to living a happy, fulfilling life than that.

Very thought-provoking as to what lies as the roots of our faith."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sheds light into dark places","review":"Bart Ehrman in this work shows the intricacies of scripture and how early Christian sects viewed their God. Ehrman sheds light on many little known texts of early Christianity such as the Gospel of Thomas, and the secret Gospel of Mark as well as many, many others. He allows the reader to view not only the ancient texts in some context but allows us to get a glimpse at what Christianity might have been like if these books, and others had been accepted as scripture.Ehrman takes on his subject as all of his others with great attention to detail; daring to shed light into those dark corridors of ancient myths and rituals. Ehrman helps his readers see the deceptions that shaped the Christianity of today. An excellent introduction for those interested in early Christian teachings and the development of the canonical works."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wealth of meticulous research to reveal long-hidden perspectives of faith and worship","review":"Lost Christianities: The Battles For Scripture And The Faiths We Never Knew takes one step further to explore early forms of Christianity and how they came to be suppressed, reformed or forgotten - even though each variant insisted upon upholding the teachings of Jesus and his apostles, and even though each possessed writings that supported their claims, books allegedly written by Jesus' followers. Together, both volumes draw upon a wealth of meticulous research to reveal long-hidden perspectives of faith and worship; and both are serious-minded theological studies quite accessible to lay readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing as with most of Ehrman's popular work","review":"It's hard to say whether I actually liked this book or not. I will say that it was exactly what I expected from Dr. Ehrman, being familiar with his writing. As always, his facts are flawless, his conclusions and hypemanship are worthless. He's a great read on early Christianity if you can skim past the hype and BS and get to the meat. I'd love to see him write an unbiased, nonjudgmental, truly scholarly work. I haven't seen one from him yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best history of early Christianity that I've seen","review":"As a Christian Yogi, I rather prefer this meaty and scholarly book to Pagel's books on similar themes. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another What-If Book","review":"Since Elaine Pagels' Gnostic Gospels there has been a steady stream of books written on the subject of lost options in Christianity. This is a particularly bad example of that genre because it misrepresents the substance and nature of almost every heresy and threat it proposes to assess. Especially weak is Ehrman's treatment of Marcionism which he fundamentally misunderstands and seems to know only from the dated studies of Knox and Harnack. His idea that Marcion's view of God was too \\"new\\" for the church to accept is based on a howling anachronism in the dating of Marcion's heresy. In fact there is plenty to suggest that Marcion's solitary gospel and limited collection of Paul's letters corresponded to (and resonated with) the most ancient inclinations of Christian theology. In short, not only yet another case of popularization but a bad job of reading the evidence as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Errors, and no new information.","review":"I have to say that I look forward to getting this book (edit: at the time I wrote this review, I had gotten this book from the library, before deciding to buy it), even though it is not anywhere close to perfect. While he makes a few legitimate claims about NT texts, many if not all of the other claims have either been debunked or have been solved. He does make errors, though. When one checks what what Ehrman says against a Bible verse, he tends to pull the verse out of context, or he is using a version that I have never heard of. It is a good read, and some of the information in this work I had not previously known. I was more interested in the Gnostics, and I was disappointed at what little he wrote about them. But it was pretty good overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new here","review":"I've taken classes on early church history and textual criticism from Christian perspectives so I thought I'd get this book to \\"see the other side.\\" I don't recall reading anything in this book that did not provide the exact same data that I have already learned. Often some of the issues of his position were withheld until after a great deal of \\"imagining if\\" had been done but hey, everybody does that to push their party line and he did, in fact, tell us about the issues in the end.Overall, if you know about the conversations over \\"lost christianities\\" then this book will not add anything. If you do not know the discussion, this book (see its subtitle) is self-awaredly fighting one side of the battle (doing so at times, unfairly (ie providing pertinent information after drawing the reader to the author's conclusions))."},{"rating":"1","title":"holy smokes what a horrid book","review":"Ehrman's a really bright guy, but this is just plain bad scholarship. He's so concerned with showing any sort of Christianity to be irrational, he completely loses himself. Ehrman underqualifies nearly all of his positive claims, and when he summarizes views that contradict his, those views clearly obliterate any chance of his working at all. Take, for example, his discussion of \\"secret Mark\\". He really, really wants there to be a secret Mark, but he's a good enough scholar to present other's viewpoints. Even after presenting all the multi-faceted evidence that it was completely forged, he still just plain wants to think there was such a thing. This book reads much like the Da Vinci Code: really entertaining narrative, but pure fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tread carefully","review":"I'm glad I put this book down.

He's a single woman's worst nightmare (dishonest about feelings, unable to commit), both the father and son you don't want. But he's all too human when making his whopping mistakes. The characters are so real you feel you've known them forever. Wish author Bausch would give us Henry, Part 2, so I can both spend more time with him and see if he's learned anything about life.

After the first few pages, I was involved in Henry Porter's life and the complex, but very real, relationships he had with his family, fiance and daughter.

Please, a teacher who bets at the racetrack and won't marry the woman that he gets pregnant! I had no empathy or sympathy for him. He was totally uninterested in his daughter also, and I just found him so unbelievable I didn't want to waste my time when I had so many other books to read. I'm surprised at all the glowing reviews.

Preparing literature studies is extremely time intensive and I am working from ground zero this year in a non-public school setting.

I am also able to insert my own personal material into the Litplan material if we have covered some aspect not addressed in the Litplans. The material is extremely thorougb ans set up in such a way that it may be modified with every subsequent presentation.I have even visited the website for this product and purchased more plans.

However the fictional account of 2 pastors (one new one, and a veteran pastor called 'Bob') grated on me after the first few pages. It comes over as somewhat self congratulatory in much the same way the scripted TV advertizements singing praises of a particular product do.McIntosh has tackled a tough topic and injected guidelines and a few thoroughly useful rules of thumb that have definitely improved my approach to \\"doing church\\". I just wish that he'd gone for a more savoury dish rather than the rich syrupy sugar glaze that this one has."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"Found the book to be statistical and fact based but lacking completely in spiritual base.

Even Darwin emphasized the role of \\"the Creator\\" in evolution, e.g. in guiding the evolution of the eye. Secondly, evolution through inheritance of acquired characteristics has been proved. Watson makes out that it is a failed theory. Thirdly, Watson seems to have a view of genetic engineering that reminds me of the H.G. Wells novel, The Island of Dr. Moreau. He says that absolute courage will be needed to perform human experiments, following experiments on monkeys and chimps. Fourthly, he downplays the role of Rosalind Franklin in the discovery of the double helix. Fifthly, there is of course no evidence for macro-evolution. Evolution through inheritance of acquired characteristics only occurs within a species; there are no common ancestors.

You'll never watch \\"The Little Mermaid\\" in quite the same way again.This is more of a philosophical treatment than anything else. There isn't extensive hard history here; they're writeups of lectures, not papers, though sources are cited. Consider these ruminations on fairy tales and their relevance to modern culture -- how they are treated, how they are disseminated, how they've changed in the past couple hundred years.

For a supposedly realistic storyline about enabling, Ashley Judd's character was so overdone that the whole story couldn't be believed. I too did not understand why Ashley Judd had to be nude half the time. It came across as grasping to keep interest in the movie. It wasn't sensuous or enticing, so the viewer couldn't sympathize with/understand Luke Perry's character, and thus the whole meaning of the story was lost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch this for a laugh","review":"This film was completely off target.

To not have any speaking for the first part of the movie, the Actors did a great job at getting the point across.

I felt that this book didn't cohesively address ANY of the issues of manhood. Some of the essays were genuinely touching, but most of the ones I really liked didn't illuminate manhood but personhood. Breathnach's introductions and comments were by far the worst parts. They framed the simple musings of the essays awkwardly, imposing structure and themes where they didn't belong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe it just wasn't what I was looking for","review":"If you visit Ms. Breathnac's site, you will find helpful advice for meditating and a new outlook on incidents in your life. The book did not offer that, though it proposed to. Her charity work is tremendous and the woman seems to have an endless amount of love and energy. The book seemed more like Chicken Soup for the Soul with a test at the end than anything that offered daily guidance and affirmations. But like I said, maybe it just wasn't for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Woman who loves Men in Abundance?","review":"Contributors to this fine anthology of male authors would be far better served without the unnecessary and cloying tailpieces tacked onto their work by Author-Publisher Sarah Ban Breathnach.

The synth sound of the album pushes the atmosphere into a passionate energy, and songs like \\"Best of times\\" and \\"One good woman\\" show Cetera at his vocal, and songwriting best. Cetera himself, has moved into more laid-back, easy listening adult rock, in recent years. Maybe he should get together with Patrick Leonard once more, because this was Peter's best work! If you like Peter Cetera, you must have this. Excellent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One Good Woman","review":"I don't know what to say about this CD, other than that it is pure awesome. When I was growing up, my mother loved Peter Cetera, and so we listened to him quite regularly.

She mixes, writes, produces, sings, and plays a barage of instruments on this disc as well as her earlier, equally delightful efforts, *Pet* and *You Win The Bride.* If you love finely crafted pop that's spit-and-polish without being antisceptic, get this. You can't go wrong. I've read at least one review that likened Ms. Ryan to Marshall Crenshaw's lost twin sister, and it's a fair parallel. Her songs are laden with hooks, a heartfelt delivery and a certain modest retro charm. (Check out her cover of \\"Stuck In The Middle With You\\" on *You Win The Bride*.) The fact that she's not a household name just proves that there's no justice in showbiz, or perhaps that she should've picked a less Hanna-Barbera-esque name for her group. No matter. \\"Orange\\" and \\"Any More Words\\" are just two of the must-haves on this no frills knockout.

At the time most of these songs were released, the clash and the sex pistols were playing real punk rock and luaghing at this amateur group that sounds like pop. this band only sings about teenie subjects and never has controversial lyrics (kkk took the babby away? come on fellas). joey ramone doesn't sing like a punker to me, sounds more like bill haley (the dude that sings \\"rock around the clock\\"). well while you buffoons are listening to this corporate garbage, intelligent punkers are currently ordering copies of london calling and never mind the bollocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Intro","review":"The Ramones are one of the most important rock bands ever.

You get 30 songs on one disc. If you are already a fan of the Ramones, this is another gem to add to your collection. If you are tired of the music that is being played today (boy bands and Britney Spears), then go out and get this CD. It is a breath of fresh air. The songs are short and brutal and their is no BS in their music. How can you not love songs with titles such as: BEAT ON THE BRAT, I WANNA BE SEDATED, THE KKK TOOK MY BABY AWAY, SHEENA IS A PUNK ROCKER, PSYCHO THERAPY, SOMEBODY PUT SOMETHING IN MY DRINK. The RAMONES showed that all you need is 3 chords, and an attitude and you can rock. So go out buy this album and be ready to rock.

Some songs are more on the mellow side like \\"I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend\\" and \\"Needles & Pins\\" while others like \\"Somebody Put Something in My Drink\\" just plain rocks. Get this and Ramones Greatest Hits Live (which has their kicking cover of \\"Spiderman\\" and the song \\"Pet Cemetary\\").

If you're looking for serious political content, look elsewhere. If you like fast, energetic, melodic rock music that doesn't take itself too seriously, then this is a good cd to listen to. Everything doesn't have to to have serious political content or complex instrumentation to be enjoyable. These things are both good in moderation, but those aren't the only things that make good music. I wouldn't neccesarily see myself buying any actual real Ramones albums, because they sort of seem to be a bit of a make one album over and over again kind of band, but I really enjoy this cd. I don't like absolutely every song on this album, but then again, there's 30 tracks on it, so there have to be some that aren't as good as others..."},{"rating":"2","title":"good clean fun","review":"Well OK, maybe not always so clean. Nothing brilliant or transcendent here, just some stripped down bare-bones rock n' roll. The Ramones will carry the punk tag till they're all dead and buried, but honestly, this is more like 50's pop than the furious and urgent British punk rock that rode on the Ramones' coattails. Just some great toe-tapping, head-bopping rock tunes about suburban boredom and apathy with that great Ramones twisted humor. I wanna be sedated indeed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A garage band that has been around the block","review":"The Ramones have been able to keep the raw sound of a garage band, the pace of a punk band and the tenacity of a pop icon for enough years and albums to be considered serious artists.

You're a zombie or have had a lobotomy. one, two, three, four...."},{"rating":"2","title":"They want the airwaves, baby!","review":"Incredible, high-spirited compilation from punk-rock gods The Ramones which naturally won't please everyone(I missed \\"I Want You Around\\" and a few other omissions)but it does have several terrific songs that non-Ramones addicts wouldn't normally hear(like \\"Bonzo Goes to Bitburg\\", a disparaging of Reaganomics that ranks as a Ramones Masterpiece). \\"I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend\\" is an awesome ballad(they didn't do many, but when they did it was usually right-on), the covers of \\"Indian Giver\\" and \\"Needles & Pins\\" are fantastic, as is the Phil Spector-produced \\"Do You Remember Rock 'N' Roll Radio?\\" and the amusing \\"The KKK Took My Baby Away\\".

It started having intermittant problems about 1 year ago. The switch would seem to be functionign normally, but it would shutdown individual ports, or the enter network. Unplugging the switch and allowing a hard re-boot usually solved the problem. However, recently the hang has been happening more frequently. Over the past couple of weeks, it hangs up almost every day. WHen it does so, not even the web-based management tool will connect, even though the computer that I am using has network access. Once again, my client tells me tht they unplug the switch and after re-inserting the plug and power-up, the switch returns connectivity to the network. I will be serching for a replacement. My recommendation is to stay away from this switch."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Switch","review":"I needed to buy a switch to put in a server rack, and for what I was doing I didn't need a managed one. This one is very good for the price range. I looked at the D-Link DGS-1024D, but was concerned about the green nature of the device, if somehow I would have issues (every review was good but a few made me go elsewhere). One issue I had was the holes on the rack mounting brackets didn't line up well, but was easily resolved with a dremel. The main reason I bought this switch was to replace a bad Netgear GS116 that couldn't be mounted, and was completely full. I should have purchased two so I can replace the switch in the other rack, but I decided to wait for a couple of months to see how this one worked out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good writing is good writing.","review":"newspaper writing, I think, often gets a bad rap, if it manages to get any rap at all.

I knew I should have stopped reading but all the reviews had said what a good writer this author was. I stuck with it and now regret doing so. This is a very simple book with a lot of things that need to happen in a cetain way and of course they do. The characters seem to be living in the 1930's even though this takes place in current time. They all are naive people. This is my second book by this author and I will not make the mistake of reading a third book! You shouldn't either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seven steps too many.","review":"This book started out as an interesting study in two very different person's obsessions.

It was supposed to take place in current time but you would never know it by how some of the characters spoke. The plot was laughable the ending was just plain stupid. This book was aggravating to read, my husband had to hear me constantly yell, \`oh, you've got to be kidding me with this crap'.I'm not big into fiction, I get more out of a story that I know actually happened however if you want a good suspense fiction book try \`Tell No One' and at least get your moneys worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to believe this is by Ruth Rendell","review":"I've enjoyed Ruth Rendell's books through the years but was shocked by this one. The plot was ridiculous and implausible. Although Mix would have had to paint his wall after the murder it is never referred to again. Why Neressa would allow Mix into here home simply didn't wring true regardless of Ms. Rendell's justification. I also didn't understand why the police were in the back garden and the old lady allowed Mix to leave for his sister's house. And the Iraqui was out of left field and bizarre.

From the start of the book, Mix Cellini becomes a fascinating, but frightening, character and you are drawn along into his chilling obsesssions, fearing for what is going to happen .... and Ms Rendell never disappoints her readers. As a child in England during the time of the Reggie Christie murders, I well remember everyone talking about them - and it is fascinating to read how Christie now becomes all important to Mix. There is noone who writes such beautiful prose, I am always in awe of the sheer brilliance in the execution of her novels.

If you are realistic and expect to be able to listen to your Zune in your car with decent sound quality, then you are buying the right product.I give this 5 stars because the price is way more than reasonable and it does what it is supposed to do. I had an Ipod and their car pack was ten times the price of the Zune's.Buy this if you are trying to listen to your Zune in your car, because even if you don't like it you paid the price of a happy meal for it, so quit crying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Friggin Button","review":"I got this item for my zune thinking \\"hey, this is really cheap now\\" When I got it, it was shiny, pretty, and looked like it would be worth it. I plugged it in, and the audio was not great, but better than nothing. Then I found out that for some reason, any time I go near a semi or street lights, the sound nearly drops out completely. Then as I was unplugging it to take inside, one of the buttons that is set on the side of the car charging part came out and immediately disappeared. So now the fm transmitter may as well be glued to the adapter. All I can say is that if that had stuck to my Zune like that, I would have requested a refund for the kit and a new Zune. This happened within a week of receiving the item, and when I picked it up to unhook everything, the aforementioned button just fell out, without warning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zune car pack","review":"I can not get a station to tune in on my zune.

I could have bought a pack of smokes and got more satisfaction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Audio Quality","review":"I received the Zune as a promotional gift and I have been very happy with it, however this FM transmitter that I purchased for it is terrible.It's primary function is to deliver radio signal via FM to your car stero on an unused frequency, it does have an auto seek to find an available frequency which is nice but it never delivers enough signal for my stereo to pick up decent sound.I am not expecting CD quality audio here, but it should deliver FM Broadcast quality audio at the least. In this case it isn't even close to AM broadcast quailty which is just silly. I tried putting the device in every part of my car with no real difference. I also tried every single frequency on the dial.I know this isn't a problem with my car stereo because my personal satellite radio (Pioneer Inno) has a built in FM transmitter that works perfectly well.Good Luck! Hope this helps you make your decision."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of Increased Traffic Accidents!","review":"The FM transmitter has about a 1 foot range (give or take a few inches) and static is the norm. To get a clear signal, you actually have to hold up the Zune in the air while you're driving, and even then your car might not pick it up. The charger also has a coiled cord, which means you have to fight against the cord's tension while you're holding up your Zune in order to try and get a clear signal while driving (see my point?). Another problem with the coiled cord: if you place the Zune anywhere in the car, the cord acts a slingshot to drag the Zune towards the charger, so forget placing your Zune on the passenger seat, or even the dashboard.On a positive note, the charger actually charges and the FM tuner has a very clear display. If that's worth the 80 bucks, then buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I give less than one star?","review":"Got this with my Zune for Christmas and I was so horribly disappointed! The FM transmitter just flat out doesn't work, and when it does it sounds like an old recording made from your 1980's tape recorder that you held up to the radio to record a song. For you young'uns, imagine constant static louder than your song. I have a 2004 VW Touareg and I have finally found the ONE place in my car where I get decent enough reception to listen but someone has to hold it there while I drive. The car charger seems to interfere with my reception because when I yanked it out in a fit of anger my reception was much better. DON'T buy this. Wait until better technology comes along or you can afford a car to go with your Zune! ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought, returned and bought...","review":"I went to Walmart, bought this product, I didnt realize that the box was opened already...

The car charger works fine, but the FM tuner is awful. When a suitable frequency is found, the sound quality is fair at best and full of static or choppy at its worst.

This accessory however is a piece of junk!I bought the Zune car package earlier this year, while on the road, because I forgot my Zune charging cable. This package comes with a charger and FM transitter in one unit. Great idea I thought. Read the rest of the reviews on Amazon, I had the same story. I found an unused channel on the FM and tried to listen. Waves of static, bad sound,, crackling noises. Doesn't matter what frequency I choose or what city I'm in, this transmitter is _worthless_.

I love the Zune, I regret the FM transmiter. First, I have to take my Zune out of my leather holder so I can plug in the transmitter. The plug never really feels that secure to begin with. Second, the best audio I can get still contains about 50% static. The quality of the sound/signal seems to be dependant on the orientation of the transmitter, and I don't exactly have a lot of options as to where I can place it in my car. I take long road trips (up to 5-6 hours) almost daily for my job. I was hoping to use my Zune as my own personal radio station. Having to find a new station to tune ever 2 hours or so is very annoying and a bigger pain the trying to dial my cell phone while driving. I've given up and just use the headphones, with the car adapter plugged in for power.I highly recommend find a transmitter with a stronger signal output."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dislike greatly","review":"This product was not what i thought it would be.

Don't get me wrong, the car charger part of the kit is great, but the modulator for radio frequency is horrible. It provides substandard sound, no matter what format you have your audio in.

Hope this helps someone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"RADIO RECEPTION FUZZY AND SPOTTY","review":"I used the transmitter for a while but after about 6 mos I bought a new one because 1) I lost the little transmitter that plugged in to the bottom of my zune, and 2) because it didn't work that well anyway. I bought one where the cord that was instered in the earpiece area actually contained the transmitter and eliminated the little piece which was lost and found several times on vacations and what not. With this model I'm reviewing, I was constantly having to stop and navigate through the radio and then through the transmitter to find a station that would work and be less fuzzy. It was horrible for highway driving and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely Works","review":"Well I guess this thing works, it will transmit audio through your car speakers but it is always full of static, even when I'm in the middle of nowhere. The auto-seek does not work, it will just move the station 2 clicks up at a time, definitely not a true auto-seek. You don't notice as much how choppy it sounds with music, but you will really notice it with podcasts or audiobooks; it sounds like the if you go to a clear radio station and go one click up or down so it sounds distorted. It's not so terrible that I'll throw it out the window, but it's sitting right on that edge of total garbage and kind of works. I use it in two different vehicles with the same results."},{"rating":"1","title":"useless....all i got was static","review":"did not work for me...i got a bunch of static playing over the radio...this product was useless and does not do what it claims to do........."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works As Expected","review":"It's a FM transmitter, with the occasional static issues.

I have two 12\\" subwoofers in my car and they didn't even work when I had my zune plugged in. So therefore the bass was crappy too.

I can say that when it works (about 60% of the time), it delivers great sounding broadcast. But that does not come without doing some constant tuning, i.e. moving your Zune around for \\"hot spots\\" or tuning to other frequencies for better signals.Of course if you go on a roadtrip, you will definitely need to keep scanning for available frequencies as radio signals from different counties interferes with the broadcast. I am looking into the CarPlay transmitter by Monster as a possible alternative. Great music player, disappointing accessory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use, and worth the money","review":"I bought this item with a little bit of skepticism because other FM transmitters have usually failed to gain my support for quality of sound. This device has however impressed me, more than I believed it would. The sound quality is excellent for radio play, and the use of the auto seek feature can be helpful while driving. However, the downside to the device is that in order to use it well, almost no cases that I have tried will fit the device without it constantly coming out, also it is very important to find a \\"sweet spot\\" somewhere in the car to get the best transmission possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a mess","review":"First off, this is going to be pretty much like everyone elses, we find the same results because the product sucks the same. The car charger works fine, no problems with it other than the cord being a bit short, it has the twisty thing but it doesn't like to stay at length for long. The transmitter looks nice with the zune and thats about it. The autoseek doesn't work at all, and even when you find a signal on a station with zero strength there is still mild static. It takes a long time to scroll because if you hold it down the auto seek goes on, so you have to click one by one. If you are in a desperate situation and the car you are using happens to not have a tape deck for an adapter, this is better than nothing... but not by much. Especially since it costs 80$, you would hope, and its from microsoft, that they would've tested it to see that it works. I don't understand how they could sell such a horrible product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zune Transmitters that will ruin your life","review":"Do not buy, do not install, do not attempt to use.This product is vastly flawed and does not perform as advertised. I implore you to learn from my mistakes, do not purchase this item.

When I first received it, I could not find a station it would play clearly on, so thinking it was defective, I returned it for a replacement.

What a mistake. Not even 5 minutes after I bought this was I back in the store to return this crap. First off, the auto seek feature is completely worthless. It couldn't tell the difference between good and bad channels. After using it manually, I was able to find some decent stations, but there was ALWAYS mild to sever static. The only way I was able to get some decent sound was if I held it in one place.The charger works fine, but the transmitter is a paperweight. For $86 bucks (bought at CompUSA w/tax) I excepted something decent. Save your money for something else, because this isn't worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superior player, Inferior accessories","review":"I have little to no problems with the car charger at all. Keeps my Zune charged fine. I bought this primarily for the FM transmitter. It is very temperamental. If I set it on my dashboard where it has a line of sight to my antenna it's ok. But take a turn and the whole unit goes flying. I put it somewhere where there isn't line of sight to the antenna, and the reception dies off or is non existent. I can't wait till they have the hardwire for my Zune to wire it into the car like iPods do. When that happens this kit goes in the trash the next day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice execution, but very poor range. There's hope though...","review":"I've purchased a number of FM transmitters and they all suffer from pretty low transmission range and clarity. The Zune Car Pack is no exception. I purchased this having already seen reports of low power. Boy were they right - it only sounded clear when it was literally within a foot or two of the radio. Any farther than that and the quality was horrible.Otherwise the device is slick. The transmitter has a nice interface and doesn't impact battery life in a noticeable way.I would have given it 5 stars if the FM range wasn't so pathetic.Now the good news. There's a hack out there that you can do that will increase the range at least 10 fold. It takes a bit of soldering and the point is pretty small, but the payoff is huge.

Two, the charger has to be plugged into too to get a very clear signal - totally [..] for me. Three - the sound quality just isnt that good. I don't aspect CD quality like someone said, but to be that close to your antenna and have it sound muffle is crazy.

If you are taking stills with a fairly light camera this thing works pretty good. If your expecting to make a smooth pan you are kidding yourself with this thing. Have a Nikon D90 with a 70-300mm lens that I've put on this to take shots. It will hold it and that's a pretty heavy combo, but did it to see if it could handle it and certainly wouldn't leave it on there overnight. It is easy to extend the legs on this thing and feels pretty sturdy when fully extended. Good tripod for a beginner shooting stills with not a lot of positioning to be done.

He has excellent advice and his summary and comparison are excellent. Right on.I give this tripod one more star because I am tall and this tripod was (and is) a good height. However, at root, this tripod cost me about $600 when it toppled over under a fairly slight gust of wind. It is not substantial. If you are going to use it, carry something to weight it down using the included hook. It moved just enough (in investigating what happened) to have one of the legs dip into a depression and down she went, as I was turning to get another lens for a very early morning sun rise. Camera was effectively ruined.A further criticism though not substantial, is that the handles, gear and locking nuts are flimsy. They work OK for ordinary use but don't expect this tripod to stand up for the long haul.

I have seen the same tripod exaclty, in circuit city under a different name for $29, with no need to pay for shipping. This is by far the worst product I have ever purchased, and they are falsly claiming to have sold this flimsy thing for $69, which is impossible.

You'll see the camera doesn't stay level as you turn it around. I've got an old cheap tripod that I compared these to, and it is steady all the way around.It appears they weren't very careful attaching the head to the shaft straight. Hopefully I can fix it.

When I received tripod I was very excited and used it for few times before we went to Grand Canyon. And then my disappointment has started.A tripod got loose after few uses, you can't screw tight the head of the tripod, so if you are using heavier camera this can be real worry. The worst thing is that the top of the tripod can't be locked once you set the target. It always moves few millimiters. If you are shooting details this is unacceptable. Another thing: it's very difficult to follow up subject without unscrewing all bolts which makes whole head of the tripod loose and until you put everything together your great pictures is gone.If you are occasional photographer and you need tripod only for Xmas to take a family picture this is a great deal for you.

Come to find out, this model does not have a fluid head, meaning, if you do any panning with a camcorder, it won't be as smooth as you'd probably like it to be. Also, at the end of a pan the head tends to \\"unwind,\\" causing your panned image to back up a little ways. Thus, I think it's rather misleading to label this as a \\"Photo / Video\\" tripod.Additionally, I don't really care for the cheap feel of some of the plastic knobs and adjusters. Finally, mine came with a few, very minor cosmetic blemishes, almost as if it were used.Instead of video, I'll be utilizing this one as a microphone mount.If you want to do video, please buy a tripod with a fluid head.

Did I mention it weighs a ton? Also the bag it comes in is useless, zipper tab bent then broke off on the first pull so hope you have a golf bag to put this thing in, and a golf cart to carry it.

I haven't noticed any wobble from the legs, and this part of the tripod could be made even more steady by hanging some weights from the tripod's hook.

We only have Mohr's notation that he wrote it in 1816. There is nothing to indicate that it was \\"written on the spur of the moment.\\" At that time he was assigned to a pilgrim church in Mariapfarr, Austria.The music was added by Franz Xaver Gruber on Christmas Eve in 1818. The first performance was in St. Nicholas Church in Oberndorf, Austria with Gruber and Mohr singing each verse while Mohr played his guitar. The choir repeated the last two lines of each verse.While the book has beautiful illustrations, it's best not to present wrong information to children when it involves a real event."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it!!!","review":"This is the best dance cd ever!!!!

Listen to this CD through headphones and you'll notice it much more at certain points. While it isn't the worst thing and it sounds like effort was made to clean up the sound quality, it makes me hesitant to buy another volume of this series.

I am a huge Hed Kandi fan (they've saved my life musically). But I have to be frank, this really, really, really is an awful compilation. Out of the 24 tracks on this double CD compilation I only enjoyed 3 songs. Those are \\"Respect\\" by Adeva, \\"Passion of your passion \\" by Gat Decor and \\"Whatcha Gonna Do with my Lovin\\" by Inner City. The rest of the songs are simply R&B tracks from the late 80's early 90's (a period I loathed). Hed Kandi is a great lable but they have so much better compilations out there.

She is a perfect size to fit on most breyers!Cons: Her hair ribbions fell out a couple of days after i bought her, and they are really small and hard to get back on. She Does have a really creepy face, with weird fake looking freackles. The end of her pants are starting to frey, and her boots are really hard to get off. The Worst thing though is about 2 months after i bought her, i was trying to put her on a traditional breyer(She is better for a classic sized horse) Her right leg fell off. I couldnt snap it back because some of the plastic holding it on broke too. I Wish i bought some other breyer doll.If You do buy her BE CAREFUL when putting her on a breyer and taking off her boots.

I had just broken off a \\"relationship\\" and had many questions about why two people date in the first place. This book shed new light on how one can view the single time of our lives, not trying to see how many people we can pickup, but how you can see members of the opposite sex as our brothers and sisters in Christ. With this view, we have an attitude placed in our hearts that we should protect one another from impurity and guard against being dishonest with each other. At 26, I certainly am happy I read this book and feel much more confident about God's plan for me in the \\"relationship department.\\" I plan to encourage the youth group at my local church to read, study, and understand Harris's well-written book.

A true desire to seek the Kingdom of God, first, and patiently wait for Him to bring me the desire(s) of my heart.

Get real Joshua--I am so tired of pretentious would-be love counselors trying to push their religious views on America's youth. The basic idea is flawed--\\"Don't date someone unless you view them as a potential life-long mate.\\" This will only cause kids to be afraid to leave their significant others, for fear of arousing God's anger.

These people are looking for the easy road, and they have fell into a mini-cult in my opinion.

Thought it was interesting but didn't think much of it since it was too idealistic and written by a guy who didn't have the credentials and experience to back it up. It was overly simplistic and its one size fits all solution didn't sit well with me. Forward to ten years later to now... I have a girlfriend who I'm crazy about but I can't even kiss her because she wants to wait until our wedding day. Great... our 1st kiss together will be in front of 500 people. Thanks a lot. As if our wedding day wouldn't be stressful and awkward enough. Dating advice from a 21 year old? What other book is he going to write about that he has no experience in. He should have a disclaimer that his intended audience is for kids still in high school. \\"I kissed common sense goodbye.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"I kissed this dating book goodbye","review":"My friend had this book and she let me borrow it right after my boyfriend and I broke up. It did have alot of good points, I will give it that...but it made dating sound like the ultimate sin. I've dated one guy and it's been with the outlook that I could one day marry him. I don't see anything wrong with dating so I believe that the author was pretty much off base. I think we should take his thoughts into consideration but not base our own principals around what he said.

I was pleasantly surprised. If you are afraid to read this book because the title strikes you the wrong way, don't be. Harris is simply saying to kiss the conventional style of dating goodbye. By striving to do this, we come closer to living our lives as God intends. An important point in this book is that we must develop the best relationship possible with God before we are able to develop a meaningful relationship with another person. When we are able to have complete faith in God, then we are able to anything because we know He will take care of us. I am sure not everyone will like this book. But, if you are reading this review, I urge you to at least take a look at it and decide for yourself instead of taking a complete stranger's word on this subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books ever read","review":"This is one of the first Christian living books I read after my dating relationship fell through.

Thank you Mr. Harris!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Parents should read this book too.","review":"This book is a real eye-opener (and heart-opener) for the parents as well as the teens and young adults it is written for. My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is because I felt that the author did not give enough information on the alternatives to dating and good practical suggestions for wholesome and happy pre-dating/engagement. I also felt that it might keep some young adults (I don't mean teens) from being open to whatever God might be calling them to without undue fear.

I Kissed Dating Goodbye, helped me see the other side that many of us do not see when we see that boy and girl, holding hands and looking like the perfect couple as they date one another. The book confirmed what God have been saying to me about how I should look at a my christian Lady friends (whom I call Sisters), as a way by which God will show me what a Godly lady looks like, so that when I am ready for marriage I will be able to easily identify the Bone of my Bone, flesh of my flesh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Naively points out problems, no answers","review":"This book opens up pointing out all the problems associated with dating. Harris's only solution is to quit dating altogether. Apparently he thinks a wife will just fall into his lap and he won't have to worry about dating. After about the third chapter, this book completely disintegrates into a whole lot of silly, \\"what's the point?\\" stories. He does not offer convincing proof that to be a Christian means to never date, and he certainly does a poor job of backing up his beliefs with the Bible. I am a serious Christian and I know that dating is absolutely okay, especially after reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremist and sad","review":"Having just broken up with my girlfriend, I read this book to sort of ease the pain and find a new philosophy on life. Little did I now the extreme ends that Joshua Harris would take. His simple points are great and then he goes too far in his explanations. Stories and examples that are used sound made up or doctered to show his point. He neither has creditionals nor schooling for this sort of writing. Where is the proof scientifically? He sounds like Freud in his unscientific method of reasoning. It scares me how many people have taken this book as next to the Bible in holiness. Expierance is the greatest teacher. I give it to stars for the points and only two stars because of his explanations."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME BOOK!!!","review":"I really enjoy Joshua's honesty and openness. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in relationships."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a wonderful book!","review":"I have NEVER read a book like this.

I would recommend this book to anyone who wants their love life to glorify the Lord. --Melissa Wragge"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't endorse book burning, but I'll make an exception","review":"I'm suprised to see so many positive reviews on this book, because it has got to be the single worst book I have ever had the misfortune to read. The author's approach doesn't work because to go his route means that you must deny yourself the EXPERIENCE of dating. You can't expect to marry the first person you date. Dating gives you an opportunity to learn about the social aspects of life. What you learn from one relationship, you apply to the next. And eventually you will have grown enough to commit to a true relationship.It's so easy to jump onto Harris' hype driven God-Train and mentally fall into line with what he says. But the reality of dating is much different and much more complex in practice than Harris would like you to believe.I advise everyone to avoid reading this holier-than-thou publication. This tripe isn't worth the paper it is printed on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!!","review":"I had trouble with my spiritual life, but Jousha broke the rules and wrote this great novel.

I agree with Mr. Harris that it is not biblical and puts us into the face of temptation, but that is all that he has to say. I did not gain anything from the book except a more solid conviction to court. Joshua did not give any principles or guidelines about courting and leaves his readers with nothing as an answer for the relationship question."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This is the worst book i have ever read. Joshua Harris has problems. How in the world can you suggest to a teenager to stop dating? There is no way to condemn dating by using biblical reasons because first of all THERE WAS NO SUCH THING AS DATING IN THE BIBLICAL DAYS. This book has ruined many relationships and has ruined many peoples chances at dating someone that they like. I met a beautiful girl at my youth church and we went out a couple of times and on one of our dates, she tells me that she had made a vow to God that she wouldnt date anyone until she finds the one that God has sent for her. Then she told me about the book. I personally think she went too far to make vows and I blame it on the book. Josh, you really messed up this time. I tried not to give it any stars, but it wouldnt let me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Legalism by any other name would smell just as bad...","review":"The first thing fans of this book say is \\"I don't believe dating is wrong\\", just as assuredly as an Amway employee begins by saying \\"this is not a pyramid business\\". Personally, I've seen the results of a church that by using guilt and legalism (extra-biblical rules), tried to construct a social norm of not dating until one was financially in a position to marry, and certainly no dating until one was 20. The result was a group of kids that had set up a pattern of denying their emotions, and had no experience base. This was not preparedness for finding and building a lasting relationship. My wife and I dated for 5 years (starting in high school), and we have been married for 6. I'm not saying that's the pattern others should adopt, but merely that it's not impossible or even uncommon for that matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guys beware........","review":"Song of Solomon - yes I Kissed Dating Goodbye - NOThe fact that this book is in so many young ladies' hands is truly scary.

They can be damaging and unhealthy. Unfortunately he uses an attention getting title and a new \\"idea\\" that really doesn't live up to the hype. What is Josh saying?Put off the DTR as long as possible. (the Define The Relationship talk)He DOES advocate dating, he just redefines it a bit so that he can use his snappy title. He DOESN'T have anything new to say.Though he says good things, he's really just pretending to say something different. Read Elizabeth Elliot's Passion and Purity First. Josh isn't worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Relevant for Today","review":"The title of this book intrigued me, but the content disappointed. For singles who are closed-minded, or for latch-key children of fundamentalists, \\"I Kissed Dating Goodbye\\" *might* work as some kind of simplistic roadmap. For thinking and feeling types, the \\"advice\\" in here is useless. I also \\"kissed dating goodbye\\", but found constructive things to do instead and have not missed the meat market since.The author would have done better to focus on actual realistic situations and how to deal with them in a Biblical, but not fundamentalist, context.

You will thoroughly enjoy his wit, charm, and seriousness for God. This book will give you a purpose in your romantic life.

One of which is why my closest male friend didn't believe in dating. While he tried to give an explaination, I didn't completely understand. Now I do!Before I read this book, I knew I wasn't happy with my life. I didn't like being alone and didn't understand how this could be a good thing. Giving my single life purpose by focusing it on God has made me a much happier person.The fact that the book is written by someone my age helps me relate to the message so much more. I have recommended it my friends more than once."},{"rating":"1","title":"He means well, but he's pretty misguided","review":"I read this book a few years ago, backed out of the early stages of a relationship, but shortly after got involved with a girl I've now been with for several years. His book applies to the Christian teenager who likes to jump from relationship to relationship constantly and has no serious intent in ever getting married. He comes across as being incredibly strict, which I found to be unrealistic and unnecessary. If you are finding all your dating relationships to be wastes of time, this may be for you. If not, this book will only needlessly discourage you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chances are you have already kissed dating goodbye.","review":"I think this book confuses dating with casual sex, settling for the wrong person, having a boyfriend for the sake of having a boyfriend, etc. If you are already dating with the intention of marriage and living a life devoted to your family and God, you have already gotten Mr. Harris' point.What I found to be the weakest point in this book was the distinction between dating and courting. Courting is encouraged, but no clear examples were given on how this differs from dating. Overall I don't think this book told me anything I didn't already know. I think Mr. Harris could have used some stronger examples to back up his points, or better yet changed the title to \\"I Kissed Casual Friendships Goodbye.\\"In any case I did finish this book to the end and did not find it boring.

He has ingrained into the heads of Christian teenages that dating is an inherently bad thing, which it is not. I'm currently having problems entering into any relationship because of the type of ideas that Harris promotes. Dating *CAN* be a good thing. It is like many other things in this world--when done according to God's plan, it can be a very good, healthy and growthful thing; but when done poorly, it can be destructive. But dating itself is *not* inherently bad.

I think it's all overrated. Sure, I've been hurt. However, if I guard my heart from everyone, I may miss the person God wants me to be with. I don't think of myself as God's string puppet. God teaches me, and I make choices. If I sit around like a jelly fish for the rest of my life, I don't believe that God will simply throw all the right things into my lap. That's not a Christian walk. That's a vegetative state. In short, since the ratings only went from 1-5...

From what i gathered from it, i was belittled, disturbed,and outright pissed off because of how i felt from its words.. Basically this book states that dating as a young person is wrong and harmful for your health, but i think its the other way around but i guess that joshua(the explayer that got caught) harris had a bad experience while with a girl and ruined it for the rest of us that are attracted to christian women.....sorry that you messed up...i guess you got your way though, congrats she's all yours now"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Book of Lies","review":"I do not believe that Christians should only date Christians, that would be inbreeding!

It only fueled the issues I had with being anti-social. The word \\"courtship\\" grates my nerves like claws on a chalkboard. I come from a homeschool family with VERY conservative Christian roots, and this guy seems to think we should live like it's the 16th century.I am a Christian, and there are a lot of things I agree with: like I don't believe in being careless with your body or your emotions towards people. However, we can have life-giving relationships with people of the opposite sex without going through the awkward ritual of \\"courtship.\\" *shudder* I just think he takes things too far.If you're looking for a good book on this subject, this one has an accurate view of \\"real life\\": Uncensored--Dating, Relationship, and Sex by Jeanne Mayo.

Not Joshua Harris. ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I kissed \\"I Kissed Dating Goodbye\\" goodbye","review":"Josh's premise is that dating among Christians can lead to all sorts of problems and even sexual immorality, therefore we should look for alternatives to dating. While he makes some valid points, ultimately Josh's argument is pretty shallow. The answer is responsible dating, not to give up dating altogether.After all, driving a car can lead to accidents, high expenses, isolation, and even death. Should we stop driving then? No, we should drive carefully.Overall, this is an immature book written by a 20 year old, and I wish he'd waited another 10 years before writing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preach it!","review":"I was able to stomach this book after the second or third read. I still think Harris is much too preachy in this book. I Kissed Dating Goodbye reads like a sermon preached by a not-so-humble preacher.

But, I do not for one second think that dating is bad. You say that by being in a relationship it takes time away from God, well if that is true then you must outlaw friendships as well, anything can take away from God, but that is why we must learn self control, in order to stay focused on him. I do not believe that dating is bad, but sometimes its intentions are. God works through people all the time and sometimes people have pain that they can not bear alone and a GF/BF is just what they need to make it through,,,,this does not mean that they are excluding God, what is means is that God is working through a person to help someone....so get it straight, and stop acting like everything in the world is evil and sinful.....thank you"},{"rating":"1","title":"okay","review":"Dating and courting isn't it all one in the same?

I think Harris is focusing on the dirty side of dating and is overreacting.There are some good points that make sense and I'd reccomend it to preteens and teens but that's about it, its pretty limited for adults to read.I think that there are better books out there for teens to read on dating.

Emphasis on the word \\"RELATIONSHIP.\\" You can't get to heaven on your daddy's Christianity. It has to be a personal relationship. And Joshua Harris has pointed out the single biggest barrier to teens' having that personal relationship: dating. Josh Harris contends that Christians are to treat each other as brothers and sisters. There is no distinction made between how we should treat our brothers and sisters in Christ and how we should treat our flesh-and-blood brothers and sisters. Only when God gives us leave should we pursue any serious relationship. That is the essence of GOD'S WILL- doing what He wants when He wants it. And before any single Christian can pursue a romantic relationship, they must be willing and able to submit to God's will. That's what this book is about.

Boy, was I wrong. This is the best book on \\"dating\\" I have ever read. I only wish I had read this when I was younger. Physically I was \\"pure\\" when I got married, but emotionally, I left parts of myself behind with each relationship. I have read the reviews, especially the negative ones, with interest.

But for those who disagree with him, it is a poorly written book. I am one of the people who disagree. It seems like this book is just based on the author's personal experiences. He wrote this book based on what he felt, saw, and heard. Since he had some bad experiences in his dating relationships, he thinks all the dating relationship is not good.He also says that dating someone distrubs the pure christian life, but I think this opinion is also just based on his thought.

It was an easy book to read, and written fairly well. There are parts that made me think about my relationship. In fact, it was my girlfriend's idea to read this book.The only real downside to this book is that there are a lot of situations that are used, sometimes the situation is the only explination of a point he is trying to make. He also refers to short term relationships very often throughout the book, but he never defines what a short term relationship is.While there were many points in the book I didn't agree with, it was a good book for me (and probably others too) to analyze my relationship and myself.

It's made entirely of cheap plastic and feels like it's going to fall apart in my hands. You'll have to find someone to help you inflate things because you need at least three hands to use the pump since the hose comes apart if you don't hold it together on both ends. Imagine trying to hold the hose together in two places and pump at the same time. Add to that the additional frustration from a poor seal that allows a great deal of air to escape as you pump. I can't claim that the pump doesn't work since I was able to inflate my exercise ball. So if none of what I'm complaining about bothers you, the pump does inflate things and is rather inexpensive.

If you want to avoid the religious rhetoric, check out that version instead. The old version is excellent. I give the new version only two stars because the pervasiveness of born again Christian thinking is a dissapointment and a distraction from the principles that can help anyone (not just Christians) struggling with their weight or body image. I am happy for Judy that she has found her spiritual path, but it is really a shame to alienate people who do not share her beliefs.That said, the concepts of this non-diet lifestyle are excellent. It teaches you to listen to your body and take value judgements out of evaluating food. No food is forbidden, but you commit to eating only when you are truly hungry. As simple as it sounds, it takes tremendous commitment, time and compassion toward yourself to make this change - but if you do you wont regret it!

However, while this revised version does still have the same essential content, it also force feeds you with an overwhealming amount of biblical theology. It's not that biblical quotes are bad because a few might help and inspire. The problem with this edition is that the author goes WAY overboard with far too many irrelevant quotes.

This edition is an uneasy hybrid of religious proselytizing and weight loss advice based on the notion Christianity is the best diet ever. The theory and tips that made Thin Within so useful in its first incarnation are buried under an avalanche of quotes from the Christian Bible, and digging your way through is an exhausting task.

Useful for writers of all genres because within are described poisons found in nature as well as those found in industry, household, and many, many others. Although there isn't quite enough specific information, there are plenty of leads for research, and, after all, the book wasn't designed as a complete reference - it's just very, very useful. Included are a useful glossary of medical terms, and a section of tables further organizing the toxins by symptoms, toxicity, and speed of action. In a word - indispensable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful reference","review":"This is a simple and useful reference book when you need information about poisons and their uses in literature.

Timeless challenges woven within a historial context spin a beautiful and compelling web of contrasts. It was surprising to realize the ancestral history that still lives in the celebrations and rituals we practice in our everyday current culture, and learn their origins. The characters in this book are our neighbors, teachers, gardeners, web designers, bosses, employees, ministers, sisters, fathers and all.

The time-traveling vampires had me so intrigued, as did the back cover, that I jumped enthusiastically into FOREVER AND THE NIGHT. Unfortunately what I found there was trite, nothing new, and downright silly.The heroine Neely is ridiculous, and stupid. The plotline about the bad senator was ludicrous.Aidan is a pathetic protagonist. They fall in love immediately, gak, give me a break. A family of vamps with 2 little eerie girls a la Anne Rice, a warrior angel with such an original name, \\"Nemesis\\" oh lordy my eyes were rolling. Silly.Read the second one, FOR ALL ETERNITY - that was great! Five stars. Or read Christine Feehan's \\"DARK\\" series which draws you into its own reality and legend, you won't be able to stop reading those \\"DARK\\" books. Or find Charlaine Harris's \\"Dead Until Dark\\". Also superb."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVED Forever and the Night!","review":"I loved Forever and the Night.

It had awful, just really really bad dialogue. Poor character development; all the characters felt like cardboard cut-outs with cheesy lines. The whole book felt stiff and uncomfortable, with events moving along without much dimension. Why should we care about any of the characters at all? The author did not provide any cohesive established background, just jumped into a story with improbable, Hollywood B-movie-like characters, actions and circumstances. I've read a few of the author's westerns and did not expect her paranormal to be so bad. Unfortunately, it was. I will not be trying another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta Read It!!!","review":"I, originally, read this book approx 20 years ago. I've attempted to locate the entire series, after losing my copies, with success, finally, on Amazon. I would recommend this book, and the entire series, to anyone who enjoys any type of romance.

I am so used to reading books that are non stop from beginning to end, and this one is just dragging for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"What have you done for me lately?","review":"I loved Vince Flynn's first 2 books. Unfortunately, his 3rd book, \\"The Third Option,\\" is not of the same caliber. It starts out with an exciting premise as Mitch Rapp is undertaking another dangerous mission, but rapidly devolves into just another run-of-the-mill \\"evil politician\\" book. And, unfortunately, the book never resolves most of its storylines, leaving us hanging (presumably to buy the next book) at the end. Anna Rielly, Mitch's love interest from the previous book, is present in this book, but is unfortunately presented as a cardboard character. There is almost no face-to-face interaction between Mitch and Anna in this book, which I found rather odd. Too much time spent on uninteresting political power struggles, and too little time spent with Mitch Rapp doing what he does best.After the promise of Flynn's first 2 books, I was rather disappointed with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Flynn delivers again.

Passable action but does not really stand alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"How disappointing! Buy Flynn's next for the end. Maybe....","review":"Flynn's first two were thrilling though implausible (but that's why we read, right?). Third Option rates one star because it's just the first part of the story. We want to see the bad guys get their just desserts, but at the end of this one the baddest is still on the loose. In other words, you've bought just an installment in this particular story. Wonder how many volumes it will take to get satisfaction?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written but leaves the reader hanging","review":"The Third Option starts off fast and carries through that way almost till the end, but the end is so incomplete that a reader can only think that the author was under pressure to get the book finished and just stopped. Too bad because it is an exciting book with a terrible ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another GREAT one!","review":"I agree with some previous reviewers that this is not quite as intense as the first two, but nonetheless, it is still a great book. All the characters are back...and I love them all! But even if one hadn't read the first two books, their history is explained and this story stands alone quite well. I had been waiting for another Vince Flynn novel and didn't realize it had been out for a while or I would have cleared my calendar and read it months before. I, for one, am glad that a certain sneaky senator will be back and am quite anxious to see how Mitch Rapp responds when he finds out a few things. Oh, hurry Mr. Flynn, hurry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"Simply put, this was an outstanding book. If you are a guy then Vince Flynn's books are for you. Lots of action with just a touch of romance. You become very attached to the characters, epsically Rapp and Rieley. In the Mitch Rapp series it is hard to put one book above any other and the third option stays true to all of that, very well written. I am by no means the fastest reader around and being a soldier myself mt time can be at a primeium but I finished this book in two days, impossible to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"THRILLING","review":"I have learned so much by reading Vince Flynn's books and this one is no exception.

I can't wait to get the next book in the mail from Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complicated, and fun.","review":"This one had a patient narrative unfold. It's the middle chapter of the trilogy. Perfect setup for the last...I'm definitely hooked."},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrible letdown","review":"Although many characters are stereotypes, plot and pacing got me hooked...until the end, which is a non-end. I was shocked that major issues were not resolved. For instance, we know the Bad Guy, but there's no intimation of whether or how he gets his comeuppance. I felt like writing the author and saying, \\"If it's not too much trouble -- and doesn't cost anything extra --would you mind mailing me the ending of the story?\\" Can't remember being treated this way by an author -- or being so disappointed in a promising story that starts with a bang and ends in a Black Hole."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Third Option","review":"When I read this book I was very impressed, liked the plot. Another good read from Vince Flynn. Read the Mitch books in order and enjoyed them all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy Ending","review":"Good read, typical Mitch Rapp story but the ending was so disappointing. I actually thought my Kindle malfunctioned and wouldn't display the last pages. The book (story) just stopped. It was by far the worst ending I have ever encountered- in any book. It seems that you have to buy the next book Separation of Power to continue the story. So I bought it- didn't like being forced to and thought it was a cheap shot way of selling books. Vince lost a lot of creditability with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read if you like the series","review":"This is the third book in the Mitch Rapp series and Vince Flynn continues to keep us reading into the night to find out how the plot unfolds. However, this book lacks some of the intensity that others in the series have. The ending is very weak, but I have already downloaded the next book in the series, Separation of Power. I like the series very much so now I will end this review and start reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jusr readable","review":"Of all the books I have purchased on Amazon this one had to rate as the one that was in the worst shape.

This is my first book by VF and I'm looking forward to read more of him.About the end... no comments."},{"rating":"1","title":"A View to a Sequel","review":"I have to agree with the other reviewers, this is just a sad attempt to get me ready for the next book in the series.While I like certain books in series (the Dan Mahoney books come to mind), I need them to be \\"Stand-Alone\\" books. In other words, with just a little background in the book, you can read it without reading anything else in the series. And you don't feel compelled to buy the next book just to find out what happens. This is a cheat, and I resent it. In fact, I have made an effort to not buy any more Flynn books since this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Running out of gas....","review":"Let me start by saying that I have read the both previous books by this author. I found them outstanding,they were a perfect fix while waiting for Clancy to put out a new offering. In fact I thought that this author was molding his own style and it was pretty darn good! However this one missed the mark. It started out slow and the pace just did not pick up. Yes the characters that I loved in the other boosk were here. I really did not like the idea of bringing the characters from two seperate story lines into one novel. I kept expecting action to break out but it never happened. I made it to page 266 before calling it quits. It has been sitting in my desk drawer for months. I hope the next novel picks up where the first two left off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner","review":"Picking up where Transfer of Power left off, Vince Flynn has another winner on his hands. Mitch Rapp, Thomas Stansfield and Dr. Irene Kennedy are back in an edge-of-your-seat political thriller. Having just read Transfer of Power, many of the characters in the Third Option were well known, with a storyline that flowed from the previous novel. The only downside to reading them back to back was that some of the material was repetitive. That said, the Third Option is another fast paced page turner. The reader follows Mitch Rapp from an early attack on his life as he seeks to track down the conspirators. If you liked Transfer of Power, you should also like The Third Option. It will be difficult to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, Great price","review":"Every book in Vince Flynn's Mitch Rapp series is amazing! Don't miss a single one. Great price and fast shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written and narrated","review":"Until this novel, Vince Flynn was one of my preferred authors. The narrative is poorly written, the dialogue jumps too much, the plot is weak, and it reads like a 5th grade level. He's lost pace with Ludlum and DeMille. In fewer words, the story is boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mitch Rapp to the Rescue","review":"This is one of the best entries in the Mitch Rapp series, up there with \\"Consent to Kill.\\"Rapp is set up during one of his assassination attempts. He is betrayed and shot by one of his cohorts and left for dead in Germany. But Rapp doesn't die easily. He survives and escapes to the States where he must contend with conspirators in Washington. Flynn's description of the behind-the-scenes machinations in Washington politics is intriguing. Too, his depiction of Rapp the assassin plotting and executing his killings is realistic and fascinating. Highly recommended!--Bryan Cassiday, author of \\"The Kill Option\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Vince's first two books and enthusiastically purchased The Third Option. True to his first two novels, I could not put the book down until I was done reading it. I found the story very compelling. One problem however,...the book does not end. After spending the time (late nights and early mornings) feverishly reading the book, I arrived at the end and the story continued. I was very disappointed. I will try Vince again on his fourth book, but if the fourth one doesn't end, I'm out. There are too many other books competing for my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waited for Nothing","review":"I was eagerly awaitng Vince's third novel after I enjoyed the first two so much. This book was very disappointing. The beginning was great--typical of his first two books, but there was no end. We were completely left hanging on almost every major point of the book. I will definitely wait for the library book before reading book #4. Is this one of those instances where a really good beginning author gets in too deeply and starts just churning out words to make the deadlines?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Have to get the next one","review":"A disclaimer for this book...to fully enjoy it, you really need to read Term Limits and Transfer of Power first. There are a LOT of characters here that were in the previous two books. Trying to digest all of them at the same time might be a little rough.I'm surprised at the amount of negative reviews this has received. I actually enjoyed this book more than Transfer of Power or Term Limits. I had planned on making it through the entire Flynn/Rapp series anyway, so the fact that the ending is incomplete is no biggie for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"ending??","review":"The story is interesting and well paced.The ending leaves one hanging and thirsty for some kind of resolution. This was disappointing, but as it was apparent on the last page, it was basically a satisfying read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The evolution of Rapp and company","review":"Flynn has hit his stride in this book. He carefully is starting to transition characters, which only adds to the complexity of the plot[s]."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Superb Thriller From Vince Flynn","review":"I just love this Mitch Rapp series. He's definitely our over the top guy. I hope there are people somewhat like him in real life.

Hayes;Senator Hank Clark Chairman of The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence;Congressman Albert Rudin Chairman of The House Select Committee on Intelligence. Peter Cameron a man for sale with 24 years of experience in The Agency's Office of Security. Secretary of State Charles Midleton an elitist snob who thought he should be running things.

Not only is his timing excellent (unfortunately due to 9/11/01), but his style and stories are engrossing. Terrorists, covert operations, Middle East political unsteadiness - all are the basis by Flynn.If you liked Jack Ryan in the series by Tom Clancey, you'll love Mitch Rapp.You won't stop with only one of his books. Read them in order to get the best story line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shameless setup","review":"I've read several Vince Flynn books, but this was the last one. The story was mildly interesting and kept me reading. But the book ran out before the story. It was a cheap shot to split the story over two books forcing the reader to shell out more money to find out how it ends. I felt ripped off and went on to find other authors that are more respectful of their audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfinished Business","review":"Old movie serials left you hanging for the next installment. Most TV shows are complete to themselves, including \\"The West Wing.\\" Here, the author wants us to read the next installment, so he left us with \\"Unfinished Business.\\" He wants us to buy the next book, rather than being satisfied with a complete story. Granted that many suspense writer leave a \\"hook,\\" but this author didn't finish the book. Perhaps his next book will be the Fourth Option. If you read Robert W. Parker, each book is complete. Overall, Parker is much better than Flynn."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is part 1 of ?","review":"The book's plot is mildly interesting, but certainly nowhere as interesting as Flynn's previous novels. Sadly, this book stops well short of finishing the story. Instead of tying up details in the plot, it spends the entire second half of the book setting up plot lines that will no doubt be carried into the next novel. This was the last Flynn book I will read."},{"rating":"1","title":"RIP OFF","review":"I HAVE READ A COUPLE OF BOOKS BY FLYNN. CERTAINLY NOT LITERARY MASTERPIECES BUT AMUSING AND FAST PACED ONCE YOU GET BEYOND THE CANNED PLOTS AND THE SAME SET PIECE FORMULA.

Way too much inside the Beltway drama for me. Kept reading it on the strength of Flynn's other novels but alas this option could have used a better editor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some improvement","review":"yet another Flynn book... He has gotten better at dialogue and making the plot tighter, but weaknesses remain. While he has introduced some nuances into professions (some good politicians, some evil commandos), there still is a bit of a comic book quality to Flynn's characters (college students are self-rightous, commandos virtual knights of chivarly etc.). Especially the female characters who are just too emotional and phsyically perfect. Why are all goodies fit and attractive and the villian of the story fat? Rapp is just too much at times, like some reject from a 1980s action film. The blatent lack of a end to the book to get you to buy a sequel is shameless. His good action and pacing, his imaginate plot ideas remain good though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty good book with a couple of negatives!","review":"Pretty good book. Uncovers the true bureaucracy going on in Washington. The author is a pretty good fantasizer. Nice work.A couple of negatives about this book that made me decide to rate it not more than 2 starts:* Very dragged out. He could've written it in half or two thirds the size* To many characters. Very confusing. And some names are similar.* Some stuff in the book is just not possible. Completely fiction.* Very silly ending. It's like the whole book makes no sense when you get to the end.I recommend books from Andy Mcnab. An excellent writer on secret intelligence and on the field."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Excellent Book!","review":"I was thrilled to see another Vince Flynn book. I was not dissapointed.The continuation of the characters in previous novels is something I particularly enjoy. However, even though the characters from previous novels are used, this book can stand alone.I read the previous reviews and many of them already explain the plot, so what more can I say. The plot is well written and very exciting. Although the end left room for another novel, it didn't leave you hanging.I gave this a four only because I think that it is not 'as good' as his previous novels. However, just because it's not as good as his other novels does not mean it's not good. I enjoyed this book.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"2 1/2 Stars -- What Happened, Vince?","review":"After reading Flynn's first two books, Term Limits and Transfer Of Power, I was looking forward to another tale of non-stop action and thrills. Much to my surprise, however, The Third Option,was a big disappointment. The plot was too dragged out and the action was neither very exciting nor frequent enough. Further, the biggest letdown in this book pertained to it's conclusion -- or lack thereof. The Third Option ends leaving the reader \\"hanging.\\" Flynn is an author that I felt I could count on for edge-of-your-seat suspense and a very satisfying reading experience. Unfortunately, Flynn let me down big-time in his third effort featuring Mitch Rapp. I'm hoping that this book was just a fluke and that the others in the series will live up to the high expectations I have when I pick up a Vince Flynn book."},{"rating":"2","title":"he is so great!","review":"It is a shame his show did not get picked up here in American he is such an entertaining person."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good family entertainment","review":"Very interesting on a number of levels.

I became a huge fan of his when I first saw his one-night stand on HBO (something that should be out on DVD) when I was 13 and immediately loved him. I have been a huge fan for close to a decade. All I have to say about his life and this book is that both were and are plagued with irony. He was a Texan with the surname of Hicks and he was one of the most educated people I have ever listened to while his book was probably the most poorly written piece of literature I have ever read. The book is plagued with typos poor spelling, grammer, and incomprehensible sentences. Many times the typos were so horrible that I had absolutely no clue what the sentence was trying to say. Shame on you Cynthia True for defiling a great man's memory with such a sad display of writing. Poor Bill. Nothing seems to go his way...even in death."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bill deserves better....","review":"Cynthia True's book is a softbound equivalent of a fluff piece in a celebrity magazine. I read this book based on a recommendation from a friend, and was certainly disappointed. If I wanted a transcription of Bill's routines on his four widely-released CD's, I could have done it myself. The book does have some nice pictures, and you could write a 100-word bio of Hicks that would hold a minimum of interest as he was such an enigmatic character, but this \\"book\\" (and I use the term lightly) is a disgrace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Reading.","review":"A lot of the people trashing this book are die hard Hicks fans that feel the book isn't up to the same standard that Bill's comedy is, and they are completely correct. The author isn't a great writer, by any means. That doesn't mean the book isn't worth reading, though. Even though the writing is mediocre at best, the material is top notch. The biggest hack in the world could write about Hicks, and it would be worth reading, because he is that interesting. And one compliment I can give this author, is she is obviously a fan. She wrote this book lovingly, and it makes the ending of this book and his life that much sadder. If you're a Hicks fan, it's a must read. It's still very enjoyable. I look forward to a better BIO one day, but I could definitely live with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting read","review":"I bought this shortly after discovering Bill Hicks.

It is deep, but there are ribs in the center, right under the handle of the lid, that doesn't allow for bigger items to fit. So you just have the left and right sides to put anything into it, the center for smaller things. The drawer guides aren't as smooth as a Kennedy toolbox but isn't too bad once you get some things into the drawers to weigh it down. Overall it is a nice box for the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a little grey for my taste","review":"I like the case. It's lightweight but seems protective, the green furry interior is fun, and the strap is very comfortable and well-padded. I'm not crazy about the color; somehow I thought it would be a little sleeker and more silver. The grey is just a little blah for my taste; it's fine for daily trekking on the metro, but I've ordered an alternate design from Mobile Edge for professional use at conferences, business meetings, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"ZZ Top Six Pack is awesome!","review":"I am not going to argue with reviewers about the sound. It definately does not sound like the original ZZ Top (i have heard the \\"The Best of ZZ Top\\"). But I am going to argue that it is still ZZ Top and the bogus remastering should not stop you from enjoying the rockin' sensation of \\"That Lil' Ole' Band From Texas\\". The remasters aren't THAT bad (though the originals are much better). This set is a good way to get 6 of ZZ Top's albums in one spot. Most of the time, you're going to have to find it used, but some sites (like Amazon) have it new. This album went out of print because they released each album individualy (yet they didn't even bother to fix the sound after some negative reaction to this album), so finding it new would be an excellent find. But new or used, you should get this set if you like ZZ Top even the slightest bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Machine Drummin madness WHAT WAS BILLY THINKING????","review":"If you are a ZZ TOP PURIST...someone who loved them from the beginning, someone who owns (owned) all of their vinyl releases from ZZ TOP'S FIRST ALBUM through EL LOCO...You'll be amazed at what has happened to this music. Billy Gibbons got behind the control board, re-recorded the drum tracks on every song (except the live ones on FANDAGO!) with digital drum machines and added horrible digital reverb to teh vocals.GEEZ!! What happened to the raw, subtle rockin' your a$$ off early ZZ TOP? Billy has destroyed the essense of the early LP's by \\"updating\\" the recordings. I admit, the effect is rockin' but it's not the original ZZ TOP records we all love.If you want the original six, sounding like they should, go to the used record store and buy vinyl copies!!

Did they re-record all these albums in a tunnel with a drum machine? I have these records on vinyl and they sound a thousand times better!

Do not buy this, urge WB or whoever to re-release it UNREMASTERED, it sounds better the way it was done the first time."},{"rating":"2","title":"What are they thinking?","review":"Anyone who gives this box set less than a five star rating is a nut case. This set of albums is more than classic. You can find songs on this set that have been ripped off by many contemporary artists including Pearl Jam. And the first album is thirty years old. If you think this is the same ZZ Top from your Eliminator cassette than think again. These songs are why Billy Gibbons was Jimi Hendrix's favorite guitarist."},{"rating":"1","title":"The individually packaged cds have the same awful remixing","review":"I agree with the previous reviewers who have complained about the awful remixing and the terrible altering of the original drum sound. Since one reviewer suggested that the problem could be avoided by buying the cds individually, I wanted to let people know that the individual cds have the same remixes on them so that is no way to solve the problem. E-mail the band or Warner Brothers (or RCA or whoever has the catalog rights) to let them know how bad these new versions are! If enough people complain, maybe they will put out the originals. Given that everyone and his brother is re-releasing \\"remastered\\" versions of classic cds to improve upon the sound of the original cds, these certainly seem like great candidates for that kind of treatment. Until then, it's vinyl or cassettes (which haven't been messed with)."},{"rating":"1","title":"a totally botched job","review":"This should have been a great boxed set. The original material, is brilliant, classic American blues-rock.

The early albums have now been released individually, without this heinous remastering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad remaster job","review":"I will also say that the remastering of these CD's are bad.

Inexplicably left out is 1979's \\"Deguello,\\" which with the possible exception of 1981's \\"El Loco,\\" was their best album from this period. \\"Deguello\\" included hits such as \\"Cheap Sunglasses,\\" and \\"I'm Bad, I'm Nationwide\\" and deserves inclusion over either of the band's first two albums, murky blues efforts that found them struggling to perfect their sound.As for the rest of the material, latter 70's releases \\"Tres Hombres,\\" \\"Fandango,\\" \\"Tejas\\" and the aforementioned \\"El Loco,\\" make for excellent doses of the Top. Overall, this CD is a good way for completists to own this material without shelling out the coin for six full albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classic Music But Terrible Sound!","review":"These original 6 albums are classic American blues-rock, plain & simple.The problem is that they remixed these gems to sound \\"modern\\" in an '80's sort of way.Now if that's your thing and don't mind, then fine, this is a good set to have if you're into that drum machine & synthesizer sound.However Tres Hombres & Fandango have been re-issued & re-masterd and don't sound half bad, though I have to admit not quite as good or \\"original\\" as the vinyl LP's did, (I still have mine!).So why do we live in a world that the record companies have to screw the fans on a regular basis?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Drink a fifth before sampling the \\"Six-Pack\\"","review":"You'll be suckin' your teeth lookin' for the receipt after you listen to this box-set.

Well guess what, in the process their older fans who were used to the original versions on the old cassettes and albums were shocked when they listened to any of these first generation CD releases. They heard bogus reverbed drums, and entire sections of both music and vocals re-recorded. Talk about tarnishing the legacy of a great band's output. Well someone finally wised up and now at least Tres Hombres and Fandango are now available in original mix, remastered form. So stay away from this trash and wait for the entire back catalog to be released in it's original mix, remastered form on CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be NO STARS","review":"What the Heck was Billy Gibbons and the other Tops thinking when they re-recorded the drums with the Eliminator Drum Machines!?!?!?This re-release of ZZ TOP's first six ( and best 6) albums should have been ZZ TOP nirvana for fans, instead it's a turbo charged headache.

What a difference this made. Amazing. That's all I can say. She taught me some exercises which are not on the DVD and offered me other beauty suggestions, such as always sleeping on my back, which keeps the symmetry of my face.

I could hardly open my mouth without a loud cracking sound and it felt like I was going to have lockjaw. Every exercise requires you to have your mouth open very wide during the routine.

The content, of course, is the beautiful story written by O. Henry but the way it was printed, left a lot to be desired. The illustrations were okay but lacked in depth. For me they evoked very little and I was disppointed, personally speaking, that they were not in color. The printing and such looked like it had been done by a bunch of people who didn't know quite what they were doing. For example, the title page was horribly off-center.

I think that there was a mix up in assembling the book that I received. The jacket that I read says that the story takes place while the old guys are in their late 70's and early 80's. What I think the jacket meant to say is that the STORY takes place in the '70's and the 80's. The first several pages do in fact deal with the hero, Willie, setting up a reunion in the year 2000, but that is it! For the next 300 pages one reads about these individuals going through their various mid-life duldrums and challanges.The last 80 or so pages then get to the reunion itself. I thought the first two books in the trilogy (I did not read these) delt with the time periods covered in this book. Incredible!I could go on and on, but suffice it to say that this is a sad piece of work for a Pulitzer Prize winning author.Read \\"Advise and Consent\\" and be truly spellbound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great french music","review":"A great album.

Does Dutch Blitz, Nertz, Pounce, or Solitaire Frenzy ring a bell? Perpetual Commotion does add a twist with a die roll to determine bonus scoring for the next round, but this alone is hardly worth 20 bucks if you already have a bunch of cards sitting around.

We have introduced this to several friends who loved it, even ones who \\"don't play games\\". It's quite simple to play once you understand the process (I advise a walk-through before pouring the wine). We don't use the dice or keep score and sometimes pair-up players to extend the fun. Don't expect the cards to remain pristine since the game can get a little rowdy. And beware that NOTHING is safe on the table during play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun!","review":"Our family started playing this and could not stop.

I discovered them around the time of Abbaesque. I love that album (although I still need to get a copy of it), and I love the song Always, which I heard on a compilation CD a friend had. Nothing on here is as good as either Abbaesque or Always. I do like A Little Respect, Ship of Fools and Chains of Love. I did like that they took a few chances, such as the instrumental piece Sixty-five thousand, Yahoo! and the cover of River deep, mountain high, but as others have said, the songs didn't work. Overall a slightly below average album that only a die hard Erasure fan would probably like. You also might like it if you're looking for dance music for an 80's party. It's not a good one for just sitting and listening, or even as a workout CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"over-rated and FULL of filler","review":"So many Erasure fans cite this as their favourite, and I have no idea why. I had it on cassette when it came out, having really enjoyed \\"the Circus\\", but I found exactly 3 good songs on this. The singles ( of course ) Chains of Love, Ship of Fools, and A Little Respect. The rest are simply awful, especially the ham handed cover of River Deep,Mountain High ( now THAT is a travesty!!)

And this is by far, my favorite album of ANY musical group. The lyrics of this album, the way it's arranged, its synth pop-dance melodies and rich, full instrumentation make this absolutely classic and original.

This is vintage Erasure, at their best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Buy!!!","review":"This album is one of the best of Erasure.

Highly recommend for any 80s enthusiast!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Little Respect -And Then Some","review":"Their first two albums were respectable and the third was expendable. But with this, they finally entered the mainstream with such catchy tunes as \\"Chains Of Love\\" and \\"A Little Respect\\". Arguably the best title on this disc is \\"Ship Of Fools\\" in which lead singer Andy Bell asks why the world is so cruel (a question we're all asking even today). This was the apex of the duo's lengthy career with songwriter Vince Clarke in top form.

Ruin is different than I expected and it had a surprise ending, which was a plus. I don't see how anyone could not like this novel.Those who criticize this novel look too deep into it and pick out all of the details which they did not like, and turn them into negative comments about the book. The New Jedi Order:Ruin is the newest addition to the Star Wars universe and it is not any worse than any other Star Wars material out there, in fact, it is better than some."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Action and characters","review":"Michael Stackpole wrote a good book. He keeps the action scenes spaced but exciting. He reintroduced Pellaeon and Baron Fel's son. He also helps devolop the Solo kids.

I would definitely recommend this book to any Star Wars fan big or small."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly Enjoyable","review":"Stackpole's Dark Tide Duology is fantastic. The ever-present sense of doom that makes the book impossible to put down.Ruin is a good conclusion to Onslaught. The Jedi storylines are great.The Ganner-Corran rift is handled very well, as is the \\"soul searching\\" of Jacen Solo. Even the subplot involving Daeshara'cor was good. But the best parts involve the outcome of Elegos' mission and the ending duel. The duel is great with the expected outcome, but it is the events after the happiness that are the reason this installment is called Ruin.Stackpole is a master of handling several characters and storylines, and has shown himself to be a credit to the Star Wars universe with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Tide II RUIN","review":"I haven't read a StarWars novel I haven't liked yet and this is no exception. However, this book did seem to have been hurried. They spent all this time looking for something to use against the Vong, when they found it, they didn't use it. The older characters are getting lost. Can you see Han Solo drowning in self-pitty. I don't think so. Leia setting back while her children are knee deep into life and death. Could we please find the cure for Mara? All in all this was a great book, I couldn't put it down. As with any book I read, I would always like to do things a little different. To all StarWars fans this is a must read, but read the other 2 books of the TNJO first, it will make it a lot easier to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"It looks GRRRRRRREAT!","review":"I have been looking forward to this book for a long time and know I can't be dissappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Tide II : Ruin","review":"This was a good book.

Finially in the end, the fall of Corran horn was upsetting, he is a great character, and I would like to see more of him. Last thing, I hope Michael A.

I thought it was boring and I just pushed myself through it. I am however somehow one of the few people who really liked Vector Prime. Third is that I really liked this book and I thought it had alot of variety. I loved the duel between Corran and Shai and I thought the author played off relationships between certain characters in the books really well. I was slightly irritated by the ever missing Han and the few pages that Leia had. I also wish that he had done more on Jag because I really like the character so far. The banquet chapter was one of my favorites. So if your wondering about this book I just wanted to say that you should read it and that it is my favorite of the three Star Wars books I've read in this series so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bre's","review":"This edition to the Star Wars saga is as excellant as one might expect, being written by Michael A. Stackpole. The action sequences are fabulous - you feel as though you are a part of it, not a mere bystander. The characters were all well-realised, and I was particularly happy with Mara, as Stackpole, apart from Timothy Zahn, of course, has a far better grip on her than the other SW writers seem to have. We get to learn a lot more about the Vong culture and way of thinking then what we previously knew, and I found that it helped with my understanding of the plot a lot more. The ending upset me on a personal note, but on an impersonal note, I'd have to say that it was quite exceptional. Very unexpected, and unexcepted is good. I wished, however, that the sub-plot about Daeshara'cor, though good by itself, had a bit more to do with the overall scheme of things."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best NJO book yet.","review":"This was good book overall. It is one of Stackpoles best and the best in the NJO so far. My only problem with it is that Kyp has no depth. I hope Kyp devolps in the later novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good.....","review":"This was a very good book. It had enough action scences to keep you interested between the other chapters. Stackpoles work is fantastic compared to some of the other righters, but i think Zahn should write them all. The book itself had a pretty good plot(i won't go into it because i would give things away). He handles most of the characters very well, but he seems to have a reluctance to use mara. He does a pretty good job with the solo kids. Leia is hardly in it after she talks to a certain person. Han is in it for a longer period of time and he seems to be getting better. Other characters make mistakes, then they learn from their actions, an become better at what they were trying to do. All in all, a must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Continuing the Saga. . .","review":"I'll be honest, I loved this book. Jaina flies with the Squadron and she deserves it. Aniken still deals with his guilt, but what surprised me the most, is that we heard realatively nothing about Han. This upset me, as he is a very important character in the SW universe, and they can't afford to lose him. The alien species that out heroes are facing seems to be gaining, slowly. I love how the chapter switsh to even the Yuuzang Vohngs point of veiw.Anyways, the point is, this book is an absolute musty have for any Star Wars fan around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just finished it and...","review":"... It's tough to say how I feel. I feel both happy but sad at the same time. I will only tell the bad. I feel bad for Corran, Jaina and all of the Ithorians. But I feel the book was good and a great for Mike Stackpole to go out.And By the way WHERE THE HELL IS HAN?"},{"rating":"2","title":"If You're Ready!

The remainder seems more experimental noise of the nervous banging, talking, generally irritating type. I tried several times to listen this as openly as possible, and in the end just feel cheated. Not just out of my money, but out of my time. By the way I came across this DVDA because Amazon shows that people who bought Blue Man Group (BMG) also bought Studio Voodo.

I watch a lot of shows and movies and know the difference between good and bad. This show is somewhat of a joke to me to be honest. Most reviews comment on how good the acting is and I find it laughable. The stories are not engaging and 90% of the players don't even resemble what NFL players look like. I am shocked at how well this show is reviewed and I feel the exact opposite. If you like good shows with a good story and acting do not buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"wish they'd bring it back","review":"Actually this one was my boyfriend's purchase, but he really got me hooked.

Many of the actors on this show demonstrated why they should be recognized for their craft of acting.

After watching the first episode I was hooked and stayed up all day watching. The show was ahead of its time and shouldn't have been canceled. It shows how pro football really is behind the scenes.

Flat out the best show I've seen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved series!!!","review":"My husbanda & I loved this series. I am just glad it did not end with too much of a cliffhanger. I was OK that it did not pick up for season 2. It was great."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Show for sports novices and sports junkies","review":"I was not interested in watching this show at first, but after the first episode, I was a \\"playmakers\\" fiend. The show was right on target. It tackled modern day issues that not only affect athletes but also non-athletes. The show addressed drug-abuse, domestic violence, homosexuality, infidelity, health & fitness...all issues that affect everyday people. The main characters had their own private drama, but all of it was dealt with in the locker room, bar room, and on the football field. The team truly functioned as a team and offered support whenever possible (well, they didn't care much for the whole homosexualtiy issue). I was pissed when I heard that the NFL complained about the show, thus forcing ESPN to cancel the series....whiners and wimps!! It would be great if another channel, like HBO or Showtime would pick up the series; these channels are definitely not afraid to air/produce shows that touch on gritty, but real life topics."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the Real Deal!","review":"I had never heard about Playmakers until my wife bought it for me on DVD. I didnt know what to expect when I read about what this series was about but after the first episode I was hooked! I could not stop watching the series until I got to the final episode. The playmakers is a series that will draw you back for more after each episode and this is one of the best things I liked about this series. After one episode I had to know what was gonna happen in the next. This is what happens behind closed doors, in the looker rooms and in the real world. People dont know about these things because we are not suppose to know but this is what people want to know about and what people want to see, what really goes on. I hope that someone decides to make another season of playmakers. I will continue to hope and continue to wait and see if another season will come out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best sports show of all time","review":"A must-have boxed set for anyone that considers themselves a fan of the NFL. The coach is a little typical and the conflicts are over-dramatized, but I haven't been this entertained by a sports production since \\"The Program\\". So hot, it caught the attention of the NFL and they virtually demanded this show 'cease and desist' if it wanted to renew its television deal with ESPN/ABC. It's too bad that this show will never see a season 2, but not all that surprising. Your girlfriend might even like it, since it has more to do with sex/drugs/violence than sport itself.

Wonderful way to spark conversation from kids who will barely tell you what they did at school for the day. All of that said, you will tire of the game after awhile. Put it on the shelf, forget about it and then pull it down a year later to relive some fun.One way to extend the playability and to add some excitement is for everyone to make some of their own cards to add to the game.

I don't care how much you want children to think and have fun, it is never appropriate to bring up such disgusting ideas for fun. Seriously? I get the urge to vomit reading most of these cards. I'll give you an example: Would you rather suck the white dried spit off the edges of a teacher's lips after a 2 hour class -or- suck off the crud that gathers in the corner of a cat's eye?This is a perfect example of what is wrong with children today.

If they had had time to develop, they could have turned into a really great band, but Grace took the decision of joining Jefferson Airplane and that was it for Society.I consider their live recordings far more interesting, but this is undoubtfully a very interesting release. It contains a nice booklet with notes and the sound quality is certainly great."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD STUFF","review":"The Great Society should be more than an Airplane footnote. They were a fine band on their own (especially live, check out the Columbia release for that), with an excellent guitarist/songwriter in Darby Slick. This album is a compilation of their studio recordings, and the quality of performances ranges from middling to transcendent. While it's true that the kickoff single \\"Free Advice\\" is a legendary stinker (one that drove session producer Sly Stone to form his own band) that probably torpedoed the band's career, there is much to like here. \\"That's How It Is\\" is one of the great lost singles of the 60's, and their version of \\"Somebody to Love\\" is an excellent, albeit apples-and-oranges companion to the Airplane's version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soap - A work of satirical genius","review":"Soap had to be the shortest half-hour of television I can remember.

After having it for a month I went in his room at night because I smelled something burning only to find it had burned our outlet and the plug on the heater. Talk about a mother's nightmare! I am now trying to deal with Honeywell about their product. The supervisor I talked with didn't seem that shocked by my phone call. They are taking my heater and running test on it to see what happened. I will not be buying anything from them!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why the stupid Beeps & Lights?","review":"I bought this product yesterday at a local retailer and will be returning it tomorrow. It heats well and quickly. But the list of issues and stupid design decisions with this heater is long.- Every time you push a button the heater beeps VERY loud.- When you turn the temperature set dial, it beeps for every degree change (Very loud)- The fan noise is high and not consistent. I'm not sure if the rapid fan speed changes are \\"normal\\" or if my unit is broken.- There is a blue light strip that is for looks only. Which if you use this to heat a room when you go to sleep, it adds light to the room for no reason.Without the beeps I would consider keeping the unit. But the beeps are just crazy loud and there's no reason for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great, when you can get it to stay on","review":"I had the same problem that other reviewers have mentioned: I bought the unit in June (I live in San Francisco, which explains why I bought a space heater in the summer), and about a week ago, the unit began turning off automatically a minute or two after being on, and now it will not stay on at all. i have had it for four months, and during the early, halcyon days, it was great: it heated our back room quickly, was relatively quiet, and the safety shut off worked well. But it is very annoying to see that this problem with the on/off - automatic shut-off s a recurring problem with this model.

While the temperature in a room would vary between 68-70 during my tests, the heater itself would display temperatures ranging from 66 to 85, sometimes within the space of an hour. Power cycling the heater seemed to temporarily reset this behavior, so the problem is definitely not poor thermostat placement next to the heat source. Additionally, one of the two models simply failed to run when on the energy-saver mode. I can only guess that this entire line of space heater was created to use up a large number of defective thermostats. In conclusion, this would be a great heater -- except for the total lack of temperature regulation, and the all-to-real concern that if the unit can't even tell the temperature, how can it be trusted to have a working over-heating fail safe?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective","review":"Heating is out in our Brooklyn Apartment.

The only problem I had was that the temperature difference between the heater turning off and on again was like 4 degrees. This created both cold and hot zones.After about 3 weeks, the automatic shut-off got activated and the heater stopped working. There is instruction on the cord that advices you to unplug the heater and wait for 10 mins before using it again. I followed it and it again started working. But after another week, everyday, the auto shut-off would kick-in within like 5 mins of switching on the heater. After that it was consistently just working only for 5 mins and then will automatically get reset after about several hours to only run for another 5 mins. It became so frustrating that I returned this back to Target."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this heater, but the thermostat is inaccurate.","review":"I've used this heater all around my (drafty old) house this winter. I keep the central thermostat around 64, and I use this space heater to warm the room I'm using. The noise is minimal, and it warms a room pretty quickly. I've had no problems with its performance, but the thermostat never displays an accurate temperature -- it will usually tell me a room is about 61 degrees when it's actually closer to 65.

He doesn't like lies and liars.The body's condition isn't very amenable to identification, but the sheriff's intellect and doggedness prove up to the task.The book kept me up far past my usual bedtime.

The band was doing it's thing before the surf craze of the early 60s caught on, but when you listen to it, you'll hear hints of what was to become surf rock as we know it. So be forwarned if you buy this expecting the Revels to sound like The Surfaris. This was a great time in rock history, coz bands could make a career out of being an instrumental group, and people loved it. You won't see this kinda thing happening today in mainstream music. In fact, if you've seen Pulp Fiction, you might remember them. Remember that rather unpleasant scene with Ving Rhames where Bruce Willis takes out those guys with a samurai sword? That peppy tune with the nasty sax? If you happen to remember that, then you've got a good idea of how the Revels sound.

They range from Non-Canonical Gospels by the Nazareans, the Hebrews, Mary, the Great Seth, et al, to Acts of the Apostles by John, Paul, Thecla, et al, to Epistles by Paul, Clement, Ptolemy, et al, to Apocalypses & Revelations by Hermas, Peter, John, et al, & those in Canonical lists such as Origen of Alexandria, Eusebius, Third Synod of Carthage.With a General Introduction that could have gone on for many more pages, to brief specific introductions to each text, Bert Erhman offers an assortment of early Christian writings, often repetitive in their stories yet idiosyncratic to the author, which are both didactic & interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Teswtament Apocrypha","review":"The book arrived in good order and a timely fashion.

Even if reading them does not change your belief, it is a matter of openmindedness listening to all available information instead of a 1600 years old \\"reader's digest\\". Translation is easy to read, even for us non-native speakers, and there is a short intro before each scripture. Very happy with this book, just wondering to myself how come I ordered hardcover??

There are many photographs, but few of the dishes for which she has recipes (this is the only fault).

Here are some sample titles: \\"Depression and Healing Touch,\\" \\"Depression and Healing with Crystals,\\" \\"Depression and Distant Healing,\\" and so on. It is like a laundry list of new age topics.For some insight into spiritual healing, one needs to turn to those who have done the spiritual work.

When he left for a trip to Europe with his wife, his visa was revoked and Chaplin could not return to the United States. Therefore, Chaplin and his wife Oona eventually settled in Switzerland, where he would raise his family until his death in 1977.The documentary reveals wonderful stories from his children, neighbors and others whose lives were touched by Chaplin in some way. Supplemented by many home movies, this documentary gives a wonderful insite to those \\"lost\\" years in Europe, where Chaplin continued to dream of new projects until the very end.All in all, I'm very satisfied with this DVD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"I paid $25 for this in a retail store, and I regret it. I was looking for a CD that would take me through guided breathing exercises, the way some CDs take you through a guided meditation. I have asthma, and I'm pregnant, and I wanted to focus on better breathing. I'm still not sure if this CD has guided breathing exercises or not, maybe it does. Everytime I listen, I fall asleep before I hear him get to any part like that. Everything I've heard sounds like I'm back in a (boring) college lecture.

I like Dr. Weil's approach. It has helped me remember to take time to de-stress through mindful breathing. And it works! One problem--I wish the first CD had been divided into individual tracks. Instead, it is a single track that is nearly an hour long. That makes it very difficult to find your place if you get interupted. I accidently ejected the CD and had to begin again, but I had to hold down the Fast Forward button on my player for quite a while to get back to where I had previously left off - that's ridiculous.

Compared to the rest of the old school artists, BDK comes out on top, alongside Slick Rick, KRS-One, and Rakim. The beats on the album are mostly good, and the lyrics are great.The production is really good on most songs. The only problem is the repeditiveness of the Raw (Remix). The lyrics are great. Here's a sample:Let it roll/ get bowl/ I just can't hold/ back the fold/ cause I'm a man with soul/ in control/ and effect/ so what the heck/ rock the discoteques/ and this jam is what's next.Big Daddy Kane is one of the greatest rappers ever, mostly because of his first two albums.

When he was young and when nothing was or could hold him back. This album is one of the blueprints of hip-hop. Melle Mel said \\"hip-hop is to pick up the mic and CRUSH everything in front of you\\". Kane killed the mic and the rumored beef with the other greatest MC of the era, Rakim, had us on the edge of our seats. Until this day, his rhymes have maintained their intensity and even in 2006, are still considered to be some of the most lethal battle lyrics ever spit. I can't say no more what's already been said numerously.Every track on 'Long Live The Kane' is a truly classic. The tracks that steps up to me are \\"Set It Off\\" \\"Just Rhymin' With Biz\\" \\"Ain't No Half-Steppin\\" and \\"Raw.\\"I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this hip-hop essential to hip-hop fans from every division."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like the Kane","review":"Big Daddy Kane delivers here and a good album showcasing who he is and what he brings to the rap world...BDK continues on Soul School now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long Live the Kane","review":"I don't know how many people do not already have or who have had this cd (cassette) and gave it major airplay when it came out back in the late 80's.

It's even worse in content and execution than Kent Weeks' \\"The Lost Tomb\\". The writing is shoddy, written is such a dry and frankly unpleasant, all-out boring tone that one gets the feeling the author didn't like writing it anymore than I liked reading it. The plates are rediculous in that none show any attempts at originality--as in rarely shown pieces--and instead reproduce so many things that have already been you wonder why they're there at all. To any future Egyptologists such as myself, I beseech you not to waste your money. Spend it on works by Aldred, Tyldesley, and other notables, not this foolery.

Fans of cultural and other types of history however, should not buy this book. One more thing about the reader from Austin, Texas who was disappointed that this book was not as detailed as he had hoped: The last of the native pharaos died more than 2000 years ago. Much information has been lost. In stead of dramatizing things, or writing some interesting theories which are based on air, this book only gives the hard facts of which is found and known about these people. And that is a good thing, because otherwise people expect the details to be known.

In a technical sense this was an excellent movie. In a practical sense, it was painful to watch. There were too many artistic transitions from scene to scene (i.e. landscape shots with thematic music). The dialogue was hard to follow; often the actors were talking with food in their mouths. To me this movie is a dramatic documentary without a narrator. It's a very very slow-burn without a boom at the end.

The contemporary story of Sarah is thin and cliched compared to the richness of the story of the Belgards in Germany. I found myself not caring what happened to Sarah except as her life related to her grandmother--and there wasn't much of that. That is, perhaps, the biggest problem with the contemporary scenes: the characters are all treated superficially, especially in comparison to the WWI-era chapters.The idea (at least I think this was the point--it's not too clear) that one can never truly know what really happened, in the lives of our parents, grandparents,and other relatives, before we knew them, is very interesting and certainly worthy of exploration, but it's treatment falls flat here.

He gets little attention from his flirty mother and after one more argument, which results in Ciske killing her unintentionally in a fit of rage, Ciske is sent to a juvenile prison. When he is released, he goes back to live with his father and helps him to rekindle his romance with his former Fiancee.

I think it's just out of date.shipping fast, condition good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for those with sensitive skin","review":"I am very fair with sensitive skin that reacts to many skincare products by breaking out, drying out or turning reddish. I have found some of the cleansers, toners and masks to be very good for my skin and it has improved after only one week of faithful use of the natural ingredients in the book. There are charts in the book which show what is best for different types of skin so you can tailor your recipes to get exactly what is best for your skin. I do like the smell and consistency of commercially prepared products better, but the additives and perfumes were part of the reason I was having problems with my skin. Before reading this book, I had no idea how many common ingredients can be good for my skin. The book is well worth buying just for the skincare recipes, but the hair and nail care recipes are also well worth trying. Another benefit is the savings. By using the ingredients in the book, I can save alot of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for Interior Designers & Students.","review":"It's a great book.

Every chapter, every page contains an insight that broadens and deepens by Christian faith, opens my eyes to more of the best of my faith, and teaches me how to look at the world through Buddhist eyes as well. More than that, it's a tremendously inspiriational guide to being alive and in the moment. I treasure this little book today and refer to it every day in mediation; it's part of my routine. Nothing bad can come of this book -- everything that comes from its pages enhances and teaches loving kindness, compassion, tolerance, awe in the majesty of God, grace, acceptance and joy in the Holy Spirit, simple and honest meditation practice, and love of salvation through Christ Jesus. Sounds like a lot, doesn't it? It's only the beginning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book I Ever Read","review":"I believe this is the best book I've ever read. It changed my life.

Overrall though, I think it contributes greatly to mutual understandings and thus foster peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"enlightened comparison between Christianity and Buddhism","review":"If one is interested in basic truisms of Christianity and the similarities to Buddhism, this is the book for you.

Thich Nhat Hanh introduced me to the spiritual world of awareness. I have discussed this publication with many of my Christian friends and regardless of any argument that can be put forth, I have to say that Thich Nhat Hanh exudes nothing but love and respect for all religions.

This book does that with christianity and buddhism, it is very naive and may be insulting to christians for it's lack of depth. Yes, dialog between buddhists and christians is desirable, but this book is too simplistic about the problem. If you want a good book about buddhism read\\"Being Peace\\" another one of Thay's books.

And of course there will be those yelling \\"intolerance!\\" and \\"offensive!\\" but Christ was killed for offending people -- he claimed he was the son of GOD!I'll take God's word over Siddhartha Guatama's, also known as \\"Buddha.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS A JOKE RIGHT?","review":"Buddhism & Christianity have only one thing in common; MORALITY.

There certainly is a differnce between saying buddhism and christianity have common ground and equating buddism with christianity and vice versa. This is what thich nhat han does in this book. Common ground is great, but real tolerance is tolerating differece and diversity, not pretending it doesn't exist. I can disagree with someone and still respect there point of view without embracing it. I respect thich nhat han, but that doesn't mean I have to like every thing he has to say. There is a world of difference between tolerating and respecting other points of view and pretending that they are the same. Every one can tolerate sameness, real tolerance is admiting difference and still showing respect. Even a buddha can't ride a peanut and shell a camel. I can't recommend this book very strongly, but this are a few good things about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bras for my wife","review":"My wife adores the product.

As an introduction to MAPLE I have to give the book a poor review. While the author clearly has extensive knowledge of MAPLE, the book is structured so it's virtually impossible to find anything except by accident. Many of the topics covered are highly specialized and of little relevance to the reader looking for a general introduction. Finally, the book covers MAPLE 8. MAPLE is now at version 12, and has gone through many package extensions and user interface changes since then. The current user will be mystified with the disconnect between what they are reading and what they see on the screen.Where else to go for an introduction?

Yes, but every little bit helps, especially when you are trying to get a kid to willingly take one every single day. We tried another brand before these and they were ok but not great.

I wouldn't say that this book is good for someone who has never seen algebra before because the easy problems are still kind of hard compared with other books. If you've seen a bit of algebra before though this book would be really good. It's got tons of problems at the end of almost every section also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Text for an Undergraduate","review":"This was the book that really introduced me to how much fun mathematics could be. The main text covers all of the standard topics in a very clear manner, but the overwhelming strength of this text is the large number of excellent exercises, which range in difficulty from easy to graduate level. Most are labeled as to difficultly, which is unusual, but nice.I cannot emphasize this enough: to get the most of this text you should do as many exercises as possible of a difficulty level that challenges you. If you do, you'll have a solid foundation of abstract algebra that will be more than sufficient if you choose to pursue graduate studies in math (or another field) later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Introduction to Abstract Algebra","review":"My first introduction to abstract algebra has been by this book and I've found it to be an excellent choice. It is a concise book with lots of content. Topics are discussed very fluidly. One really gets the essence of the topics with a lot of insight. The book is simply too elegant. Another great asset of the book is its high quality exercises. Most of the exercises are difficult, nontrivial and provide further insight. This is the only abstract algebra book I've seen, but I don't think any other book could surpass this one in the quality of treatment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying sticker attached.","review":"The price was great and the condition was as advertised, but I must warn you that this product came with an extremely annoying sticker attached.

Moreover, no mention was made of the sticker in the product description.

It's really another and the best episode."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Drama of the Century","review":"Love the story, the characters, the settings, the period detail. The romances are full of drama that never veres over the top into farce, because the writing and acting are Just. That. Good. Delicious. Wish I could enjoy watching it again for the first time, but I'll settle for owning it so I can watch it whenever I want! Same writer as Gosford Park--Julian Fellowes. Similar in its wit and insight into human nature. For everyone who loves a grand sweeping story with lots of great characters--the historical time period April 1912 to spring 1919 is wonderful and engaging--seasons framed by the sinking of the Titanic to after the Spanish Flu outbreak at the end of WWI."},{"rating":"2","title":"We're ready for season 3!","review":"This set brought us up-to-date on Downton Abbey and now we've begun watching Season 3 as well-informed viewers.

WIth humor and historic items that are accurate and poignantHuzzah!"},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible! do not buy!","review":"This was purchased as a Christmas gift for a family member and I was upset to see them watching it. The quality of the blu ray dvds are absolute garbage. The picture is horribly grainy and the playback is jumpy. It is very noticeable. We turned to the hd episodes playing on tv and they are crystal clear and perfect. I don't see how a boy ray disc set could be so bad. I own several other blu rays and have never seen ones look like this. I honestly think it's a bootleg ...will be contacting amazon for further investigation"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a Scam","review":"There is no difference between this edition and the US edition, advertised as origional UK version is misleading. I was hoping to see some difference since we own the US limited edition set...there is none, so if your thinking this Uk edition is different in some way...its not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whose in Charge!!!!","review":"Class still shows when it comes to watching how the upstairs-clan over-ride the downstairs-clans. Maggie Smith is at her best which lines and looks that could kill. The entire cast is very well played and the humor is very, very stylish.

Looking forward toSeason 3."},{"rating":"2","title":"Limited Edition Set-Seasons 1 & 2: I love it!","review":"There's a reason why people talk about this series over the water cooler at work the next day--it's that good. It's a high-brow Brit soap opera, equally at home with a bowl of popcorn (for the soap opera bits) or a fine wine, for the well done, good show, aspects that the British bring to these period dramas.BLUE-RAY Edition: Quite simply drop dead gorgeous. One of the most beautiful blu-ray sets I've bought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well writen drama!","review":"Downton Abbey is a great novel that is on television.

I have fallen completely under it's spell!! My husband & I have had a \\"Downton Abbey\\" marathon over the New Year's holiday--MUCH better than dealing with crowds in bars & restaurants! I HIGHLY recommend this series & can't wait to see the new season!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Up With Downton Abbey!","review":"Far be it from me to row against the tide of critics and fans that lavish praise on this highly acclaimed series. Downton Abbey is Marianas Trench deep in the category of chic flic, and if you're bored some night, check out the hysterical clips of women watching Downton Abbey together. But I'm a guy who likes sci-fi and action flicks. And even so, on the evenings when I've been entrapped into watching Downton Abbey, painful as it is to admit, I LIKE it. And if it can reach across the high boundaries that separate my flm genres from my wife's, my daughter's, and my female co-workers, it DESERVES a five star rating!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Series that you cannot stop watching!","review":"I needed to catch up from seasons one and two before season 3 began and this was perfect.

I couldn't believe it when the storyline jumped forward so abruptly. I went on pbs' website to determine which episodes are missing. I ordered season 3 on amazon when it became available; I can only hope it is complete."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good upper-class soap.","review":"This is a great series if you want to follow very different characters along the paths that they (or fate) choose. The upstairs, downstairs effect has been a hit before and is again, and you are equally drawn to both, but perhaps slightly more to the downstairs, where people can show their emotions more. You come to love the locale, with its magnificent cedars of Lebanon gracing the property, and the house, as they say, is a character in itself. This is a great showpiece for some good acting from both tried and true personages of stage and film as well as newer, younger break-outs. It will be interesting to see where they turn up next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I purchased this to catch up on the series before the new season started. It is great and our family had a mini DA Sunday marathon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great television!","review":"The writing, acting and production are all first-rate! The quality of the DVDs also were great. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't stop watching!","review":"My friends got me on to this series last summer. I bought myself the box set for Christmas. It is written really well, and very captivating. It won't let you down. I promise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Downton Abbey Seasons 1 & 2 set - Original U.K. version","review":"I missed out early on watching the series so early in season three, I purchased the whole set - seasons one and two and then a separate purchase of season three. Additional program segments in dvd set very nice and well worth the purchase price. A good value!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Box Set - But Missing \\"Christmas at Downton Abbey\\" , the series finale of Season Two","review":"Everything about this splendid box set is a keeper - with the exception of the missing series finale for Season Two. As the box set credits proudly proclaim it to contain the \\"Uncut U.K. Version\\", perhaps this last episode (running time of 1:38) was not broadcast as part of the Second Season in the U.K., but as a stand-alone broadcast.In any event, I returned my box set, as it doesn't make much sense to be completely enthralled in the second season only to have to find the finale on iTunes!p.s. I must give Amazon due credit, as they were very quick to respond to my email and issued a full credit to my account immediately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Downton Abbey","review":"Excellent series. Awesome acting, whether one likes the characters or not.

I don't know anyone who doesn't like it. I bought this set because I missed Seasons 1 & 2 and wanted to catch up before watching Season 3 on TV. I only gave it four stars because the discs were slightly problematic. The first disc stopped playing part way through and I had to fiddle around with it. The rest were okay for me. I loaned the discs to a friend so she too could catch up and she had some problems with the other discs but then cleaned them and they were okay. I don't know why they would need cleaning being brand new and not being handled with dirty hands. If the discs hadn't been a problem I would have rated this set five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"This show is wonderful!","review":"I love this show! The costumes are beautiful, the characters are really interesting, There is always something going on, either upstairs or downstairs with the house help. If you haven't seen it from the beginning, I would recommend that you buy the first two seasons and catch up before watching the third season. I started watching with the third season and while you can still enjoy the show, you will understand what is going on much better. I don't know the difference between the American version and the UK version, but after reading the other reviews, I bought the UK version. I would definitely recommend this edition of Downton Abbey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series","review":"We have really enjoyed watching this series - very entertaining and we've learned alot about that timeframe. I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the show! This set has it all.","review":"The Limited Edition Set covers the entire 1st & 2nd season including Christmas Specials and season finales. This is not to be missed TV.

A most have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Show","review":"You better carve out some time for this purchase. I bought this as a Christmas gift for my parents and now we're all addicted. Great and entertaining series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Downton all over again!","review":"This 2-season set is just what we needed to bridge the time we must wait until season 3 comes out in the U.S. We're loving the extra scenes (when we notice them) and are grateful for basic features such as subtitles (for my elderly father -- who is hooked on Downton). The sale price was a bonus, so a great buy all around. Bring on season 3!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Downton Abbey 1&2","review":"My husband and I have thoroughly enjoyed watching Downton Abbey. We will be sad when we've completed watching all of Season 1&2. I will be placing an order for Season 3 when it comes out in January. Great entertainment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Obviously a 'masterpiece'","review":"For those of us that remember the original 'Forsyte Saga' and 'Upstairs Downstairs', 'Downton Abbey' is a so-so programme. It is hardly filled with great acting - obviously sets and costumes are 'spot on', but do I really care if Mary and Matthew get together or not? I am much more interested in the driver and the daughter and whether Mr. Bates get free or not ............. but only up to a point! We have been driven NUTS here about this show thanks to PBS who have shown it, reshown it and shown it again in order to build up the audience for Series 3, which was aired last night ..... yawn! So why did I buy this 'special UK version'? It was a present for someone."},{"rating":"1","title":"The series is great mines just came broken","review":"I got this as a present for a friend and all the cds with the episodes are fully functional except the cd with the special features came cracked i would return it but since i gave it as a present i cant really ask for it back just to return it for a new one. Aside from the unusable special features cd, this is a really great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie is great!","review":"The reason I gave it one star is because it plays jerky on my dvd player. I think it is my player. I have seen it online where other people say it plays jerky on theirs also. Be careful that it will play on yours. I bought another dvd player and it wouldn't play on it either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Season 1","review":"We just watched season 1 and there were only 2 episodes?? What are we missing?

I was pleased that it arrived on time, but I did not opend package and did not play the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I had to give it one star for the scenery for that period of time. As for the dialogue, I didn't understand it They don't talk good. Who learned them? I didn't see any sub-titles. If you like soap operas this one is for you. Read somewhere there was 15 hours of this joke on the DVD. Not so. I was more than disappointed for the 6 hours I viewed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Downton Abbey Season ! & 2","review":"Perfect as advertised! Good condition and great, probably best TV I've seen in a long time. This is must see TV!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a big series fan, but I loved this","review":"All three age groups in this household love it. It has every human emotion, quirk, points-of-view, goodness and badness. The castle is magnificent, and the costumes were perfect! I will be sorry if it ends anytime soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic quality set for Season 1&2 of Downton Abbey","review":"There is too much to say about this show. It is brilliant. Being expertly written, produced, and acted, this show is suitable for both genders, and anyone over the age of 12 (as there is some material that wouldn't be suitable viewing for young children). The show keeps it realistic and captivating with true-to history events, lifestyle, and cultures, which is just something you don't find too often in todays over-the-top-sexed and overly-violent-blood-thirsty TV dramas that will do anything shocking for ratings. This show is a massive international success because they keep it classy, keep it realistic, and do it SO well. I highly recommend this show to anyone over the age of 12, and I can't wait for season 3!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Escape to Downton","review":"Received this dvd set as a gift because I had missed it on tv. Immediately I was absorbed into the world of Downton, the culture, the traditions, the family. It is set in a different world and time but intertwines the stories of the rich with the world of the servants. All storylines are interesting and relevant and the twists and turns make it very interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"In love with the series","review":"In love with the series, but did not join in until series 3. This caught me up to the whole story. Loved it, did not stop watching for hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"Great series. Wish there were more episodes each season. Will buy season three and future seasons and told all my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely fantastic","review":"Like most viewers I have been delighted by this series. So I won 't repeat all that has been said. I watched it on CBS when it aired (thank you CBS for the quality you put on air, what a change from other stations!) but the advantage with a DVD is that you can rewind when you missed some of the dialogue. As I am french speaking from Canada, sometimes some of it escapes me. And there are also the subtitles who help a lot. I have also bought season 3, and of course I am anxious to see season 4, hoping that it will be just as good as the previous ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Downton Abbey Seasons 1 and 2","review":"Downton Abbey Seasons 1 and 2 CDs were good quality. We enjoyed watching them immensely and would recommend them to anybody interested in the life of the rich during the Edwardian era."},{"rating":"2","title":"Downton Abbey Seasons 1 & 2","review":"We got hooked on Downton Abbey after watching the first episode in Season Three.

I would recommend this to anyone who loves the Jane Austen movie adaptations and/or Masterpiece Theater."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Excellent series, script, acting, location, storyline...exceeded all my expectations. I am already looking forward to season 3, as I'm sur eit will be as good as seasons 1 and 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as expected.","review":"Unfortunately, I would have liked to rate this as EXCEEDED my expectations, but cannot do so in good conscience. It was enjoyable and in my favorite style, 'period drama', but sometimes the characters seemed a bit too predictable, and left me feeling maybe they would improve over time? Characters were a bit two-dimensional. Story line as well. On the positive side, I loved the set and costumes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super!!!!","review":"We fell in love with this series when it first began, and have followed all along. Looking forward to season 4, but sorry they killed Mathew off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timely shipment.....but no gift card enclosed.","review":"Shipment was quick. However, Amazon did not include the \\"gift card\\" in the shipment. The receiving party did not know who the gift was from. She spent the next 45 days asking people she knew if they had sent her the gift. Anyway, that was the only negative itme to mention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the series!!","review":"I love watching the series and seeing how the aristocracy and the servants \\"lived\\" and worked together.

We will most likely finish before season 3 ends on TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful !","review":"I love this series, and this collection is great as it is the un-cut edition, although PBS didn't take much out when it broadcast the episodes. The storyline is beautifully interwoven and the interactions between the characters is interesting and compelling. I can't wait for the next series. If you love Downton Abbey as much as I do, buy this collection and enjoy it over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"ready for season 3","review":"gave this as a gift for Christmas and now the giftee is ready for season 3 while yet another family member, who lives in England and has already seen season 3 has been caught up on what took place before that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Great show with fantastic characters that I have fallen in love with.

Its rare to find a show as wonderful as this"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best TV series ever made!!!","review":"So many of my friends insisted DA was one of the best TV series ever made, and still I resisted watching it for almost two years. Then I received an iPad for Christmas, caught a bad cold, and decided to stream the 1st episode while recuperating in bed...I couldn't stop streaming...and streaming...Afterwards I knew I had to get my family to start watching it so I bought the DVDs. We are all hooked! I bought Season 3 even before the PBS broadcasting in the US was over. We've watched all 3 seasons more than twice, and we can't wait for Season 4 to start in October, 2013!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Now I See What All the Fuss is About","review":"So many friends have been talking about this series, so now I finally know why.

So the UK version is completely original and uncut"},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS STILL THE EDITED VERSION","review":"I bought this thinking it would be the original uk version without half of the scenes being cut out. I feel angry about the false advertising. It is cut and is not the original uk version. If you want the uncut version I don't know where to get it. I want my money back, as this was not what it says it is on the packaging.DO NOT BUY IF YOU WANT THE WHOLE EPISODE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If I could give it a galaxy of stars I would!","review":"So my husband and I are hooked on the Abbey. Refreshing escape from swearing and slang and slovenly manners. The location is a feast. The script is supper all by itself. The actors make you forget they are acting. Take a vacation without leaving the Lazyboy. Drama, love, sibling rivalry, class warfare, humor. Have a generous helping with your tea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Had to catch up!","review":"Everyone has been talking about Downton Abbey and numerous awards have been given to this series, so I decided to \\"catch up.\\" Am I ever happy I did.

Anyway, I'm pretty upset, especially since the \\"Original UK Version\\" is exactly the same thing as what was on Netflix.

Penny Rimbaud and Crass represented the real anarchists of the day. This great book delves into Penny's life and the life of \\"Wally Hope\\". \\"The Last of the Hippies\\" (the last part of the book) scared me to death, because it reminded me just what the government can do to people. Rimbaud is an excellent writer whose brilliant style will take on a journey through his revolting life. A must read for anyone who considers themselves an anarchist."},{"rating":"1","title":"not great","review":"I used these placemats for only about two weeks.

Also when received they had/have a terrible smell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best placemats ever","review":"The other review rating these DII placemats as a 1 is a mistake of Amazon; the low rating is for the plastic placemats only, not the cotton. These ribbed cotton placemats are the real deal--thick, sturdy, washable, and dryable in the machine and on the line. I've purchased these for years and I'm still using the original buys. They're great basics--freeing you to have fun with all kinds of napkins. I have Luna ware--solid pottery china in different colors, like Fiesta--and it's fun to mix and match the different dish colors with the various placemat colors. I've seen similar solid-colored cotton placemats at big-box stores that are cheaper at $1.99 each, but they're too thin. These DII ones are just the right weight. Since discovering this brand, I've taken most of my others to Goodwill--even cotton, washable ones that aren't practical in the end because they curl up and/or wrinkle, such as ones from April Cornell. I use these DII placemats every day, and wash them once a week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice for price, though don't hold shape well","review":"These placemats are very nice, exactly as pictured, durable.

He's a singing storyteller who is in a league of his own. I can hardly articulate what I find most impressive about Dwight, and what appeals to me about this particular album. It's beautifully stark, traditional yet contemporary, the lyrics are honest and descriptive, the production is fine and music first-rate. This album is classic, just like Dwight. Part of the making of a Legend. No wonder Buck Owens and Johnny Cash liked him and thought of him as a worthy successor. He was and still is.

I bought this thinking it might celebrate girls who enjoy doing both team sports AND dance (like so many girls I know DO), but this presents it as an either/or choice. It's great to encourage girls to do the team sports, but is it really necessary to tear down the other pursuit? My 6 year-old daughter was very disappointed. Baseball Ballerina Strikes Out is a better choice, though it doesn't really deal with dance, but the conflict is about handling teasing.

This video is serious and educational, and appropriate for little children (unlike the other National Geographic video, also titled Volcano, subtitled Nature's Inferno, which I feel is a little too graphic for young audiences on the devastation caused by volcanoes). This video also captures a bit of the \\"love story\\" of the greatest husband-wife pair in the history of volcano study and their pursuit of erupting volcanoes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Volcano!","review":"This was not the correct video that the title box represented.

I bought one, proceeded up into my attic to cut some holes for some can lights I was putting in.. Laying on my belly across like 3-4 rafters and this thing just kept jamming on me.. Didn't seem to matter how perfectly perpendicular I held it, it just kept getting stuck.. It wouldn't even go all the way through, I ended up using the blades to puncture the last little bit, turn the blade a bit and puncture, turn the blade and puncture... HORRIBLE!!! I cut 3 holes with it before i gave up and went back to my old fashioned gun drywall saw...LOOK AWAY NOW!!! WHILE YOU STILL CAN!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This thing is dangerous","review":"This thing just doesn't work, and furthermore will, more than likely, hurt you. It doesn't really cut, and it catches constantly, resulting in all the torque being tranmsitted to your wrist -- if you're not careful it could conceivably break your wrist or arm. When it catches it screws up the adjustment on the blades, resulting in an incorrect diameter hole, assuming you're able to get through the drywall eventually, so you can't even use it to scribe a good circle for your jab saw. Save your arms, wrists, and money and don't buy this piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Throws dust everywhere -","review":"Not apparent from the picture but the shield spins around along with the hole cutter which is made of two pieces of steel that are bent at the ends and a thin layer of carbide grit added. More dust is spread all around the room then using either a rotozip or a hand saw or even an electric reciprocating saw. The blades are not going to cut through the wood or metal lath with a plaster ceiling or through a tongue and groove wood ceiling. No way to limit the cutting depth to avoid cutting into a pipe or wire.It is the kind of tool I would gift to someone I strongly disliked - anonymously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Speaker hole saw","review":"I used this on the largest setting and was not impressed.

The clear plastic dish is pretty useless for dust control. I supposed it did catch the small debri. Good luck if you are working with anything denser than typical sheet rock. The cutting edges are thin pieces of steel with the sharpness of a butter knife. It got the job done but if your are installing circular speakers in your living room, be prepared to do a lot of clean-up afterwards."},{"rating":"1","title":"What you pay is what you get.","review":"I returned it. For the price it's just adequate, I guess I expected more. The padding is real thin and there's only one backpack strap, so when you put it on, your guitar is sticking out diagonally and I keep bumping the guitar into walls and people. Over all poor quality.

That was during the time Drum N Bass was invading the States. I was impressed by not only Ben Watt's production at the time but the somber, angelic character of Tracey Thorne's vocals. When I heard this album, Idlewild, for the first time just recently, I was pleasantly surprised. This was a stretch from their drum n bass or house phase. Mad chill. This, I learned, was EBTG in its nacent stages. I mean...damn...look at the cover. The two look like they just came from a happy little date watching the Duran Duran or Scritti Polliti (remember them?). I was digging it though. I didn't even know Ben Watt can sing like that prior to hearing this. He's a smooth jazzy cat, and Tracey Thorne of course delivers. This album is something I wanna drop when just lounging at the crib yearning a Calgon moment or cooking a meal for someone. If you're in the mood for something like that, cop this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best cd they ever made","review":"This is one of my top three cds, ever.

My foundation of religion did not go into detail in many areas, and this book consolidates pertinent information in readily accessible categories. I like the way the topics are organized and indexed, and how there are sufficient biblical references to allow for targeted study with the narrative for each subject discussed. The format of the book provides easy access to any area of concern, so you are free to delve into any topic at any point in the book, and do not have to be bogged down in seeking what you want to find, as in so many other books, helpful as they may be. I highly recommend this book to anyone who desires a useful reference for Christian topics to study, and for truly great reassurance in Christian living."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wanted more!","review":"I felt the writer could of used more scripture though in some of his topics. Not that I disagreed with all his assumptions, but I could see how a person with a differing opinion would want more scripture. I feel some of the topics he wrote on just required more... I guess the book was probably written as a general overview and not an exaustive work on each subject so it served its purpose.Overall this was a decent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent bedtime spiritual snacks!","review":"I only use \\"snack\\" to describe the chapters in this book because the subjects are offered in manageable amounts of nourishing, informative, fulfilling and soul satisfying nourishment.

Now, about 100 pages into it, I wonder why I am still reading it at all. The characters are underdeveloped, the story is boring and whoever edited or proof read this book should be fired. The only reason I have for finishing this book is that I have never stopped reading a book because I didn't like it. Also, I want to see how much more cliched it can get. Whichever reviewer said Ms. Curran was following in Stephen King's footsteps, I feel, is mistaken.

Davy Crockett fans will be particularly pleased that 20 verses of The \\"Ballad of Davy Crockett\\" are included.This collection is not exhaustive. The book is not particularly pretty--there are no pictures aside from the cover.

I find short passages that mention a gruesome death or injury and just go on to the next page. My main interest in using this book is for ESOL students whose reading levels are low but need American history lessons. This book fits the bill in history and reading level but I wonder if the book could have been written with a more comfortable fit.

Every bit seems a half-baked rehash of Louder Than Hell, but with less heart, including the Jesus bit, the gay stuff, etc. The relationship stuff here feels extra-nasty, if that's possible. Not that Louder Than Hell was a rosy walk in the park, but it was much more fresh and original the first time around.

[Side note: I'd never write a Star Wars or Star Trek novel, but if Chalker ever asked me to write a Well World novel, he wouldn't have to ask twice.] Every Well novel has been brilliant; the last three were superior, but read much like variations on the original theme. Now he has integrated new scientific & technological knowledge into the Well mythos AND done something completely new with the concept. Besides that, virtually no one besides Chalker of whom I know has done so well in making aliens both understandable to us and at the same time so clearly not like us at all. I am awaiting the sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gone to the well once too often","review":"I am an avid fan of Jack Chalker and have read all the previous Well World series with great enthusiasm but this latest two book set in the series was a major disappointment. The author creates detailed and interesting back story on all the major characters in book one and then practically dumps it all in book two in what amounts to a rush to finish the story. The point at which Wally steals the straight gate piece is amateur. And the ending when Ming and Ari are resolving basically the rest of their lives after their personal and emotional ordeal on the Well World and then end up in a tryst to end book 2 tells me that Chalker cared less for these characters than a non-fan. It almost feels like the author was limited to 2 books on this story and cut corners accordingly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Off the mark, cheaply done","review":"Okay my 2.5 year old loves trains. But he doesn't just love pictures of trains, he loves the sounds- the chuffing, the whistles, the clackety-clack. He loves to study a scene before it cuts to the the next. I had to give this video a low rating because all it has is train scenes set to music. Hardly any train sounds and the scenes cut much to quickly for an interested child to digest. The whole video is smothered in this uppity folk music which is horribly repetitive. My son gave this a mild reaction and really hasn't asked to see it again much, which is remarkable. Now that being said, I finally got \\"Choo-Choo Trains Up Close...\\". That one is by far his favorite video in his entire library. Ahead of Elmos and Barneys he just loves the visuals and sounds.

First of, there are two UK hits \\"Too Youbng to Be Married\\" a somewhat sappy but still touching mini Soap Opera, and the incredibly catchy \\"Gasoline Alley Bred\\" whichis a real great sing along number. Then there are a lot of choice album cuts. \\"Man Without a Heart\\" is just about perfect. \\"Frightened Lady\\" is an impassione ant-war number. \\"Little Girl\\" has some heartfelt countrified harmony. The only real clunker is \\"Marigold; Gloria Swansong\\", a leftover from the Butterfly album that tries hard to be Eleanor Rigny but misses by a mile.

But this one was really disappointing, Renee Fleming sings in very operatic style, she is wobbly in many places. There was one German song which I kind of like, the Wiegendlied, and Abends duet was OK, but most of this album is very overdone vocally. Several pieces are done very slow, dragged out, others are too fast, like the Mozart Laudate Dominum. I heard many other opera singers in such material and they sound lot better.I found this Sacred Songs collection to be bland and very sugary. The final Amazing Grace was crazy, I did not like it either. If you want a good Christmas collection, get the Christmas album by Il Divo, it has many real Christmas songs. Bocelli's Sacred Arias album is also good, and he sings in a very natural way, very emotional."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lets not get carried away here!","review":"No offense to Miss Renee Fleming and her fans but...I dunno, if people who love this think Sarah Brightman's an operasinger..they completely misunderstood that Renee Fleming is very different compared to those crossover artists. Gounod, Faure, Franck, Bach and Handel aren't crossover-territory. Much less Charlotte Church territory. Crossover's fine, as are some of its leading men & ladies. But mixing an operasinger singing this repertoire with crossover artists....Apples & oranges. And what does the cover have to do with anything? Seriously, Fleming's fans should be less touchy and her detractors should let the bloodhound-mentality go. Both parties are looking like fools now. As for the recording: 3.75 stars. I was close to giving 3 stars, but then her voice per se deservers better. So 3.75 stars out of five. Great christmas-gift for my grandma!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland","review":"This is such a bizarre collection, many popular pieces cobbled together for no reason. The Amazing Grace stands out like a sore thumb, and Faure and Messiah pieces are completely out of sync.Only the duet with Graham is OK, maybe good for Christmas. My guess is that the label wanted a crossover type collection to cash in on the popularity of best selling acts like Bocelli and Il Divo. Fleming does not have the looks of Sarah Brightman but she tries to imitate her style anyway, with soft singing and mushy diction, in many languages. Her French is particularly bad. Even the English pieces are not very clear, which is just as well, because the lyrics of the Simple Song are so silly anyway. Many songs are sung in strange tempi, very slow or very fast, and embellished too much, but the main feeling is indeed sugary blandness.This album will be waste of money for anybody interested in opera, but some crossover fans may like it, if they can tolerate Fleming's heavy vibrato and very round tone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Her Vocal Quality is Slipping","review":"I won't repeat the faults found in many of the other reviews. Like most of Fleming's vocal interpretations I find her album cover picture to be oh so pretentious and precious rather than \\"beautiful\\" as some reviewers have found. Was that \\"I am So Wonderful and Here I am Dreaming\\" picture necessary? Her voice has become heavy and her mannerisms less than welcome. And the songs comprise a veritable hotch potch of overly recorded numbers with her singing varying from fine to \\"Oh My God, what was that\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed again","review":"I am always at a loss to understand why singers insist on singing music unsuited to their voices. I saw this concert on tv, and I was appalled at the vocal manipulation it took for Fleming to sing the Mozart Laudamus Te from the c minor mass, for one example, not to mention the fact that the version she chose to sing left out the difficult passages; I don't ever want to hear her sing anything from the Messiah again.Another dreadful CD to avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Let me just preface my comments by saying that I am a huge Fleming fan and consider her pretty much the gold standard for good singing, musical intelligence and character interpretation. (Her Manon! Her Countess! Her Desdemona! Her Rusalka...) Maybe that's why I'm so disappointed by this one. I'd figured a sublime singer and sublime material couldn't miss. But this recording is just so odd. In some spots it's overly produced and in others she seems oddly disengaged from the material. And very rushed. The Laudate Dominum seemed way too fast. And as someone else noted, the Panis Angelicus was atrocious. The flute intro was so wrong in so many ways. Way too bright and chirpy for such a profoundly devotional song. Cecilia Bartoli's prayerful rendition on \\"A Hymn for the World 2\\" (with Myung-Whun Chung) makes Renee's version seem circus-like. I just can't help but think Miss Fleming knows better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Il Divine Sacred Collection","review":"I thought this album was a real stinker but I have seen the light! I was so wrong! This is the best Christmas store album ever! I love listening to such soothing music when I am shopping, especially when all this wonderful junk is on sale! I fully support changing the name of this collection to \\"Holy Mysteries Deep Within My Bosom\\" too, that would be totally magical.I even have come to appreciate the stylistic choices like that interesting flute solo in Panis Angelicus, or the very very special version of Amazing Grace. Such wild trilling in Laudate Dominum or these crazy Messiah pieces, it all makes sense. Yes, Renee is having fun, she is finally free of boring old stuffy \\"classical music\\" section. Vive Le Crossover!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice","review":"After buying her Daphne I got into a sentimental mood and picked this up. While I agree that it's a tad sugary sometimes I see no particular reason to slam this when compared to ridiculous crossover singing of these poor pieces. Renee's style may not always be spot on, I think her Bel Canto adventure was dreadful, but this is a very nice album. It is perfect for Christmas or holidays, it's fun to put it in to sweeten up a dark moment or just to be thrilled by a gorgeous voice singing simple, yet very beautiful music. Even if some may dislike Renee's operatic approach to this and others think she doesn't sing it operatically enough, I like it. It's a harmless CD, soon to be forgotten like other similar releases by Tebaldi, Sutherland, te Kanawa, Bartoli, Jo etc. In the end it's her operatic legacy that counts, not a pretty album filled with songs that are, thank God, not sung by crossover artists this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Commercial Yet Beautiful Yet Oddly Bland","review":"First I will say that I adore Renee Fleming with all my heart and that some of her discs have found a very very special place in my collection. This however will not be one of them. I have a feeling that Renee was slightly bored herself recording this disc of rehased \\"sacred\\" greatest hits...much like Barbra Streisand's Movie Album this disc is filled with soporific orchestrations and murky arrangements in which the rich, honeyed tones that make Renee Fleming who she is get lost. I would imagine that her record company made her do this disc for commercial reasons.While her voice is amazing this disc is most certainly not.

In the case of Rosslyn, the authors often quote their previous authored works or the work of others that have quoted other publications. In one case, the authors drew a major conclusion and quoted The Sign and the Seal (Harrison) as the source who had decifered the French text of the Rule of the Templars. Since I owned and had read both books I checked out the quote. Not only was the supposed quote non-existant in Harrison's book, it didn't exit in the original Rule of the Templars either.

I loaned it to some friends also interest in the history of the Knights Templar, the Freemasons, and the Holy Grail. Only one finished it and he said he would not recommend it.Let me put it this way, if you knew someone whom you wanted to \\"initiate\\" into this sort of study (i.e. Rosslyn Chapel, Rennes le Chateau, Holy Grail, etc.) this is not the book to give them. They will think you are a New Ager. However, if that is your thing this might be the book for you.

Lincoln practiced law for a quarter of a century, gave major speeches on the meaning of the constitution, followed the constitutional requirements on suspending the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus--at least the leading constitutional lawyer in Congress, Reverdy Johnson, the patriarch of the American Bar, Horace Binney, and the profesor of constitutional law at Harvard thought.

Again, I do enjoy most music of the genre, but the music must be of a certain level of quality and the lyrics of some originality. Neither can be found on the self-titled Bulletboys debut album.Case in point: The opening number, is an okay track, but it is their BEST track! \\"Smooth Up In Ya\\" is an awful number, yet their only bonafide hit, which qualifies this garage band of VH wanabees as a genuine \\"one-hit wonder\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bulletboys at their Best","review":"If you're a child of the glam era, Bulletboys is a must-have!

While all the songs are great here, in my opinion 3 outshine the rest; the singles \\"Smooth Up In Ya\\" and \\"For the Love of Money\\" and the difficult to pronounce \\"F#9\\".

This mentally challenged person known as Radio teaches the community what is and should be important. The story is moving on so many levels.

'You Turn Me On'; 'Poor But Honest'; 'Fizz'; 'This Sporting Life'; 'Too Many Cars on the Road' and, as far as I know, the other tracks on this album were recorded by this band in 1964. They were brilliant 'Live'! .. Ian was a true showman! Their stage appearance and funky humourous R&B style just blew us all away! As far as I recall 'You Turn Me On' hit #4 in the US Hot 100. A true collectors item .. this album is a little piece of history! Hope you're still rockin' Ian, you certainly did then!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Timeless? Nah.","review":"I think Dennis Miller is one of the brightest comedians out there today, but this CD is in no way representative of that. Given Miller's penchant for jamming as many pop-culture references into his monologues as possible, the material is very dated, and he seems to be relying on that and his ironic stance to carry him through--it gets kind of old. I listened to this once, and feel no need to revisit it again. Ten years or so down the road now, Miller has a cable tv show and has compiled his \\"Rants\\" into audiobook form (now up to three, as I remember)--these hold up much better. You can hear his mind working on more substantive material instead of the trivia, and he is just naturally funny in his ticked-off way. To put it plain--he has gotten better since this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am so impressed!","review":"I teach violin and fiddle.

This is an album I've owned for several years now, and I continue to bring it out and enjoy it often. As a violinist and violin teacher, I also have my students listen to it to give them another musical perspective that is mature and developed (as well as beautiful, inventive and fun, of course!).

More Like Too Choppy","review":"With a good cast and quirky characters, this movie lacked something in the substance. The characters were a little over done (a.k.a.

It's easy to see why it took three years and a name change to get a distributor...for a straight to video release. As we said three years ago:You would think that Neve would use a small role in a self-produced flick to try new things. Only Neve doesn't have new things. The film only goes to show that right now Neve has a pretty limited acting range.

A lot of fun to watch and damn funny.I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"except for the noxema girl, this movie sucked!!!!","review":"This had to be the worst movie I have ever seen. The only reason I bought this is because on the box it said in the tradition of American Pie, which I love. American Pie, this movie is not. The lead character is supposed to be this big time player. In short he has no skills of how a true player is. Dude, when you play a girl you are not supposed to tell her what you feel or even fall for her. What a Jabrone. Whoever wrote this movie should have done a little research. Besides all that the acting and the plot were horrible and unwatchable. I searched my dvd only to see Rebecca Gayheart aka \\"The Noxema Girl\\". As Heavy D once said\\"got nothin' but love for ya!\\" If you want to see a good movie on being a player get Def Comedy Jams \\"How to be a Player\\" with Bill Bellamy, you can't go wrong with this. I give that movie 5 stars!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"spend yout time elsewhere.","review":"Just because Rebecca Gayheart is gorgeous, it doesn't make this movie worth renting. I wish I rented Whipped again and I didn't like that movie either. Next time I am clueless on what to rent and pick a low budget movie like this one, I'll stick with my DVD collection and watch Road Trip for the billionth time, (at least it's funny). The cute combo of Katie Wright and Gayheart was the only reason I was able to make it through this movie. Other than that, it stunk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truely Amazing","review":"This cartridge always gives me moments of speechless awe.

I just dug this out of storage and watched it again the other day. Actually only the live footage even sort of looks like red-blue anaglyph and that's probably because of stage lighting! Either the band thought that viewing anything through red-blue glasses made it 3-D or it is simply a marketing gimick.Note to the band: Some inventive video here, but next time use a Nu-View 3-D camcorder adapter (widely available for under $300) and make a REAL 3-D music video!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good ideas","review":"I may not use theses lessons exactly has they are but there are a lot of ideas to be taken from this book.

They were actually good, despite my misgivings about freeze dried cooked eggs. I actually liked them better and found them tastier than the powdered eggs that are often camp fare.The \\"eggs\\" look like big \\"cheese puffs\\" in the package. We added the water, let them stand a little bit longer than the directions asked for, drained off the excess water and dumped them on a plate. They looked like scrambled eggs! The flavor and texture were both reasonably good, although a bit too salty for my tastes. The bacon taste was just right too. Overall, I was surprised and pleased. This has become a \\"must have\\" for our backpacks now, and it definitely beats that off flavor of scrambled powdered eggs."},{"rating":"1","title":"No breakfast for me.","review":"Mountain House makes great camp food, but these are the first true disappointment from this brand.

The Plextor device driver installation was made without problem (so the InterVideo WinDVD Creator Software). The box works fine. You get a MPEG format file as result from capturing analog video (Beware : this MPEG file ,wich Plextor says it's a MPEG2 format, can't be opened by Pinnacle Systems Studio Plus software as a MPEG2 file). If you want the best quiality video in your final DVD or Video File, then this device is not for you. No comparison between the Plextor PX-AV100U and the USB Moviebox Deluxe regarding the output video quality (With Moviebox you get a very superior video quality ). About InterVideo WinDVD Creator Software, it has the basics. Easy of using it, but runs much slower than the Studio Plus when generating a video file.

Like i said, if you would love to see some great bass playing, you need to check his dvd out. Even if your not a hardcore bass guitar fan like I am, im very sure that you will love this dvd.

It is a little short and the audio mix is pretty poor (the bass is a bit buried for my tastes, especially because is a Marcus Miller- led band!), but the performances are killer, and it's definitely worth a look and a listen.Kenny Garrett and Patches Stewart both contribute well on their horns, and the keyboardists do well also; Morris Pleasure (who's also the musical director for Earth, Wind, and Fire!) plays great keyboard bass under Marcus' soloing, and the other guy on keys (whose name escapes me!) sure makes some goofy faces, but his solos are killer.And then, of course, there's Marcus and Poogie Bell, who provide a solid foundation anyone would die for.Overall, not the best sound and a bit short, but DEFINITELY worth the trip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Home VHS 8-Hour Mode Quality Video - Audio Even Worse","review":"I bought this from Amazon.com and I don't understand all the positive reviews.

With video and audio that appear to be the product of someone's $199 VHS camcorder set for 8-hour economy mode, all I can say is that both audio and video are beyond horrible. It's not even 1980's homemade kid's birthday-quality video. Like a VHS copy of a VHS copy of a VHS copy! The audio is totally washed out. Think 1970's 19.99 portable cassette-recorder with a $4.99 Radio Shack microphone...Or as if recorded from the $199 camcorder's on-board microphone.

The action on bicycles in this movie started a freestyle frenzy all over the world. Guy's like Eddie Fiola and Martin Aparijo played a significant part in the film. When I first saw this movie I begged my parents to buy me a freestyle bike to do the tricks I saw in the film, that was in 86 and I still consider BMX to be an important part of my life, thanks to this film. Bmx did not fade out, look at DAve Mirra, if anything it has certainly grew. This movie is hard to find and it is something I treasure very much.

This one started out with some interesting dynamics....spies who may or may not be traitors...sleeper agents headed to LA and a presidential negotiation.The ending, however, seemed slapped together, predictable, and I imagined an editor barking, \\"Listen, you've got til tomorrow to get this on my desk.\\" A good tension-building P.I. novel can't rely on clues and discoveries that are simply too coincidental or unrealistic. This one does. Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"This one is necessary reading for die-hard Spenser fans like myself, but it's almost like taking bitter medicine. Candy Sloan is the most repulsive Parker female yet, a stereotype of a 'spunky girl reporter' who gets what she wants by batting her eyes and unzipping her pants. Yet for some reason Spenser finds her irresistable, and for many books to come he will agonize over her death. If only the reader could be convinced that this turn of events was a deliberate attempt to humble Spenser the Superhero.... But I think it wasn't. I think Parker actually liked Candy, dim, short-sighted and manipulative as she was, and expected the reader to like her too. Yuck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs an editor","review":"The kindle edition looks like it was scanned in from hardcopy using a very poor OCR program. This edition is littered with missing punctuation and obvious scan errors. For instance 'clap' became 'dap'.

You would think that the price charged would mean somebody actually read this edition -- obviously not Dell's concern.

The author does not seem to know, how to present scientific and logical facts and, then build on a subject. He has a tendency to completely off the tangent. If I say anything more, it will only look very rude and mean spirited. If possible, I would have given this book a zero star but, alas that is not possible. So, I will give it a one star.Amazon should strongly think about having a policy as to how to deal with possible return of such kind books wherein the customer is very unhappy.I would instead anyday recommend the book 'Safety Integrity Level Selection' by Marszal and Schrapf for clear and logical presentation for the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"A clear and concise introduction","review":"A clearly written book usefull as an introduction to HAZOP & HAZAN.

I miss this cartoon and am glad I can now watch it any time I like. My son watches it all the time, and it's good clean fun. I enjoy the humor and antics of all the characters. It's a great cartoon series for adults as well as kids. I give it a \\"thumbs up\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"For those who love their film fried","review":"The Critic is an irreverent cartoon along the lines of the Family Guy and South Park. It celebrates the love of the Celebrity and Pop Culture, and although not as abscure as the other two shows, it remains to be edgy and dark, with sometimes ridiculous slapstick moments.There are some impressive, solid, and hilarious perfomances that never cease to stay true to the character being played. The line between actor Jon Loviz and the educated but simple minded charecter of Jay Sherman is so blured that any other live action film with the former is hard to watch without imagining this cartoon.It is true that the jokes and parodys of Hollywood Blockbusters littered throughout the series become a bit redundent. However, the show has moments of gold that can't be ignored, and it remains to be one of the most sharp and relentless cartoons created in the ninties."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two words: Crocodile Ghandi.","review":"This is as side-splittingly funny as I remembered it from TV. The fact that it was cancelled after -- what? One season? Two? -- says a great deal about the pedestrian and simple-minded tastes of Americans. The satires in this alone are worth the price; this is almost Monty Python-level humor. Lovitz really avoids all the pitfalls of playing a character based on himself -- he doesn't take the easy way out and make it about him. It was a gutsy and inspired choice, and shows his integrity as an artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated witty and well made series , buy and appreciate","review":"The Critic is one gem of animation. It's an intelligent, witty and well made work of art that it's a shame it got canceled so soon. I remember watching it as a kid, and laughing a lot, but now watching it again I get many jokes I didn't get before (lots of movie references for example).It's animation for grown ups, professional,with engaging episode plotlines on a whole different level than other shows like...let's say..Family Guy (plot?) I know, cheap shot, but the thing is, I hope current generations can enjoy good quality animation and don't get fooled by some of the low standards that prevail today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite TV series, a classic.","review":"I have never been as entertained with any other animated TV series as I am while watching the Critic. And that means a lot, coming from someone who is a devoted fan of the Simpsons. Knowing that this show was produced by the same producer as the Simpsons, I gave it a try and haven't been more pleased. Jon Lovitz is brilliantly depicted as a cartoon as a short, chubby, (gay?) film critic, who gives us his take on movies that just plain stink. The other voices are perfect for the characters of Jay's son Marty, his father Franklin/mother Eleanor, boss Duke, stylist Doris and of course all of the imitated actors. The humor is quirky, the plots are pointless yet wonderful and if you're looking for something a little different from the average TV cartoon, pop in the Critic and you're sure to be pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best show ever, not best dvds","review":"I love this show so much and I love being able to watch it again, the thing is the third disk would not work in my nice dvd player, others did fine, they did skip a little, and like I said my dvd player is fine, its not old or a bad brand at all, still I buy most my tv series on amazon because its cheaper.

Since they had only three good albums they filled their playlist with live songs and previously unreleased edits. Its horrible that they edited \\"Money for Nothing\\" from seven minutes to just under five! Unfortuneately, ALL greatest hits compilations have this edited version so that it is not possible to have \\"Sultans of Swing\\" and the full \\"Money for Nothing\\" on the same disc (without illegally burning a disc).

But I guess we're supposed to review his CD. Well, I have just finished listening to it for the second time and it's not any better. There's not much here but yet another John Mayer type who isn't as good a songwriter and not even close to the same caliber of singer. How this guy got to make a CD is anyone's guess, but just because he did doesn't mean it's any good. Believe me, it's not. All I can guess is that all the 5 star reviews on here are from his own fan club or street team because I can't believe that anyone would give this 5 stars.

The radio stations figured it out that he was just a knock off of John Mayer, and a bad one at that. I so can't believe that anyone actually bought this album. The other good news is that I didn't have to pay for it and then tossed it after listening. I once saw Ari play a show near my hometown and he was not bad, but also not great.

Even my six year old daughter rocks to this sound and demands it whenever she gets in the car. Every, yes every song, is excellent! I'm no pro critic, but Ari Hest has created a great Rock n Roll album that has everything including a voice that is matched perfectly with great bass, lead guitars, and drums that all create a sound you don't want to stop listening to.

McCall's 1975-76 #1 hit song \\"Convoy\\", about a group of truckers united against law enforcement abuse, while very vivid and full of redneck wit, simply could never have made for a very good film, no matter who directed or starred in it. The fact that the man behind the camera is Sam Peckinpah, the man behind such superb and disturbing films as THE WILD BUNCH and STRAW DOGS, just makes it pitiful. There's no point to the story. Subliminally, Peckinpah knew it--but drugged and boozed as he was, he never showed his disgust loud enough.Even given the appearances of such actors as Kris Kristofferson, Ali MacGraw, and Ernest Borgnine, CONVOY is an unfortunate terrible clinker, the nadir of a director's career.

Now I can not stress to you, the reader how much I deeply enjoy EVERY ONE of Gordon Lightfoot's albums, but this really was an embarrassment to his career. I'm not kidding when I say that voice aside, Tommy Smothers could have pulled this album off with the same emotional intensity and talent put in.DON'T BUY THIS! Download the first song IF IT SHOULD PLEASE YOU, then don't let this album taint the beautiful visual lyrics, instrumentation, voice, and feeling that the original versions possess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment","review":"This album is absolutely horrible. These are not the original releases of these songs. These are all atrocious recordings made in 1988.Gordon Lightfoot mumbles his way through this whole album, at times sounding disturbingly like the Swedish Chef from the old Muppets TV show. Even the new version of the Wreck of The Edmund Fitzgerald is unbearable listening. It's hard to believe that somebody at the record company actually allowed this album to be released."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bad and lousy second compilation disc of Gordon Lightfoot!","review":"Some of the tracks aren't bad from Gordon Lightfoot's in studio recordings but the rest sounds like live concert recordings on this Gord's Gold Volume 2 because \\"The Wreck of The Edmund Fitzgerald\\" song is performed differently and does not suit my taste at all in retrospective so take my advice just get Gord's Gold Volume 1 and Summertime Dream their way better albums than this one right here to tell you the truth folks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth a listen","review":"Recorded live on the floor, this is a fine album from Lightfoot and the long-time members of the Lightfoot band. Yes, the tracks do sound different than the studio versions fans have come to love over the years. But, if you enjoy the original version of The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald that much, why not buy Summertime Dream? It's one of the best albums Lightfoot has produced in his career. Since Gord has but one live album to his credit, Sunday Concert from more than 30 years ago, I like to think of Volume II as my opportunity to listen to Gord as if he's performing on stage. Unfortunately, there's no tracks from a few of his latter albums including Salute ('Whispers of the North' is a contender) and East of Midnight ('I'll Tag Along' and the title track are both strong cuts). 'If it Should Please You' is a nice treat, but another one or two new tracks wouldn't have hurt. Regardless, here's a chance to hear some of Gord's songs in a different way. Check it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointmenet","review":"I, like most other reviewers here have Greatest hits Volume 1 and looked forward to volume 2. I listened to it once and put it aside. I didn't realize at the time that most of the songs had been rerecorded. The new recordings are flat and Gordon's voice sounds strained and weak."},{"rating":"1","title":"huge disappointment","review":"Given that Gord's Gold Vol 1 is one of my favorite CD's, I had high expectations of Vol 2. The majority of songs on Vol 2 have been redone and sound cold and boring. I don't understand why unreleased material is included on this and other \\"greatest hits\\" CDs I've bought. I'll be selling this CD as the used CD store!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired, wooden performance. Few high spots.","review":"I have been a Lightfoot fan since the late 60's and I was quite dissapointed with this album. Unlike GG Vol.1 these re-recorded versions do not measure up to the originals much less surpass them. They may be technically superior but the overall performance is poor. Most are wooden and flat lacking the vitality that they had on their first go round. They all share the same background \\"echo\\" which I suppose is intended to make them sound \\"live\\" but only serves to make them sound \\"hollow\\". I did like the quieter version of Edmond Fitzgerald.I am sorry to say that I must agree with others that GL has not aged well. His lyrics and performance have both declined since the early 1980's. Stick with the original albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW WOW WOW","review":"Gordon Lightfoot is one of the worlds seven wonders.

The resource room was the place where kids with minor learning disabilities went to get help with school work. None of us wanted to be there so we had an incentive plan in which we could earn points for positive behavior and completion of our school work. The prizes were not very motivating-a few small toys, some candy, a comb and a tape of Gord's Gold 2.It was in that room that I understood the futility of life. you work hard, complete assignments, you overcome your modest but real learning disabilities and what's your reward? a copy of Gord's Gold 2. A mule that won't budge gets a carrot dangled in front of his face, a mouse in a maze gets a piece of cheese at the end but we got a shot at winning Gord's Gold 2. This is what Gord's Gold 2 means to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wreck of Gord's Gold II","review":"Well, I bought the tape \\"Gord's Gold II\\" for the song \\"wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald\\" and discovered as someone else did who reviewed the album found it to be an alternate version of the song which left me disappointed and glad I didnt soak more money into the cd. Now I like Gordon Lightfoot, but there is alot of music on this effort of his that I just dont recognize. Give me a Greatest hits comp with \\"sundown\\", \\"carefree highway\\", \\"wreck\\" and the like and we could talk. Like most here hough, I have to give a thumbs down. I give this cd 1 star and it hurts to do that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gordon at his worst","review":"Although many highlights of his 80's albums are in their original versions and has a great song called \\"If It Should Please You\\" available nowhere else, everything else, including \\"Wreck of The Edmund Fitzgerald\\" is all re-recorded and the remakes are not good at that. You are better off getting the \\"Songbook\\" boxed set or the original albums for what you would be buying this for. If It weren't for the highlights of the 80's albums and the new track, this would rate 1 star, but since the 1980's original recordings are well chosen and \\"If It Should Please You\\" is a decent song, I give it 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Lightfoot lovers, a giant thumbs down!","review":"Although no \\" re-mixes of earlier masters were attempted\\" the Gordon Lightfoot Band does nothing to enhance Mr. Lightfoot's voice or highlight the lyrics, of otherwise pleasant songs.

(Not by Gordon, though!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"essential Lightfoot","review":"I know some people are put off by the fact that Gordon Lightfoot re-recorded 14 of the 18 tracks on this compilation, but I think the new versions give this collection added value. The 14 newly performed songs were essentially done with live vocals and without any high tech production, therefore giving the listener the feeling of hearing the Lightfoot band performing live in the studio. And seeing as though there are no GL live albums from the 70's and 80's, this is as close as you can get to one, and besides, the original versions are available on other albums anyway. It would have been nice to see a tune or two from the highly underrated LP East of Midnight included as well, but when you've got such a wealth of great material to choose from, it's impossible to get everything in. Particularly noteworthy are the re-cuts of Endless Wire and Race Among The Ruins. This is a rock solid disc that should be in every Lightfoot fan's audio library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have had original studio cuts","review":"The purpose of buying a greatest hits collection is to get a representative assortment of songs without having to buy a large quantity of CDs. On an album entitled Gord's Gold II, we have a right to expect the original studio cuts. A live album should have been released separately. The live versions of High & Dry, All the Lovely Ladies and others just don't make the grade."},{"rating":"1","title":"modest mouse ripoff","review":"seriously, save your money. this is like weird al making an album of modest mouse and imperial teen ripoffs. except they aren't joking. when i listened to song 3, i thought, there's no way...but they are just totally aping isaac brock's vocal style. why?! if you are in an indie band, why try to steal how someone w/ a distinctive voice (isaac, tim kinsella, etc.) sing? too distracting to enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"modest mouse [copy]","review":"seriously, save your money. this is like weird al making an album of modest mouse and imperial teen [parodie]s. except they aren't joking. when i listened to song 3, i thought, there's no way...but they are just totally aping isaac brock's vocal style. why?! if you are in an indie band, why try to [imitate] how someone w/ a distinctive voice (isaac, tim kinsella, etc.) sing? too distracting to enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"what would i do","review":"without this cd? it is definitely my favorite at the moment. and has been for a few months now. buy it!

There are some really beautiful bits on this and the songs sound very intimate and authentic, and romantic, demos or not.

I love the energy, \\"vibe\\", or whatever you want to call it, behind his music and I've listened to most of this album many times.

My initial reaction to hearing the disc was negative. It's raw. The vocals are a little wonky at times. What made Love great is there, though. There is complexity to the songwriting process. After giving the disc some time, you know why Arthur Lee worked with this guy. You can certainly hear the show tunes and jazz influence that shows up in songs like Orange Skies and Alone Again Or. The changes are odd. Bryan Maclean was unique. I don't play the Maclean demo cds (there are 2 on Sundazed) all of the time, but when I pull them out every once in a while, take a deep breath and really listen, the rough songs are real gems. Interesting for songwriters and Love fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"shows again the whole to be greater than its parts","review":"I've been a fan of LOVE since introduced to Forever Changes back in 1969. That remains my favorite LOVE album, so I was excited when the news that Bryan Maclean had put out an album began to circulate. After seeking it out in record stores for several years, I finally found it here. My disappointment is profound. Instead of new material, all I found was a weak collection of musical doodlings which would have been better off consigned to the trash bin. There is almost nothing even tolerably listenable on this album.

Tracks such as \\"one track mind\\" in stereo are pure heaven, and the booklet is very informative, including interviews with the band members. The knickerbockers were compared with the beatles and although they did not have that groups range and depth, the energy and talent shine through.

It seems that since acquiring fame, Mr. Le Carre has decided not to think too much about plot, but rather copy whatever there is to copy, ad a bit of eccentricity to the characters, and voila. The Tailor of Panama is Our Man in Havana, much like The Perfect Spy is a retelling of Kim Philby's story, a story that has been told many times.I, at least, look for originality in plot and premise. Mr. Le Carre has become a comformist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sometimes the Short Answer is Simply Too Short","review":"Especially relevant after the number of journalistic scandals involving \\"once-source\\" information that have occurred worldwide, John LeCarre, in his most cynical novel to date, scathingly takes \\"the epiocracy\\" to task for what he perceives is a trend towards the inappropriate interpretation of factual information. Of course, that pitfall isn't all that hard to tumble into, considering how the major spy organs of the West continually recruit from the creme de la creme of academic circles. Because the creme de la creme are practically bred in the ways of diplomacy from their childhood on up, they are indeed valuable in just about every aspect of spying except one: Determining exactly how the lay of the land will affect policymaking in the short run. It's as if Marie Antoinette was the only candidate to play La Femme Nikita, and she's not about to go getting her hands dirty. This book, however, comes highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing -- Certainly Nothing Special","review":"Le Carre for me has always been a wonderful challenge -- a difficult-to-read, disjointed writing style balanced by his mastery as a storyteller. This is the first book of his for which the annoying outweighed the pleasurable. Clearly this is meant as wicked satire, and indeed it is, but the heavyhandedness of the points he makes is grating. Every single character in the book is either amoral or incompetent, or both -- seemingly bent on self-destruction. Le Carre spares no one -- if I were Panamanian, Jewish, black, Indian or Japanese, I'd be offended at the insulting generalizations he heaps upon my people. World-weariness is one thing, but Le Carre writes with the ultra-cynical tone of a man who needs a rest. This story of post-Cold War spies manufacturing a war seems to be a metaphor for his predicament as a writer. On the plus side, no one does the clipped British speech pattern like Le Carre -- Osnard's annoyed \\"hell's going on's\\" are classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My Cup of Tea","review":"I have to admit that I had a negative view of this author before I started reading the book, but because of his reputation and the good reviews I thought I would give him another chance. I don't know what it is but I just cannot get into one of his books. I think they move very slow and are just not peppy. Maybe I just have a short attention span, but I need more pep in a book then this author delivers. I did enjoy the movie (I keep giving him chances), but the books put me to sleep. I actually thought the overall story line was an interesting new twist to the cold war era spy story but I just could not keep turning the pages on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you saw the movie, Do not read.","review":"The plot though rather good, could not keep my attention. Some of the characters are well written, but others, seem to drag the book down. The book does not flow and you will find yourself putting it down to do something. The story is a satire on the time when America has just handed over the Panama canal. Though I cannot believe that any agency would fall for the information that was passed on by Harry, the tailor and would be spy. Of course I read the whole book, becasue my rule is once you start ....finish it. Other wise , I would have put it down. Just watch the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I've read this year","review":"My first and last Le Carre book is The Tailor of Panama. I expected a spy novel. I expected a plot. Instead, Tailor is a book entirely about an author showing us how clever he can be by poking fun at American, British, and, especially, latin people. If you read and liked Catch 22, you may like Tailor. I hated Catch 22. With both books, I kept waiting for something to happen: nothing does. And the humour in both is similar: smart-alec dialog that quickly becomes irritating and is never funny.The characters are universally annoying.It's not a spy-thriller and it's not funny. It is almost unreadable.I look forward to missing the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I've read ever!","review":"Boring, Boring, Boring. Save your money for another book. I hope the movie is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Book to Sleep By","review":"The Tailor of Panama was described as a spy story. After three quarters of the first tape, the story had yet to get to anything to do with spying. It talked about a tailor-well at least the name of the book was right-and described all the customers of the tailor, from British Royalty to Communistic Leaders. It talked of the politics and even had a customer come in to get fitted for a suit. It described the receptionist and how she had gotten the scars on her face. But it never set the scene for a spy story.The book, which was compared to Casablanca, would make interesting reading for someone that enjoys the intricacies of politics and lots of in-depth details. It is a very dry read."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book suffers as much from bad editing as bad writing.","review":"As an occasional reader of the spy genre and a sometime fan of Le Carre's earlier works this book was hugely disappointing. The characters were two-dimensional and scarcely believable. The plot was dull and slow-moving. Clearly, certain writers receive a pass from their publishers when it comes to editing. I could barely summon the interest to finish reading this compost heap of a book. Don't buy this book unless you'll read anything by Le Carre regardless of merit."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so tailor.","review":"The Tailor of Panama is only so-so.It becomes muddled, confusing, too much attention is placed on the interactions of the various characters, a decent espionage plot is not given the attention it should.This was not one of the better spy books."},{"rating":"1","title":"another loser from the cold war guy","review":"Mr. Le Carre has clearly run out of things to write about now that the cold war has thankfully expired. Graham Greene certainly did a better job on the same theme in \\"Our Man In Havana\\". The descriptions of Panama are very tasty, but the story does not hang together very well and the characters are not well formed. This book is not worth stealing but will make a fair \\"poolside\\" read if there is absolutely nothing else to pick up"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leave it on the shelf.","review":"\\"Panama\\" has the momentum of cold maple syrup. The story's location and Le Carre's name drew me to the book. But after reading it, I wept for my lost time. The main spy, Osnard, lacks depth; his background is revealed way too late in the story. Le Carre fails to legitimize Osnard as a cunning, capable spy. And it seems the reader should care about Panama's plight & the Canal's future. Yet the characters who own the passion & grit to fight for their Panama were obscured in the plot. What's left is a wimpy tailor with a past who's desperate for cash. And when I realized all of this, I still begged for something to happen. It just doesn't. For intrigue, momentum, and competent characters, try Ken Follett's work (favorite is \\"Triple\\")."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Le Carre","review":"This is my favorite Le Carre. A little gem. Pure satire. I love it and have re-read it many times. Le Carre is a superb wordsmith but mostly he leaves me feeling dry. Perhaps I need a little more color.

I think this book has value as a starting guide except for the fact that it requires a lot of knowledge on the history to begin with.

What made it irritably boring is Michael Stipe's wavering voice in songs that should have been best sung by perhaps another member of the band. In addition, the overhype in the media about this band kind of ended it for me after this album. There were a couple of good songs from followup efforts, but essentially this band went the way of U2: Overhyped, oversold, in your face, all the time.I don;t begrudge them their success as they've certainly earned it, but when the media started focusing on the homosexuality of the lead singer (of which I couldn't care less anyway), the band responded by breaking up some time later.
