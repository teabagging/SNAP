Still more, it is difficult to find philosophers and theologians who can adequately engage with him. That the author, Richard Kearney, was a former student of Ricoeur's still makes no guarantee that he can do so. But Kearney does, indeed.Kearney's book is first class in this field of thinking on Ricoeur. I would consider it as important as any of Ricoeur's own books. Though it is not \\"critical\\", this books lays out a wonderful exposition of many of Ricoeur's points. In this sense, it is better than a critical approach which often puts the progect of critiquing before understanding what is being read or thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adapting Ricoeur to a social field model","review":"[[ASIN:0754650189 On Paul Ricoeur: The Owl of Minerva (Transcending Boundaries in Philosophy and Theology) (Transcending Boundaries in Philosophy and Theology) (Transcending Boundaries in Philosophy and Theology)] Excellent for my purposes.

Their suggestion is that I go to a local shop to get it serviced. Parts and labor to fix it will no doubt be more than what I paid for the product so now it's just a book end.

I haven't found one yet that plays like this one plays. Several months ago we purchased the Norcent DP-220 DVD PLAYER WITH DIVX PLAYBACK and it still doesn't play what the older model DP300 will play.

I questioned if the replacement DVD was new, they could have just sent me back my orginial DVD player. Again, I contacted customer service but have received no response.

We were drawn in by the low price and since it has been a couple of years since we bought a DVD player, we thought prices have really come down. What a mistake. Better to pay a couple of bucks more. You know what they say - you get what you pay for. First, the remote control does not allow you to set your TV for DVD mode, meaning, you need to use your TV's remote to do this. If you have cable - that means you need to use 3 remote controls just to get your DVD going. What a hassle. Additionally, the box does not play the sound properly - separating the dialogue sound from the background music. The background music gets loud and you can't hear the dialogue. On some DVD's you couldn't hear the sound at all. I could go about the drop in functionality from the Sony we had previously, but, I think I would run out of space. This machine is garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"worked well for a while","review":"This was perfect for my family and at a good price.

I would rather shell out more cash and buy a DVD by a REAL company, not this Cracker-Jack outfit called Norcent.I am stunned, additionally, to see that this product can be purchased for $200.

But I have been extremely happy with my purchase! DVDs play beautifully, I've had no problems with skipping or sound quality issues whatsoever. You have enough ability to change settings that you can optimize playback to fit your sound system and TV. It comes with a remote control that has every option you could want on it (play, rewind, fast forward, settings, etc) and the player itself is surprisingly light and compact, so it's easy to stick just about anywhere!I'm very happy with this player - the only thing downside to a lower end player is that it doesn't have the information/clock component on the front, so you can see how much of the DVD has played, etc. But this truly is an extra you can live without if your main focus is to find an afforable, durable, and good player!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"the first time I watched a movie, it seemed just fine.

I received a player with beginning serial #113 (the newest version of the player). The price is great and it can be made region free, but PAL discs play back with noticeable pixelization. When playing regular movies, about 1-2 second pauses/skips occur periodically while playing almost any movie. Moire patterns are also constantly noticeable throughout movies. I have also noticed the incorrect framing problem (it cuts off a portion of the left & right side of the image). My friend has a cheap APEX that has the same features and doesn't exhibit any of these problems. I will be returning this player in exchange for another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke After 15 Months","review":"Sure it has a warranty for a year, but you are SOL if it breaks after a mere 15 months of useage.

Since the first day the audio output from the player has been marred by weird random hisses and pops. It's gotten progressively worse over the past few months to the point where it's impossible to watch any DVD without being distracted by the constant noises.

The recordings where in my professional opinion poorly mixed. The arrangements on some of the tracks is amateurish. There were several tracks that didn't even appear in the series but were from a video game release. Obviously a poor way to fill up a CD with fluff.I would have liked to have tracks from the episode Sleeping in light. That is in my opinion one of the best tracks Franke has written for the series"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, not great","review":"There are some gems on this CD. Most of the music is nondescript when you listen to it; it is much more suited to being the background music of a TV show, of course. In other words, it's not like regular music you get on a regular commercial band's CD. In my opinion, the best songs are the Main Titles, in particular the 5th season."},{"rating":"1","title":"I demand the hour of my life back that Hogan stole from me.","review":"Basically it's Hogan spewing his orange-skinned garbage for an hour with some really horrible wrestling mixed in.

In these troubled times that we all live in we're wondering what's going to happen next. It's a good time to learn to pray. This is a wonderful example of exciting stories and testimonies as to the power of prayer to the one true God, a triune God, Our Heavenly Father, son Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit. Pastor Cho gives his testimony of how he came to know God personally and ended up pastoring one of the largest churches in the world. This is just one in a series of fantastic books by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fourth Dimension","review":"Excellent Book! My pastor recommended that I read it and I am glad I did! Dr. Cho really teaches you how to apply the Word of God to your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fourth Dimension","review":"I haven't finished it yet; I like a lot of what Cho has to say, I just wish he used more Scripture to back up his main points instead of only personal anecdotes."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fourth Dimension","review":"Excellent book for those seeking the \\"higher life\\" God intends for allChristians to have.

Pastor of the largest church in Korea, and possible the world, it is amazing just reading the testimonies of what he went through and also how God came through for him. Faith is active! Faith is alive! Faith has to be in God! Faith is exciting! Faith will take you to places and experience things that nothing else in this world can ever provide! Through Cho's experiences, he expounds further on what faith is, and aspects like seeing faith and having the faith of God in our lives. For some, as you read it, you would be able to identify aspects of it... maybe a \\"Hey, I had this before... but I never followed through with it as I doubted if it was God or if it was me!\\" But thorugh reading this book, you will be encouraged, strengthened, believing, and it will stir you up to press in for more... and this time... in your own life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read for Christians.","review":"Any Christian who wants to grow in the Lord should read this.

I am a Christian who holds a Biblical worldview and found this book to be interesting in many ways, but off the ,ark in some ways too. If you have a strong Bible background...you can sift the wheat from the chaff in this book and the Spirit will certainly speak through it. If not, I suggest you run from it and don't allow this into your head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid!","review":"Aberrant theology masquerading as orthodoxy - New Ageism cloaked in Christian language. Guided visualization and other metaphysical techniques are recommended. King of the \\"feel good\\" gospel, Robert Schuller, contributes the introduction. Typical \\"Word Faith\\" movement doctrine.

This is by far the worst travel guide I have ever purchased. There is very little practical information. The photos and maps need a magnifying glass in order to read.

You bet!","review":"At first I found the voice Lombardo uses for \\"Works and Days\\" a little off-putting. I mean, you don't expect an ancient Greek poet to come off like one of Huck Finn's more literate relatives. But as I continued reading, and, indeed, I had a hard time stopping, I was convinced this really was Hesiod's voice, at least for this group of poems and proverbs. He's a rustic, cranky know-it-all who's also quite entertaining. \\"Theogony\\" is more formal and stately, but as with Lomboardo's recent \\"Iliad\\" and \\"Odyssey\\", compulsively readable. In this volume, Hesiod is more pleasurable to read than I had imagined possible. Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Otto Rank: The Unheralded Psychoanlyst","review":"This is an important book about an important contributor to the nascent physoanlysis movement. It wasw Freud and his disciples' desire that Rank would be forgotten to future generations, and they have been largely successfull. This book goes along way in righting that wrong. The importance of Rank to psychoanalysis and beyond--to the therapy itself--is difficult to overstate. Read here why he is so important, what his approach had that Freud's didn't and why that threatened Freud,and how he evolved from one who was passionate for recognition and advancement to one who was passionate only about living a creative life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simplistic view","review":"I had a hard time getting into this book because of its simplistic characters, plot and dialogue.

The V-Brakes that came with the bike were wearing out after 20,000 plus miles. The inset shaft is shorter on these than my originals, so they do not sit quite flush with the frame (hard to describe really), but it is just an asthetic's issue. Funtionally, they work perfectly. It seemed faster and easier (and not much more expensive) to replace the entire brake system that it has been to just replace the pads.

If I had known sooner, I would've replaced the OEM brakes on day one.Does your V brake not retract well, and you're using cheapo OEM calipers? Depending on how much you value your time, you may just want to spring for these. Even if you don't value your time, it'll be extremely difficult to match the performance of this pad & brake caliper set.I just went for an off-trail ride with these, and I never loved my bike as much as I do today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product, Best Out for price, Brand New Polished.","review":"Ive loved changing to these, After Ordering just the front Brake to Check these products out, I Boxed up my original Promax SET and ordered The Rear Set of Shimano brakes as well I found Here>Shimano BR-M422 Acera Bicycle V-Brake (Rear, Black), I go EXTREME mountain biking, And Ill tell You what these brakes NEVER slip or get loose from cable, Ill Recommend Everyone tired of squeeky, Slipping brakes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"We were rather disappointed by this game.

His documentation is complete, his scholarship impeccable. The book is unbiased and carefully researched.

But he was paralyzed from the waist down due to an illness and couldn't play the role. Tsk.) I'm sure Reginald Owen was a nice man, but his portrayal is truly one-dimensional.

Even the cartoon versions are better than this one. Some of the stories on here aren't bad, and Gene Lockhart as Bob Cratchit is good, as are his kids. But ultimately this movie really lacks the energy it needs to sustain such a story, especially the Marley character. There are too many important scenes that aren't even in this, while some of the other scenes are pure drivel.If this had been the first version I ever saw, I would never have watched another Scrooge or Christmas Carol ever again! Do yourself a HUGE favor and watch the 1951 version.

To this day I guess you can say I am a great defender of both movies and now think of them as equal. If anyone were to see A Christmas Carol staring Reginald Owen for the first time I'm sure they would take a likin' to it.As a review of both movies, and I have seen many remakes of A Christmas Carol......these two will long be the best and give it my thumbs up.Jim Lawson"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Timeless Christmas Classic","review":"A Christmas CarolA Timeless Christmas Story of a an old stingy employer who finds Christmas and its meaning when visited by The Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future.

We only use the touch switch maybe a half dozen times a day at most, and we became unable to turn the unit off without unplugging it from the wall.

The stories, however are well written and interesting, and probably good approximations of the thoughts, words and feeling inside a therapy session.

This is not about her clinical practice. It is about her. These fictional patients exist as vehicles by which we learn about Susie Orbach. Very disappointing. In addition, The book has been tarted up for publication and hoped-for sales by the use of the word \\"sex\\" in the title.

Sometimes it is subtle, sometimes terrible, and I am sick of wondering if I am eating something that has gone bad- and rancid oils are really bad for you, which defeats the purpose of this product.

I would have rated them 4 or 5 stars then.However starting in early August, there was a definite odd taste that was starting to creep into the chip. And here in early September they are totally inedible. My guess is that the oils used have gone rancid in the chip, since they are using natural oils. Normally this is a very good thing, but the longevity of the product is sacrificed due to it, which is a problem when you are buying chips in 12 bag packages!So if you are purchasing these chips please make sure you are able to eat them quickly, they will not be any good about 1 month before the best eaten by date.

They taste good, so I ordered the case from Amazon. (In fact, I even signed up for subscribe and save) When my package arrived today, the bag says they only have 1 gram of fiber per serving! I called Garden of Eatin' and was told that there was new analysis and testing done which shows they only actually have one gram of fiber per serving. That's a huge difference! The customer service rep said the testing was done in September, yet the nutrition information on their own website still shows 4 grams of fiber. To me, that is false advertising. How hard is it to go in change that information on your own website!So, bottom line, if you don't care about the amount of fiber...these are really tasty chips. But if the amount of fiber is what attracted you to them, don't buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rancid/Stale Chips, DO NOT BUY!!!","review":"I purchased these chips on October 18, 2010. They were rancid/stale so you can certainly believe the other reviewers. I had not noticed the reviews about the horrible taste and staleness of these chips. I wish I had. I contacted customer service for a refund which they approved but I think Amazon should either stop selling these chips due to such poor reviews or check their stock to make sure they are FRESH. If you order, you should order with caution. I am trying another brand instead of reordering these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stale Stale Stale!!","review":"If you regularly buy these chips, you would be like me and say, \\"that's a great deal!\\" These chips are not cheap at the stores, but they are fresh. The expiration date is not past when you receive your big box... but for some reason they are not fresh, and the salt on the chips is all at the bottom. I kept thinking that it was \\"just that one bag...\\" but it was all of them. I had eaten too many of them to send them back. Do not buy this product from Amazon- but... my shipment may be the unlucky one that was stale- although i read several other reviews sharing my opinion... and i did not believe!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Literally Stink","review":"I've order the Seasame Blues before and thought they were great. The 7.5 ounce bags are round compared to the triangles. When you open the bag you get a strong odor of bad oil. The taste also has the bad oil to it. Unfortunately I sent a box to my sister after bragging about them. I called company but no word yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too salty!","review":"Otherwise great. If you're a saltoholic like my husband you'll love these. I got these for the kids' lunchboxes but ended up not using them for that because of the salt."},{"rating":"1","title":"STALE Tasting!","review":"don't be fooled and misled by believing these chips are \\"healthier\\" or \\"better for you\\".

Canola oil is made from genetically modified rapeseed. They also say it may have Safflower or Sunflower oil, but I'drather not take part in that lottery. I'd like to send back this lot, but I'm not willing to bet, they would not have the nerve to sell it to the next unsuspecting soul, so it will go straight into the trash can ,where it belongs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing but crumbs!!","review":"Do not order these online. They are shipped in the flimsy box that the grocery stores use. No additional packaging is used to protect the inside. My box was crushed on three corners, adding to the already crushed chips. I wound up feeding them to the birds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rancid and Nauseating","review":"I would have liked to actually taste this product, but as soon as the bag was opened I was attacked by the stench of rancid oil. The product was still 5 weeks away from the \\"Best if used by\\" date, so that's no excuse. And it's not likely they were shipped in a hot truck, it being the middle of winter. On further research, I discovered there's a good chance that any Garden of Eatin' chip product you buy will be rancid. So much for \\"organic\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"3g. Fiber Per Serving!","review":"Love these tortilla chips made with organic white corn! They are perfect for dipping in salsa or eating right out of the bag. 3g of fiber per serving and there are 8 servings per bag. Mine were fresh with an expiration date of June 2011. I will be buying these again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious!","review":"These might be the best chips I have ever had. The \\"Used By\\" date is March 2011, but I had to cut this bag open as it was sealed up so tightly (this is the first bag of chips I've had to cut open..if I really reeked on it I could have got it, but I didn't want it to explode in my face). No worries, you will be happy you got these."},{"rating":"1","title":"blue chips","review":"The chips are okay Not near as flavorful as the regular blue chips. Nice size bag for a family."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE RED HOT BLUES!!!","review":"OK, so before we opted to purchase these from Amazon, my whole family was a fan of these chips and if you never tried them you have too. They are absolutely delicious, spiced up just right, perfect in taco salad, with salsa or just fine all alone (and it helps if your alone too because when sharing these chips are addictive!)But I HAVE TO SAY that these chips purchased through amazon were the best NO EXAGGERATION, that I have had. I thought it was just me but then my husband was like \\"i dunno what it is but those chips are GOOODDD!!\\" They were fresh, so fresh and this size bags makes it better for snacking/sharing as opposed to the larger bags from the store.Stop reading and order these, your family will thank u :-D"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Torilla Chips","review":"I tried these chips about 4 years ago before the blue corn tortilla chips were popular. The second I finished eating one chip I knew I would be a customer for life. These are absolutely amazing. I wish all of the ingredients were organic but i won't be too picky. The 12 bags are quite a bit to get in one order but it is much cheaper than getting it at a local store. If you like to entertain these would be a good idea to keep handy for a more healthy option for your guests. I love these little guys. I would recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Taste really stale","review":"We had ordered this chips before and really loved them in the past.

They have a bizzare stale / cardboard like flavor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware the salt!","review":"I gave this product a 1 because of the salt content. While not terribly salty, they are advertised as a no salt product, yet the label clearly lists sea salt as an ingredient.Most people wouldn't have a problem with this, but if you're on a sodium free diet like me, you could be just a few hand-fulls away from a trip to the emergency room."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stale, no non-GMO","review":"Very stale, even though not out of expiration date.No non-GMO.

They have a great flavor and texture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too salty and nearly expired.","review":"I ordered a case of these chips from Amazon because I like the regular Garden of Eatin blue chips and usually like baked chips better than fried. I ordered a case (and put myself on subscription) to get the best price and figured I could eat a couple of cases a year. But these chips are too salty - eating them actually burns my lips! And all of the bags in the case I received from Amazon on January 5 have \\"best by\\" dates of February 3, 2010. How am I supposed to eat 12 bags of too salty chips in less than a month? Since Amazon does not allow returns on this item, I'll probably just donate my case to the food bank. I highly recommend that before you order this item, buy a test bag at Whole Foods first. And don't order a case unless you can use it within a month.

Clearly there was much for Lass to learn! But there was also a great deal for Keller to learn, and in his work with Lass, Keller sees his own spiritual journey reflected.In many respects this is a charming, unpretentious, and often thought provoking book, filled with memorable phrases and insights. Even so, and in spite of its brevity (it runs less than less one hundred small pages), it is surprisingly repetitive; Keller essentially gives the complete history of Lass in the first two chapters, a fact that leaves no room for the reader to be surprised by his later reflections. Still, I recommend it--particularly for the Christian dog-lover in your life.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book","review":"I enjoyed reading this book very much.

The author's mentioning of his beliefs and other religion elements take up at least half, if not more, of the book and it is a short book to begin with.

We've only had it for 2 days so far, but it looks pretty durable to me. Someone said it gets out of whack if you bump it...well, the projector head is moveable. You can move it back and forth a little to get the image on the spot of the paper that you want it. Someone said they used it to trace images on her children's walls.

The base kept detaching from the projector head, and it just stopped working. changed batteries twice with new batteries; took out bulb, it's brand new of course (and so far haven't been able to find replacement). My son got frustrated as he wanted to play with it but could not; the idea is great but the construction of the toy is lousy.

My daughter wanted this and I bought it. Same as everyone else, bulb blew in about 5 minutes and I was not happy with the fact that it's in 2 pieces and it's hard to get the top part to stay on while you trace. Big waste of money and if I would have read reviews first I could have saved myself the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Dissapointment","review":"I have read the other reviews, and cannot believe that it got any positive reviews! My 3 year old just received this for Christmas and was anxious to try it out. Our light bulb works, but we would have to have her play with it in a closet in order for her to see the image! During daylight the image is barely noticable. Even if you do go into a dark room the image only lit up for a few seconds, and then slowly faded to a black screen. My daughter loves drawing and can't understand why her new toy is already \\"broken\\". I recommend reading the reviews for the Travel Trace N Draw, which is more on target with how this similar product works. This is not the quality I expected from Crayola. Don't waste your time or money- at $19.99 it ought to do something!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I thought I was purchasing a great tracing board for my granddaughter but she only got to use it once.

What a huge disappointment when the bulb blew as soon as she switched it on. As in the adjacent reviews, replacement bulbs are not available except from the manufacturer. How do you explain to a little girl that her toy is a piece of junk? Just let her read the other reviews. She readily agreed to return it for a refund and purchase something else. I agree that Crayola should be ashamed for endorcing an inferior product such as this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hunk of Junk!","review":"As the people said in the other reviews, the bulb burned out within the first hour of use.

The light quality to project is poor at best and on the learn to draw discs (red ones) - just move anything a millimeter and your artist will be howling because now the entire picture is out of focus and you have to jiggle it back in place to get the same size so you can finish the picture. It's not worth $20 -maybe $8 at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great Concept, but not worth it!","review":"We bought this for my 3 and 5 yr old last year. They only play with it on occasion. We've had no trouble with the bulb, but the the projector doesn't stay up so the picture is never centered correctly on the paper. It also works best in the evening with all the lights off, otherwise you can't see it too well. Needs some work to make this item worth the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"My seven-year-old daughter found this projector to be rather limited.

The bulb blew out only minutes of using it. It is impossible to find a replacement. I did take it back and exchanged it for another one. Same thing happened again.

What a waste of money and of time trying to get it to work. FIND ANOTHER TOY!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SIMPLY CRAP","review":"My 4 year old daughter received this yesterday for her birthday. In just under 5 minutes of use the light bulb blew. I was like \\"what the ...\\" The light itself is not bright so you can barely see the image and the paper would not stay put. She lost interest quickly. I cannot believe how poorly built this is. My only salvation is her birthday is close to Christmas and I can dispose of this thing on December 26 when she is so preoccupied by the new toys. I always check the reviews on Amazon before I buy my toys. Too bad my friend didnt. DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP.

They show some fascinating tangents into the lives of the main characters that will propel them closer to the Shadow War. The highlight is the Hugo award-winning episode, \\"The Coming of Shadows\\"; the terminally ill Centauri emperor (Turhan Bey) arrives at Babylon 5, seeking to find a peaceful resolution to ongoing political strife between the Centaurl Republic and the Narn Regime. As a previous reviewer noted, all the elements of Greek tragedy are present, with Babylon 5's resident buffoon, Centauri ambassador Mollari (Peter Jurasik) making a bargain with the \\"devil\\", Mr. Morden (Eric Wasser), that he will eventually come to regret.

Second chair was in good shape--no issues. Chair does what it should. Glides smooth and quiet after a month of use and will hopefully continue to do so. Average quality--worth the money you paid.

This glider has been a great addtion to our home; its pretty too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not real impressed!","review":"We received the glider in great condition and well packaged. However, my husband had to drill longer holes in the arms to get the long screws to go in. Once the chair was together, it's nice looking but not as comfortable as what it looked in the picture. I wanted a chair to put in my own little corner for reading by the fireplace. I'm not sure I'll spend a whole lot of time in it as it's not all that comfortable. The ottoman could be made a little higher. Just not what I expected, but got with a free gift card when I bought my new car, so not a total loss. Just shop around. I definitely wouldn't recommend a glider any cheaper than this one if that determines comfort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed...","review":"I read all of the reviews before I purchased this glider. I knew the fabric would roll on the arms...it did. I knew the seat was wider than normal...it was. But, the workmanship was cheezy. There appears to be very little finish work on the chair. The fabric is poor and I doubt would last too long...I wanted a chair to use for a long time. The stool is also low and bothered my legs. I thought for $250 it should be a fairly well made chair...wrong. If you're looking into one of these think hard...it will not last a long time. If you're looking for something more sturdy and well made you might want to look further and spend a little more. It works for a spare chair for company."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a piece of junk","review":"I got this glider based on all the good reviews. It lasted for less than 6 months, and then literally fell apart: the \\"wood\\" cracked, the bolts fell out and would not fit into where they are supposed to go anymore, etc. My suggestion is, if you want a good rocking chair that will last, forget about all this made-in-China junk and go for something that will really last, preferably Amish-built."},{"rating":"1","title":"really disappointed","review":"i bought this item so i could rock my baby to sleep in it.

The wood on the ottoman came \\"unglued\\" which made me come unglued. 3.) The large screws used to secure the arms on is very difficult to use. It took an hour to get the arms secured.

After some research, I settled on Ricoh based on some of the reviews here and else where. The setup as a stand-alone system was easy and it took less than 20 minutes. It does all the things as advertised, however, there are some not discussed anywhere:1. It weighs about 70 lbs. In other words, it's very heavy.2. It consumes a lot of power. When this is on, my lights flicker!3. It makes too much noise...it makes clunky noises when powering up and when it prints.4. Color is not as vivid as others, such as Samsung's CLX-3160FN5. For some reason, when I'm printing labels, the it creates smudges and the image is not complete on the bottom. The same image on the same labels in Samsung comes out fine.All other function works, but this Ricoh model just doesn't impress me at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dream Machine Nightmare","review":"The concept behind this machine is great. They have put in all you need to run a small office. It is quite simple to use, the program is good once it is installed properly and overall it works well. You will love it for the first month (thought the color print is never very good). Then reality sinks in. The short lived consumables are the most expensive I have seen for any machine this size running between $150-200 per cartridge, there are 4 cartridges. If your black cartridge is full and any one of the color ones runs dry the entire machine stops printing! No faxes, no black prints, no black copies.Exactly one week out of warantee ours broke down and required a $350 repair. Since then, besides consumables it has cost us another $700 in repairs and now sits dead, 1 1/2 years after purchase. I refuse to spend any more on this product. I advise you do not buy this as it will certainly run your small business into the ground."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely LOUD machine","review":"I purchased this for a small office in 09/06 during a sale at Staples. We set it up, and started to print some sample documents. WOW, was it loud. It sounded like the ink cartridges were being hit with a hammer against the front cover! I contacted Ricoh, assuming this was some type of defect or damage to this new machine. They wrote me back, stating in writing that this was normal and we could expect this level of noise. I could not believe they admitted this, in writing. There is no way you can talk on the phone if this is anywhere near you. It does the job and prints nice copies, but unless you can put it in a corner that is far, far away, this is not the machine for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Certainly a great deal for the money.","review":"I got this for $375 (delivered) though Amazon's warehouse deals. The box arrived in horrible shape but the printer miraculously survived. The damage to the box was worse than Fed Ex could have done in one shipment so I suppose it was discounted due to the box damage. In any case the printer was in good shape, which speaks well of the durability of the printer itself. The set up and installation on Windows XP was easy. No problems with the drivers or installation for both the USB and the network connection. Print quality is very good, we could read a two point font! It's a bit noisy (bangs and clunks) as it warms up for the first page, but, not as bad as I expected based on some of the reviews. Subsequent pages print quickly and quietly. I've had a couple of minor paper feeding issues, but nothing too bad. Certainly a great deal for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a pretty good printer...","review":"It's a pretty good printer if you can afford to keep it filled with toner.

The book is phenomenal in describing the impact of war on today's people and particularly the affect on Iraqi Veterans. There is something lacking in the futuristic scenarios at the beginning but I think there are too many great chapters in the book which seam together a fantastic story. Despite some very revaltional and innovative writing describing a vision of the future eventually the story becomes what it is which is a romance with a war drama climax. It's an incredibly depressing and terrifying story of the relation between Dom and Marianne which compelled me to read this book to the end. Overall the book is fantastically deep, thought provoking and warrants a thorough reading. I love romances and this is one of the steamiest dramatic stories I have read (im not a big fan of science fiction)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Signs of the times...","review":"This book illustrates, with some technical form, the artful, whimsical commercial signage of days past.

The book is organized chronologically in a consistent way, highlighting the developments and changes that occured in Route 66's motel signage and culture. The whole study can also be viewed as a microcosm of the changes that occured in America during the period covered (40's - 70's).

But his passion, performance and the score convey the urgency and soulfulness of the songs.I get the message.The safe thing for Mr. N'Dour would have been to stylistically return to his breakout CD of a decade ago, The Guide, arguably one of the best releases ever. But to his credit as a genuine artist, he has matured and evolved into a new area. Art is not static, especially in music. And if that measure of value is applied here, then this definietly qualifies as a CD worthy of repeated listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Direct flight from Senegal to Egypt","review":"Youssou N'Dour is to Senegal what Fela Kuti was to Nigeria. Moreover, he moves far beyond the borders of Senegal and Africa having embraced World Music and recorded with Paul Simon and others.Egypt features him with a full Egyptian orchestra and as always the result is invigorating, enlightening and enjoyable. While I doubt you will understand the lyrics, the music speaks for itself and the message is rewarding.My only complaint is the 41 minute running time for this CD. I don't believe these were the only tracks recorded. If you want traditional Senegalese music then pass on this album. If you want to experience a hybrid musical experience then buy this album. If you are unsure then buy a low-priced used version. It is worth a $5.00 investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Listen in Moderation","review":"I did like this album when i bought it.

He's killed the trees, poisoned the water, built sheds with glaring tin roofs, and driven away the wildlife. And he runs a screaming scrub-clearing machine all day seven days a week. Of course, there's no shortage of suspects. Shirley is as outspoken as ever, and she voices plenty of opinions to unsettle liberals and conservatives both. B.J. Oliphant is a pseudonym of SF/fantasy author Sheri S. Tepper. This whole series is very entertaining, and so is her other series of whodunits, written under the name A.J.

As another reviewer pointed out - the endings of each chapter with a premonition got old really fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flawed From the Start","review":"When I started reading \\"To Bury the Dead\\" I was looking for your typical thriller. The back cover describes the book as one man's search for anwsers. What the book turned out to be was a deep dive into obsession and control.The story is about Paul Kelly a fireman in a New Jersey town. After a rough start in life Paul has turned it around. He has a loving family, good friends and a solid job. Paul also purchased a second house as fixer-upper. The on night Paul's life is changed when his daughter is murdered by a local teenager. This is were the book turned dramatically. Paul becomes obsessed with \\"why this happened to me\\" and starts taking serious risks to get the anwsers.By the end of this book, the reader will be shaking his head in complete amazement that Craig Spector has gone this far. The obsession is blown way out of proportion and the ending is very unbelievable. This one might want to stay off your must read list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Potent thriller with compelling characters","review":"After reading the reviews of this book which went from loved it to hated it, I decided to give it a try. I have to say, I found it very compelling. The characters were very believeable and the author's ability to pace a story kept me turning the pages, which I always look for in a good thriller. I actually read it in one sitting.The ending is somewhat oblique, and at first I wasn't sure I liked it, but then I realized that it's the kind of story that doesn't have a neat ending with all the loose ends tied, and perhaps that makes some readers uncomfortable. The story stayed in my mind long after I read it, which is more than I can say for many other books I've read.I guess it's up to the individual to decide for themselves whether they like a story like this -- it's dark and hard-edged and feels very real, but it lingers in the imagination. It may make you mad. But it will not leave you untouched. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"When Good Guys Go Bad...","review":"This thriller is truly worthy of the jump starts and hair pin turns that Spector is known for in his previous works. Though more psychological than his usual direct slasher style, he never-the-less probes the depths of violence and the borders of sanity in his new novel, 'To Bury the Dead'. This was a one night read for me that I coudn't put down til the end. It's not a novel that will gross you out- instead this one will make you nervous, wondering what YOU would do if it were YOUR child instead...A must read if you love Skipp and Spector- A must read if you don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Believable Tale of One Man's Downward Spiral","review":"When an average guy suffers an extreme loss, there's no telling what dark depths he's capable of reaching. Spector does a great job in documenting Paul Kelly's emotional destruction and twists to his perception of self and family. The symbology and chaos of Paul's worklife compared to how he perceives his homelife works on so many levels. The fragility of an individual's world is rendered here in such realistic detail that the relatively benign horrors (compared to the author's previous works) become more terrifying than what is delivered when buckets of gore or supernatural horror are utilized. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rocks out","review":"Yikes - I was there at the Radio City shows ... how long ago ... don't say. Album has upbeat songs and a great rock sound.

In particular, compare the two versions of \\"Samson\\" and \\"Franklin's Tower\\". The Dead Set versions sound like the kind of songs a has-been band pays on a summer cash in tour, while the DP3 versions boil over with drive and energy. In particular the DP3 \\"Franklin's Tower\\" is a shimmering, grooving all too short 15 minutes long, while the Dead Set version sounds forced just to make it to eight minutes.Still looking and listening!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jazz Lover","review":"I will miss you george.

It also lists gay newspapers and support groups. I has an essay written by a gay activist who opposes gay marriage on the grounds it could make gays too conservative when their goal should be to make heteros more promiscuous. What this has to do with traveling the USA I'm still trying to figure out. It tells the gay traveller where the best pick up joints are, but doesn't do so for heteros. All in all, this book is great is you are a gay swinger who wants to travel from town to town visiting all the major gay nightclubs. For the rest of us, I don't recommend it. They call themselves LG for Let's Go, but maybe it really stands for Lesbian and Gay?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic gift idea!","review":"Finally, a fun accessable tool to take the stigma out of purchasing, ordering and enjoying wine.

My 5 year old daughter loves this. I would reccommend this for 5-7 year olds... not so much for older kids.

Otherwise it gets a little complicated for younger kids, but I ended up modifying the rules (there are different versions included anyway) so that my almost 5 year old daughter could play it. We have a great time. This is basically a combination of the card game \\"Speed\\" and \\"War\\", but just picture cards instead of numbers trumping each other, which makes it a little easier for the younger crowd.

This doesn't contain just a \\"touch of ultra-violence\\", as the box suggests. I think the animators ran out of colors other than red.

And It's not because of the senseless violence or excessive swearing. Ohh no. This anime has the most despicable characters I've ever scene in a series. But the one that takes the cake is the three punks who bully a kid half their size. And to put a cherry on top, they pull his pants down and sexually assault him. This is one of those Vhs's that deserves to be thrown into an incinerator. I would have actually enjoyed Genocyber more had it not been the molestation. It's because of this terrible act that I didn't bother to watch the other parts to this series. I'm sorry, but I don't watch anime to get a look at some child's naughty bits nor should rape of any kind be handled with such insensitivity. Genocyber should have just stayed in Japan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, though violent...","review":"After the Genocyber destroys Tokyo in part one, the project is moved to a battleship. The mysterious girl is taken in by the Ship's doctor. Then the Genocyber runs around destroying things again. All in all, that's about as much of the plot as I could gather. It's rather complicated, and confusing, but the animation's great, and the mecha is pretty unique. If i had to compare it with something, MD Geist is the first thing that pops into my mind. It is much weirder though and extremely violent. I would consider this excessive violence one of its only drawbacks. If you like weird, ultra-violent animes that include a lot of mass destruction- this is a video for you < I think it may be one of the best of it's kind>. If violence is not your thing, stay far away from this title."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darby the Dragon","review":"This is a wonderful game. I played it with my grandchildren.

It sounds as fresh now as it did 15 years ago while Chicks Electric stuff sounds dated.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memories of Mom","review":"Mom found this book at the library when I was a child and she made a stew she called \\"Love Apple Stew\\" that we all liked.When I found the recipe it was for Brunswick Stew that the stew she made by that name was totally different and uniformly disliked by us.Still, now I know how to make that lovely recipe and maybe I can have a taste of Mom again.I had been looking, off and on, for this book, and I'm so glad to have it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A good hair dressing.","review":"All righty, I'm more then pleased with this product.

Great covers of some jazz standards. The music is made more enjoyable by the live performance. If I have a complaint, it's that the playback level of the recording seems a bit quiter than it should be compared to other CDs at the same volume. That is a pretty minor issue though. If you like traditional, accoustic, piano-based trio jazz, then this is a great CD to own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great TV, until is breaks....","review":"I bought the RD50 about nine months ago through Amazon.

Statements such as babies cannot be breast-fed immediately after birth, don't allow the baby in your bed, and the gut-wrenching \\"cry-it-out\\" philosophy all made me cringe. Beautiful pictures throughout however, showing step-by-step instructions for tasks of daily care (bathing, dressing) as well as excellent first-aid and illness section. However, they show month-by-month pictures of a pregnant woman -- she gains 26 pounds, perfect clear skin, no stretch marks, no cellulite, in short, perfect. Hard to live up to in real life. As a Registered Nurse I would recommend the pictures and health care section, especially for new parents. Very helpful. But don't read the text! The Sears Parenting books are so much better.

It also did me a lot of good for me to hear my favorite bassist, Marcus Miller, added to the mix. He adds that touch of funk that only he can do. With Marcus thumpin' the bass, Joe tickling the ivory, and the rest of the guys doing their things, you can't help but love this piece. \\"Healing the Wounds\\" is probably the best Crusader cd to date.

Why? because it is pablem for the senses, elavator music that goes nowhere, there is zero sense of fun or adventure. It may be \\"modern\\" and \\"sophisticated\\" but it is above all boring, as if someone went out of his way to bleach out all of the groove and swing of the early Crusaders albums. The good news?

A few months ago the imput where the USB cable that attaches from the MP3 player to the unit is not holding the MP3 player and is not making a connection to charge. The cord fits in the USB port very loosely and falls out or just won't charge. Now I use the USB cable that came with it and the charger for my phone to charge the unit and that works out great.

The constant resonance and downward tones inflict damage upon ones nerves, and Reed still claims to this day that it was a honest and serious attempt at making music. Being under emotional distress at the time of the recording of this experimental album, the music heard in this album speaks from Reed's twisted heart and soul, and broke through in plain english the torture of a mind. Metal Machine Music is simply the most amazing thing that I have ever had the joy to hear. Bravo, Lou Reed, bravo."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE READ THE REVIEW FIRST ...

No matter how bad some albums are - even if the artist envisioned them as such - there are people out there who will champion them as works of genius. This is better as a concept. Instead of putting out an album of rock songs, folk songs, acoustic songs, poetry readings, whatever - Lou gives us 60 minutes of electronic noise. Funny, unless you sit through the thing. The idea is good, but being there to experience it is not. Some might think it's clever to subject their friends to this next time their friends come over, but anyone who would do so probably has no friends. Enjoy the idea, skip the album - buy something by the Shaggs if unlistenable music is your thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny","review":"Whether Reed meant this as a joke on his record company, a joke on critics, a joke on his fans, or all of the above may never be known.

Lets get real here folks.This is not a Lester Bangs inspired trek into genius,it is a commercial suicide attempt.If Lou was really serious,he would have made \\"Metal Machine Music...The Sequel\\" instead of \\"Coney Island Baby\\" as his next album.A must hear for the bored,the pretentious, and the certifiable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Songs?","review":"I am amazed at how loosely some people use the themr 'song\\" and the term 'music.'

He recorded this album to complete his contract with them. Needless to say Reed was not at all happy and basically told them if they wanted two albums worth of material, they'd get it. Thus, you get \\"Metal Machine Music\\", extended white noise and feedback. After he released the album, Reed's record company released it, probably thinking Reed's attempt at professional suiside would do him in. I'm surprised it has made its way over to CD - uh, it's unlistenable.If you like this, great, but I liken it to watching white noise on the TV - no substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM!!!","review":"Do not buy this album - unless you enjoy listening to a dentist drill!

I know of no one who has been able to stand this for longer than two minutes: feedback, electronic noises, not even the slightest hint at melody, rhythm, lyrics or whatever you are used find in pop music. Nothing at all. I think Lou Reed has made a bunch of great albums (Berlin is a masterpiece, Transformer, Coney Island Baby, even the live ones aren't too bad), but this is a stinker. For the life of me, I cannot understand anyone giving even one star to this 'recording', but Amazon won't let you give zero stars.

All I know is, i've drawn on it as an influence, though I don't know what a good idea it was as an entire album. But seriously, outside of Zappa, who else ever would have had the balls to make this album? And who else could have pulled it off like Reed?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Best interpreted as a gesture","review":"Trashing this album on musical grounds seems inappropriate since it can hardly be considered a musical work (no composition, no structure, no progression or development, etc.) So it's best reviewed as a gesture but I think it fails in that respect too. MMM is a sonic stink bomb, hurled by Lou at the industry and his fans. Even at this late date it's a depressing reminder of Lou at his mid-seventies low point of cynical contempt. That said, I am amused that this was originally a double vinyl album (not one disk of unbearable noise, but two!) And the fake concert-album packaging, while a rip-off, is not a bad practical joke.

The wisdom in this short book is based on the prayer of a humble man. (1) If you haven't found your ministry, this book will teach you to pray in a way that God can lead you to the ministry He has for you. (2) If you are in ministry, God will use it to \\"grow\\" that ministry or open new doors for your work. (3) This prayer is for the 'sinner saved by grace' to learn your place in Gods plan. (4) If you're looking at it for selfish gain, forget it... this is truly a book for those who seek to follow God. While the book is small, the message is mighty and God IS using it in the lives of many believers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prayer of Jabez","review":"I'm so glad I ordered this book!

A must have for fans!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened?","review":"I wouldn't usually give a Madonna CD single two stars, but these dance remixes have to be the worst makeovers of a Madonna song I have ever heard. Madonna has re-recorded her vocals and not for the better. She sounds bored and she oversings as if she is Shirley Bassey. The original album version was stunning and surprisingly moving, but these remixes sound campy and unintentionally hilarious. Madonna, who usually picks great DJs to remix her songs, should have found some others (Vasquez, Hex Hector?) to do the job here. A real disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended!","review":"The song Don't Cry For Me Argentina is so beautiful, and this CD features all the Dance Remixes you've ben waiting for + the original album version!!

The acting is hesitant, the lines delivered teleprompter fashion. There seems to be little interaction between the characters who are in the scene together, but could well be on their cell phones the way the lines are delivered. Sorry to pan any Austen story, but there it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"incoherent, pointless, pretentious","review":"Godard is mediocre at his best, and this is the worst of that mediocre director. Incoherent, pointless, pretentious: these are just the nice things about this cosmic bore. To this add the stupid mannerisms. E.g., Godard likes to have multiple concurrent sound sources for no rational reason (e.g, TV running loud in the background + background music+ the dialog). Or people carry books and for no reason starting to read out loud passages irrelevant to anything else in the \\"story\\". Or irrelevant images like a chandelier is displayed frozen for no reason.I wish i could give Godard zero stars. I think of him as a charlatan that should be run out of the business."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jane Austen defiled","review":"I bought this version because we needed it to complete our collection. I doubt we will ever watch it again, after viewing it once. It was painful to watch: most of the players seemed miscast, the hairstyles were straight from the late 1960's early 1970s, , and the emotions were stated but never shown by the players. We actually hoped Marianne would die and be put out of her (acting) misery. All my wife kept saying while we watched this version was \\"I hope you didn't pay much for this DVD\\". Definitely the worst of any of the BBC attempts at Sense and Sensibility."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful. Even Austen addicts should avoid.","review":"I was interested in seeing this version particularly because I loved 'Poldark' and thought Robin Ellis and Clive Francis would be interesting to see, and I always thought the BBC could do no wrong. Oops. Clive Francis as Willoughby was not nearly as much a cad as I thought he should be, and I think Robin Ellis had a little too much gravitas to carry off the role of Ferrars - he is the polar opposite of Hugh Grant's Ferrars. I found it all too difficult to watch - I was always gaping at the 70's hairstyles (why do they give women soooo much hair? Willoughby's voluminous faux-victorian tousled hair nearly stole the show). The lighting was amateurish and the female actors were over-the-top. One notable exception was Patricia Routledge as Mrs. Jennings, who is over-the-top in her own right. Please don't bother with this. There are far, far better adaptations out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sense and Sensibility Review","review":"I'm collecting as many video dramatizations of Jane Austen's novels as I can lay my hands on. I particularly prefer the \\"older\\" BBC versions to some of the newer because of the longer run times ... meaning there is more of the book on the screen. And the British are renown for being \\"faithful\\" to their dramatization of classic literature. Although the actors are certainly older than the characters they are portraying, I still liked this version being familiar with so many of those actors from other Masterpiece Theatre and/or BBC productions I've viewed on PBS over the years.This nearly three-hour version features \\"salad days\\" performances by Joanna David, Patricia Routledge, Robin Ellis and Clive Frances (adversaries in the POLDARK mini-series) and when you factor in that this 1971 mini-series had never aired in this country made it a \\"must\\" purchase.

He claims that only around a million Jews were killed in the holocaust and the Jews themselves ran the camps in a Judeo-Communist conspiracy. To be honest this book gave me a headache, page after page made me sick.

As one of the great conductors of all time, Weingartner was fully familiar with all the great music of Western civilization. In this symphony he seems to be writing the totality of all the great music that had gone before. I don't mean to say it's derivative, but rather it's the summation of all that's great & beautiful in Wastern music."},{"rating":"2","title":"WEINGARTNER THE COMPOSER","review":"The great conductor Felix Weingartner composed plenty of music. This recording of his symphonic poem Das Gefilde der Seligen, is wonderful. Think of Schubert, Liszt, Mahler, Bruckner, R. Strauss, Beethoven and keep going! The symphony number 2 has these influences as well, but it goes further into Weingartner's personal style. If you may be growing a bit weary of the old warhorses but want to hear music that warms your soul only the way... say.....Brahms can, I can't recommend this recording enough. Weingartner was a brilliant orchestrator. He had a great sense of line and proportion. One wonderful theme follows the other in a seemless tapestry of color and expression. The CPO recording (hybrid multichannel) is compatible with SACD and regular CD players. Soundwise, it is one of the finest recordings I have ever heard. Conductor Marko Letonja and the Sifoniorchester Basel are stellar in every way. These are lovingly warm and life affirming performances."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK Symphony","review":"I am surprised at the extravagant praise here on Amazon for Weingartner's Second Symphony: one of the best symphonies of all time, should be in the standard repertoire alonside Dvorak and Tchaikovsky, etc. In truth, this is better than the First Symphony, but it's no masterpiece. Repetition substitutes for development, melodies are unmemorable, and I would characterize the piece as a whole as workman-like rather than inspired. The tone poem (Das Gefilde der Seligen) starts well, but an insipid theme is introduced and mercilessly repeated, guaranteeing that I, anyway, will never listen to it again. That said, it's impossible to imagine these modest pieces presented in better performances or recordings (hence the four stars). If you like earlier installments in this series, get this one; otherwise, try other late romantic composers like Franz Schmidt, Alfven, Reger, the early Wellesz...."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great unknown","review":"Weingartner's second symphony is an undiscovered treasure.

The son stumbles upon the knowledge that the wicked general of Litchenburg was plotting to become king by forcing marriage to the queen Zona and by killing anyone who got in his way. Of course One of the major heros in this film is the son of the great Count, so he exhibits the same strength, sword fighting skills, and honor of his father. This is an excellent movie plot filled with drama, romance, betrayal, and action. Louis Hayward has to disguise himself as a fool in order to uncover the evil general's plan. This disguise is similar to the fool's disguise of the recent remake of the Scarlet Pimpernel.

Something I've learned about from personal experience. They're difficult to communicate with those who aren't involved with the sport (the risk of terminal boredom being very high) but form an incredible bond with those who are. This book, on the experiences of the pioneers of women's rowing in the 70's, tells it like it is, and makes it fascinating. Dan Boyne has recreated the whole experience of these women, and it's an experience that is, fortunately or unfortunately, not so far from the present day. It's an impressive addition to the tiny canon of rowing-lit, and even more importantly to the growing canon of books about women athletes and competitors, and what it takes to be in the game. A riveting read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book for sports fans!","review":"The Red Rose Crew is an excellent, informative, and engaging book for fans of any sport. Though I have never picked up an oar, I greatly enjoyed Boyne's character development and storytelling skills. In an era in which women athletes must often look pretty to court fan support, Boyne focuses on the courage, strength and poise of these pioneers without romanticizing away their flaws. The book is a great read and the plot transcends the sport of rowing. It is an essential read for female athletes in their teens and 20's who are often not aware of the doors that pioneering women athletes had to break down."},{"rating":"2","title":"So much more than just a rowing story .....","review":"If you love rowing, if you love sports, if you're interested in historical moments .... this book is wonderful.

From inside the book, Barbara Cartland writes to the reader:Mary Latimer, crushed into insignificance by her boring husband, pulls at one's heart strings and will make you long as I did for her to find happiness. Her daughter, who tries to have a modern outlook but fails, is adorable. This is a lovely story in the real meaning of the word"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap and Cheezy","review":"I had high hopes for this toy because I purchased it off the recommendation of another homeschooling mom's blog. I usually respect her opinion, but this time I wish I hadn't. The pieces themselves are made of a very cheap feeling plastic. They aren't even close to being sturdy. The set includes axels and wheels, but the wheels fall off of any vehicle that one tries to construct and drive around. This is quite frustrating for a young child who has worked very hard to make something out of the pieces. I tried every possible combination of parts to get those wheels to stay on and ended up tossing all of it into the garbage because it just leads to incredible frustration for anyone who tries to use it (grown-ups included).

The key here is speed as the band delivers punk-ish and bare bones renditions that gallop along like a maniac on a mission. Add to this Quine's frenzied morse code solos and led heavy rhythm and the effect is nothing short of stunning. Reed's voice (he still growls and sings here) is irreverent and wrathful while the rest of the band contribute to the no-nonsense driving pace (Maher's drums) and timely countermelody (Saunder's bass). Live recordings seldom sounded this raw and enthralling. Without a doubt, Reed's best album of the 80's."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 1/2 Stars","review":"Recorded in 1983 with Lou's most critically acclaimed band since the Velvet Underground..\\"Live In Italy\\" comes with a lot of hype and promise.The band is far from tight and not in very fine form at all here.

It is about 100 pages too long and loaded with the sort of self-important dialoge that makes the reader want to slap the characters (or the author) silly for wasting so much of our time. There is nothing about the golfing portions of the book that will enlighten the uninitiated, and little to spark the interest of long-time golfers. Oftentimes the writing is clinical and choppy, especially the chapter that drones on and on and on about Freudian psychology: one wonders why. Freudian psychology is about as mysogynistic as one can get, especially in a purportedly lesbian novel. I also thought it was creepy that the women pictured on the cover don't have any mouths. Is it possible that \\"First Resort\\" was actually written by a man? Based on how it is written and how it reads I wouldn't be surprised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par.","review":"I have read Ms. Little's other books previous to this one and enjoyed them more. I found that Jordan's character was a bit much. I thought that she was just way too good and experienced at too many varied things. Also, I do believe that intense relationships can occur in short time frames, but the relationship characterized in this book did not seem plausible to me. The transition from a scared, severely battered wife not able to be touched to having a physical relationship with a gay woman in one week is difficult to swallow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still A Separatist","review":"The so-called Thoughtful Reader from Toronto is either a personal friend of the so-called author of this book or the author herself. This book will be used in one of my graduate classes next semester as an example of oppression and class systems among lesbians. As for the woman who read Park Webster as black because of her dialogue, all I can say is that, as an African-American woman myself, that is an incredibly racist statement. To make those kinds of assumptions based on generic speech patterns is the epitome of elitism and is the whole problem with Nanci Little and her readership."},{"rating":"1","title":"I must be missing something","review":"I couldn't disagree more that the excessive alcohol abuse was a cautionary comparison to \\"The Great Gatsby.\\" Actually, I thought the author flattered herself by even mentioning Fitzgerald.

Multitalented is one thing, fantastical egotrip is another.I don't get it. I read this book on reccommendation from someone else who read \\"Thin Fire\\" and liked it.

Barbara Stanwyck plays a writer who pretends to be married with a baby and pretends she's an expert at cooking, sewing, and overall home-making. Her boss decides that she should have a recovering military man to her country home (which she doesn't have) for Christmas so he can experience cozy home-life over the holidays. Then, her boss manages to invite himself along, too! She feels sure she's just lost her job and this will be the worst Christmas ever.... but a male friend of hers (who has been pestering her to marry him for a while) convinces her to marry him and they can have everyone to HIS home in the country. Of course, she doesn't love him.... and she ends up in love with the military man.... It's one problem after another, making this movie a real hoot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"love this classic!","review":"I had this movie on VHS and recently replaced it with DVD because I just have to watch it every Christmas. Think of a classic, old fashioned Christmas set in the snow-covered countryside, sleigh rides and sleigh bells, homey kitchen scenes and imagine those good smells coming from it. And such a cute, light-hearted story full of romance. If you like old, black-and-white movies and ones that make you feel good, you will like this to put you in the Christmas spirit. With Barbara Stanwyck and Sidney Greenstreet, it can't compare to the later version. Highly recommended!Christmas in Connecticut"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good old fashioned hokey fun","review":"We start every Christmas season by watching this movie. Sure, it's hokey, contrived, and uncharacteristic for Barbara, but it's so much fun watching her get flustered by everything, especially flipping pancakes and changing diapers.

It bubbles over with merriment and radiates good cheer like a Christmas tree with all the lights lit. This is a surprisingly well-known film (they play it on television every year at Christmastime) and it's highly entertaining. Stanwyck is winning as Elizabeth Lane, (Betty Crocker personified) who writes a cooking column for a housekeeping magazine (in actuality, she knows nothing about either subject) When a soldier comes to her home for the holidays, she must either master the ways of housekeeping of reveal her incompetence. Dennis Morgan is very likable here and the creepy Reginald Gardiner is amusing as the man who tries to win over Stanwyck. The plot is thin as air and the direction is rather unsure, the script and pacing could have been better - but just sit back and enjoy this little flick - it never claimed to be a Sturges masterpiece.

It's a non-taxing frothy screwball farce that goes down easy acted by a first-rate cast. While your at it check out the short subject included with the disc, \\"Star in the Night\\".

A friend of mine recommended this film as a holiday classic.Compared to the others, it pales miserably. The plot is stretched far too thin, and there's only one - ONE - song in the whole movie. If you're not going to have a good plot, at least provide some good song and dance (and in that era, song and dance was at its best). If you're not going to have any singing or dancing, then give us a plot.For those who love any and every movie from that era, by all means get it. For those who love any and every holiday movie, go ahead and get it. For those who want a little more, don't waste your money.

The acting is respectable (outstanding in the case of Greenstreet and Sakal, the two veterans from \\"Casablanca\\"), but the plot is goofy and the script leaves much to be desired. Stanwyck, who is supposed to be pretending to be a country housewife, is required to let the cat out of the bag at every turn (apparently not realizing that she has a baby, not realizing what a cow is, and other such idiocies). Invest instead in \\"Miracle on 34th Street\\" (1947), \\"It's a Wonderful Life,\\" or the Alastair Sim rendition of \\"Scrooge\\" (\\"A Christmas Carol\\"). Those are the true classics of the season, with messages that will delight, year after year. Even \\"Holiday Inn\\" and \\"White Christmas,\\" both fairly slight fare, are a step up from this.

I've come to expect this from Palmolive dishwasher detergent, but didn't know if the ECO brand would do the same. The rest of the ecological brands, well, you know the drill. Nice idea, but the load doesn't get clean. That goes for Seventh Generation, Meyers, anything you find at Whole Foods. This stuff stays on my permanent buy list.

I see that scores of people are complaining about this problem (you can search for \\"Palmolive eco white residue\\" or read forums discussing the subject). The residue is calcium carbonate. It precipitates from hard water, and it does respond to acids. Therefore your best bet is to round up all your affected dishes and put them through a mildly acidic wash cycle without detergent.

I bought this album when neither Amazon nor the Internet eexisted, I have been a fan of the Cocteaus for 14 years, and I just loved the idea of not using the name Cocteau Twins. Some tracks like \\"Memory Gongs\\" sound as if they had been played under the water. A perfect soundtrack for being lost in a pinus forest amidst a dense fog, barely being able to see the blurry shape of the trees. The last track has the most inventive and senseless name ever, and it grows and grows until it explodes. One can barely hear Harold Budd in the Cocteau Tracks, but can surely here Robin Guthrie's guitar sliding through Harold Budd's tracks. One of my best cds. I would like to take it to my grave."},{"rating":"2","title":"The First Track is Trumpet Ecstacy","review":"Bunny Berigan (1908-1942) was one of the most talented trumpet players ever, but he died so young, he is less well known than he should be, especially to today's young people. His trumpet playing on the first track's \\"I Can't Get Started\\" is a thrilling demonstration of a human approaching perfection. His singing on the same track is so familiar and endearing to me, I think of it as wonderful, even though I'm guessing that a singing expert would think of that idea as laughable. The remaining fourteen tracks are mainly old standbys from the \\"big band\\" era starting in the 1920s. These did not impress me, partly because of my overexposure to them and partly because I heard them this time on a CD, but think they would be best heard in a setting ideal for slow dancing and sentimental pondering. What I don't know is how well the same tracks would sound on a different recording of the same material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I have always loved the title track and hoped that other Berigan songs might be equally enjoyable. They're not. Stick with the title track, available on other albums (I especially recommend \\"We'll Meet Again: The Love Songs of World War II\\", which is where I found \\"I Can't Get Started\\" originally) and save your money. The biography was interesting, and perhaps explains why Berigan might be considered a \\"one hit wonder\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect solution","review":"I'm a professional keyboard player, and gig with the Ampwedge weekly (on average) playing jazz, R&B, funk, rock, etc. I use this with a Yamaha DXR8 powered speaker to monitor my keyboard rig. The Lange Ampwedge is a elegantly simple solution to a longstanding problem. I've tried to angle the DXR8 and a number of other speaker solutions to better aim it for monitoring - using direct boxes, gaffers tape rolls, and just about anything else that was handy at the venue. The Ampwedge is light, simple, non-slip, effective - perfect for the job. The fact that it is also small and matte-finish means it's not obvious onstage, which is another plus. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, effective floor wedge","review":"As with the other reviews, this just works.

Unfortunately, many preachers find it difficult to make connections with all the readings for a given Sunday or Feast Day. The Days of the Lord series is not an exegetical commentary, but rather a guide for insights into what the Church desires to be preached from its selection of readings. The text is clear and easy to read. It provides some exegesis to ground the readings in the thought of the biblical world. But it also includes enough poetry and symbolic language to allow a good homilist to use these readings to speak to the people of today. These books are a great help in constructing a lectionary-based homily or sermon, thereby achieving the goals set forth by the bishops in their pastoral instruction on preaching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Family Circus Treasury","review":"This book has some of the oldest and a lot of hilarious cartoons from the family circus.

The problem is that it attempts to focus on at least five different cases, sometimes skipping between one and another. The result is that I could not feel much of anything for any of the stories except that of the young woman and her governess who are lesbians. I was amused by the ending which demonstrates that even the \\"best therapy\\" may not be a cure for what society considers sexual problems. Regardless of the warnings the movies feels the need to have, it is not very sexual explicit nor did I find it particularly arousing.

Not SmashING","review":"This documentary is mostly about the physicists, not the physics, of high energy particle research and how the US government has devalued this research. Since this level of physics requires federal funds, it of course has a political element. (In the interest of balance, maybe the producers should have found some conservative physicists to argue why their research is not of sufficient economic value and government investment in their life's work has been a waste.) The Fermilab budget is continually undercut and the United States' position as a world leader in research, as in so many other areas, continues to erode. Infrastructure has never been a politically exciting talking point, and infrastructure for the future is even less so. It's not morning in America for science."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I love watching documentaries about all kinds of topics, but I most enjoy science based documentaries. I would not even count this as a scientific documentary. It was more a personal interest story (I don't care if you commute or have kids, tell me about what you are doing to find the higgs!). It talks about some of the people who worked at fermi, but didn't really go anywhere. It didn't end with the finding of the higgs boson or the closing of the tevatron, it just ended.

It is interesting & tries to distil the concepts, but doesn't really add to our investment knowledge, unless you haven't read anything about Warren before. The continual references to Jack Welsh also seem redundant. You would be much better off reading \\"Making of an American Capitalist\\" by Roger Lowenstein which is the definitive Warren text. However, it is easy to read & gives a good overall view of the Buffett approach, but a lot of it is assumption or extrapolation based on other writers, shareholder letters & a bit of psychology thrown in for good measure. No important players were actually interviewed & given that the writer is based in the UK it appears he just pulled out his collection of Warren books, a psych. text & Jack Welsh's biography then started writing. The Warren worship is getting a bit tired."},{"rating":"1","title":"author had trouble communicating","review":"i read this book about 3 years ago, i don't remember much, i guess the info was ok. but what i do remember is the author really didn't know how to get his points across.

Moreover, these books make one feel like a moron, because they play up all the traits that you probably don't have. This book was a refreshing change. Written in a matter-of-fact style, it talks about some of the basic rules used by Buffet over many years. Making managers think like owners. Focusing on long-term wealth creation rather than short-term fads. Not investing in anything that he cannot understand. This book is a great way to pick up a few broad brush strokes of the Warren Buffet philosophy and then jot down a few pointers that may work for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Proof Text","review":"Bruce J Malina's book on the Jesus group may come of as slightly pedantic, but overall it is rewarding. I consider a lot of the anthropology and social psych that went into this book to be something of the proof text for a lot of the unexplained or unelaborated claims that go into his commentaries. Make no mistake this book is highly academic, while it is being marketed as a book for everyone, it is not.

It's shaped like a pacifier so she tried to suck on it, but it's so oddly large that she has just spit it out each time I tried giving it to her. Other reviewers have posted about the same issue.

It *is* on the large side and he was only able to 'nibble' at the raspberry part at the very beginning. We put it away for a bit and took it out a few weeks later for him to 'grow into.' We had it for about a month (and he loved chomping on it) before the handle/ring broke in the middle. This was not on a seam, so it shouldn't have been weakened in any way. I didn't have the receipt, so sadly could not return it.In addition, it doesn't stay cold (which I assumed it wouldn't when I first felt the material it was made of).Great idea, but poor actualization of design.

Most other teethers only hold his interest for a brief time, but he will gnaw on this thing for ages.We keep one in every room of the house, in the diaper bag, in the car, and in pockets of various articles of clothing because we don't want to be caught without it. So far, he's never damaged any of them and they've all seen plenty of use.We like that all parts of the teether are chewable, each with different textures to soothe babies' gums. Plus, you can easily use plastic rings or one of those pacifier holders to attach the teether to the stroller or yours/baby's clothing, and it's not going to hit the ground to be soiled.I've given them out to every new mom whose shower I've attended this past year, as it's been one of the most valuable items we've used to help our baby stay comfortable.Great product for great price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My baby never liked, loved, enjoyed these","review":"I was very excited when I found these. I have 5 kids and with my youngest it looked like a great new possible solution to help during teething. My daughter seriously hated these. I'm not sure if it was the texture, the material used, etc. She just never liked them and I stopped trying to offer them when she started crying just from looking at them O_o At least we tried."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's just ok","review":"I bought this item for my 3 month old because she started teething. Despite the fact that the product recommends 3+ months, it was far too large for her mouth. She seems like she would probably be interested if it were smaller. I bought it because her teething rings that she got at the baby shower were all far too large for her to do anything with and this looked a lot more manageable. Not to mention, she loves her pacifiers, so this seemed perfect. I'm very disappointed. I'll probably continue trying it occasionally it hopes that she will grow into it. If she does change her mind I will amend my review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby likes to play with this","review":"My baby loves to play with this. She isn't as fond of chewing it, as she is of holding it (since it's just the right size) and playing. I would buy this again."},{"rating":"2","title":"great little teether!","review":"My baby loves this teether! The small size and design make it easy for him to hold and fiddle with. I use one of those straps to secure a toy to his stroller when we are out in town. My little guy may chew on the strap more than the teether but he does enjoy it as well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just ok","review":"I bought this for my 1 year old, I thought it would help with her teething. Unfortunately she doesn't like it, she really won't even put it in her mouth. The nipple part also seems very large... It might be great for other babies, but not for mine :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG what a lifesaver!!!!!!!","review":"This is the best teether ever!!! My 5 month old is soo picky when it comes to teethers. I tried everything from teething beads, frozen pacifier, washclothes and oragel. Nothing helped for more then 2 minutes. Once i gave this to him he immediately put it in his mouth and started chewing on it. It looks like a pacifier so he knows already to put it in his mouth. I got the all blue one because i heard the multicolor one would comes apart. I love this teether soo much i am going to buy more. I just wish it came with more solid colors. Besides that i love it, my son loves it. Its AMAZING!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Raspberry Teether","review":"This is a must have. There is another one on the market with a green handle, and either a red or a blue \\"nipple\\". Don't buy it. There have been reported incidences of the two pieces (yes, they are molded together with whatever they use) separating from one another, posing a possible choking hazard. This is all one piece, and both of my babies loved them! Neither of my babies would ever use a pacifier (oy), but they loved chewing on these so much! A great purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great teether/pacifier!","review":"My baby does not take pacifiers but she has been teething and she loves the feeling of cold nubs in her mouth. I freeze this pacifier and then give it to her and she loves it! She actually was able to hold it by the ring portion and press it to her mouth and just gnaw on the bumpy raspberry part to her content. She just loved it! The design is also very cute.The teether seems very durable and it also has a lot of flexibility/stretch to it to withstand baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"good product","review":"The Multi-colored berries attracted me at first but after reading the comments on them I went with the solid color blue one.

She LOVES it so much it is usually with her 24/7! However, we got hers at our local CVS Pharmacy for $3.99. I would suggest checking out yours first (if you have them where you live)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for teething babys older than 6 months.","review":"When I first bought the teether my daughter was only 3 1/2 months old and her mouth was a bit too small to use it. Now she's seven months old and she adores it, she likes to chew on it and tug on it while it's in her mouth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Teether","review":"My daughter started teething right around 3 months, when her hand to mouth coordination still wasn't the best, so the bulkier teethers did little more than frustrate her when she tried to get a hold of them. This teether is great, it's lightweight and was easy for her to hold and bring to her mouth (and she's never used a pacifier). I was a bit wary to purchase after reading the reviews about it coming apart, but mine seems to be all once piece, so perhaps they resolved that problem. She's now 4.5 months and she still loves chewing on it...along with everything else she can get her hands on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teether is one-piece and safe","review":"My daughter is teething, and she really seems to enjoy chewing on the unique shape of this teether/pacifier. Another reviewer commented about the bulb part of this teether separating from the wide base. I don't see how that would happen. I requested and received the all-pink teether, and it is molded from one piece of rubber/platic (perhaps the other colors are different?). I do not think this teether will come apart, and it seems very safe to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"RaZzBerry Baby Teether","review":"Received this item fast as promised. The first item was defective and came apart during initial sterilization, but after an email to the seller a new one was sent to me very quickly. The second item did not come apart during boiling, and has lasted. My son loves to suck and chew on this thing both frozen and not. The small loop is easy for most babies to keep a hold of. Great alternative to your basic teether."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the little RaZ!","review":"Our poor Little One (LO) has had a really rough time with the teething. Lots of pain, drooling, waking in the night, and refusing feedings... and he's only 5 months old. (We've only just begun...) So, we've tried everything that's been suggested to us and divided them into WIN and FAIL categories. The RaZ-berry teether is a definite WIN, and is LO's second favorite teether behind Sophie the Giraffe and one ahead of a washcloth-wrapped ice cube. It's rubbery and squishy, but firm enough to provide resistance on the gums. It's also easy for him to grab and hold with his \\"paws\\" as he learns to control the digits. I saw the review about one falling apart; I took note but didn't see anything that would cause this helicopter mom any concern; it looks pretty sturdy. But we'll be sure to examine it before we ever give it to him, like we do most toys. I recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for kiddos who don't usually take pacifiers","review":"This is the only teether that worked for our little one! He didn't really take to pacifiers, and we had a tough time trying to introduce different teethers. The RazBaby was perfect from the moment we handed it to him. Great size, with a handle large enough for several little fingers to grasp easily. He loved it! We kept our in the fridge so it would be cool for his gums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sterilizing","review":"I loved the idea of this teether. Unfortunately, I am not sure if I should us it. I just got my order from UPS. I sterilized the Raz according to the instructions on the package. I put it in boiling water for 5 minutes. Cooled and inspected. The glue or adhesive that holds the ring part to the raz part melted away and the ring part is breaking off. Very upset. I would have sanitized in the dishwasher, but I was in a hurry to give to my baby. A flimsy product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too big--triggered gag reflex","review":"My son (5 months old) didn't like this at all. He put it in his mouth like you would a regular pacifier and he gagged. Way too big."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too big for babies mouth!","review":"I bought it and she spits it out over and over. She's teething very bad and refuses this thing because it's huge! it's too round. It's too big for her mouth and she has to form an O shape just to fit it in....which is uncomfortable! This thing should be more flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great teether","review":"I thought it would be a nice texture for my daughter to chomp on during her teething but she really could care less for it. I think the problem is that the raspberry part is too big/fat and it doesn't fit comfortably in her mouth. She actually chews more on the ring/handle and leaves than she does the actual raspberry! I would not recommend this product to any of my friends!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby loves it!","review":"We have tried a lot of teethers and this one is one of the few that my baby can actually hold and handle with her little hands. She loves it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too big for my baby's mouth.","review":"I thought maybe this would help my son with teething, but it is too big for his mouth. He isn't able to keep it in his mouth at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"cool teether","review":"My 4 month old loves the texture of this teether, but it's too big for her mouth. She won't suck on pacifiers. Instead she wants to chew them, so I thought this would be great. It's just too big and she gags.I like the concept though. Maybe when she's a little older."},{"rating":"1","title":"large and confusing (suck vs chew)","review":"I was really excited about this teether. In my mind it made total sense as a solution to teething babies. Unfortunately to my 4 month old this is not as intuitive. She keeps wanting to suck the teether like a pacifier rather than chew on it for her gums. This usually results in her spitting it out in less than a minute. In addition when she does move it to her gums to chew on, its rather large and heavy so it ends up falling out the side of her mouth unless someone is holding onto it for her. Would not recommend for early teethers or young infants (6 months or under). We'll try again in a few months and see if she likes it any better."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's too big....","review":"I love the idea of this teether. My 5 1/2 month old son however didn't like the size of it. It is way to big for his mouth. He would chew for a moment then start gagging. He has a soothie pacifier, the raz-berry is about 2 1/2 to 3 time the width of his pacifier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this for non nursing babies? Pacifier babies?","review":"Well, it's a good concept, however my baby never took a bottle or a pacifier and did not like the feel of this teether in her mouth. Maybe it's for babies used to that feeling in their mouths (bottle nipple and pacifier). If your a nursing 100% mom, I dont know if this is the right teether for you. Also, on a good note, you may want to try teething tablets all natural by Hyland's, if your little one is teething badly. They worked wonders for me! You can buy them anywhere. Target, for some reason, keeps them behind the pharmacy counter. Again, they are all natural, no chemicals at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummer...","review":"Not sure if it is just my baby girl but she wants nothing to do with this teether. It is actually a cool little teether and seems like it would have been a hit with all teething babes but she actually prefers to chew and gnaw on her toys rather than take a binkie or pacifier/teether. I think that if your little one is the same (does not like pacifiers or binkie's) then you might run into the same issue. However, the teether is only a couple of bucks so it may be worth trying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little teether.","review":"This seems to be one of my sons favorite teething items. It's easy for him to get in and out of his mouth unlike some of the bulky teething toys. I would recommend this to a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunate!","review":"I really wish this would have worked!!! I love the whole concept of the nifty teether....but it just doesn't do the job!! I bought this when she was 4 months and didn't show as much interest anticipated, now @ 7 months is a lost thought ;[ I put the item on her Baby Einstein bouncer as a hanging item, she chewed on it and showed some interest but not as much as other items, that I actually wouldn't assume was better. Very dissapointed in the quality...like others said, looked like it was just glued on ;[ Which it was! Good ole' teethers you put in the freezer from target work better ladies! Don't waste your money ;[ sucks...it was a cute idea though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Interested","review":"My baby is not a pacificer baby. She likes chrew toys tough.

(but for us so were all the teething items, he never used a one, just wanted to chew on straps)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Razberry Teether - Good, but big","review":"My 4-month old baby likes to teeth on this a little bit, but because it's bigger than a normal pacifier she can't really fit it in her mouth all that well. I think it will be better when she's 5+ months. Otherwise good product and good invention! Now they just need to make some tiny ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helps sore gums","review":"My 5 1/2 month old loves this teether. When he started teething a couple months ago, I gave this to him and he wasn't sure what to do with it at first because it was bigger in his mouth than his normal pacifier. He quickly figured out that he could chew on it and was able to get a good grasp on the handle with his little hands. When he chews on other toys, teethers, etc. he gets agitated if he chews too hard, but not with this teether. It seems to have the right consistency to allow him to massage his gums without irritating them. We try to keep this with us wherever we go."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a hit!","review":"I just purchased this teether for my 5 1/2 mth old and she loves it. The entire thing is great for chewing on and seems to be very soothing. She has chewed on the \\"berry\\" part, the gaurd, and the handle. She smiles when we hand this teether to her and quickly puts it in her mouth. We have tried other conventional teethers and they have just been thrown to the side. I am glad I made this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice material soft","review":"This is a very nice pacifier , nice texture, very soft.

He would cry every time i would offer it to him. I assume he was confusing it with a pacifier. So the teether didnt work for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ideal for babies around 6-8 months","review":"First of all, the teether is pretty big so getting the big nubby part into the mouth can be a challenge when your baby is smaller. My child does not use a pacifier but when he was about 8 months, this became one of his favorite teethers. (Up to that point, a smaller, spoon-like device seemed to work better).So make sure your baby's mouth is bigger before you buy this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby gagged on it","review":"My little one did not like this at all, but she does not take a pacifier either, I would not waste the money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a fan","review":"this binky shaped teether did not go over well at all. she just kept trying to suck on it and would get frustrated when she couldnt. it also is not very durable. i wouldnt buy this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING CHOKING HAZARD!

It's not a must have for her so far. It is a nice flexible silicone material. The only downside I see so far is that she likes to shove the round \\"handle\\" piece in her mouth and has gagged on that a few times. Since the material is soft, she can pretty easily get the handle into her mouth, and get it out quick."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO BIG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This says 3+ months, but I don't know how any 3 month old fits this in his/her mouth. It's HUGE! My little guy won't be able to get this thing in his mouth for months. I do like the design of it, and he does like gumming on the parts he can get in his mouth, but I have to hold it for him to do that. I was hoping for something he could use largely on his own since his little hands aren't coordinated enough to hold onto other teethers. Sigh. I'm going to keep it for future use, but it's a big disappointment that he can't use it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE it!","review":"My 6 month old son loves this teether! He wanted nothing to do with it at first, but we kept sticking it in his mouth. He loves to grab it and chew on the leaves. He manages to hold on to this longer than anything else he has. Highly recommend! Warning....keep a bib handy. Drool seems to multiply each time he uses."},{"rating":"2","title":"My child LOVES this","review":"My 5 month old son seems to really enjoy this teether. He isn't teething just yet but as most babies, he likes to have things to chew on. This teether is so similar to a pacifier which is something he is quite familiar with. It's easier for him to handle than most traditional style teethers. Also, the fact that the entire teether is made of pliable soft rubber with no hard plastic parts seems like a great idea as he enjoys chewing on the green parts of this teether as well as the blue bumpy part. I would definitely recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only teether my baby likes","review":"My baby girl loves this teether, more than any other teether I have purchased her. For weeks I tried to get her to take the the Vulli Sophie the Giraffe teether but she would end up throwing it down after a short time. I purchased this teether from CVS for a higher price after we were on vacation and I couldn't find her teethers that I brought and she took right too it. She is 9 months old now and still loves this teether. I really like this teether because it's easy for her to hold also, so she doesn't keep dropping it meaning I don't have to clean it a million times."},{"rating":"1","title":"baby item","review":"my grandson is not into this at all....but it's cute and he may enjoy it later on but for this first stage of teething it's just not for him."},{"rating":"1","title":"teether came apart","review":"I absolutely love the idea of this teether which is why I bought it. Unfortunately, the raspberry part (which seemed like it was just glued) came apart from the rest of the binky which posed a huge chocking hazard. This scared me since I usually leave teethers in my child's crib where I am not constantly supervising. I would not recommend this product. I feel a lot more confident in the teether binky from \\"Soothie\\" that is all one piece. It's unfortunate because it looks like it would be a fantastic product if only it was constructed safer..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for very young teethers who use pacifiers normally","review":"Be warned if you are buying this for an early teething baby. I bought this in advance for my little one, thinking that it would be a couple months until he needed it. Whoops, he started teething just this past week at 3 1/2 months. I got this out and he doesn't know what to make of it. It's too large for his mouth. He is used to a pacifier and tries to suck on the RaZberry. Then he spits it out or it falls out. Although he is able to grasp & hold a rattle and throw it around, he doesn't have the manual dexterity necessary to help hold the RaZberry teether in his mouth for it to work. We try to hold it up for him, but his little tongue pushes it out. Right now what is working are plain old teething rings directly from the freezer. We help him hold on to those and he'll chomp on them for some time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoddy, and possibly dangerous.","review":"I was excited to buy this after reading all the positive reviews, but my baby does not enjoy this teether and I'm not even sure it's safe. The \\"berry\\" part seems to be glued onto the ring part, and even after boiling it it has a peculiar smell. My daughter took one nibble and screwed up her face as if it tasted bad. I threw it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsafe and unhygenic","review":"The teether (made in china) came out of the pack with a bad smell. The material used for construction seems to be unhygenic. Raspberry part is glued to the teether base. My doubts are that it can come off easily. The raspberry part was itself marked with black dots which i first thought are part of the design but when i rubbed them with my thumb... they vanished.Design is very good and practical but construction (raspberry glued, black dots) and material used is worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"This was one of my little boy's favorites. High quality, perfect shape and texture. Your little one will LOVE it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't stay cold","review":"My daughter really likes the cold of the frozen teether rings, but just can't seem to hold on to it long enough because it's too cold for her hands. I thought this would be great. After staying in the freezer overnight, this teether stays cold for about 15 seconds. Plus, the green \\"leaf\\" part (which covers half of her face) seems to be the only part that stays somewhat cold. It's not her cheeks that need soothing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not really working","review":"it's too big, my little one is 7 months and just picks it up and puts it in his mouth for just a sec and that is it, it's just too bulky. waste of our money..."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm in love - and so is my baby!","review":"My daughter is 5 months-old now and chewing on everything. Because of health issues she is a little delayed with her motor functions, and as such has issues getting things into her mouth without help. So, I wanted to get something that she is able to hold on her own so that she can try and learn to do it. Within a week with the Razberry she had no issues getting ANYTHING into her mouth, pretty reliably! I'm not saying that it is the cure for development problems, but having something that she likes enough to try and get it into her mouth all the time helped her learn how! I don't find that it is too big for her mouth (and she is small for her age) because she isn't using it as a pacifier, simply something to chew on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seems cool, but baby isn't that into it yet","review":"Since my tot was constantly chewing on his pacifier instead of sucking it, I thought this would be the perfect solution. Right now (4 1/2 months) he isn't totally into it, but I think when he gets a little more hand eye coordination down he will enjoy it more. For the price I think this is a great buy and worth a try - if the baby doesn't like it, you are only out a few bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great theether","review":"My son had trouble holding other heavier teethers but he just loved this one...

The fact is that with the China having added LEAD and many other toxins to kids toys, I don't trust them to have a safe product and having my baby suck/chew on it for long times is scary.

Then, you realize that this is not a recorded theme song. It's actually the Cannonball Adderley Sextet playing behind the opening credits. Jazz Scene USA was a short-lived TV showcase of jazz. Filmed in black & white, the cameras work in sympathy with the players. Every nuance of the performance is captured down to the vibrations of the bass strings. Having been born in 1969 and having seen too much TV, it is my opinion that television's golden age has come and gone. For me the best shows (Twilight Zone, The Honeymooners, Star Trek, etc.) were made between 1952 and 1969. DVD is the perfect medium to revive these old shows. Now they need to reissue other, more recent music programs from TV like David Sandborn's \\"Night Music\\" (early 1990's) series and PBS' \\"Sessions On West 54th\\". But first, I need to get the rest of the titles in this series.[DW]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love them even though they hurt me!","review":"I love the details on the boots - from the zipper pulls to the toe plates they are very cool! However, they run big in the foot area, so I slide around in them, but then they are tall and tight in the ankle area, which makes them very uncomfortable. Because they are so stiff and tight, they are painful after even just walking to the ladies room once or twice. Unfortunately you can't adjust the fit because they have zippers rather than being lace ups. Even if I loosen the ties and leave the zippers down part way, they still hurt. I'm hoping that they will loosen up in time. Meanwhile, I put up with it because they are hot looking but in the future I will only wear them on rides and to sit.

I just unscrew the top and pour water directly into the bowl portion.

When I received my 3 new handi-drink bottles, I was very disappointed. Only to be even more disappointed once I took one of bottles with me for a hike. Here are the flaws. #1 bottle is smaller (read, holds less water) and the dish is square so it takes up more room in the fanny pack. #2 the slits are way too small to actually get water out of the bottle, I altered it to get a somewhat steady flow (although it took a while to get the stream to come out the center and not shoot out to one side). When it is in the fanny pack while walking, the bouncing of walking sloshes the water out of the container and down my butt and leg. #3 There isn't much water left for the dog to drink #4 the plastic is very cheap #5 need I say more.I will go back to the GULPY now.Sincerely, sad pooch :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Water dispenser for dogs/cats/animals","review":"The novelty of this item is awesome and convenient, but after a few uses the nipple leaks.

Also, there is really no way for the water to get back into the bottle if the dog doesn't drink it all. This isn't a problem if you're outside but I am using it with my service dog and there isn't always a place to pour out leftover water. And then if you do manage to get rid of the water, or your dog drinks it all, you have to find a way to dry the thing off otherwise when you close it there's going to be water/spit all over the bottle.

There is very very little,if anything at all, along the lines of any sort of technical instruction nor any sort of introduction to baseball of any kind. I just don't understand how something like this can be passed off as professional.With that being said, my two year old son cannot stop watching this. He wants to watch it over and over, which now worries me.All in all, take a pass on this. Instead, take your kids outside and play the real thing. Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for all kids","review":"My wife and I are active and really try to get our little ones (boy and girl, 3 and 4) active as well. The kids like this video a lot...we were really happy that this video works for Ashley, our daughter, as well as our son. The characters are enjoyable, pleasant and not overly commercial. Ashley is now getting the neighbors kids together for wiffle ball! Kyle likes this video, too....but likes the soccer version better."},{"rating":"2","title":"great video","review":"My grandchildren just love this video. It is very entertaining for the whole family.

It's amazing! very creative, and it's fun to listen to.You must have it!Dihelson Mendona"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brecker Brothers Vs Hip-Hop. NOOOOOOOOO","review":"Take away the hip-hop, the samples (it's LAZY music, man) and Randy's bad singing (why does he do it - I hope it's meant as a bit of fun, but I fear otherwise; listen to some of his solo albums) this is a full-on high-octane, high-range, rubber-burning horn set that defined their sound over a decade earlier. It's tinged with the nineties' sound of world-music synth rhythms, which is not a criticism (I particularly like 'Wakaria' with it's quirky rhythms and tribal chant tip). I'm not a lover of Hip-hop, and would take sampled music and strap it to a large explosive device if only someone would ask; however, this is definately the Return of the Brecker Brothers. Welcome back boys, it's been a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"At last a reasonable encyclopedia in English!","review":"A fantastic accomplishment! As a longtime Dante enthusiast, I have been waiting for something in English (my Italian not being up to snuff yet) that combines breadth with depth.As my own metric, I like to pick a topic that is not altogether esoteric and that is the subject of at least several competing theories. In studying Dante, that topic for me is numerology. I was especially pleased to read the article on numerology because the Dante Encyclopedia fairly explained the competing theories on the use of numerology by Dante. Never have I seen one source that provides the in-depth overview that this book does. For the serious student of the classics, this is a must-have! Gracie! And bravo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I received these earrings in the mail today and am having to return them already.

Very enjoyable history lesson.Scotia Ellen"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Historical Account","review":"For those who enjoyed the documentary that aired in July 2003 on PBS and couldn't find the DVD to buy, this is it! This is the entire program with David Starkey as the narrator. A very good account with live actors intermixed with historical locations and portraits. My only criticism is that the costumes (particularly the headpieces) tend to be a lot more lavish than what they would have been and equal time should have been spent on the last four wives. The time is allocated more on the number of years they played a role in Henry's life, so the first DVD is comprised of Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn, the second with Jane/Anne/Katherine/Catherine. All in all, Henry VIII fans will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"This was a gift for my wife who loves Tudor history. But it turned out to be a bad choice. Not only was this an amateur production, but the picture seemed stretched vertically.

David Starkey is an excellent narrator and historian and obviously has an affinity for the period. The only criticism that I have is that maybe the DVD skips or makes light of some issues, however, the book puts that right and actually makes the DVD more enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"STAGECOACH","review":"Even though John Wayne's version of this movie is more famous, this is a great western adventure.

So, I went to the mall that very day and bought \\"Sometimes\\" and I've been listening to the ENTIRE album almost non-stop for the past few days. The thing that I think is unique about this album is that I find myself listening to it from begining to end unlike other albums where only 3 or 4 songs are exceptional and are listened to the most, every track on this album is perfect. The album's vibe is maintained from track one to ten. I highly recommend that you at least download some of the songs because this is truly one of the best albums I've listened to in a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Simulation","review":"This is not a game. It's a simulation of the Air War over Vietnam. The best part of this simulation is the Scenario Editor. It requires time, effort and a good understanding of the actual tactics used in the Vietnam Air War to fully appreciate this simulation. The interface requires patience, practice and time to get good results from it. For people looking for quick entertainment without much effort and concentration, this is not recommended. For people looking to get an idea of what the Air War in Vietnam was like, it is highly recommended. It's too bad that the Air War Staff's that conducted opertaions during the War didn't have access to this simulation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classy Rider Motorcycle Jackets","review":"This jacket has features specific to motorcycle comfort and safety.

Our son was 16 months when he got it, and never even got around to learning how to turn the key on the music box, so all we can think is that he dropped it on the floor once or twice (as all toddlers will do), and now when you turn the key and let go, the thing spins really fast. Now we are stuck with a cute-looking piece of garbage, since it's not really safe anymore for our son. Gund needs to seriously examine their quality control. I wish we had done a tiny bit of research online first, since it appears from reviews we've since read that we are not the first people to have issues with this poorly-made toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"works fine","review":"Just learning this buffing stuff.

Weckl shows off his awsome chops in his solos, and weavs intricate beats that fit perfectly with the groove. I got bored of the backup music and wanted to hear more weckl almost imediatly. I would rather have less synth also, but that's just me. I wouldn't pass this one up."},{"rating":"1","title":"My least favorite of Dave Weckl's solo work","review":"I agree with \\"Ian Case\\", this is not Weckl's best work at all. I was really pretty disappointed with this album as a whole. The tunes have no \\"oomph\\", no drive or passion to them. There's a lot of very cheesey synth work throughout the album. Yes, the drumming is very technical and flawless...but lacks heart. This is one to add if you're simply looking to complete a collection...but not one that will get worn out from being played too much!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Revisionist nonsense","review":"The book is nonsense. If it was truly accepted as a doctoral dissertation, the University on Nantes has lowered its standing as an academy valuing truth. Interested readers are directed to Saul Friedlander's biography: Kurt Gerstein: The Ambiguity of Good (apparently OUP and not available from Amazon). Gerstein's account has been affirmed by, among others, some of the people who were there and were later tried (see Gitta Sereny's Into That Darkness for interviews with Franz Stangl and others). Finally, Yitzhak Arad's Belzec, Sobibor, Treblinka: The Operation Reinhard Death Camps gives a definitive look at these institutions."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING!

However, the profundity and beauty of \\"Standing On the Moon,\\" and \\"Built to Last\\" make this album worth while; it would have made a great EP. The two aforementioned songs are two of my favorites. If you choose not to buy this album then do yourself a favor and get these few brilliant tracks somewhere. Cheers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For The Casual Fan","review":"BUILT TO LAST is the Grateful Dead's last album and they finish their recording career with a pretty boring album. The song, \\"Foolish Heart,\\" got most of the radio attention and is the most often included song in their concert repetoire. However, that song alone is not worth the price of the album. There are plenty of other great Grateful Dead albums, AMERICAN BEAUTY, WORKINGMAN'S DEAD, MARS HOTEL, and IN THE DARK plus a number of fine live albums are much better choices.This album is for completists and Deadheads only and for them, it will take up shelf space more than ever becoming a staple in the CD player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware of quality control problems with Rhino","review":"I just received this Grateful Dead \\"Built To Last\\" Digipac CD from Rhino and was very surprised at what I got. Never in all the years I have been a CD buyer have I ever experienced such a blatant quality control issue as this. The CD packaging was the usual high quality packaging you would expect from Rhino. Even the disc itself is professionally screened printed with the Built To Last title.

Gardner focuses too much on categorizing the various forms of harassment out there, and it just becomes a long-winded piece about that. It forgets all the other nuances of public harassment, and there is no focus on the dispositions that cause men to infringe on womens' rights to be left alone. It has a very static narrative that leaves one's eyes to glaze over after a few minutes. Moreover, most of the testimonies is set in Indianapolis, which is honestly not the best place to study harassment. It is a commuter city, and women who live here do not experience the same kind of intense harassment, since they can just drive back and forth--unlike cities like New York or Washington D.C. where the urban experience does not allow you to actually escape harassment.This book was just not enjoyable or enlightening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun!","review":"I purchased this for my 2 and 3 year old daughters. They love it and have put it together hundreds of times. Although it is no longer challenging for either of my children now ages 2 and 4 I would buy another like it if it had more pieces to keep them entertained a bit longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as I had hoped","review":"I came to this book with high hopes, but was disappointed. It has some very good writing and some very gripping sequences. But some of the sentences are stiff and obscure. And overall, the book did not flow. And the contrast between the ordinary world of the children and the fantastic world they became enmeshed in was too stark and jarring. The various aspects of the fantastic world are thrown pell mell at the reader with little development or integration. The sequence where the children get lost in the tunnels deep in the mountain is just so shatteringly hopeless as it starts out, I never really recovered. The author is just so ridiculously matter of fact about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST BOOK EVER","review":"THIS IS THE WORST BOOK EVER WRITTEN I ADVISE READERS TO NEVER READ THIS BOOK I WOULD RATHER DIE THAN READ IT AGAIN"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book.","review":"I read the swedish translation \\"Den magiska stenen\\" of this book as a child and it was my favorite book for a very long time. It has the qualities and uncertainties of an intriguing, exiting and nuanced myth and still it is placed in a partially modern setting. It includes mythic characters - or maybe the opposite - it includes modern children in a mythic setting without letting go of a good sense of balance. I'll reccomend it to everyone, especially those who feel that Tolkien is slightly over the hill with heroes and legends and that CS Lewis got stuck between the coats and never really got out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weirdstone","review":"In simple, descriptive prose it's quite a scary book for young children, even without the paraphernalia of Harry Potter they seem to devour unscathed.

For the final boss of the game, they don't even give you a strategy. I didn't buy the guide for them to tell me to find out myself how to cure a problem. The worst of all is that it is very confusing. I had many times where I had no idea what they meant.

It's slow, and the info you're trying to get is pretty well buried. You'd do better printing out one of the many online strategies put out from the private sector on the net. I seriously hope Bradygames catches a clue (and losses some revenue) from this worthless nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Huge Disappointment...","review":"...and a regretted purchase. Every time I have tried to reference something in this guide, it just points me to a website (which gives poor detail anyway) where after navigating for about 3-4 minutes, I can find a clue about what I want to know, nothing more. It lacks much info on sidequests, and very little about abilities. It, however, looks very well made, which seems an attempt to trick the reader into thinking it is a quality guide. What it boils down to is this: your money for a book that you could write yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Close, but.. oh wait! There's a cigar Online?!","review":"In comparison, to Brady Game's Strategy Guide for Final Fantasy VIII, this one is sorely lacking. The information is presented in a disorganized fashion, making it unclear who can learn certain skills from items, as well as what skills they actually can learn. But, the main problem I have with this guide is it's \\"PlayOnLine Enchancement.\\" To get most of the really good hints and charts you have to go online, using codes found in the book. Which I think kind of makes the book futile. The point of getting the Strategy Guide is so you have a quick reference to items, skills, and events in the game; not so you have codes to go online to find them. But, the information is there....if you don't mind looking for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A guide that refers you to another guide","review":"This is the lowest quality strategy guide of Final Fantasy ever.The complete guide is released on the playonline website. This strategy guide only serves as a reference to the guide online.The strategy guide gives a basic overview of what to do to progress the game. It includes a few chest locations, minigame, hidden items, secrets, but then tells you to look it up online to find out how to get it. Sometimes the guide just tells you at this point in the game there is a secret and you need to go online to find out what.I would see no reason of buying this guide unless you are trying to collect Final Fantasy merchandise. Even as a collector's item, this is one bad official strategy guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I wanted the help online, I wouldn't have bought the guide","review":"Im sure pretty much everyone on here has already made the exact same point so i'll keep it brief. This \\"strategy guide\\" is a travesty, I usually buy the guides to all FF games, to help unlock secrets, hidden areas, items and sub-plots, I never use the walkthrough. The guides for FF7 & 8 were superb so I had no reason to think this would be otherwise, how wrong I was.The walkthrough is probably great, however I dont use it, everything I bought the guide for though is useless, it gives me a password and tells me to go to play online. Now back in 2001 when this came out, I wasn't even online, and even if I was to pay 12.99 for this is a joke.Thankfully the FF10 guide was great again, so i'm presuming the feedback they got from this experiment was not good, avoid this guide like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost completely useless","review":"Except for the bestiary, this guide is completely useless... All I can find here, I can find more complete and better in gamefaqs.com. No maps, no item location, nothing!Playonline.com? It doesn't have the link to FF IX anymore now that FF XI has come out. I am extremely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Useless in 2010","review":"This strategy guide is completely useless in 2010.I'm not sure what they were thinking by forcing their customers to go to a website in order to learn about Final Fantasy IX - but they website you are directed to doesn't even work anymore! This book is really completely worthless, and it's a major bummer because the game itself is excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"This strategy guide is the weakest guide I've ever invested money in. It doesn't tell you how to do much of anything, and as a matter of fact says to just go on the internet to look for what you're looking for. A thinly disguised way to pad thier emberships to the site they recommend you going to. I'll give you the biggest hint about this strategy guide, a hint they keep telling you about through out: Just go on the internet for your walkthrough."},{"rating":"1","title":"playonline site is horrible","review":"Well this is a fine mess, you pay for the book and then it refers you to an online address that you must register for and doesn't work. I suggest you save you money and use the great sites like gamefacs.com and rpgamers.com."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is great...","review":"...for people who spend half there lives online trying to figure out the game they just bought instead of playing it and enjoying it. I bought this guide because I couldn't even get on the website. Imagine my dismay when every page has a link to the site so you can find information that should have been in the book in the first place. If Bradygames is going to continue with this \\"new\\" style of strategy guides in the future, then they've lost me as a customer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for propping up chairs.","review":"I want to give this guide a one star review but it is just so perfect for correcting off balance chairs and tables that I can't possibly do that."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a total waste of money","review":"This is the absolute worst strategy guide I have ever seen. The strategy guide for FF VII was great, the one for FF VIII was not as good, but still extremely helpful. This is without a shadow of a doubt a TOTAL RIPOFF. I am only partially through the first disc, and so far, this book has given me no information I could not figure out myself. It doesn't even give a full list of the character abilities, just a handful of the abilities for each character and a code to get the \\"full list\\" from the website. In the event that you do go to the website (which means you can't just grab the book and check it quickly while you're playing the game) and put in this keyword, the information is presented in a strip that is maybe one and a half inches high and the print is extremely small. I honestly think if you used this site much you would go blind. Save your money for something better, like paying someone to hit you in the head with a hammer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was looking for","review":"If you are looking to pass the game this book is probably for you. But if you have played RPG games before, like to explore, and want to get the guide for the extras that is impossible to find without reading it from somewhere then this aren't it. The strategy goes on telling you what to do but when it comes to getting secret it has a side note telling you to go look online at the squaresoft page...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed the moment I have bought this guide...","review":"Nice try, BradyGames, but this guide wasn't worth a cent. After a few weeks of playing Squaresoft's Final Fantasy IX, I was stumped with the Chocograph's mini-game. Frustrated, I wanted to buy a strategy guide that would help me solve the problem. Unfortunately, I was shocked to see the guide's lackness of quality; the information on chocographs was only a few sentences! As I skimmed through the guide, all it said was \\"Visit play online for details!\\". I was disgusted by this [stuff]. Did I just pay $$$ for a guide full of advertisements telling me to visit this website? What if I don't have a computer? What if I'm too lazy to turn on my computer? What if my internet connection runs at 14.4K speed and am dying for a webpage to load? Well that's what the strategy guide is for. Bad guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book just doesn't tell you anything!","review":"A strategy guide should have information. This one does not. Instead, it has many URLs that you are expected to type into your web browser and then read the information that you wanted on your computer screen. This guide completely fails you help you find the game's secrets and defeat the major enemies. DO NOT BUY THIS GUIDE BECAUSE IT WILL NOT HELP YOU!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"Purchased guide after defeating game to go back and pick up missed items.

There is a reason everyone rated this 1 star, because its NOT helpful, the author ommited all important information from the guide, and instead makes you go online and search for it. I mean really come on, we buy guides so we can get help, not be sent on a wild goose chase. IN all honesty im not going to use the guide for the rest of the game, it totally detracts from the fun of playing an RPG, how this became the official RPG guide for ff9 is a mystery, i guess square can make some mistakes..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst strategy guide in History!!!","review":"I bought this guide more for the reason of owning everything that has to do with the Final Fantasy series. Sure I looked through it like I do all of the guides I have, and this new PLAYONLINE feature is a definite turnoff. Instead of being helpful, it is detrimental to completing every quest in the game. why buy the guide at alll, might as well wait until the versus guide comes out or just print it all on-line. Believe me when I say, this was a huge disappointment and I hope this new author of the strategy guides gets fired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad guide for a really good game.","review":"I bought this in hopes it would be like the Brady Games guide to FF8. Well its not. Like everone else said, its just a big plug for their website. I wish all guides could be like the versus books guide to FF7. Thats the best guide I have ever seen. All other guides should be molded after that one. Save yourself money and time by going to IGN's or Playonlines guide cause thats what your going to be doing anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Strategy Guide","review":"This book would be a waste of your money to purchase. Throughout the book, there are a few small tidbits of information and following everything it says, \\"If you want more information, go to our website and enter code ...\\" In essence, the strategy guide is a link to get people to go to their website playonline.com. This book was a big disappointment to Brady strategy guides."},{"rating":"2","title":"Final fantasy nine strategy guide","review":"Its a decent guide but they could have done a little better... and the hints to go online to get more info are a little distracting and make for a problem if you cannot go online.... but push come to shove its an alright guide...."},{"rating":"2","title":"it helped","review":"I bought this book because I needed help with the game.

So, even if the PlayOnline section for FFIX was still active (which it is not, so the references are dead too), this would still be a pretty pointless book.Refresh my memory: If all this info (and much, much more) was available for free at the official website, what's the point of having the guide in the first place?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a bad guide!!!","review":"When i first bought this i thought it would tell you where everything is but all it says is go to playonline. back then i didnt have internet so it was useless!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste","review":"After playing FF8 with the excellent strategy guide for it, I expected the same to happen with FF9. However, this guide does very little to help you. As a matter of fact I don't even see why this guide was made.To start off, the walkthrough section is just horrible. It only touches on the basic objectives of each area and then tells you to go to playonline.com for the in-depth strategy guide. Didn't these idiots know that the reason most people buy these guides is so that they don't have to run to their computers for a strategy guide? Trust me, you'd be better off without any guide at all than this one. The bestiary is incomplete and the guide for accessories/abilities is lackluster. If you've used any of the other guides then you would know why I say this one sucks.Overall I don't recommend this guide AT ALL. There should be no reason at all for you to buy this guide. You would be better off to just go to playonline.com and save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A rip-off","review":"What is in the book is good quality stuff; what is NOT in the book makes it not worth the money to buy it. You buy a strategy guide for the STRATEGY (and maps, weapons lists, etc), not as a come-on to a website. Throughout the book you are prodded, time after time, to get on the internet, go to playonline.com, type in a \\"keyword\\", and retrieve information that should've been in the book in the first place. As if that wasn't bad enough, playonline.com only has Final Fantasy XI now. If they've archived FFIX and FFX I couldn't find them. So, basically, I unknowingly bought half a book. Very disappointing..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"By far this is the worst guide Ive seen for any video game. It calims to have a detailed walkthrough unfortunately, the entire guide is not detailed. It skips over everything and gives you a username to use at playonline.com when it should go into greater detail. Go to gamefaqs.com and print out a text guide you will be doing yourself a much bigger favor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Websites are better","review":"This book is annoying in that all of the information of the game isn't in it, they make you go online, login, then you hafta type in a code, and THEN they tell you what to do in the game with a *few* pictures. I hate having to leave the room when playing a game to go online, which is why i would purchase a strat guide so I wouldn't have to go look on webpages!! Frustrating!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel bad for the trees used to make this guide","review":"Ok, this book blew. I mean, after the guides for Final Fantasy 7 and 8, you would think that this would be good also. But its not. Dont be fooled. It is a very short guide that is constantly refering you to Playonline to get hints, which is a major waste of time. The game rocked, and I always thought that the Brady Games books rocked to, until this one. If you get this guide, you will regret it. Trust me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did They REALLY Think They Could Get Away With This???","review":"This is going to be an alarmingly short review, because there is only one thing you need to know that will without doubt steer you away.About 75-80% of this book are *passwords* for their website, where you can type a code and get hints from there. What a complete waste.. Not to mention there is absolutely NO STRATEGY WHATSOEVER. It's a shame, since not all of Bradygames guides are that bad (Final Fantasy X, Kingdom Hearts, etc) But this really takes the cake as the worst guide i've ever seen. Reading the first few paragraphs of a FAQ/Walkthrough written by a fan at Gamefaqs.com will give you more information than this entire 'Guide'.It gets one star because.. well.. i guess the artwork is nice.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst strategy guide ever.","review":"This guide tells you absolutely nothing you couldn't figure out on your own.

THIS BOOK IS NOW NON-FUNCTIONAL. DO NOT BUY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Different Author","review":"The reason why this guide is so bad is that it was written by a different guy (Dan Birlew)than in the previous guides by David Cassidy. My theory is that this new guy is the MOD for PlayOnline.com. There is absolutely NOTHING in this guide that you could not find on the website. NOTHING. Do not buy this guide, and if you have one, I recommend that you return it immediately so that BradyGames will get a clue and never write a sorry excuse for a guide like this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much to add...","review":"I just want to do my part to force the numbers down. I suspect Brady had little to do with the decision to omit all of the useful information from the guide (and that's no exaggeration; it provides only information that a novice player might be able to herself discern on the first time through the game), and that Square demanded this half-guide. No matter. Brady may have to learn the hard way that when you lie down with a dog, you'll get fleas.I suppose I wouldn't be so insulted by this guide if the things it omitted required extensive explanation that there wasn't room for. But it makes no attempt to cover its tracks -- most of the time it leaves out things that could be covered in a sentence, like the location of a special item. The guide needn't have been a page longer to be substantially improved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a guide to FF9, but a guide to PlayOnline","review":"This book is supposed to be a strategy guide for Final Fantasy IX. I bought it expecting to be told where all the hidden secrets are and a detailed walkthrough of the game. Instead, I get paragraphs telling me, \\"There's a secret hidden item in this town that very valuable to have. For more information, go to PlayOnline.\\" NO! I DIDN'T PAY $12.00 TO BE TOLD TO FIND OUT ONLINE!! I say we boycott this book and show whoever is responsible that we don't appreciate being tricked. This book should at least tell its customers that if they don't have internet access or don't feel like signing-on every 2 minutes to find out the information you paid to have in print, then this book is USELESS!! A definite bomb!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dan Birlew is a sloppy FAQ writer","review":"The problem with Dan Birlew is that he is far too used to getting away with sloppy work. He runs a Resident Evil webpage and used to write FAQs for free. Those FAQs on Resident Evil 1 and 2 are some of the worst ever. He leaves out big chunks of info that the obsessive gamer (like me) needs! So perhaps the guide for Final Fantasy IX is more up his alley. At every junction that you need information, all Lazy Dan had to do was insert the url for Square Online which is where the answers are. The $... you stand to spend on this guide would be better spent burning to keep you warm."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened???","review":"I don't know what they were thinkin when they decided to make a guide like this, I could've got a free guide that was 10X more detailed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks...","review":"Its the uncomplete guide I ever seen!!!

That means all of the items, characters, secrets, and weapons, ect. Unfortunately, that is not what this strategy guide offers. It introduces you to the basics and that's about it. Other than that, it does little more than point you in the right direction. There are tons of references to the website Play Online, which does have everything about FF9 on it...but what's the point in buying a strategy guide when all of the information is already available online? Unless you just want some extra reading material, just wait for an unofficial strategy guide to come out, or go to Play Online if you have internet access."},{"rating":"1","title":"rape of the strategy guide","review":"The only reason why i didn't give this guide 1 star was because it had a few helpful hints..but the main point of such a low score was because linking the guide to playonline was a stupid move!! That's not much of a strategy, and half the time playonline was down or \\"performing an illegal operation\\". They really degraded the guide with linking it to playonline. they had no strategies for defeating bosses, winning mini-games, locations of weapons, cards, or stellazios. This is worth so much less then they want for it.

I only use the guide when I'm having trouble. This guide did not help me with either. Unless your willing to go to PlayOnline every five seconds, this guide is ultimately useless. It tells you nothing you don't already know, considering the only thing it ever does is tell you where to go next. And you already know that if you read anything the people in the game say. Everything else in the game is marked under a header 'Go to PlayOnline to learn about this secret'. Its not in the book at all. So if you want to save money, just go to PlayOnline. This strategy guide... is worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"This is the worst guide I have ever come across. It may help you get through the game, but when you get to things you really need information or help on, it tells you to go to PlayOnline.com. You basically need to be sitting next your computer when you play this game so you can stop every five seconds and go online. It is one of the stupidest things I have seen.

I live in Taiwan so I bought this book with out seeing first, if I had been able to see it, I would never have bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy only if you don't have a computer!","review":"The title should be a moot point, because you obviously have a computer if you are reading this. So, don't buy this! Why? The game is certainly hard and worthy of a few pointers here and there. But (and this is significant), this is the single most frustrating guide I've used. Here's a good example, let's say you want to get to the boss of Disc 1. The guide will do a good job of how to get to the boss, but then do you know what happens? It will say \\"for strategy to defeat this boss, go to PlayOnline!\\". This website is certainly comprehensive, and even more so than the $10 guide itself. The website is free and printable, so just spend 30 minutes printing out the walkthrough, and you will much better off than wasting your money on this guide. However, both have a major problem in that they contain major plot spoilers, so be warned. Awesome game, terrible guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"All this book represents is a referral to an online site","review":"Im overly dissapointed with this title. Sure all the other Brady Guides for previous Final Fantasy titles were flawed, but you could live with them. At least they had information in the book and not a constant referral to playonline.com. The entire format is presented like this for everything. Want more information ... refer to playonline.com. Want any information about anything? Refer to playonline.com. If im stuck I like to have the book in front of me and be able to read and follow along with my playing. I also like to have information about skills etc so I can plan an effective strategy for character advancement. Which brings us to another problem, the website itself is very hard to get on to. I managed to create a user id, but since then it just times out whenever i try to access the north american site. You know what? How about you save yourself some money and just refer to online faq's that you can print out."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT!?","review":"Ok when I buy a guide I expect it to give me all the info I need not tell me to go online to find it. Then for no other reason then that I played the game later then other people, if I go to the site I dont get any info, I just get stuff for final fantasy xi, not ix. This guide is very incompleate, and beacuse of that can't help anyone if you use the guide for every step you take then you will become very frustated, if you only want if for help with mini games and finding special items well then dont even pick it up because thats the stuff thats missing. Anyone wanting to play this game would be much better served by an online guide which is what I ended up useing to find what I didnt find in the official guide"},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought I was buying a strategy guide, not a hyperlink.","review":"I have pretty much the same gripes as everyone else. Although the Internet is faster, more widespread, and more reliable than when this guide was first released, I still don't approve of essentially half of the guide being on PlayOnline. It's a nuisance to have to stop in the course of a game, and it takes the information away from your fingertips. Aren't you entitled to have the full guide in front of you at all times, seeing as you paid for it? I think so.The bestiary is also very lacking, so much that I don't even refer to it. The descriptions of boss battles seem thrown together at the last minute, and they don't really offer much insight. There is a wealth of information about the game in here, so the guide isn't worthless, but I still would have liked a much better one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I read the reviews first....","review":"I know this game has been out for a while, but anyone who's playing it now and looking for a guide LOOK SOMEWHERE ELSE. I wasted money buying and returning this stupid thing because all it did was tell me to go to Playonline.com every other page. If I wanted to go online for information, I could do it for free! The whole point of having a strategy guide is having all the info right in front of you, and this does not do that job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save a tree!!","review":"I felt bad to see that this book involved cutting down a tree to process it. What a waste of a good tree, they could have used it for a note book rather than this \\"ONLINE\\" non-Strategy guild"},{"rating":"1","title":"Honestly.....","review":"The guides to the past final fantasy's were a great help and provided much useful information. However, with this guide and the 'playonline' addition, the user gets almost NO information without having to go \\"online\\" to get more. Simply [bad] to be quite honest. Boss battle strategies are kept short and offer more \\"playonline\\" help to the user if he finds that the HP count of the boss is simply not enough to work with. This guide flat out [horrible]"},{"rating":"1","title":"dan birlew must be stopped","review":"presumably it's unfair to blame dan birlew for this travesty. i'm sure he wanted to write a really, really great guide filled with useful information, and square and brady instead forced him to take out all the bits that you actually look for in a guide -- you know, like INFORMATION -- and instead insert a lot of plugs for their website... But that's really neither here nor there. Some [not nice] person, or collection of people, is responsible for this travesty, and all you and I can do is see that they don't profit from it.

Ugh!","review":"This is the worst guide I have ever seen. Seeing as half of it is online. To access the most important stuff you must have internet access and you must sign up at PlayOnline.com. Now it may very well be that they are trying to attract fans to PlayOnline.com but this is ridiculous.If you are stuck in a part of the game, then this guide is useful, but to get the most out of a game, I would recommend finding a fan written online guide instead of using this.

I've never seen a guide so full of useless information. They should just have the website listed in the instruction manual for all the good the guide does you. No hints, very few tips on bosses. I personally don't want to have to pause my game every few minutes and go online just to figure out what I need to do. It should be in the guide. Who cares if it's longer? The guide for FF 7 and FF 8 were far better because they told you everything you needed to know. This one should to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad even for a Bradygames guide","review":"And those are usually known for making Gampro articles look good by comparison. This, however, hits new lows. If I'd wanted to pay 13 dollars for an advertisement for a slow (even on my cable modem) website that still doesn't cover all the information on the game, I would be happy with this. As it is, I'm checking faqs posted on Gamefaqs.com to find secrets on my second trip through the game. The art isn't even that good in most of the book, they use the same renders of the characters on literally almost every page. A few pages use some nice preliminary art, but nothing you can't find in the art book. Save your money and go to Gamefaqs, and buy the \\"Art of Final Fantasy IX\\" book if you want the art. Avoid this insulting pile of tripe like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey I didn't know","review":"I was ashamed when i started using this guide. Who ever thought of the playonline thing is crazy. Thiis strategy guide is barley detailed. It just relies on going on the internet to find something!!! Here an example:the guide says search the area to find a very impotant item, to find and figure out what the item does go to playonline.com. I mean who wants to go on the internet when there sittin down playin there game. And the secrets sections are terrible. example: go to the town on disc three to get a new weapon this is very complicated so go to playonline.com. This strategy guide is terrible. The least i can say is you can get it just to move forward in the game but for anything else use it as toleit paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a ripoff...","review":"This is a horrible book!

But the way this thing is set up, I've only been given half the info and less. Most of the info is extremely vague and it is needed to go online to get ANY help. Plus, the website is incomplete and it goes down a lot. So I'm waiting for a COMPLETE unofficial strategy guide..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected much more...","review":"I would like to say first and foremost that a great effort was put out to make this guide, I am sure, but it was just not up to par. I felt like I paid for two things- one, a very brief and vague strategy guide, and two, a set of passcodes to a website. What really made me upset was that I found you didn't really even need the guide for the website- all you need to do is register, sign in, and self navigate, even without the passcodes. I really felt betrayed by Brady- my last two guides, Final Fantasy VII and Vagrant Story, were wonderfully detailed- covering every corner of the game-and then some- without spoilers. Although the Final Fantasy IX guide has no spoilers, I still was very dissatisfied with this book. Bottom line- you can use different websites and get better information than this guide or the playonline.com site combined. If this trend of strategy guides continues, perhaps I'll buy Prima next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um.","review":"If you're one of the millions of final fantasy fans, you'll probably get stuck. I know I have. This book will help, but if you have the internet, it's not worth thirteen bucks.With Squaresoft's new playonline.com, you can find every single tidbit of help online. And it's free. Sure, the website says \\"use passwords from the books to get the most out of your game\\", yada yada yada. If you dig, you can find the passwords right there on the site. THe only thing the book has that the website doesn't is the trading cards.Save yourself time and money. Don't buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of money and paper","review":"This guide is horrible. All of BradyGames other strategy guides are superb, but this one falls horribly short. If I could have I would have given it a zero. The PlayOnline.com website contains all the information in the guide and then some. Save yourself the $15 and just print out the website. But even the website is not of a complete help. They only have one map, the world map, that's it. It is absolutely no help with the chocobo part of the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extended advertising for PlayOnline.com","review":"I made the mistake of buying two copies of this book for friends who I'd also bought the game for. Each and every interesting tip and sidequest is not found in the book, but on Square's PlayOnline.com website. Scant bits of information are given with a little \\"Want more information on how to do this? Visit PlayOnline.com!\\" blurb to intice you on to the site. In fact, some pages include more of the \\"PlayOnline\\" ads than actual information.If this is the future of videogame strategy guides, online walkthroughs will definitely be more attractive. They might lack the glossy pages and screenshots of the books, but they're not an extended ad for an online service either.Do NOT make the same mistake I did. Avoid this book at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not Buy: no longer \\"Up To Date\\"","review":"Most of the details in the book require you to go online to a website that is out of service. Most of what is included in the book itself is available by being observant in the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this guide, waste fo money","review":"This guide for Final Fantasy 9 is a terrible guide, the guide is \\"enhanced\\" by a website that no longer exists. Play Online was turned into the Final Fantasy 11 website at some point and as far as I have found theres no new website to go along with the book :/ This means half the book is essentially missing because you NEED the website to access anything thats not on the main storyline.The book itself only gives a small box of information on each boss and will taunt you with small tidbits of information about side quests before it gives you a code and tells you to go to the website for more information. There are no maps in the book and only a dew pages devoted to side quests (a small box per quest with the Play Online code).In short: this books a waste of money as far as a guide goes, you'll be spending more time online looking at guides than you will using the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy","review":"Unless you have some need to have all of the physical guides for you FF games Do Not Buy this book. Too much of the information is stored on a website that doesn't exist anymore. It was still a bad idea when the website was actually online but now it's just a joke.This guide was one of the worst parts of the game's roll-out. They wanted people online for the forth coming XI Online but all the did was piss people off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"The American version of this guide is worthless.

No luck there. You go through the guide hoping to find the secrets and hidden items to make your game 100% complete. It then tells you to sign-up and give your personal information to a site to get that info. The membership is free ,but I thought the purpose of the guide books were so you didn't have to run to the computer every 5 minutes for help. This guide is a total waste of money. Only get this guide if you are payed to do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this","review":"I was very disappointed by the FF IX Strategy Guide. Brady Games and SquareSoft seem to have written this book more to push the PlayOnline game website rather than helping players with the game.Everytime I'd try to find information about something the strategy guide would tell me to log onto Play Online and enter a keyword in order to learn more.When I buy a strategy guide, I expect to find the answers there, not be told to go access a website. This guide was practically useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"They need to re-release this guide","review":"With a version that doesn't refer you to the web page 1000 times. Not all of us have internet access where the TV is. I think they lameness of this guide ruined the game for me. Or maybe it was because the target audience of the game was non-adults. Oh well the Final Fantasy series is over once it goes online anyway. Some of us have connections that are too poor to play online games. Biggest mistake they ever made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"What is the point of getting a guide if you have to keep referring to a website for the information you need?

Every secret, every code, and every trick is not in this book. As a matter of fact everyone of them is intentionally left out. See the trick is when everything is online at www.playonline.com So, while playing the game if you want to know something, the book actaully says in it \\"To find out how to... goto www.playonline and use **** keyword.\\"Honestly, all the actually codes, tricks, and hints, are online. The only thing this guide has is the keywords you need to find them. You get the keyword out of the book, and type it into a special spot on the playonline website.Now unless you have an constant internet connection and can have constant access to a pc while playing, this book is worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mother of God, why?","review":"I have to say that this is one of the most asinine ideas for a book ever. Not all of the information is in the book. Instead, every few pages you will need to know something, and the page will ask you to go online for more information. I don't see how this could serve any practical purpose other than to save the publisher money. All of the other Final Fantasy games were roughly as long as Final Fantasy IX, and the guides for these managed to cover nearly every facet of those games. If you've already wasted your money on this guide, take a couple of hours and download all the necessary info on the internet at once. It will save you a lot of heartache later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money-Disappointment","review":"I've bought the FF7, FF8, and this. This guide is a rip off. The other guides gave you everything for the same price. This guide refers to the internet. What if you don't have an internet connection? Then, this book is nothing more than pretty pictures and a manual. I'm very disappointed. I can't believe I paid money for this. Try reading a book that asks you to go online for the rest of the story-rip off! I used to buy the official strategy guides before reading them, now I have to review them before I buy.

This had to be the most frustrating, because at times, it wouldn't even help out much.The idea of using PlayOnline with a video game is absolutely the worst idea you could ever have. What if some of the PSX players didn't own a computer? True, most folks to nowadays, but...the enhancement?! The idea of a guidebook was to help you out through the game and find some other puzzles along the way...I honestly think that if you need help with Final Fantasy IX, save your money. Just look up an online walkthrough instead..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is Squaresoft in league with ISP's?","review":"This strategy is very helpful.......as long as you have a computer right beside you when you are playing the game. Almost every page has a \\"code\\" for Squares website Playonline so that if you want to more than the paperback provides you must get online and find it. This wouldn't even be so bad but when you enter the code the whole guide shows up rather than just the tip you are looking for. If you are like me and don't wnat to have to get up every ten minutes of gameplay and have to get online you would attempt to print this information so that you have it in the books when you are playing btu the layout of the site even makes this difficult because of the mass of info that appears when you enter the code.

I can get a rough outline for free online, and this is exactly what the FF9 book is.What makes me most angry is the blantent coverup of the book's incompetance (sp) by telling me to get the 'real' info [online]. This is just a cheap ploy to keep the book thin, and save the publisher money, by leaving out more than 50% of the information, and posting it on a semi-complete website somewhere.I regret buying this, and will probably buy another, more complete guide for the game if one becomes available before i figure everything out on my own."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the purpose?","review":"I bought this guide thinking it would be as helpful as all the other guides I'd bought from Brady Games in the past.

The text in the book is basically just filler and pictures, all the real stuff is online. I suggest you just register the site and print out the pages instead of buying the book. It's got the same layout as the book, plus all the important information. Overly dissappointing. I don't like going online for game info anyway, I hate printing all this stuff out.

The Bestiary is all of 7 pages long. The Secrets and Side-Quests section (usually my primary reason for buying a guide)is also 7 pages long. The guide's advice for fighting every boss boils down to \\"Try to not die.\\"And the book's excuse for providing absolutely no information whatsoever? Well, just type in this handy code on our web site and you'll get the information you paid for!...but... that's why I bought the book! But tough luck.

It has a simple walk through, and prompts on every page to enter a keyword at PlayOnline.com for more information, and little teasers about what the information MAY be about.IE \\"someone in your party needs an upgrade! to find out who, enter this keyword in Playonline.com!\\"well whats the problem with that?aparently, that part of Play Online has been deleted, so there is no way to do that. Basically, you just get no information at all, except for a very basic walk through that you dont need.Dont get this its a terrible investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish it was better","review":"Like many other gamers I buy a strategy guide to have all my hints in one place. This book barely gives you what you need and sends you to their website for the rest. You are basicaly at the mercy of how long they feel like keeping the site running or how much you are willing to print out to add to an already pricey book. There isn't a page in this book that doesn't have some sort of callout box suggesting you go the website to learn an even BETTER way to defeat a monster, or learn where this or that magic item is hidden. It gets frustrating and really takes away from the gameplay. Oh and as another reader pointed out you can't just go to the site you have to have a special game code for EACH hint.Overall, the book's redeeming qualities are its artwork and the fact you couldn't really find some of the items and answer questions in a timely manner without it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Guide...on How to Get Around on PlayOnline.com","review":"When I first bought the game, I didn't buy the guide. I beat the game in one week, totaling 28 hours. It was that easy. Then I bought the guide so I could get all of the secrets. Apparently, Eidos, or whoever wrote the guide, decided it best NOT to include the secrets of the game. Instead, it was thought a better idea to give a very short description of the sidequest and give a code so you could visit the website PlayOnline.com to get help. The point of buying a guide is to use it to help either beat the game, or in my case, finish all the side-quests. I refused to go to the website and still haven't finished a third of the side-quests. This is a sorry excuse for a guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad, but possibly not for everyone","review":"I followed Edita's diet for 45 days I can say honestly that if I had been losing the weight I'd hoped for, it would have been easy to continue for the full 90 days.

But this book seemed off-key most of time. Too many characters and too many plot threads for short stories. \\"Write A Story\\" shares an unfortunate stylistic connection with the children's book, \\"If You Give a Mouse a Cookie.\\" The one story with any strong emotional effect is \\"The Rabbit Hole as Likely Explanation\\" about a woman's experience with her mother's Alzheimer's. But it was mistake to begin the collection with the dreary \\"Flechette's Follies.\\" I would never have toiled to the end of that very long short story, or the collection, if I hadn't been stuck on a 14-hour plane ride. As a complete aside I must say, Beattie looks a bit like Joni Mitchell in the cover shot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well-intentioned, poorly executed","review":"I really am an Ann Beattie fan. But as I read this collection over a long weekend, I did not find the Beattie voice which so imaginatively gave us portraits of real lives in novels like PICTURING WILL and MY LIFE STARRING DARA FALCON. The main problem plaguing this collection was a lack of focus and imagination, leading to pedantic stories which go down like a bowl of bland oatmeal. Although Beattie is a talented writer I felt like these stories may have been written on autopilot. Stories don't always have to \\"do\\" something, but they have to at least be interesting to read; Updike isn't always a master of plot, but his precise and imaginative use of language is always a delight. I found neither interesting plots nor beautiful sentences in this disappointing book. Let's hope for a new, great novel or a strong collection from Ann Beattie again very soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another lovely CD by Patti!","review":"When I read this CD is produced by David Pack than I thougt it should have been a great CD... and it is!

Well, I can say I've seen alot better movies than this one. In a nutshell, a couple becomes stranded in the woods and discover what they think is a dead body. Wrong. After coming in contact with the \\"dead body\\", they both become infected with a deadly desease. They seek refuge in a deserted cabin because they have no where else to go. They soon realize that they will both suffer a horrible death. They turn to thoughts of murder in order to save their own lives. This flick contains a tiny bit of suspense but is basically a low budget movie that doesn't deliver alot to the viewer. I'd recommend renting it if you are really bored!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"The director of this movie made a poor attempt to spice up the horror genere.The dialogue was just plain bad, the actors gave weak performances, and the pace of the movie was slow and tiresome.This was as bad as watching Gigli.I gave it one star because the director/writer tried pretty hard to make something unique, but he failed immensly.If you want movies that are a little off key like this director tried to do, then stick with M. Night Shyamalan.Some caterpillars just aren't meant to be butterflies."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS MOVIE CRAWLS","review":"This movie crawls and deserves a double punch on your hacker's card. It begs the moral question, \\"Is it okay to kill others to stay alive?\\" We all already know the answer to that: Tele-marketers-yes, Pizza delivery boys-no. Beverly Hynds does a great acting job on a poorly written and developed script. The beginning scene of the boyfriend/girlfriend interaction during the car's flat tire was done well and brings out the differences between the sexes. However, once their flesh starts to rot, so does the movie. Beverly's back must be hurting from trying to carry this whole movie. A great movie to watch with emo friends you don't like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this movie","review":"I was unfortunate enough to rent this movie from my local video store.

Instead of trying to classify fascism by the expected trappings of the 20th century (i.e. brown uniforms, jackboots and armbands) Paxton instead tries to really analyze what the underlying social conditions are for fascism to take hold, and what the meta-characteristics of fascism are when it appears. Fascist ideology was widespread in Europe (and even in America) for the first half of the 20th century, but most movements did not develop past what Paxton calls phase 2. For those regimes that did, there is an interesting problem of whether the regime can continue to expand or if without continued expansion it falls into stagnation and \\"mere\\" dictatorship. Agree with it or not, the ultimate definition of fascism Paxton leaves us with is a good social lens through which we should continue to examine governments at home and abroad."},{"rating":"1","title":"yeahh, sure...","review":"Yes, Bible has special place in history and this special I expected from commentators.

She creates a tale of a girl missing for years whose body turns up wrapped in plastic after a flood in the Ohio River. Shortly afterward, Dara's diary is found, giving clues as to who might have killed her. Christine Ireland, a woman who knew Dara and found the diary, sets out to find the killer, therefore putting her own life in danger.Christine's dilemna lies in the fact that she learns too late that the finding of the diary has also jeopardized the safety of her mentally challenged brother, Jeremy. Luckily, Thompson walks a fine line in characterizing Jeremy. While he is \\"slow,\\" with an IQ of 70, he is not \\"cutsy\\" nor helpless. Think Forrest Gump--stong and skilled in some ways, childlike in others.I admit to being an avid fan of Thompson's, and in this book, I feel she has not only created a dark and haunting story, but several unforgettable characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intro to Thompson doesn't fail","review":"Thompson did a fabulous job of outlining a complex plot and keeping the reader guessing \\"Who Done It\\" in this suspense novel about a girl who goes missing three years ago only to be found after a flood upends her body.The book was fast-paced, witty and detailed accurately police procedures (a big plus in my eyes). My only regret is that the romance was buried within the plot and wasn't developed more. There was a budding sense of connection between Michael and Christine, but it wasn't brought to life, giving it tension and solid reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too tight bathing Cap!","review":"I bought this to give me a little protection to limit water in my ear in my ear.

Not mockingly or judging them in any way. Just deeeeeply.It is difficult to be a man. One would almost think it has become more so, as men now are expected to be strong but caring too.

The political purposes of the story are undone by an ending that serves to reinforce the very societal values that the rest of the novel seems to rally against. The sort of person who would be attracted to this book is likely to find this very obvious, frustrating, and unsatifying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely easy to download music","review":"I was shocked at how easy it was to find and record music that I wanted.

If it's dark outside, there's no contrast between the black numbers and the black (dark) background.2. If any of the digits contains a 4 or a 9, as these two digits look very similar.Also, the suction cup is off-center a bit, so the longer, heavier end can tilt down a bit, requiring correction if you happen to like a level look."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice design, needs to be returned","review":"I like the design of this thermometer, very cost effective compared to wireless units.

A ~2 dollar Chinese made LCD thermometer I bought off e bay displayed an exact temperature match to weather (dot) com.

Although this is a medical biochemistry book, this is inadequate for medical school. Many topics are covered in great detail when they don't need to be, while others are neglected when they should be emphasized. In short, it does not teach to the NBME biochemistry shelf exam or USMLE Step 1. Although it is the second edition, it is riddled with errors, unclear grammar, and inaccurate figures. There are also some topics where this book is just plain wrong. Who thought it would be a good idea to have a bunch of biochemists write a medical text? Get something else; anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard going","review":"This text was compulsory for our college. As a new student to biochemistry I really struggled with this book.

Yes this book was well written, and yes the program samples were nicely layed out, but the whole scheme was not a practicle learning tool. The majority of the internet protocols were handled by the demo ocx called dssock32.ocx. I did not see any code of this ocx, well perhpas bits and chunks but nothing that could be of use.

I found the material to be clearly presented and the sample FTP program functional. To his credit, the author also supports fixes to the code on his web page. However, the book relies on the use of a custom control for Winsock which, although supplied in demo form on the accompaning CD-ROM, costs an additional $99 dollars if you really want to write any code for distribution. The author states that VB will be too slow to use without that custom control. The problem is that I would have preferred to learn stand-alone code at this point rather than depend on that control. If I had known I would be so dependant on it, I would have rather spent the money on a licensed copy of WS_FTP"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written Internet programming book for VB 4.0","review":"This book is well written in that it provides a good mix of conceptual and hands-on material for the intermediate level Visual Basic programmer.

I wish I was kidding when I compare it to a salon hair dryer. It makes more noise than the entire rest of the PC. I bought it to provide some additional flow-through air for my case (not as a hard drive cooler specifically), and I couldn't live with it as loud as it was.I wired in a potentiometer to adjust the voltage to the fan trio, hoping to dull the noise, and it only changed the pitch, not really the volume. I also disconnected the fans one by one and discovered that 2 of the 3 were significantly louder than the other. I now am running just 1 fan in the group of 3. I made the decision to keep and rewire the unit rather than send it back for a refund at this price point.

I had to archive all my records ('98-2004)that MSM 2003 kept w/o incident, because 2005 could not handle the data. Tech support thought that's why 2005 over charged my processor (pentium 4). Then I had to download what I had to MSM 2004 so it could convert to 2005. Apparently this lock-up is a common problem with XP users.

Initially I was put thru an endless stream of tests which mostly assumed that my installation or computer was at fault. When I did a search on the web for Money bugs I found that many others were having the same problems. When I mentioned this, they admitted to 'working on fixes' and then basically threw their hands up. How useful is that? and when will these dozens of fixes be made available. I knew I was in trouble when I bought it the day it was released and by the time it arrived from Amazon, the first time I tried to run it I had to download a large patch.

This mistake is serious to the point of making the whole program useless, and Microsoft has ignored my request for support where I notify them of this situation. And if this makes you want to switch to Quicken Premier it shouldn't, because that program can't always add correctly either.

It appears to be collaborating with Passport too much to back up everything you do. But even worse, on three occassions I've had it go haywire. It added duplicate accounts, merged other accounts, screwed up balances, etc.The way it imports transactions is bad too. The payee names are never there but rather an address. Change it to the name and the next time you synchronize it will show that transaction as a duplicate with the re-downloaded version with no name.Bugs Bugs Bugs.

Some days I cannot download statements at all receiving error messages. Lets not forget all the time and long distance charges talking to their tech help. Their update managed to fix a problem with matching similar transactions but that's all. Now I'm obsessed with getting this to run smoothly. You would think Microsoft would be as determined as I am.

You have to select files and folders using check boxes, instead of being able to just drag and drop files to the new computer. Also, when your computers are transferring they are unaccessible and it is difficult to interrupt the transfer process.If you have a router (wired/wireless), it would be much easier to transfer across the network using shared folders.

Which only worked to register the software on Vista. More emails got me additional code which was required to be used in 24 hrs. Thus, any future installs will require future emails to Laplink. The application is a bit clunky, but is FAST through the USB. 1.3GB in 45sec compared to 20+minutes through my homes hardwire network. I tested the Easy transfer and it is just as fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product did not work.","review":"The Belkin easy transfer cable did not work.

They have mentioned by other reviewers too.1. Do NOT try to transfer your whole computer files and settings...it takes FAR too long.2. Always use the advanced options tab and just choose the folders that you need.3. Recognize that transferring programs does not guarantee that it will install on your computer (most of the time it won't).4. IMPORTANT: if a red x appears anywhere on your screen, it means the transfer is NOT working. You may need to disable your firewall. I recommend also disconnecting from the internet so that you do not make your computer vunerable to virus/or harmful software.Because of the LACK of technical product information supplied with this product i have wasted basically a day trying to get this thing to work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Belkin Easy Transfer Cable","review":"I do not recommend this product.

The on-screen display says if you stop it none of your files will be saved and you'll have to start all over, so that's what I did, although the second time I selected specific folders rather than the all folders and settings. It did work. But then I discovered numerous duplicate files on the new computer--in some cases 3 or 4 copies, from pictures to music to documents, with no rhyme or reason.

With no activity displayed from either hard drive, I spent the day starting and stopping the program. It finally transfered without hangup about 2 in the morning.

I found a web forum run by someone who is on Microsoft's Easy Transfer. He has been able to help other people who have different problems. However, he hasn't been able to help anyone who has the same problem that I did.

If you have an external hard drive use it to transfer your data. A side note - Transferring from Windows XP to Vista computer is much more difficut than transferring from a Windows XP to Windows XP computer. Vista's file structure is different and Outlook 2007 has its' own problems - still not operating correctly - Outlook 2007 is using half the resources of a new Dell XPS M1710.

I needed the file transfer because the old laptop cannot burn CD's reliably anymore.I will eventually burn CD's from the old system to keep as an archive, before I wipe it and replace it with software fit for humans to use, linux.

On my XP system I had user data on the 'D' Partition. In Vista the 'D' partition is used for some Vista system recovery stuff. When you use the Easy Transfer application with the ET Cable it moves data from where ever you had it on the source system (XP in my case)to the corresponding location on the target (Vista) system. The 'D' partition size in Vista is 10 GB, about 7 GB of which is used, so after transferring approx 3 GB of data you get a filespace error.When you use removable media (e.g., CD, thumb drive) you evidently get a choice of where to put the data on the target system but not when the ET Cable is used,If you have data on the 'D' partition on your source system, save yourself the $30.00 for the cable and invest it in a 4GB or 8GB thumb drive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Mover","review":"Used the Belkin Easy Mover to transfer files from Windows XP to new Vista computer.

My 20-month old daughter will sit and watch this because of the video, which changes frames every second or so, and they do flash numbers up frequently. But there are certainly no educational benefits to this video, and the lyrics are enough to drive an adult insane. Baby Genius does much better when they stick to classical music or nursery rhymes, rather than attempting to compose their own songs. Save your money for something more worthwhile for your child."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a favorite in our house","review":"My 3 yr old already knows his numbers but for some reason he really likes this video the best out of all the Baby Genius videos. At least once a day he will say \\"number 1 is fun - 1, 1, 1!\\" I disagree with another reviewer in that I think the video teaches number recognition as well as the concept - e.g. for the number \\"2\\" there are 2 dogs running on the beach. So you see the number 2, see two dogs running on the beach and the song starts with \\"two happy dogs, run run run....\\" I like it because it offers an opportunity to discuss what's happening -- actions, prepositions, etc. -- in each segment with real kids/people and not animated ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"My daughter loved all the Baby Genius videos.

We tolerated the Nursery Rhymes and Childrens' Songs DVDs, but this one is just so cheaply made. The male singer on the songs is not even studio musician quality and certainly not as decent as the one on Nursery Rhymes. The songs are not wonderful either.

I would much rather own The Twilight Zone season one than a random best of. Also I think that viacom could spend a little more time and package episodes differantly.

I bought 35 HOUR-LONG episodes of the equally excellent Outer Limits for about the same price. The 35 episodes that make up the first season of the Andy Griffith show are going for half that at 30 bucks!! Again, another equally excellent classic.

The reason why involves the potential lack of profit in doing so.The reason is not chronological order; with a show like the Twilight Zone, this means nothing. We're not talking about a series that has any type of continuity. Each episode was its own, with no cross references.The problem is that the quality of the show went down in its fourth season, and took an even sharper dip during its fifth and final season. Don't get me wrong, there were some gems to be found; \\"Living Doll\\", \\"Death Ship\\", \\"Steel\\", \\"The Masks\\", and \\"Nightmare at 20,000 Feet\\" are some that come to mind. But I think most fans of the series will agree with me in that the gold mine lay in the first three seasons.So don't hold your breath for a season release.

At the local Best BuyI have seen several people pick it up and pass it up. Each of these individuals have bought several sets of other Television programs. Why-1) Hefty price- fair market value is about $3O for a season.2) Not Chronilogical- some volumes even go as far as to force the inferior hours on you.3) I have used the naviagation menu for one episode and it is bad plus weird.If Via$$$ ever decides to reissue the TZ correctly then Donny will buy.

It started off horror with a bang in the 60's and the show is still relevant and entertaining today. This shows a lot of skill and Rod Serling is a genius.

I bought the first two box sets and was quite dismayed by the quality of the release. The shows are well mastered, but there is very very little extras added in, the menus are very poorly designed, and (most annoying, esp. for a \\"complete\\" set of releases) the episodes aren't even in any sensible order (why not chronological? Ugh!) This is the first series of DVD's I've decided not to collect all of and I'll be selling mine used. :^("},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated nook and overpriced","review":"I purchased this book thinking it had a wealth of information in it -- The book refers to old litho prinitng techniques, film and such...The general content is 10 years or more out of date..It is not worth more than $9.95 at the best. I paid best part of $50 for it....So much of the information is far to liberal and generalised.I would not recommend this book to ANYONE unless the price was under $10. It is certainly not worth $50 or more.A very, very overpriced and overrated book.On the back of the book I recieved it had a reduced sale tag at $8.95This book needs to be entirely updated with modern technologies and information.I have purchased and hired books with so much more modern information than this has.It needs to be completely re-written.

I do wish that there was less of a reliance on female stereotypes in some of the pieces -- there's at least two strips that indicate that nicely dressed women are either likely having affairs with upper management or hoping to skate by on sex appeal. Adams can be funnier than that and doesn't need to resort to these stereotypes; fortunately these strips are two out of ~100 and the rest of the book is very funny and fun.

A natural way to cope is with humor, it is a natural stress reliever that can make even the worst of situations lighter and bearable. Scott Adams is one of the best at creating humor related to the office, made effective because there is so much truth in the situations he creates. Nearly all office dwellers can relate the cartoons to their experiences.If you need a humorous break from your personal office ecology, then this book is what you need. It is funny, accurate and a lifting of the spirits from the tedium and uncertainty of life in modern office world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Case!","review":"I just got this today, a day after ordering it.

Toobin presents a nice narrative here, with plenty of the juicy inside stuff, without losing sight of the two tragedies that occurred: the horrible, bloodthirsty slaughter of Ron and Nicole, and the acquittal of a clearly guilty murderer. If anyone out there seriously still believes in O.J.'s innocence, it's time to check out of Denial Land. The cynical playing of the race card is detailed thoroughly, as is the star-struck way that Ito handled his courtroom. Toobin is not blind to the mistakes of the prosecution, but he sees equally clearly that \\"Guilty\\" was the only possible verdict a juror could have reached (I don't know what the twelve people empaneled in this case were, but jurors they most definitely were not). Toobin has an eye for the telling detail, and his writing skills make this a sometimes fun, sometimes sorrowful, journey through the most unjust trial of modern times. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and Dull","review":"This novel starts out very slow and uninteresting and only barely picks up. It paints vivid pictures of the coastal town and even of the characters in a physical way. But the main part of the story, the relationships, falls flat and remains ambiguous. With the interesting lives led by all the characters, in both timelines, so much more could have been developed. The actions of Lily, Max, and Elsa all seem random and without any motivation. It did offer interesting information about Germany and it's peoples lives before and during WWII."},{"rating":"2","title":"incredible","review":"each of her books is smashing and wonderful... just love her work. this one is as in detail and filled with incredibl journey which is easy to read and as all her other books one who likes her dosent want to put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny.... and scary","review":"Roy Tappen works for a (thankfully, fictional) nuclear weapons facility in the UK. He fights bureaucracy while trying to use it for his purpose, which is to undo the potentially disasterous results of a practical joke gone wrong.What's scary is it looks so real, so familiar, to those of us who have dealt with government facilities.It has a surprise resolution that is rather poetical."},{"rating":"1","title":"BECAUSE I can't give it zero stars","review":"A dull, boring book.

The man takes them home, and find that a misplaced war head is in the files.He was going take it back,BUT the very next day, the rules for going in and out of the plant have been upgraded and made more stringent.A really contrived plot.There are some funny lines, but the characters are so dull and flat that there's no concern for any of them. I watched the ceiling a lot whie reading this title. It was more interesting.Langford can write, but the whole book is not worth the effort to seek out his good lines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the music Steve?","review":"If there is one word to describe this album, it would be definitely \\"crap\\". I loved Steve Stevens' work with Billy Idol. I thought he had style, but this album broke the illusion big time. Song are lousy and there is no music at all! Couple of nice soundeffects and that's it. Lack of direction is main concept of this album. If you want to ruin your friend's birthday, give him this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment","review":"I have always loved Steve Stevens' guitar playing with Billy Idol and believe that he is under-rated, but this album really bites the big one! The songwriting is downright amateurish and Stevens doesn't get a chance to shred the way he obviously can. I'd like to see what he could do in a Jeff Beck-Blow By Blow type of context. Here, it sounds like he has recycled songs that weren't good enough to make it onto a Motley Crue disc (and that ain't good!). The singer makes Vince Neil sound like Paul Rodgers. Save your money and get Rebel Yell by Billy Idol."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, but not our favorite","review":"My son does love this toy, and it did withstand a dunk in a glass of milk and the washing machine, but it's not our favorite.

As soon as he started grabbing for things (around 1 month) this was one of the first things he would grab. I think all the colors and shapes really got his attention. Now that he is 4 months and teething this is still one of his favorites. He loves to mouth the balls and plastic pieces which have great texture. What isn't pictured is that ours has rings instead of the ribbon looking pieces on each end which allow him to hold onto it very easily and allow me to easily attach it to his car seat or stroller. I also put it in front of him when he does tummy time along with other toys and he often chooses this one. This is a great toy and I plan to buy it as a gift in the future!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great amusement","review":"I got this toy for my son when he was 4 months old before we went on his first plane ride.

She loved it then and she's still enjoying it at 9 months. I don't buy her many toys but I wanted something that was stimulating for her development. She enjoys sucking on the different textured rubber pieces, holding onto the plastic rings, and pulling on the elastic \\"arms\\" of the toy. I like that the noises made by the toy are the subtle ringing of a bell inside and the crinkling of the celophane edges. I'm very pleased with this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not real henna","review":"I have not used this product and do not intend to.

The ones I just had installed are made in India and both the sound quality and loudness are greatly inferior to earlier Hellas. I'm unable to install them myself, so I had a very reputable VW shop install them on my 2010 GTI. Took 2.5 hrs labor at $75/hr. Wish I'd never bought the darn things. The Hella spin is that they're 7 times as loud as most stock horns. They might be almost twice as loud, but the frequency is lower and not attention getting. Save your money- these do nothing to add to safety."},{"rating":"2","title":"the beginning of the most famous love triangle in Western history","review":"This is a fascinating epic, meticulously translated and annotated by Cline. It seems to be amazing how much you can learn about some of the most cherished tropes in Arthurian legend by reading this, but this is ultimately unsurprising as The Knight of the Cart was the original source of the Arthur-Guinevere-Lancelot love triangle. It is packed with magical imagery, dark humour, and, of course, fatal flaws. I wish I could read Old French so that I could have a better familiarity with the original text!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT-SO-WONDERFUL LAND OF OZ","review":"Based on the Oz book of the same name, the movie gives the phrase \\"turkey\\" new meaning. Its special effects stink, its costumes for the birds, its acting so-so (at best), its songs pathetic. You get the feeling someone wanted to cut as much costs as possible with no regards to the quality of the movie. The same holds true for the Jack and the Beanstalk movie - poor acting, poor special effects - and the numerous movies it previews.There is a silver line behind this dark cloud of a movie, though. In 1981 a stage production of The Wonderful Land of Oz was televised, entitled The Marvelous Land of Oz, and eventually released on VHS tape. This was as good as The Wonderful Land of Oz movie is bad and worth a look-see.Getting back to The Wonderful Land of Oz, maybe someone will drop a house on it or something!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Below Review","review":"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAaH!!!!lol, best review ive ever read!you've inspired me to buy this dvd, although its 20 something bucks! :(Hopefully in life i come across some decrepid lunatic who owns this 'Wonder' ahahah.I HIGHLY recommend the 4disc set of the BEST animated series of Oz, that this site offers. thats what i was looking for whilst i stumbled across this hideous looking artwork of a thing.LOL, i still cant get over your review, <3"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Review Book, Passed first time!","review":"This book is a quality book to review for the exam and help you pass on your first try, which i did.

If you haven't worked on a computer, haven't built one, haven't installed an OS, don't expect to buy this book and pass the test, in all actuallity, don't buy any book and just expect to pass the test.

This book is heavy, plodding, depressive. By the third chapter I needed prozac. The Turkish people I know do not compel me to jump off a building. Save yourself. Skip this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so much about Istanbul as Orhan!","review":"When the title shouts \\"ISTANBUL\\" followed by \\"memories and the city\\" ( in small font ), you might think this was mostly about Istanbul. To me it's not. It is mostly about a boy/youth/young man growing up in the city and his personal angst and melancholy. the word melancholy must appear 100 times or more in the book, as the author claims that the city is overwhelmed/steeped in a melancholy resulting from the defeat/collapse of the Ottoman empire long ago. It is possible, but I really wanted to learn about the city and it's people and ways, not sooooooooo...much about the author.The photos are very arty, interesting, and educational. Dozens of good photos.Not for those wanting to really discover Istanbul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Huzun Redux.","review":"I returned from my 6th visit to Istanbul a couple of days ago. I took along Pamuk's book thinking it might be fun to read about the city during my stay... This is not really a fun book to read, though it is a good one. As one reviewer pointed out the translation is very well done. The style is smooth and flowing. If you can't visit Istanbul in the grips of winter, Pamuk's book will give you some idea of what it is to walk alone through this great cities back streets and alleyways and to feel history rising up to meet you at every turn. There really is a special melancholia to Istanbul in the winter and Pamuk captures it perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Istanbul Memories","review":"I visited Istanbul about 10 years ago as part of a tour group and went back again this year after all that time. Istanbul never fails to mesmerise and invigorate and excite. It is such a lovely, magnificent city and Pamuk's book brings that out but also highlights the hidden bits/ historical curiosities which visitors might not be aware of. I found the information about his family rather boring and draggy, but it was an interesting background to a man shaped by his city. Pamuk has a wonderful gift of holding the attention of this readers, and though it was somehow lacking in this book - mainly due to the fact that it's autobiographical - the subtle humour he posseses still came through. I love the pictures as well, which brought to live what Pamuk was recounting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Re-titling","review":"I'd re-title this book \\"Memoirs of a Boring Childhood.\\" Like many other readers I *want* to enjoy it.

At some point you have to make your own judgement of a book, Nobel or not. And this one is boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"yawn","review":"Frankly, this was a painful read. Not because of the subject matter, but because of the writing style. I gave up reading it several times, and convinced myself to pick it up again (only because i do not like to leave books mid-way), only to give up reading it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nobel What?","review":"I lived in Istanbul for some years and expected to find in this book something--anything--that told me what the place was about or what I missed.The answer is very little indeed. For those who like kitchen drama--i.e. what Baby Orhan liked or did not like; what his mother thought of him when she thought at all; what his father never thought when he was out philandering--this should be a satisfying book. For the rest of us--I just don't know. We tend to think that most of it belongs on FaceBook. And nowhere else.Read Pamuk's fiction. It's generally quite good. Forget this piece of gross self-indulgence.P.S. It's also high priced for an ebook."},{"rating":"2","title":"2006 Nobel Prize Winner","review":"Orhan Pamuk brilliantly descibes the city he was born with melancholic touches. I think he is at his best at this novel. He is definitely one of the great masters of his era. I couldn't help wiping tears."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so","review":"Istanbul is a truly fascinating city, and the book covers Pamuk's personal memories of it since childhood, and its transformation from the decadent seat of Ottoman power into one of Europe's most astonishingly beautiful and modern cities. What I regret is Pamuk's writing style which frequently veers off into historical minutiea that is a challenge to plod through, but if one skips those parts, he does shed an interesting light on life in Istanbul prior to the mass exodus of it's Greek inhabitants, and how their departure impoverished Turkey culturally in many ways. The Istanbul he depicts is a grey sombre place, caught in the cold-war struggle between the superpowers, living on a lost glorious past, contrary to what it is today. The inclusion of more personal memories would have added warmth and enhanced the book, which in its present state resembles a long rambling lecture by an old historian."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the city but not the book","review":"I visited Istanbul twice and can still see, hear, smell and feel the vibrancy of this exotic, magnificent city. I eagerly anticipated reading this book. Disappointedly, I found this author's lifelong experiences to be melancholy and his writings meandering. His reflections and observances offer a few beautiful moments but those moments are not worth the tedious read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Orhan Pamuk's Experience of Istanbul","review":"Orhan Pamuk, winner of the 2006 Nobel Prize in Literature, writes of the history of Istanbul and of his personal experience of it growing up in the 50s through the 70s.

I was upset for spending the $25 dollars, im just not impressed with bootlegs i guess. If you like bootleg style videos then this is the one for you. But I highly recommend LIVE CANNALBALISM over this one, the sound and picture blows this dvd out of the water."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live Monolitic Cannibalism","review":"This is one of my favorite Cannibal Corpse DVD's in my collection. I once brought it on VHS format many years ago but latter on DVD when it was released.What you will see on this DVD is some killer performences from 4 killer shows during the Monolith Of Death tour or the tour for the Vile album. Some of the footage is not in the same caliber as the footage on Live Cannibalism but it's still raw, crued, heavy and brutal. So no Cannibal Corpse die-hard will be dissapointed.There is also the unsensored video for Devoured By Vermin, photo gellery, discography and some interview footage which really is an extanded version of that extra footage from the Live Cannibalism DVD.So alll and all, buy this DVD and experience some live cannibalism at the hands of the monolith of death known as Cannibal Corpse. Enjoy the trip."},{"rating":"1","title":"VHS quality footage with TERRIBLE SOUND","review":"I like this band a lot, but this DVD is a rip off. The sound is muffled and absolutely horrible.

Throughout much of the book, I laughed so hard I couldn't breathe, and there were parts that moved me to tears. The characters were beautifully written, believable, multi-faceted, and likeable. The intricacies of the plot were amazing, and the descriptions made me feel like I was a part of the story without being tedious. Now this book stays on my nightstand, and each night I open the book at random and read a few pages before I go to sleep.

There are simply so many tangents throughout the story that plot is constantly bogged down. There were very funny lines scattered throughout, but I found myself just wanting it all to be over. The character development is very shallow...so shallow that I didn't care what happened to whom. It was kind of like reading slap-slick comedy...funny to watch, not so funny to read. I do think that, in the hands of the right director, it would make a good movie and am a little surprised that it has never been tried."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brevity","review":"Brevity is the soul of wit. Don't read this book if you have just finished the incredibly funny Norwood by Charles Portis. Handling Sin would be a lot funnier at half the length -- in that regard it reminded me of what a hard slog it was getting through the Girl With The Dragon Tattoo trilogy. So hard that, in fact, I never read book three! Somewhere in Handling Sin is a much smaller and more focused book that isn't trying to be an \\"all things to all people\\" classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat funny, but too distracting","review":"I think Malone is a talented writer. This book is a picaresque in the tradition of Don Quixote. But, this book fails where Don Quixote succeeded.First, the numerous digressions from the main plot were extremely distracting. I would be reading one of these asides for two or three pages, and then suddenly get jarred back into the main plot. Some of these digressions were funny and quirky, but they often did not seem to have a point relating to the story. It seems that they were just stuck in to up the quirkiness of the book. Quirkiness just for its own sake is hollow, and a poor substitution for genuine humor.Second, the characters were all too outlandish. Granted, in this style of book, the characters will be extreme. But, Malone didn't rein in his characters in the least. So, they end up being incomplete and unbelievable.Perhaps Malone's fans will enjoy this. I did not."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a long way to get to nothing...","review":"I finish every book I start. I thought this book would never end.

Raleigh Hayes of Thermopylae, NC, discovers his father has absconded (after escaping from the hospital) with the family fortune and taken off for points unknown in an egg yolk-yellow Cadillac convertible. His companion of choice is a young female - no big surprise - but she's also a mental patient and of a race traditionally looked down upon in the Deep South. Raleigh, following clues on a left-behind list that give him 7 tasks to accomplish, sets off on what quickly and predictably becomes an odyssey. His sidekick is his friend Mingo, and the two of them quickly become the lead comedic characters in their own play as they wend their way toward New Orleans and a \\"planned\\" rendezvous - as if anything could really be planned when dealing with this wacko cast.Wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, I'll be the first to disagree....","review":"As one who regularly teaches a course in Southern literature, I bought this book to see if it might be a good addition to the syllabus. From the start, I got just sick of the writer's self-indulgent, smirking attempts at humor. I guess I prefer books that seem written for readers, not for the tongue-in-cheek amusement of their authors. In short, I found the style of Handling Sin insufferable--so much so that I confess to having stopped reading after page 75 or so.

It is laugh out loud funny while at its heart a truely touching tale about family and self discovery. Malone amazingly creates a wonderful tale which takes its main character on a sojourn which exposes his family secrets while at the same time awakens him to his own doubts and strenghts. I hesitated to compare Malone to Irving as Malone's other novels are quite different, however this book defintely compares to Irving at his best (Garp,Widow for a Year)where humor carries the reader through the main characters trying times and road to self discovery and realization. The definitive difference being its southern roots and down home style. I have read two more of Malone's books since \\"Handling Sin\\" and have come to enjoy him immensely,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inevitable","review":"Because of the style and setting of this book, it is inevitably going to be compared to A Confederacy of Dunces. While I loved JK Toole's book, I enjoyed this one even more. It's just a fun escape from the world for a few hours, taking a trip from North Carolina to New Orleans, with moments of utter silliness, moments of touching family and racial issues, and everything in between. After reading this, I also read Foolscap, still a good book, but I didn't enjoy it as much as I did Handling Sin.I'm editing this review today at a later date...pick up his books featuring Cuddy Mangum and Justin Saville...sort of in the \\"crime/mystery\\" genre, but so well done, it's just good literature any way you look at it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy!!!","review":"I buy this snack once in a while and it always surpasses my expectations.

Try them frozen -- yum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Story Under Water","review":"Luckily for us, Dobyns comes from the \\"readers need constant review\\" school of writing. That's good because when you get to the point (early in the book) when you are skimming for all that you are worth, you can still keep up with the thin story line that is lost under layers of useless detail. Robert Parker would have gone through this book with a machete and come up with a real page turner. I don't know if Dobyns was paid by the word or the character or both but the result is a story that had me rooting for the murderer. Dobyns does capture the essense of life on a prep school campus reasonably well (although the headmaster has entirely too much time to waste, as do the students who apparently don't have to show up for class). You can put your time to much better use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good characters&#65533; impressive storm","review":"Gullible, naive Clinical Psychologist becomes the new headmaster of a residential school in New Hampshire, and in his efforts to re-invigorate the venerable institution, he encounters some interesting characters: some nice- some not so nice.

A good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and disappointing","review":"I really looked forward to Dobyns' lastest novel. His previous work \\"Church of the Dead Girls\\" was excellent and creepy; however \\"Boy in the Water\\" is boring and tedious to read. He hasn't created characters that are interesting nor ones that I care about. I agree with the reader from Indiana that the book is repetitive and the action takes entirely too long to begin. Sadly, I would not recommend this novel to anyone I almost did not finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!","review":"The prologue is amazing -- the description of the scene had me hooked and I eagerly bought the book. I anxiously started reading as soon as I got home. Good at first, but the further I read, the more boring it got. The first 25 pages of Part 2 are a complete rehashing of what we just read in Part 1. Maybe the author was aware that he was putting his readers to sleep and felt he had to remind them of what they had read before their nap. The main character is a complete moron. I was so irritated that I skimmed the final 100 pages, not caring what happened to our \\"hero.\\" Be warned - \\"Boy in the Water\\" is all wet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Slow","review":"I was hoping for a good page turner.

It bounces around far too much from the death of Bob Stevens, to Mohammed Atta, NBC, Homeland Security, the CDC and back to AMI among others. The aforementioned are all critical to the story. When there is a gap in time and with such a detailed story it would have been better had it been tighter.Graysmith has not turned out to be my favorite author. But, when it comes to movies based on his original writing, such as \\"Zodiac\\" or commentary he provides on the Autofocus DVD discussing the investigation into the murder of Bob Crane, I have become a fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Over the Map","review":"(This is a review of the Kindle edition.)The author has unquestionably done a lot of work on researching the history and personalities involved in the anthrax killings. The problem I had with this book was how unevenly it plays out. It jumps from a fairly good narrative true crime story to a poorly written overly detailed look at topics that are barely relevant to the story. Most irritating were the numerous repetitions of facts and quotes, as if the author were being paid by the word or presumed that the reader could not retain simple facts from one chapter to the next. The narrative is choppy and jumps back and forth across time more than is really necessary.I bought it as a reader with an interest in human response in disasters, not as a professional researcher. It may be useful to keep as a reference to refresh my memory on facts, but it is not what I would consider an enjoyable and informative narrative in the genre of true crime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well researched but poorly written","review":"Although an intersesting account of the investigation of the anthrax mailings in 2001, this book is poorly written and hard to follow. I often got the impression that the author was quoting sources that he doesn't understand which made for a confusing and dissapointing read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent cutlery","review":"This has quickly become one of my favorite tools.

Read this to find out what a fouth grade wizard is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice book for kids","review":"This book is actually part of a series geared towards young adults with if I remember correctly, five books. Granted, it's been a long time since I read the series, but I remember enjoying it, and it is a great series for kids.Granted, the books are now dated (this was before the Internet and cellphones!) but it's nostalgic and in a way refreshing. You don't have to start off with this book, but I recommend it as it is a prequel to the rest of the series. The main character has a deceased mother, so she and her father have to deal with that while she has to deal with school. In my personal opinion, this isn't as interesting or funny as 'Nothing's Fair in the Fifth Grade' or 'Sixth Grade Can Really Kill You', but it's still a worthwhile read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hits?","review":"This anthology is peculiar. Not exactly greatest hits or even favorites. The sequencing is odd, as well. Too bad the original greatest hits package is unavailable on CD in the United States as that was far superior."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent compilation","review":"An excellent selection of 14 of SD's songs from \\"Can't Buy a Thrill\\", \\"Pretzel Logic\\", \\"Katy Lied\\", \\"Countdown to Ecstacy\\", \\"Royal Scam\\", \\"Aja\\" and \\"Gaucho\\". While a lot of good material was obviously omitted, let's face it, you can only fit 74 minutes of music on a CD. Another plus is that \\"FM\\" is on this CD but isn't on any of their original CD's, most of which I already have. But all things considered, about the best justice that can be done to Becker and Fagen's clever lyrics and jazzy rock style on a 74 minute CD.Verdict: Best choice if you are buying your first Dan CD.

And, for real Dan Fans, the version of \\"F.M.\\" on this album has the guitar outro (the version on the box set has the sax outro).This is a decent disc to start with.

Almost all of the landmark tunes are present. You have the early hits Do It Again and Reeling in the Years, as well as the Adult Contemporary standards F.M., Peg and Hey Nineteen. They are excellent, for they comprise some of Steely Dan's most essential moments.I will give the content of A Decade of Steely Dan 4 stars instead of the unequivocal 5. Why? Because Bodhisattva and East St. Louis Toodle are throwaway tracks and do not suitably reflect the artistry of the highly talented Fagen/Becker duo. The title track from the Aja album and Dirty Work, instead, would make this a most complete disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect","review":"Only flaws here is that NOT all of the charted hits are included, and the mastering is somewhat low and all over the place.

It's truly a lovable cacophony of sound whose timely dissonance is predictable for the band, whose very LA accents and references are a weathervane of musical esoteric perfection. We have the two classics, Rikki Don't Lose That Number and Deacon Blues in this collection, both of which are indicative of a rock/jazz marriage and quirky lyrics that have catergorized this group since day one. Steely Dan is a pacesetter, the inside track entry in any contemporary rock collection.

However, if the purpose was to proselytize, then the movies should have had the budget and quality necessary to attract the targeted audience. As it turned out, it appears the purpose was to make a quick buck off low-budget films that do not serve justice to the authors. Unlike the successful Christian music industry, Christian movies will not reach the \\"other side\\" until they are made with such quality as to rival any competing movie on a Friday night.

Or much mention of Christanity. Only the vague God and some type of Heaven is mentioned, but never really explained.I challenge anyone to spot the name of Jesus in this film. It just isn't there.Despite this, the LEFT BEHIND was decent, with a lot of effort from Kirk Cameron, and the intense scenarios of the books to rely on.The second two sequels films are more B movie terroritory, (They actually mention Jesus so this is an improvement) so if you like that then buy them.

This book can be used like a pre-flight checklist, or a troubleshooting guide.I would also like to add that my first round using a putting tip from this book (when during the breathing cycle to initiate the putt) I had one of the best putting rounds of my golf life, made every putt I looked at except one, saved me approx six shots over my usual performance and turned a ok day into an excellent one.

The best songs on the album are the jumpy \\"Hosanna,\\" \\"He Reigns (the medley),\\" and the beautifully arranged ballad, \\"Don't Cry,\\" with a wonderfully executed piano accompaniment by Richard Smallwood. The entire album as a whole has wonderful structure and balanced substance.

While he submits that he was often weak in dealing with the producers, the reader who remembers well the series will have no doubt but that this is none other than the legendary John Steed himself writing.

Most remixes from that time period don't change much of the song, they just extended the original bassline (that's what I've found anyways). These ones actually change a bit, especially the \\"Stop & Go Dubs\\" of \\"Express Yourself\\". But let me tell you how upset I was to find that it was only about $15.00 on Amazon.com!!! I bought these in 1992 as a Japanese Import and they cost me $50!!! Do I ever feel ripped of now. But what can you do? I needed it for my Madonna collection.

A must buy for any fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Song Will Take You There!","review":"I will admit off the bat that this is not the best single Madonna has ever put out. However, the song itself ranks up there in her all time top 5 (I'm way too huge of a fan to pick a number 1). The lyrics are powerful, the music is infectous, and Madonna has almost never sounded so amazing. This album brings you the power of \\"Like a Prayer\\" and spices it up a bit to boot. While you won't find any hard core club mixes here, what you will find are some exceptional mixes of this classic tune. Haunting guitar intros and the soft whisper of \\"Oh my God\\" add a touch of mystery that is addictive. Well worth the price of the CD, this is definitely one for any Madonna fan. Along for the ride are a few mixes of \\"Express Yourself.\\" While none are likely to blow your mind, they are fun and worth the listen. And for those of you who obesess over melodies and harmonies like my good friend Scott, be sure to check out the re-remix of \\"Express Yourself.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"No Choice! Her voice will take you there!","review":"Simply the best remixes of this song in existance! If you liked the Blond Ambition Tour, you'll LOVE tracks 4 & 5!this CD also contains a soothing \\"Churchapella version\\". Track one is similar to the concert version, as well as the one on the Immaculate Collection. And my personal favorite is track #2! The guitars are soo great! In addition to all this, you get some kickin' mixes of Express Yourself! Buy It Now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sorry, I made a mistake","review":"This is NOT the first time a Madonna remix was over 8 minutes. I made a mistake; the first time was in 1987 for the \\"You Can Dance\\" album with an extended mix of \\"Into the Groove\\" clocking in at 8:26. I should've known, since I have it on my iPod! This is the first time a M remix was over 9 minutes! still a great mini-album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Amazing","review":"Remixed Prayers is an awesome miniCD.

I think that the ability that sets Madonna apart the most is not simply being someone who manipulates media well but in truth two things: One, she's not a big fan of TV or indulging in the media, beign a puppet to it in watching it. Two, Marianne Williamson talks about that people who become legends do so because they tap into the concept of what the human consciousness is available to, needing to develop and that rings within all of us. It is that work that interests the rest of us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mixes of 2 of Madonna's Best Songs","review":"Since the other reviews had already mentioned details about this Cd maxi-single, I will be brief:There are 5 different singles of the #1 song Like a prayer, all of them very nice. She does know who turn to to make her singles.The other 3 tracks are from the #2 song Express Yourself. I like this song better then the first one so these mixes do it better for me.Overall a excellent addition to your Madonna cd collection, this mini-album has long mixes so is worth your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain terrible transfers!","review":"Bad commentary by some Curly impersonator and convention stuff of their family, all pulled from tape, so the lack of quality is horrible.

(\\"Red Letter Day/Woodson\\" which has both of the Get Up Kids E.Ps on it for practically the same price as purchasing one of them)and the actual song Red Letter Day is on their second album \\"Something to Write Home About\\". I don't understand what is so great about this song that we have to be forced into listening to it on 3 of the five Get Up Kids CDs. If you want some better Get Up Kids songs listen to \\"Valentine\\", \\"I'm a Loner Dottie, A Rebel\\" and their first single \\"Action and Action\\".

It smacks you in the face less, but wraps its tendrils around your heart more than any other Sandoval recording I know. Sandoval comes off as no less a genius than elsewhere, but there is understatement and rich texture. Technical brilliance is not this recording's reason for being, but rather this is a celebration of georgeous tunes and arrangements. I've grown to dislike Giant Steps because so many have tried their hand at it, but this is the best cover I've heard. This is my favorite Sandoval recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"quality product","review":"fast service excellent quality. the sound is great. i used a couple of velcro strips to hold the transducer at the recommended location and got the best sound. i can easily move the transducer to another instrument. the included 10 ft cord has a 1/8 inch connector at guitar so i dont have to drag the cord around when not in use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this book.

The Groover attachement with the weight of the bull float on it caused stones push upward on the sides. The concrete was left with a messy groove that was too wide and rough. I refloated the groove to smooth it out somewhat.I ended up cutting the gooves rather than using this attachment. I can only guess that the weight of the float caused it (the groover) to dig into the concrete. Controlling the bull float was more difficult too.Maybe it was me, but I prefer cutting the grooves or doing it by hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, bad science","review":"When anyone can publish a book, they can publish anything.

In fact, as any zoologist or marine biologist will tell you, sharks do get cancer! So much for accurate research. This book's information is dangerous for two reasons: 1) people may use this unproven treatment when they need traditional medicine, and 2) many sharks are being unnecessarily killed for their cartilage. A dangerous book and a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dr. Lane still doesn't get it","review":"Not only do sharks get dozens of cancers, but they get several types of chondroma, which is cancer of the cartilage, according to the John Hopkins study and other reports.In 2007, a study found that shark cartilage actually *reduced* life expectancy of cancer patients (led by Dr. Charles Lu), or more likely had no measurable effect. Other studies showed a similar outcome.In 2004 the FDA shut the author's company down for making unsubstantiated claims. The FTC also barred him from making similar claims in 1998.It should be noted that cartilage, taken orally, is broken down by stomach acids into amino acids, making it indistinguishable from any other protein. Any *complete* protein that gets into the blood system would trigger an immune response. So it doesn't even make sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Disappointed","review":"I'm not a huge BOC fan, but I did enjoy their music and was looking forward to seeing this concert. I played it immediately after receiving it and was very much disappointed; sounds a lot like me and a few buddies belting out the lyrics after a few drinks and the music wasn't much better. I have approximately 70 concert DVDs and have my top, middle and bottom tier shows and BOC will be at the bottom."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sad Showing","review":"I've been a BOC fan since the mid-70's, and I rocked live to their \\"Black and Blue\\" tour with Black Sabbath. That was an awesome show!\\"A Long Day's Night\\" is a sad, sad picture of what the band's become. Bloom's vocals are often off-key, the songs lack punch. The guitar work still rocks, but how many guitar solos can you really listen to once you're in your 40's?I bought this DVD hoping to relive a fantastic live concert experience of many years ago.

Before that was in Phillie,PA in 1980 on the Godzilla tour.This DVD has all the great songs plus some of there newest stuff. The reason I gave it 4 stars is based on the poor sound quality. Apparently the guy working the sound board must have missed the sound check or had his girlfriend present and forgot to adjust for the band. You can barely hear Buc Dharmas vocals. The mix is just terrible and doesn't allow the home listener to be able to adjust the mix because it just simply isn't there to start with. 5 star sound is like for example the Roger Waters or Joe Satriani DVD or Led Zepplin's Jimmy page produced latest.Overall it's still a great DVD and is the best available I think for a B.O.C. concert.Crank it up to Bucks Boogie!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost as good as LIVE","review":"I just viewed this DVD - AND I just saw BOC live at the Catalyst in Santa Cruz, CA, this week. This DVD is phenomenal. Great video, great audio, excellent editing, great song selection. To be honest, the concert sound at the Catalyst was too loud and a bit distorted, and the song selection on this DVD is better than what they are currently playing on tour. Sure, I can complain that the left out \\"Astronomy\\", \\"Take Me Away\\", and \\"This ain't the summer of love\\" and a few other favorites off of this DVD; but overall it is superb. Perhaps they can put out another concert DVD in a couple of years and cover the great songs missing from this one! I'd buy it! If BOC happens to read this, also include \\"Golden Age of Leather\\". Buck Dharma and BOC are a truly great band!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Hesitate!!!","review":"Possibly B.O.C.'s best live recording yet! I saw these guys a few months back and they put on the best show I have seen in ages, even after being on the road for 30+ years. This DVD captures what the band sounds like these days. My only complaint is that the DVD doesn't contain \\"I Love the Night\\". Ignore the Naysayers, this is an excellant DVD and the boys sound better than ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT BAND, LOUSY RECORDING","review":"FIRST OF ALL, I THINK BOC IS A GREAT BAND. HAVING SEEN THEM LIVE, I KNOW HOW GOOD THEY CAN SOUND. I'M SORRY, BUT HOW DO YOU TAPE A WHOLE CONCERT, WITH MAJOR PROBLEMS WITH THE VOCAL MIX, SIT DOWN AFTERWARDS AND LISTEN TO IT, AND THEN RELEASE IT ANYWAYS. ERIC BLOOMS VOCAL MIKE WAS TOO HOT, MAKING HIM SOUND OUT OF TUNE IN SOME PLACES. BUCK'S VOCALS SOUNDED GOOD, IF ONLY YOU COULD HEAR HIM. WITH TODAY'S RECORDING TECHNOLOGY, WAS THERE NOTHING THEY COULD DO? THE SAD PART IS, IS THAT THE PLAYING IS DAMN GOOD. IF YOU'RE A BOC FAN, YOU'LL BE [UPSET]."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Show","review":"The last time I had seen Blue Oyster Cult was in 2003. The Boys put on one heck of a show.

The production is very clear and warm, with sweet camera angles. ... If you have a hard time swallowing the gentrified music that's seems to sell these days, this video will restore some faith that a rock band can still have some cosmic punch. The new rhythm section is extra pumpin combined with already legendary guys like Eric, Alan &Buck. Memo to rock fans, even if you only know \\"Don't Fear the Reaper\\" and \\"Burnin for you\\", BOC has so much depth and consistancy that you're doin yourself a favor to explore them. Finally, a great rock band with their priorities straight who put integrity and music first..."},{"rating":"2","title":"I WAS THERE","review":"Ok, I am on my way to buy this DVD, but I must tell you I was actually at this show....I'd known a grand total of four BOC songs, but that didn't take away from the enjoyment at ALL. It was a fantastic show that was energetic, electric, and mystifying. Their lead guitar player shredded up Navy Pier, he was that good.

I was not so excited after watching it. The concert footage and the video quality were great, but the sound is terrible. I own many concert DVD's, and this by far is the worst. The vocals on some songs are so low; it becomes painful to watch after a while. About half way through the film, my wife looked over at me and said, \\"We can always sell it at a tag sale\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Surround Sound","review":"Buck's vocals are buried so deep in the mix you can barely hear him. His vocals do not come from the center speaker. It sounds like he's standing 15 feet away from the mike. I think the only way his vocals are being picked up is through another microphone on stage but not through his. I tried Dolby 5.1 and DTS 5.1 but it didn't make a difference. I cranked up both my rear speakers but it didn't improve things much. About 2/3 of the way through the show you see a guy run on stage and mess with some wires in the background. After that Buck's vocals are much improved and can be heard through the center channel. I bought the DVD at Best Buy and they wouldn't let me return it.

It also sports 2 prefaces, an intro, and sections on the shorts and short subjects, Disney TV, a filmography, and films post-Walt. As an overview, it's a fine work; obviously, you can only put so much info into a book that covers dozens of films. Each film gets between 1 and 10 pages (according to their importance). I always enjoy Maltin's writing, since he has an enthusiasm for his subjects that is passed on to the reader. What I liked best about this book is being able to read up on little-remembered pieces such as The Reluctant Dragon and Victory Through Air Power. The only drawback is that the illustrations & photos (and there are quite a few) are all in black and white; however, I suppose this did keep this book very affordable.

I guess I wanted to try other things, and after amassing all kind of heavy bulk which I eventually gave away, I resorted to buying disposable paper plates which, useless to say, got to be expensive after awhile. Corelle is better than disposable plates because they are light and easy to handle, they don't break, they are easy to clean either in the dishwasher or by hand, they are heat resistant, they hardly take up any space on the shelf or in the sink, and they are inexpensive to buy. I also think they are pretty as they come in a variety of colors and styles.

It's part travelogue, part human-interest story, with an element of risk: Even on a trip as carefully planned as this, the unexpected occurs. Several cars broke down and forced their owners to abandon the race. The author is very knowledgeable about cars, and very hands-on. I especially enjoyed his detailed account of his own car preparation and his repairs throughout the rally.

It works for anxiety, panic attacks, alcohol withdrawal symptoms such as shakes and cravings. I think they should use this instead of benzodiazepines for such symptoms. Passionflower does not have any addictive qualities. If you suffer from any of these symptoms, I can tell you personally that this does work, and it works well. I would suggest three tablets instead of two, but that's just me. It shouldn't be taken with a few medications like Depakote (Passionflower also seems to have anticonvulsant qualities) so be sure to check on interactions and ask your doctor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Calphalon Katana","review":"This knife is well balanced, sharp, and weights comfortably in your hand.

The reason is that the bolster is smooth instead of having a hard edge like what's seem in most German cutlery.

Basically, some cameraman is running around talking to assorted rappers about nothing in particular. Most of the time, the rappers are lamenting on how non-fans think all they do is sit around and get lifted, and when they're interviewing Jadakiss, for example, he's sitting there smoking a joint! Did I miss something?Another thing is that there are a lot of testimonies from some extremely wack rappers (Masta Killa, Sticky Fingaz, Jermaine Dupri). And why in the world was Dalvin DeGrate there?

It was Hole's first single to actually break into the Top 40. This CD single is the Australian version and it comes with the b-slides 'Rock Star' (alternative version) and a cover of Echo & the Bunnymen's 'Do It Clean'. The 'Rock Star' version (aka: Olympia) on this single is a little different than the one on 'Live Through This'. The lyrics are changed around and they're actually better, but the sound quality is strange. Courtney's voice echos and you can hear the original being played 'underneath' this one. 'Do It Clean' is a catchy little song played live, so the sound quality isn't the greatest. The cover art of this single is a Barbie doll's wedding dress, veil, flowers, shoes, etc in a plastic case. It goes well with the cover design from 'Live Through This'. Very girly.

So far, I've only had to shake and wiggle the pan and they loosen up by themselves and then slide them onto to a cooling rack to cool. One of these muffin is pretty close to an equilivent of two regular cupcakes, give or take. Highly recommend this pan to those to prefer to eat one big muffin vs. 2 small ones. Easy clean up as well.

The bottoms of some of the muffins were destroyed because they stuck. I was very upset, but decided I'd try again another time. So, last night I decided to bake some cornmeal muffins. This time I sprayed the inside of each cup with Pam so that nothing would stick. Well, the muffins didn't stick at all...instead half of them came out with some sort of a metallic film on them. It had flaked off of the inside of the muffin tin. I will never consciously buy another Baker's Secret product. What's the secret?

I happily made a batch of muffins and put the batter directly into the pan, thinking how great it was going to be to skip the step where I butter the pan. The muffins stuck badly to the pan. They stuck to this pan worse than they would have stuck to the fine old Ekco muffin pan I've been using for years. I have just read through the other reviews of this item and was amazed to see people are highly impressed by a pan that they must first grease before putting in the muffin batter. Folks, this has been true of all muffin pans for as long as I've been alive, and that's a very long time.

They were a GR8 success and they'll last awhile since I don't bake too often, but when I do, I tend to get a bit rough with my pans, but these keep coming up like brand spankin' new.

I have a lot of tile and hardwood and it does a great job on both. The battery lasts long enough to do all the floors with time to spare. The head swivels so it gets in the tight spots around toilets and under kitchen cupboards. The only draw back and it is a minor one, is that if it even thinks you are about to turn on the spray, the vacuum shuts off. Keep your finger away from the trigger and it is fine.

On the third time the mechanism sounded like it was working but the solution was not dispensed. According to the trouble shooting guide, this was one of the problems that required a call to the repair line. I did not feel that an appliance requiring a repair call after two uses was in my best interest.Since the purchase was made during a period of time that my husband has hospitalized three times, I did not make return arrangements within the 30-days allowed.

In the next four songs I literally strained to hear Sarah Brightman's voice - it was overwhelmed by a somewhat \\"tinny\\" sounding musical soundtrack. -- So, gave it to a friend who is an audio expert with great equipment - she got the same results. I love Sarah Brightman but certainly was disappointed in this album. Although the type of music is not my favorite I thought her voice would override that. Maybe that would have happened if her voice had come through over the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something went wrong!","review":"I was very disappointed with this album! Nothing wrong with the music or the way Sarah sings it, I simply dislike the content, the lyrics! A song about a fly is hardly my cup of tea!

I cannot stand her singing like the 80s song \\"Barbie Girl\\". Her voice is now so \\"nasaly\\" that it's almost impossible to listen to her. The one and only best track on the album has to be \\"A Question of Honour\\", for it shows off Brightman's operatic ability. I just can't take the Pop Sarah! Please, someone convince her to go back to classical! I would dissuade you from buying this CD because it is almost unbearable to listen to! If you want something that sounds like the old Sarah from The Phantom of the Opera, then purchase the sound track or buy Surrender - The Unexpected Songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Album!!","review":"This is a very good album by Helix. Certainly not their best work, but that's a testameant to the band, not a knock on this album. The songs are rock n' Roll without a doubt, but with a very melodic and catchy tone to them. I guarantee you'll be enthralled by the deeply hypnotic \\"Storm\\". You'll be singing along with \\"Midnight Express\\" and \\"Rockin' Rollercoaster\\".

End times is hard because one has to be astute at handling all of the Scriptures, or else it dribbles into the false and endless stream of stuff that comes out of the Church, especially when current events merit fear among the people.Plueger shows using the Bible and its difficult sections on prophecy, e.g. Daniel, Zechariah, etc., how the literal milleniallists distort Scripture to their own destruction and those who follow.This is Plueger's second excellent work on end times. First was well-done as well: \\"Things to Come for Planet Earth,\\" which showed the unbiblicalness of Hal Lindsay's best-seller, Late Great Planet Earth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tremendous!

She was completely dedicated to her homeland of Germany; she spoke fondly of the culture until her death. She was raised in a priveledged class and was lucky enough to begin her career that brought her to America in The Blue Angel with Josef von Sternberg. She became a huge star in America and never returned to Germany to make another film. When World War II began, Dietrich rallied against her home country and went to extremes to encourage the moral of the American troops. She even became a citizen of the country.Dietrich's war efforts have not been explored in the past the way this documentary does. Made by much of her family including her grandson and with interviews from her daughter, this documentary provides a personal view as well as a scholarly one. The war changed this exotic performer, and this DVD shows the world why and how.As a big fan of Dietrich, I have never admired her as much as I do now after seeing this documentary."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad luck or service?","review":"I've sent you an email that I did not receive the purchased items!!!!!!!!!!Please answer my email and complaint!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too fragile","review":"I have the 80 lb Cobra crossbow pistol, which is great. It came with three of these aluminum bolts and I ordered an extra pack of 12 aluminum bolts. Well, these bolts are terribly fragile. The plastic rear section that includes the fletching (fins) is quite brittle and breaks off easily. Once it breaks, they are not repairable. What can cause them to break? Almost anything. A target that's a little too hard, a slightly angled impact, etc. Order the plastic bolts available from Amazon and other sites. These plastic bolts are single piece, molded with a metal tip and are virtually unbreakable. Occasionally a metal tip will come off, but they are easy to glue back on with Superglue or any strong adhesive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Product","review":"These bolt break as soon as they are fired, even when shot from low-poundage crossbows. The cheap plastic fletching is held onto the aluminum bolt with (what appears to be) super glue. The fletching is one solid piece of plastic that is not connected to the aluminum in any way except by glue. I thought that the past reviews were probably just from overly-picky buyers, but I was so wrong.

They're light weight, cook evenly, and are easy to clean up. If you use canned spray oils (like Pam or Bakers Secret) you will get a gummy build up around the top of the pan that can't be cleaned off. They will still cook just fine, but they get dirty looking after awhile. I generally replace my pans every eighteen months or so because I do use spray oils.

Like most of his works, Stephenson researches what he is talking about and you actually learn something should you choose to do so. It has the typical Stephenson finish of ending at the climax.You will enjoy this book if you like Stephenson, Science Fiction, Political Fiction, CSI or any of those other shoes, or if you just want a good read. This book is appropriate for all ages but a healthy dose of cynicism may be needed for enjoyment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant satire.","review":"Interface is a very well-crafted political satire. Like the best satires, it places a recogniseable institution into an extraordinary situation, adds a good dose of humour, and uses that to expose some truths about the real world.What is interesting about Interface is not the science-fiction storyline about brain implants or global conspiracy. What makes this a brilliant book is the insight it gives into the election process, mostly in the USA, but I'm sure it translates worldwide.This is what made it impossible for me to put the book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Replaces some VHS tapes you might already have","review":"At first, I thought this was a lot of repetition from the Golden Greats DVD since many of the skits seemed familiar. However, four VHS tapes of a different collection I have are in this DVD, so I will free up shelf space with this collection. There are a lot of skits on this DVD, many of them very short. This is classic Benny Hill, and a good addition to the collection for Benny Hill fans. If you are a Benny Hill fan, you will want this DVD; if not then it won't matter. This DVD may not contain the best of Benny Hill, but it does contain a lot of Benny Hill."},{"rating":"1","title":"hard core madonna fans only","review":"if you have the soundtrack to Evita, then you have this CD.

Sean Pennstars As a cop who feels the burnout from undercover policework inflatrating an irish mob returns after ten years and findshimself in over his head becoming what he fears most a IrishGangster. Top Notch cast features Penn's wife Robin WrightEd Harris and Gary Oldman who almost steels the show as a drukensuicidel Gangster with a vicsious meansteak... A great film with a lot of strong versatile actors portraying their roles with the utmost of profinceny. I Beleive this film is more appreciated now that the people involved in this production have gone on to do bigger and better films."},{"rating":"1","title":"kind of terrible","review":"I cannot beleive how well received this movie was! Sean Penn's character was rediculous. I beleive Ed Harris was poorly cast for this movie- I didn't buy his character for a minute. This movie had so much potential but fell short. The ending - again rediculous. The writers had much they could have done with this movie - espeically considering how long it was. I think they took a second look at it realized it didn't have to suck -and came up with The Departed."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't like it","review":"Without revealing anything about the movie, I did not like it because it was unrealistic, especially the Gary Oldman character.These are gangsters that do anything in broad daylight, without any planning, without any regards to getting caught?! Undercover officers that reveal their identity?! PLEASE!The movie was of quality simply because of the strength of the big name actors but the acting, story, editing (the parade montage was annoying) special effects (the shootings weer overdramatic) and very wooden charactors were not indicative of a superior film.This film is grossly overrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD that doesnt play on DVD player","review":"Ordered DVD.

Ed Harris plays his character's chilling lack of emotion and sentimentality so well it'll freeze your dvd player. Gary Oldman is endearing even when he's pummeling some poor sod with a beer mug and his alcoholic fog may be a little too believable. You can see why this movie gave birth to Sean Penn and Robin Wright's on-again/off-again relationship, they are phenomenal. You can actually feel Penn struggle with who he was and who he becomes. The supporting cast -John C. Reilly, Burgess Meredith, John Tururro- could be the marquee lineup of any other film and Meredith's poor, lonely, old man will tear your heart out in the ten minutes he's on screen.This film is a must-own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"This is a good flick, although it may seem slightly aged since all the others in the genre have beaten the genre to death (Kill Bill breathed a breath of fresh air into it).

In fact, I had never even heard of it until I saw it on IFC in 2008, 18 years after it was released!This movie also has a lot of similarities with The Departed. I am surprised few have noted the similarities:*The Irish Mob.*The demented Irish Mob \\"Godfather,\\" played by Ed Harris.*The undercover cop who was affiliated with the gang, left, became an officer, went undercover, and then returned.*The love interest with a person close to the undercover officer's friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good Sean Penn film","review":"This is an intresting movie about an undercover cop trying to bring down the Irish mob which consists of some of his long time buddies.

But if you're looking for a high quality airsoft gun with good accuracy and fps, then get something else. First of all I should point out that in the product description it says the gun includes a tripod, but it's actually a bipod. However, this is clearly visible in the product picture so I figured it was just an error. The laser and flashlight work well, and the batteries are included. Some tedious assembly is required, but it shouldn't take you more than 15 minutes. The scope is not real (it's just for looks), but you have the option of replacing it with the standard M16 sight, which is also included in the package. The entire weapon is made of plastic, and shoots about as good as you would expect from a cheap $40 gun.Overall, this is a great display model and the accessories work good, but I take one star off because of the mediocre quality of the gun itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad","review":"i hade a airsoft war and the gun fell apart the stock broke the barol came off and and the clip holds 10 BB\`s. it taks a long time to load the gun over all sucks and the laser does not work unless you know how to fix it but it breaks after a few ueses and the tripode broke when i tried to use it while in a war and it was my 1st war ever and i was only 11 when i hade the war."},{"rating":"1","title":"problems with quality","review":"There is a defect on this product at the 23-24 min on the disc at the 30-29 score in the 1st half.

I have other Battery Backup UPS's from other makers and they are all over 3 years old and not a single one has failed.This is obviously a faulty part installed at the factory and it seems they are still pumping them out.

I've been searching for days for someone who has an RBC32 (battery required by this unit) - and no one seems able to obtain one in less than 90 days. The CDW operator told me they have hundreds of these things on back-order and that APC is unable to provide them - without at least a 90 day wait. In fairness I have to say that the unit worked reliably until this point - I just think you need to be very careful about using a unit that's popular enough that replacement batteries will still be available when yours wears out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed.....","review":"Well after having a 900va (BR900) for a few years (on this particular PC), i bought this one to replace it as it complained about the battery age and wouldn't pass the self test.Hooked this one up on FRIDAY, and it is now SUNDAY morning and this thing is beeping twice every 2-3 seconds.

On a recent brown out, I found this completely dropped power instantly, telling me the battery must be completely dead. Of course, there's a battery indicator that SHOULD have alerted me to this so I could change the battery. The bigger issue is now it randomly drops power. I thought it was a problem with my PCs, but this morning I noticed both PCs and the cable modem were all powered off simultaneously. All 3 devices are plugged into this unit. Needless to say, I'm extremely disappointed. I work in the IT field and my computers are rather expensive, which is why I chose to protect them on a UPS.

I've heard many a soul singers before and none of them have to force their adlibs. It is just natural. But alot of people who are amazed by Joss Stone are probably not used to listening to real soul music so they would not know the difference. By the way, Joss does not have much of a vocal range.

You definitely fall in love with it and never get bored since the tempos and moods vary, really showing her versatility.She sounds like she's been doing this for years!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Real, Fresh, & Talent !!!!","review":"I was just taken back!!! This 17 year old is just a breath of fresh air, on her sounds and lyrics. She has heart!!! I throughly enjoyed her tremendously. It's not nasty, or overly thick on the sexuality (just enough). No profanity or dissin of no other races. I'm just surprised that their is still someone out there that can make good music!! She is Hot!!! Keep going Joss."},{"rating":"1","title":"HYPE","review":"To mention Joss Stone in the same breath as any number of female soul singers or even Teena Marie or Lisa Stansfield is a joke and an insult. This girl is no more soulful than any singer on American Idol. She does have a gimmick that can sell though cause she sounds black, is 17, and singing something other than teen pop.That said her voice isn't embarrasing but it isn't great either and her songwriting is mediocre. She does get points for using real musicians and bonafide background singers but other than that she's no better vocalist than say, Kelly Clarkson on a good day.Hype for its own sake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something missing....","review":"Joss Stone has an amazing voice and talent.The Soul Sessions was her \\"debut\\" and now she realeased her second album,but her first album of her own material.What's missing is more fast songs than slow songs.Here's how I rate each track:1.Right To Be Wrong-4/52.Jet Lag-5/5-My second favorite track.3.You Had Me-10/5-My favorite track on the album.4.Spoiled-3/55.Don't Cha Wanna Ride?-5/56.Less Is More-4.5/57.Security-2/5-Worst track on the album.8.Young At Heart-2.5/59.Snakes And Ladders-4.5/510.Understand-4/511.Don't Know How-3.5/512.Torn And Tattered-3/513.Killing time-2.5/514.Sleep Like A Child-3/5Overall,not the best album,but if you like Pop and Rock,then this C.D. is for you!If you also like pop and rock,go get Ashlee Simpson's Autobiography.Bye!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Highly over-rated. A soul singer, I guess. Since Mary J. Blige is the \\"Queen of Hip Hop Soul\\" I guess she can be in today's terms. Neither of these women, have voices that I would ever pay to hear live. However, I will give it to Mary, she does pick more interesting music, and has some mighty catchy beats, stuff I can groove to on the dance floor. Ms. Joss Stone, is just boring and flat all the way around. Maybe she get some lessons from Angie Stone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everything I Know About Life I Learned on Oprah","review":"Four little words tell me all I need to know about this album - \\"As Seen On Oprah.\\" That's short for saying, \\"Help! We need people to buy this album, but its really not that good. But Oprah hocked it - will you buy it now?!?\\"Joss Stone (that is one lame fake name by the way) is another confused white person who thinks she's black. Some of the tracks on this thing sound like Al Green - if Al Green were a 17 year old Twiggy look-alike from the UK. All of it sounds like recycled disco/funk/soul/R&B; from the 70's bin of a used record store - except with said Twiggy look-alike singing over the tracks trying really hard to sound like she's black. Ugh - spare me.If I want to hear some soul, I'll throw on some JB or Aretha - why waste your time listening to somebody TRYING to sound like they've got soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Chick is really over rated","review":"I really do not like it. Worst then Norah Kones who has a better voice. Joss sounds like Anastasia eating a whale.She really has no voice all the songs sound the same they are all this boring 70's soul stuff. I really do not like this stuff she is not a real talent it is just B.S. because everyone sais Ashanti sucks which she does. Not for my ears"},{"rating":"1","title":"A total rip-off","review":"I don't care how pretty she is, Joss Stone rips off \\"Am I The Same Girl\\" by Hugh Masakela and calls it \\"art\\". Is there no end to this casual theft of classic songs by a bereft and talentless breed of hip-hop idiots? Jeez, give me a break!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Give it up already!!!!!!!","review":"How much longer do we have to continue having Joss Stone being shoved down our throats? I saw her Gap commercial the other day and I must say that it was unbearable to listen to. She is known as a soul singer, but where is the soul? She was trying so hard to sound soulful, but it just wasn't happening. I wish that the corporate big heads who are marketing this lady would realize that the people as a whole are not quite feeling Joss Stone. All of this great media and marketing push and she still has not gone platinum. If she were a black artist, first of all a black artist would not have all of this corporate backing. But hypothetically, if a black artist had all of this type of corporate support,failed to bring in the goods, the sells after two albums, they would have been dropped along time ago. But no!!! Ms. Stone continues to be supported because she's white, attractive and the white coporate powers want Joss to be the next Queen of Soul. This is so sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Hype","review":"These days it seems like it doesn't take much to impress people. Joss Stone is another overrated \\"artist\\" in the music business who has done little to convince me otherwise since the release of her first album. It is not that she can't sing at all, she could very well hold her own in the shower or humming along in the car. Her voice does not have the presence of an Aretha, Billy, or Joni; among others. I can hear little bits of potential but overall it gets lost in the music. Too breathy, too forced. I know an album is bad when I can't hear any difference between songs. I am bored halfway thru the first song. Even though, it doesn't matter what I say. It doesn't take much to be a sensation in this world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Please BORING","review":"I still don't get all the hype and all the 4-5 star ratings she received. She needs to learn a lot about harmony, She sings in short breaths, one tone too, very very annoying. In fact the CD is boring as hell, nothing I mean nothing stands out. Yall must be industry insiders writing all these pitiful reviews. I don't pretend to get her singing at all. This is has no SOUL at all, somebody decided to lable her SOUL LOL. It's all HYPE!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't hate Ms. Stone, I strongly dislike her...","review":"First let me say that I wish Joss Stone the best of luck with her career. I have nothing against white soul singers or pop music, so I dont base my reaction to her material on these factors. I base it on what I see and what I hear. What I hear is a over-produced young lady with a voice that makes me want to punch a wall. What I see is video production and press stinking of \\"love me/flower-power\\" corn. I'm sorry, and I may be overreacting, but if I hear her sing \\"Don't Cha Wanna Ride\\" one more time I may attempt to kill her. Okay that's a bit much but no Joss, I dont WANNA ride. That being said, everyone has a niche, and everyone has different tastes, I just can't see it.. at all...Before I end this I'd like to send a shout out to ?uestlove for attributing to her musical soundscape. Must say that really hit me in a funny way, still can't figure that one out. But I must remember the golden rule: music is a business.........."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"After seeing how many people in this space said they didn't quite like Joss' album that much or like her voice that much, I had to stick up for her and offer my support because I love her voice/sound and this album!! I fell in love w/ the first one and I think this is a great effort of original songs. My favorite song on the album is \\"Security\\" and after that I'd have to say \\"Less is More\\" and \\"Spoiled\\". I have to say that I'm kinda surprised that the second single is \\"Don'tcha wanna Ride\\" as, for me, it's not one of her strongest songs on the album -- or I guess I should say it doesn't truly show off her vocals.But overall, if you're a fan of r&b; and soul music, this is a great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool, Refreshing, and Reassured","review":"Joss' voice is cool, refreshing, and reassured. There's nothing quite like it. Her smooth vocals glide over each song with ease. She doesn't stumble along like most 17-year-old would, but instead Joss makes it look easy. Every song sounds genuine and rich. The only thing, I walk away wanting more. There never seems to be enough of Joss' music to satisfy the soul. Her first album was a treat to listen to every time I played it. But her new one is like a great dessert. To be honest, I'd be miserable without it. So if want something soulful and enchanting, then don't hesitate to purchase this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAAAZING!!","review":"I loooooooooove this album. It's definitley the best of her three. The only songs I don't care for are \\"Understand\\" and \\"Sleep Like a Child\\". The rest are amazinggggg. Esp You Had Me, Right To Be Wrong, Jet Lag, Killing Time, Snakes and Ladders, Security, and Dontcha Wanna Ride.When I heard Killing Time, I thought for sure it was a remake because it sounded like such a classic song. THen I looked it up and saw that Joss wrote it, AMAZING!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SHE'S GOT IT!","review":"I'm really feeling this album. I was very hesitant to buy it at first but I'm glad I did. Joss Stone proves she can hang with the R&B crew and produce good music. She's not just another \\"blue eye soul\\" wannabee. Overall, this is a good album and if you're into good soul music, this is it. You will not regret your purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Ciara, but...","review":"\\"Spoiled\\" is her only song that is being flushed on 95.7 R&B in my state of VA. It is sooo pretty! This is the first I have ever heard of the British 17 year old. She has a soulful voice and I don't think any other teen singer could reach that high. So, much props to homegirl for this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"So annoying...","review":"I heard Joss Stone on the Today show a couple of weeks ago and she sounded pretty good, singing You Had Me. She was so adorable and unpretentious, I figured I had to give her a try. I should have just downloaded You Had Me and saved myself the money. This CD is so boring...and so monotonously annoying, I never even made it to the hidden bonus track."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great voice, wrong music","review":"I bought this cd because I heard Joss sing on TV and was greatly impressed with her voice. I am still amazed that someone so young has such a wonderful voice. But, I felt the music was not quite right for her. It was like Etta James music on steroids."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love soul/RandB, but this is terrible.","review":"There either is something wrong with my ears or her voice just stinks. It got on my nerves the first time I heard her sing. Her imitation of a black woman's voice is poorly done and my ears will bleed if I ever have to listen to her again. I do agree that she sounds manufactured (Like Ashlee Simpson, Ryan Cabrera, etc.) because she really does n ot have any talent in her singing whatsoever."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE her!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I just love this girl!!! Her voice rocks and she's got some serious talent. Both cds are a must-have!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW WOW WOW.....good Job J.S","review":"I must say this cd is really really good. Her first cd \\"Soul sessions\\" was aiight but this one is probably the best pure soul cd have bought in years. For all the Soul Brothers and Sisters, this is definitely a must have. I wasn't feelin her first single \\"you had me\\" cus it sounded alittle pop to me but after listening to her whole whole CD on AOL...I had to rush out today to get this incredible cd.My favorite songs on here so far areSpoiled( first heard this song on an urban radio before the cd came out and it blew me away....best song on the cd)Jet lag, dont cha wanna ride, less is more( got a root rock reggae feel), security, young at heart, killin Time. Ok now i've got to go and listen some more....might have more favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mind, Body and alot of Soul!","review":"Wow! is the only word i can react with. She is such a phenomenal singer/songwriter. I am impressed with the level of work Ms.stone has produced on her sophmore album. This album surpasses the soul sessions because it is all original material and we get to see the real Joss Stone. The highlights of this album are: Right to be wrong(great soul song)Spoiled,YOu had me,less is more,killing time,Security(my favorite),Sleep like a child,torn and tattered and snakes and ladders. I dont hav eto skim with this album. She sounds like a mixture of Aretha and JAnis misxed together. Well done job Joss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album","review":"This is a good cd. Wasn't expecting this, much less from a 17yr old. This girl would go to places if she puts out good music like this. Watch out for these singles Spoiled, less is more, Jet Lag and killing time"},{"rating":"2","title":"Album of The Year","review":"After endless craps we hear on TV these days, comes this soulful record that reminds us on good ole days, when music is something that people sung to and related to emotionally. Ms. Stone showed us that you don't need to have 'bling' or hoes in bikinis in order to sell records. What you need is just one good soulful voice and good music, the rest is history...\\"Mind,Body & Soul\\" is an album where music is supposed to be and particularly Soul R&B; supposed to sound. Two thumbs up to Ms. Stone and the whole of her production crew."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joss Stone Mind, Body & Soul CD","review":"I'm very happy with my new Joss Stone cd.

Couple of days afterwards I purchased it, and it turned to be one of my favorite cd, and I bought it becasiue od one song. I love the beats in all of her songs and her amazing voice.This cd will make you happy and energized but yet calm no matter what mood you are in."},{"rating":"2","title":"This girl is so soulful","review":"Joss Stone is one of the most soulful young singers we've got in this era. She is absolutely amazing and appears to feel what she sings. In truth, I'd only heard of her through my children until one day I was \\"youtube'ing\\" Janis Joplin. I'd run across her and Melissa Etherage's tribute and instantly fell in love with her voice. I truly dont think that if you were to get this cd, or any of her cd's, you'd be disappointed. I've ordered and loved them all. Hope this review helps you in your decision to purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, but not there yet","review":"Yes, Joss Stone has a warm, deep voice that is very reminiscent of a some of the older blues singers. The problem I have with that voice is though that it does have a tendency to get on my nerves after a while. Her timbre is always the same, no matter if she is supposed to sound happy, sad, angry or mellow. Sure, she is young and might grow into a really great singer with more experience and maturity. She is not quite there as of yet, though. The same holds strue for her songwriting, which at the moment leads to pretty mediocre fare. Hopefully her record company will give her the chance to blossom. In the meantime I will stick to my old soul records."},{"rating":"1","title":"MIND, BODY & SOUL","review":"JOSS STONE IS A GREAT SINGER, BUT THIS CD EVERY SONG SOUNDS THE SAME.

In order to listen to this CD the same way I listen to all my other CDs (every single one purchased by me, BTW) I'd have to pay for it THREE TIMES over -- once for the house, once for the car, and once (downloaded from a legal site) for my mp3 player.

And when I finally do, it feels like taking a cold shower without warning! Produced by the Russian Cinema Counsil, and distributed by Ruscico/Image, this DVD is a visual mess. Originally filmed in 70mm, this ought to look absolutely splendid; instead, the print (or negative?) used for transfer displays dreadfully washed out colors, lousy contrasts, and looks so soft that it almost made my eyes hurt. Was this really the best source material that could be found in the vaults? I do not think so! Old Soviet archives were famous for taking good care of their cultural heritage (provided, of course, that the artists involved did not do something politically or morally \\"incorrect\\"), and this film appealed to the powers in the Kremlin as splendid export material.

The key is not to stretch the tape, if you do then it will pull off after a little bit. It stuck really well through a heavy rain storm right after application.

I got one for my arachnaphobe step-daughter and she says it rocks. My only complaint is that they are drop-shipped sometimes with a battery and sometimes not..so you have to be sure to have a 9-volt battery handy. Also, some bugs with \\"stickier\\" feet can resist the suction which is, necessarily, rather gentle so as not to tear the critters apart on capture. It's a great little invention!

If I could find it locally I wouldn't have ordered it from this company. They first sent the wrong product--courteously told me to keep the error and they would send the BugBuster. They did but the power supply wire from battery to motor is broken in two places sufficiently to break the contact if the wire is bent.

I tried using them to turn a simple valve and the top half just mashed down over the flimsy channels. These are the grooves in the pliers to allow you to adjust the width of the grab, but they are far too shallow for the amount of play in the handles. Unfortunately there is no way to try and fix them or tighten them up. I was able to turn the valve using another set of pliers rather easily so it was not that I was asking too much of that particular tool. Now I have a roll up tool set missing a pair of pliers, I would not recommend these if you intend to use the channel lock pair for anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not High Quality","review":"I was expecting a bit better quality based on the reviews I read. However, once I received the package and inspected the pliers I decidedly immediately to return.

For those who have not heard the Motown discs issued by the Singing Machine company, let me tell you that they feature the original performances (both music and vocals) remixed twice for each song, once with the instruments to the left channel and lead vocals isolated in the right and once with new stereo instrumental mixes. They are GREAT!This 2-disc set, however, features only rerecordings of these hits from the 80's -- the kind of stuff you usually hear in karaoke bars. It isn't that these renditions are terrible, they just aren't what I expected given the other releases in this company's catalog.If you don't mind singing karaoke to recreations of the original hits, then you might like this compilation. If you're looking for an interesting plunge into the original multitracks for these hits, you won't find it here."},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect Souvenir of Venice","review":"For anyone who has ever traveled down the Grand Canal on the Vapporetto #1 or #82 this will bring back a world of memories.

It even helped in locating non existing places like the Palazzo that collapsed in the film Casino Royal (It was superimposed over a recess in the buildings near the Ca DaMosto)It is a great reference before and after a trip to Venice, and the photographs of the buildings are better than any you could take on your own.

It comes with all the cables for hook up to a regular TV, as well as a 12V auto cord, wall charger/110V adapter, earbuds, and the remote. Don't lose the remote.

The battery would not hold a charge, and some online reviews suggested this is a common problem. Unfortunately it didn't come with a car adapter, so I had to buy one from the company for $23. The disc cover is pretty flimsy and has already broken, although it does still play. If your DVD's are in less than pristine condition, you will likely run into playback problems. That said, the playback quality is actually pretty decent, so if you're looking for a lower=priced player, it's okay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this - Buy something else","review":"After playing it maybe 5 times, the screen went out and all you get now is sound.

This book is the first one I have found that has helped me make sense of this experience. My mother's cancer was not openly discussed in our family and we did not talk about my mother much after she died. But her death made a huge impact on my family;we were kind of lost without her. And for most of my life I have not talked very much about this. But reading this book and seeing the experiences of the people Davidman interviewed, helped me see how common our family's experiences were. It was helpful to learn about how society and the mother's role in it, and the American taboo on death, shaped our very personal, painful experiences of loss. I recommend this book to anyone who has lost a mother at any age. I'm sure you will find comfort in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An important contribution to the sociology of loss","review":"Lynn Davidman's book provides a sensitive and nuanced account of how mother loss reverberates throughout the course of people's lives in complex ways. As a fellow sociologist, I was touched by and learned from her deep and compassionate empathy for her subjects. She carefully and thoughtfully listened to their stories, and presents her analysis in a strikingly original way that honored the integrity of the narratives. This book helped me think about loss, identity, narrative and the art of sociological writing in new ways. I also know that her work has helped many individuals to make better sense of their own experiences of mother loss, something that few sociology books can claim."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misguided","review":"This book tries to make the case that America has strong policial parties.

They cover topics in notrump play (count your winners), trump play (count your losers and when to and when not to pull trump) and introduce the finesse. The book is targeted towards beginners, and does a very good job. It includes quizzes on how to play out hands.

Steven Gaffney presents his advice and opinions in simple terms, accompanied by personal anecdotes to illustrate particular issues. While he does throw in a few non-attributed statistics in the early pages, the overall work is his individual view of how to implement an honesty-is-the-best-policy style. There is nothing disagreeable, certainly, but not much substance. The most useful part of the book is the recommended reading appendix. Gaffney briefly touches almost all the areas of the cited books in less than 100 pages; go to those sources for more thorough and grounded insights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just went to the seminar!","review":"The company I work for paid for our entire division to attend his seminar.

The chapter on Columbo should be required reading for anyone interested in succeeding in corporate America. Using Mr. Gaffney's easy to understand strategy I was able to obtain a position in my company that I was woefully underqualified for. As an added bonus I have been able to parlay Gaffney's \\"Authentic Communication Strategies\\" into a very active sex-life.

Hello! Our family values and ideas about family have changed since then, but that is not addressed in this volume.

While this music is great for listening, it leaves a lot to be desired for dancing. Most important, these are not quicksteps, just fox trots played a little faster (the speeds are correct for quickstep). However, they lack the drive and pep necessary for a good quickstep. The arrangements are weak; the sound recording quality varies from acceptable to terrible; and the orchestra sounds like a 1920s dance band. There are two bands that are danceable: Chicago and Medely (which is over six minutes long - a marathon of quickstep dancing). Again, fun listening, not great for dancing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Go Wrong on This One","review":"I have always been a fan of Smokey! Anything he touches is golden.

They are very detailed, which makes it fun to color.I'd recommend this book for children in middle school and up, and adults who enjoy coloring as a relaxing creative outlet.

There's a lot of nonsense out there regarding 2012 but this documentary finally provides the straight story of who we really are and where humanity and planet Earth may be headed in the future. No doomsday predictions and no promises of a bright future either because it all hangs in the balance right now with what we, as a species, collectively do about the situation in which we find ourselves.

This box is held together by paper tape which doubles as the design and display of the box, but where the edges of the box come together, it's very easy to rip it apart. When I received the box I was already able to wiggle the wall of the box and see that if I were to press hard enough, tear the paper tape and disassemble it. (I included a picture)All-in-all this show is great and just be aware that this box is not a toy and is only for display.

I was inspired after taking one of Amira's classes at Broadway Dance Center in NYC and decided to buy a few of her DVD's. The workout is hard! Belly dancing isn't easy! This DVD promises a total feminine body workout and delivers just that, it's amazing. It makes you feel sexy and beautiful while burning excess inches off your body. It really strengthens your core, legs, back, butt and arms while keeping your body curvy and giving you a more distinct hourglass shape. Amira has an essence about her which keeps the workout fun and enjoyable. Definitely worth a try. =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice scholarly take on Virginia's courthouses","review":"As a professional architectural photographer who specializes in state capitols and county courthouses, I have collected a number of books within this niche. Virginia's Historic Courthouses has proven to be a valuable member of my collection. Peters and Peters have done an excellent job researching the histories of these buildings, quite a few of which predate the United States. They have taken more of a scholarly angle on these buildings than is normally found in similar books, yet the text remains interesting and quite readable. The photos taken by John Peters are quite nice as well, and I do wish that a bit more space had been devoted to these images, as they are often smaller than one would prefer. The book is a bit more difficult to navigate than the typical state-specific courthouse book if one is seeking county-specific information, but this is just a minor inconvenience."},{"rating":"2","title":"solid cd","review":"this cd has some good songs from some good people, like third eye blind and barenaked ladies.

If you enjoy Shogun you will probably enjoy this as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"For pity's sake don't","review":"Any fans of samurai films, Sonny Chiba and Toshiro Mifune, do yourself a favour and stay away from this ignorant, stupid film. The hamminess of the American actors, the portrayal of Americans as big lumbering stupid clods and Japanese as just crazy....this film is infuriatingly bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheeseball is being kind","review":"This hackneyed excuse for a samurai film is an example of great actors (excluding Frank Converse) needing work. The action sequences are laughable and if you may not have noticed, this is an Arthur Rankin/Jules Bass production, famed American cartoon producers, Frosty the Snowman being one of their most well-known works. Someone should have told them to \\"thumpity, thump, thump\\" back to Saturday morning fare. This one reeks about as much as the scene where the sailors refuse to take baths. Shogun may have been melodramatic, but there isn't an ounce of drama used here. Buy this one at your own risk. Only thing of value is the plastic box it came in. You can use it for another DVD and the DVD as a frisbee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Samurai Film Ever","review":"I am a big fan of samurai films and Japanese cinema. Toshiro Mifune is my favorite actor. I own about sixty or so samurai and/or mifune movies. With that said, I purchased Bushido Blade in hopes that it would be tolerable. I was sadly mistaken. Don't let your curiousity get the better of you and your money. The plot is missing, the acting is terrible (except for Mifune, who speaks English in this film without understanding the language, yet he is dubbed anyway), and the quality is unbearable. In one part, a US naval officer beats a samurai in a sword fight. Give me a break!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality Recording","review":"My complaints are not with the film itself but with the quality of the VHS recording. I ordered this tape brand new and paid full price, but the cassette I received was clearly used and recorded over.

It's annoying to the point where the tape is unwatchable.Save your money and don't buy this tape."},{"rating":"1","title":"Samurai vs Yankee?","review":"In support of the previous reviewer's comments, those writers who sneer at the very idea that a western sabreur could triumph over a Samurai are being sadly and deludedly unpatriotic (not a quality usually associated with Americans, let it be said).In fact, there are a number of accounts dating from this period of Samurai being embarrassed by the skill of western opponents - and some of these are Japanese accounts. One may speculate that it was simple culture-shock, but it remains true all the same.As for the film, it's no great shakes, but the fight is credited to a Japanese fight director, and if this is the case he deserves brownie points for a decent bit of difficult choreography."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bushido Blade","review":"This is the single most entertaining and moving film I can recall seeing in recent years. This film was unbelievably pathetic on so many levels, ie: historical accuracy, writing, acting, plot, theme,etc., I can't begin to comment. It was entertaining in the sense we were throwing things at OUR screen while correcting all the inaccuracies, poor writing and just plain bad acting. I was moved through a variety of emotions while watching this film, including, anger, disgust, nausea, and shock. No mortal is perfect and we all have to eat but how they EVER got the great Toshiro Mifune involved in this film (and role) has to be the ultimate cinematic mystery of our time. My words may sound \\"..spiteful..\\" but they are as true and accurate as I can make them about this embarrassment of an American film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original Black Sabbath","review":"Excellent reference for guitar chords, lead and bass tab for Black Sabbath.

I ordered four sets and found something wrong in each of the sets. The defects ranged from small bubbles, black dots, unfinished spots, small chips, wavy/warped edges and very rough bottoms (problem for stacking). If you want to use these for every day, these probably won't be the dishes for you. The other problem is that I discovered Churchill China sold off this division of Jeff Banks Ports of Call recently and so if you needed replacement from the company it would almost be impossible. I tried to contact them to discuss the quality with them and their website in England doesn't allow that type of contact. Amazon was helpful but the contact they had for the warehouse in the US wasn't the correct location either.

I knew with my large rough-and-tumble family that these dishes would never hold up at my house so sadly, I sent them all back. Amazon was very gracious and gave me free return shipping and promised to completely refund my money.

However, the acting is generally better.You'll find the usual (for Hong Kong) bad mix of comedy and gangsterism (with surprisingly little gunplay). A very diffuse plot going off on all directions. Unsympathetic characters. And cheap locale shots (I didn't feel the urge to visit Okinawa after this).I rented this to see if Faye Wong could really act without Wong Kar Wai around. I'm convinced now. She's a natural -- tho she doesn't match the depth that Leslie Cheung offers. And it was a huge surprise to hear her speak a line of English near the beginning. I knew she lived in NYC for a short while, but I wasn't expecting it to be so good. She actually makes American English sound quite pretty.

She also appeared in his2046)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this movie","review":"Sure its campy but some of the scenes were priceless.

The conclusion seems cut off and unfinished (not in a good In The Woods way but in the lazy way)- like the author knew the how but no the why of her crime. The big issue is with the main character. There is just no \\"there\\" there. I got about 2/3 of the way through before I figured out she was supposed to be \\"almost 30\\". REALLY? She reads like middle aged conservative DAR member.

Anyway, enough with the film, let's talk about the DVD.One of the coolest things about this DVD is when they talk to the cast of the film like 15 years later to see how the film has affected them or how the film has reached cult status. A lot of cool info. of the behind-the-scenes of the making of this film.It does have an alternate ending but it's from the first woman who played the main character and was later released.Anyway, it's one of those surf films to keep and just have fun watching and showing other people."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I Only rate movies one way.....\\"","review":"\\"I Only rate movies one way.....the right way.\\"This movie rocks!.

The newer version with the slanted shoot for dispensing the food is great. We have a cat who needs to be on controlled version of food. This feeder allows us to feed our cat twice a day and in a controlled amount. In addition, the new design prevents our cat from stealing foodfrom the shoot. The feeder is so wonderful, I bought one for our neighbor as a gift. The cat loves the feeder and knows when it is supposed to dispense food. I would highly recommend this product. Also, our delivery from Amazon was quick and timely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make sure you clean and oil it!","review":"I loved this pet feeder (I bought the medium size) until it stopped working after using it only 2 months. The company troubleshooted with us and we found food crunched up and jammed around the auger. We had to clean it and oil it as recommended. It never worked the same after that and within 3 weeks, the auger and twistie thing no longer turned. I have contacted the company, and they've agreed to send me a new one. I will try to avoid this from happening again by cleaning around the auger every week, and I recommend the same advice to all who have one or purchase one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works ok, but not for long. Very unreliable!","review":"I bought the feeder and waterer as a set. The water bottle leaks at a glued seam at the top, which empties the water bottle. I'm on my third water bottle in six months,and now my second pump for this waterer is dead. All of the water bottles had the same failure.The feeder worked OK but now is also dead after six months. I really tried to keep these things going since they were nice when working, but I'm giving up. This feeder and waterer cost a lot of money to be so unreliable. I expected more that a problem ridden 6 months. I would not recommend buying this brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product / needs better instructions","review":"This is a heavy duty, well designed product. My small cat loves it. I love it. Now it doesn't have to bug me for food, and I can watch her weight. I have a couple of gripes.1. The manual refered me to a needed timer programming page, which didn't exist. I guess that part of the manual was missing. They had the full manual with all instructions on an included CDROM, but I wouldn't have known if I didn't look. And nothing tells you how to look.2. The top is difficult to remove and put back on, I guess this is good so your animal can't remove it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not reliable after only 6 weeks of use.","review":"I just came home tonight and I noticed only 2 Tablespoons of food in the Dog's tray.Normally the machine dispenses for 2 minutes, or about 2 cups of dog food.

The warranty is only for 90 days and this should have been a clue to me prior to purchasing a $140 piece of plastic.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flawed, cat can get kibble out continuously","review":"The problem with this product is that a smart and motivated cat (such as ours, apparently) can stick its paw up the delivery chute and wiggle the auger, causing a slow but endless trickle of kibble. We tried larger cat kibble, to no avail. If the auger was longer or a tighter fit in the passage, or there was less wiggle room in the mechanism, that might help. Once we noticed that the cat was feeding at all hours and not just when the feeder was scheduled to deliver kibble, I tried wiggling my finger inside the delivery chute and sure enough, a few bits of kibble were released with each wiggle, and this goes on indefinitely. This product might work for a cat that is less obsessed with food than ours, but it is annoying that at this price the mechanics can be by-passed by a cat's paw."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped Working After 5 Months","review":"Worked great for the first 5 months then stopped working and could never get it going again.

However, both the unit and timer broke after two years. The unit would and would not drop food. Never good figure out why. One day it would work fine, the next day it wouldn't. We bought a new unit and used the old timer since it was already programmed. Unfortunately, the old timer didn't last too long after that. We found out after a power outage that the internal battery in the timer would not hold a charge. Our cat was real angry about these problems. Hopefully, the new unit will hold up better.Dan"},{"rating":"1","title":"BAd Quality/Not Dependable","review":"My first feeder arrived broken. The auger was detached from the motor. But construction did not impress me. Cost was the factor in my choice of this feeder. The second one jammed frequently (obvious poor design). Then, probably because of jamming, the auger detached from the motor on that one, too. It is not possible for the owner to fix this. Much too expensive for the lack of dependability. I travel frequently and the feeder provides a way to avoid the cost of a pet sitter. Definitely will try something different - probably more expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of JUNK","review":"I have bought 4 Ergo Pet Feeders for my dogs (2). Everyone single one of them broke. The feeders do not feed equal amounts of food. The auger breaks, the welding is poor, it breaks as well.

They only want you to spend more money."},{"rating":"2","title":"no complaints","review":"I have had no problems with this feeder. I have had it for at least 2 years, if not more. The first timer didn't work and I got another one sent to me right away. Since then, it has been wonderful. It has worked with no problems for the full two years. My cat does like to grab little pieces of food by reaching into it. But honestly, she only gets one piece at a time. I don't think this can possibly keep her from her diet by THAT much. The fact that it doesn't rely on batteries is great. If the power goes out, there is something in it that keeps it going that I've never had to change.I just wish it were a little less expensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"couldn't live with out it","review":"You can find the new updated users manual on \\"ergo systems\\" website. The instructions are now so easy my 11 year old has been able to set the timer program.We have a medium size feeder, it set for a very active 16 pound cat: 8 feedings of 28 seconds each (frequent feedings; like cats in the wild).And who cares if by pawing at the feeder tube, the animal obtains a few extra morsels in the 1st feeding period, when the machine is first turned on???. Only when the auger is empty of food - such as \\"running out of food\\" is there ever a reoccurrence of this problem. No loving, caring, responsible pet owner, would ever allow this to happen to their pet.The one problem we have encountered: The feeder needs to be given a firm shake occasionally to prevent the formation of a \\"vortex\\" within the catfood, created by the auger removing feed from the center of the container only, sort of a funnel effect. hence the 4 out of 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"I bought this to feed my 3 cats.

I will agree that learning how to program it is a bit confusing. I'm not sure why they couldn't come up with a more user friendly experience there. But once it is programmed, it works great! I like the size too - not too large, but not too small. I use it to auto feed dry food to my three cats. They get two moist meals a day, but this supplements that in between while we are at work or asleep. I also plan to reprogram it for more frequency when we are out of town."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Unreliable","review":"Terrible product and terrible customer support.

I was forced to return the item to Ergo systems vs. the company I bought it from. To do this, I had to get an address and RMA # from a person who barely spoke English at Ergo systems. To make matters worse, the tech expressed disbelief that the item was broken, implying that I was trying to scam them. In the end, I had to pay for shipping both ways and find a neighbor to care for my pet during my trip. Even if the item did work, I'm not sure it's worth the money.

Secret is in programming it to the schedule you want. Written instructions are a bit brief, but adequate to get going. The included cd is very comprehensive and walks you through all the options.

Also, no more over feeding or trying to remember when he was fed last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for any cat with some smarts","review":"I thought this was the perfect solution to my irregular hours and thus cat feeding times, and when I first got it, it seemed to be perfect. However, it only took my cat a couple of days to figure out how to manipulate the lever that lets the food out so it would drop whenever she felt like a snack, or more. I tried different types of food, to no avail, and finally gave the feeder to my Mom who's cat isn't quite as astute or agile. Her cat is doing fine with it, and my cat is doing fine with a covered dish-type auto feeder that cost 1/3 as much!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Complicated, overpriced, and prone to breakdown","review":"I bought this feeder about a year ago. It feels sturdy and heavy, so I thought it was well constructed. But the control mechanism for it is pointlessly complicated. You have to press some couple of dozen poorly-labeled buttons to set impossibly precise timing controls. I know that I need to feed my cats a third of a cup. How am I supposed to how many seconds of being \\"on\\" that equates to? Why should I be asked to know?I figured this was the worst of it, but as of just now it's stopped working. I can verify that the control mechanism is working fine, but something inside the feeder itself is now broken. And it has been engineered with tamper proof screws, so I can't even get inside to try and debug the thing myself. It's less than a year old, and a breakdown this quickly is just unacceptable.Between the pointlessly complicated timer, annoyingly inaccessible engineering, and high price tag, I do not suggest this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth The Money","review":"For the first 4 months this feeder worked very well. Then it jammed and overfed our cats causing the motor to heat up and after that the product never worked correctly again. We had the timer piece replaced twice due to malfunction. Our auger dispenser broke due to the jam of the overfeed and the cats learned how to get their paws up in the auger and free feed themselves at all times. The bad news is that sadly this unit is not worth the money. The good news is that Ergo Customer Service worked with us to fully replace a whole new unit and two timer units."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money","review":"I bought this based on the favorable reviews on amazon and was disappointed to find that when you read the operations manual, this feeder only accepts a certain shape (round)and diameter of food.

It's not worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"We have a cat who quickly learned how to access food in other pet feeders, so this one is perfect.

They were highly helpful, as usual, and immediately sent out a new one.The second one:The hopper jammed, then some \\"internal\\" component broke.I gave up and tossed the thing. Bought myself the Petmate feeder ($60 cheaper!) and have been using it successfully without a hitch for over a year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Many improvements over our older model","review":"We had a 9 year old model of the same feeder and wanted to upgrade primarily because of the shoot that doesn't allow our cat to pick the food out of the opening. Other improvements include 1) a more rounded bottom to the bowl, the older model had a sharp angle making it difficult for our cat to get food out of the angle formed by the bottom and side of the bowl. 2) Screw on lid 3) more granular timer - now supports seconds instead of just minutes allowing us to feed smaller portions more times a day. 3) timer has an outlet on it allowing you to string together another device such as a water fountain. Only complaint is it is still cumbersome to take apart to clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album!","review":"I bought this album in vinyl when it was originally released, replaced it by a CD and still love it every time I listen to it.

Squire's singing sucks and his sappy \\"new age\\" love lyrics are even worse. The only way this record could've worked would've been as an all-instrumental record a la \\"One of a Kind.\\" It holds little interest outside of the bass playing and drumming, though you can't program only the instrumental sections because it's all one big goddamn \\"composition.\\" Save your money. Any of the Squire/Bruford Yes records or Bruford's solo albums are much better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as Yes's best efforts","review":"I got this CD when it was first released. Since then I have played it at least 100 times. Why? Because I love it! It is at least as good as my favorite YES albums; Fragile being my favorite YES album.

From all of them Squire's (along with Anderson's) really stands out.Even as sound and music has evolved it still sounds good (or even better, if you compare to the quality of some of the music that's out)So having a release of Fish out of water, enhanced it's really great.Great music, great sound and insightful inteview with Chris Squire as a bonus what else can you ask? probably an enhanced Olias of Sunhilow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who ever said a bass player couldn't put out an excellent CD","review":"I've been a Chris Squire fan for over 25 years and was very happy to be able to find Fish out of Water on CD, as I have worn out the LP decades ago. Its more mellow than most Yes stuff, but to me it's the best buy around. You won't be disappointed with anything on this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Talented Bassist in Rock Music?","review":"Just listen to this album to see what I mean.

The five tracks are just genius. \\"Silently Falling\\" and \\"Lucky Seven\\" show the best moment of Bill Brufford at the drums. If this would be a Yes Album, it would be between the classics, like \\"Relayer\\" and \\"Close To The Edge\\"; but Chris wanted it to be done alone, with a little help from Mel, Patrick, Bill and Andrew. Five Stars, no more."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish Chris had done more solo stuff","review":"In 1975-1976, all five members of Yes did solo efforts, and I bought them all. (For the record, the others are \\"Elias of Sunhillow\\" by Jon Anderson, \\"Beginnings\\" by Steve Howe, \\"Ramshackle\\" by Alan White, and \\"Story of I\\" by Patrick Moraz.) When I moved to CD, the only one I bought was \\"Fish Out of Water\\". Even though I was, and am, an inveterate Yes fan, I could recognize dreck when I heard it, and most of the other solo efforts were mostly dreck. \\"Elias of Sunhillow\\" had its moments, and Moraz' keyboard playing is always interesting, but only Chris Squire produced an album of solid music.If you like good general progressive rock, give this a try. It's not the very best effort of the mid-seventies, but it's quite good, and certainly beats most of the overly-engineered stuff being put out these days, including recent stuff from Yes."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Fish\\" is better than some YES albums","review":"Definitely the best YES solo album/CD of the early years, \\"Fish Out of Water\\" will appeal to any art-rock/progressive fan. And with the inclusion of guest musicians such as Bill Bruford, Mel Collins, and Patrick Moraz, Squire takes the listener on a journey which touches on all bases of rock, jazz, and classical. This CD presents a subtlety to the somewhat bombastic YES approach, and yet, the signatures of all great YES music are displayed with superb artistic skill. I have searched for this work on CD for years, considering my old turntable is now a piece of art itself. \\"Fish Out of Water\\" is just that: The one solo YES CD that doesn't belong with all the others, yet, every YES aficionado should own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Yes solo disc yet","review":"This is probably the most satisfying of all the 'Yes' member's solos discs. It's just a combination of great songs, a great concept and a great bunch of players. Although there's a few bass solos, they are all in the context of the music and not over indulgent. In fact, this is a very musical album.I keep coming back to this album because of the great music here.

In this book, Brehony and Rothblum explore the lives of lesbian women who, for whatever reason, omit sex from their relationships. The authors' inclusion of theoretical models, personal accounts, and discussants effectively illustrates portraits of real people who make conscious decisions about their sexuality- not women who are controlled or defined by existing social constructions. The book powerfully raises philosophical questions about the nature of relationships in general- for example, what is a relationship without sex? The book calls all people to question the nature and purpose of their own sexuality. I omit one star simply for its lack of historical and statistical data. However, the book serves its purpose- recognizing and attempting to understand relationships that have previously been undiscussed."},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong size socks","review":"I ordered these socks through Amazon, as sold by National.

First of all, they barely even introduced the kids. Second, Dan was supposed to be an orphan, not an adopted kid who was overly attached to his \\"father\\" and was sent to Plumfield because the \\"father\\" was being bugged to put him in a school. Most of the movie was about a plot that wasn't even in the book!!! How awful can you get? I think someone should completely remake the movie, and actually make it at least the tiniest bit like the book! Right when the movie started, I was dissapointed, but I gave it a fair chace and watched the rest of the movie, but it was TERRIBLE!!! It was hardly recognizable as 'Little Men' except for the names...that was it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BOTHER...","review":"Louisa May Alcott would roll over in her grave were she to see the mish-mosh made of her book of the same name. This black and white film is simply a poor excuse of an adaptation, as it bears little resemblance to the book. Consequently, it falls far short of success.Though the film has some good actors in it, with Kay Smith most successful in reprising the role of Jo, the actors simply cannot overcome the third rate script with which they have to work. Quite frankly, I could not wait for the film to end and breathed a sigh of relief when it was finally over."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor excuse for a DVD!","review":"Surely a better 35mm print exists than the one used to make this DVD! This one's full of splices and scratches. To add insult to injury, the film doesn't even follow the original novel, adding characters that weren't in the novel, deleting others and introducing studio-fabricated plot devices. RKO Radio Pictures lost $214,000 on this picture, so save your hard-earned cash and don't buy this DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Waiting for Christmas to see but, was a great price","review":"This was new and arrived exactly as advertised. I am giving it as a Christmas gift for my son, who requested it. Great price!!! My rating is for the delivery and processing. I have not yet seen the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A documentary feel to the humiliating life of a Toyko hooker","review":"The movie transcends the usual hooker line by usually staying within the groundwork of sado-masochism. A story of sex, life & survival in Toyko, detailing a young girls life as a hooker. A girl with a taste for the finer things in life that can only be had by the humiliating & dangerous - yet sexy life of a high priced hooker who specializes in sado-masochism. The sex scenes are not graphic, however, they may leave the viewer with mixed feelings as they portray scenes of domination and submission. The rating of NC-17 is appropriate as it does not fall into an X rating, yet its adult content is full throughout the whole film. The viewer may be glad that their life does not approach that portrayed by the actress in Tokyo Decadence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tokyo Dullness","review":"I saw this film about seven years ago when it was touring the second string art houses. (I don't live near a first string art house.) I genuinely love foreign film and Asian film in particular. I prefer subbed to dubbed because it lets me hear the emotions directly. However this film's excellent imagery was not sufficient to overcome its dull and not particularly erotic plot. It wasn't a total waste of time, but there are better ways to spend time than watching this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big letdown if you want something hot","review":"This Japanese movie revolves around a Tokyo callgirl who, not surprisingly, keeps running into weirdos. If you are looking for something to turn you on late at night, this may not do the trick, as it doesn't really have any good scenes -- I guess the beginning scene was probably the best, followed by the S&M one with the lady in heavy makeup. If you want a good storyline, you shouldn't even be looking at this video! I wouldn't say this one sucks, it's just not very satisfying, if you know what I mean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero stars really","review":"This pointless movie is not merely non-erotic but frequently disgusting.

The author provides a first-hand account of his own primary research into the geochemistry of Pollonium radiohaloes in primordial granite bedrock, and convincingly argues his conclusion that such evidence supports the biblical viewpoint that the earth was created suddenly some few thousand years ago. Of course this flies in the face of evolutionary science, which claims a billions of years old earth, but that is his point.If you believe in the biblical creation view, read this book! If you believe the evolutionary theory, read this book. Regardless of your beliefs, you will be impressed by Dr. Gentry's thorough scientific evidence."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tiny little fatal flaw in his assertion","review":"I very much wanted to like this book. Unfortunately Gentry's basic assumptions are wrong, therefore his conclusion is wrong.... and grossly so.What Gentry calls \\"polonium halos\\" are not polonium halos: they are radon halos, constructed as the result of alpha particle cascades following inculted pathways in the rock matrix of assorted minerals. He should have known this fact, since at least one of his samples was collected at a uranium mine.Gentry has been corrected on this subject many hundreds of times after his book was published. Gentry should have had a physicist check his hypothesis first, before publishing the book. But of course Gentry is a Creationist, and the last thing a Creationist will ever do is have a scientist or two check his cherished and much hoped for beliefs.Which is a shame: Gentry is a good person. It is sad to see him making a fool of himself over such a simple and basic error."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH THE TIME OR MONEY","review":"This video was not worth taking the time to watch, let alone spend good money on.

Such notable characters as Billy the Kid and Clamity Jane are but a few of the enigmatic characters that are featured.

Writers are often known by who criticizes them the most, and if this is so than the subjects of this book should thank Millard for the compliment.There is no evangelical left. To hold to the basic tenets of evangelicalism, however loosely, is to be to the right of the spectrum. This is neither good nor bad, it is simply a statement. Evangelicals are often slandered in today's culture, and this is sad, since many of their best thinkers (Grenz and Stott, for example) are truly intelligent people. To see them eating their own in this book is frightening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooked from the beginning","review":"The first 2 sentences of this book hooked me. \\"Merton\\"Buddy\\" Hinckley wouldn't tell you the truth if you set his hair on fire.

Even though I hated the ex-girl friend and hoped she'd get iced or at least didn't care, Stone makes you care about the story. It moves fast and has interesting characters. The final \\"show-down\\" is hilarious; this should be a movie. I plan to read all the Streeter books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff!","review":"The promise that author Stone showed in The Low End of Nowhere is delivered in this second book of the series. While a key plot point is telegraphed fairly early on, the author uses this to his advantage and delivers some nicely unexpected twists. This time out, the characters stand solid in their own right and in the climactic scenes of this book Stone lets his sense of humor loose, with the result that there are some hilarious, laugh-out-loud moments. It's always rewarding when a writer finds his stride and takes off. I'm looking forward to the other books in the series--which are already waiting for me in the small mountain of bedside reading.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A woman from Streeter's past brings him trouble today","review":"---A LONG REACHMichael StoneViking, Feb 1997, $20.95, 225 pp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy!!!!!!!!","review":"I bought this lock brand new and it broke in less than a month.

The key very quickly started to get hard to use in the lock, and after about 2 months, it broke off inside the lock as I was trying to lock my bike. The fact that someone as weak and unathletic as me could break the key off by twisting it in the lock says something about how poorly it is made.

I recently decided to read it again and, now that I have some life experience, I am DISGUSTED. According to the author, my infertility is probably the result of: (a) being ambivalent about parenthood and/or wanting it too much; (b) working outside of the home; (c) having a poor relationship with my husband; or (d) bad vibes I picked up from my mom while in utero -- which she probably inherited from my grandma. How are any of these claims empowering to women??? When she's not citing studies conducted in the 1920s and 1930s, all this author does is reinforce the stereotype that infertile women are cold, sexless workaholics who bring it on themselves. And that is not how I define feminism."},{"rating":"2","title":"something every woman should have","review":"An in depth book on feminine wisdom & health... so many of us have stress related illnesses, and bad experiences with the medical profession - this book can go a long way to heal both.

Infertile women especially do NOT need to hear that their problems are caused by their own doubts. Women who suffered miscarriages used to be told that the loss resulted from their own fears of motherhood, and teenagers w/cramps were told for years that their problems were psychosomatic, and were left to suffer and feel inadequate.

I personally suggest Our Bodies, Ourselves from the Boston Women's Health Collective. Instead of shoving unfounded, bias, and conservative information down your throat like Northrup does, it clearly explains issues pertaining to any woman of any age or background. I have extreme remorse for any woman turning to this book for tolerance and understanding concerning our bodies, minds or choices (especially the choice to have an abortion). I feel like work does nothing but spread harmful, untrue information instead of the facts. Northrup's \\"wisdom\\" is best kept inside her head."},{"rating":"1","title":"appeared promising, but disappointing","review":"As a feminist scholar, I was excited to read this book, especially given that it appeared to have a strong focus on holistic women's health. However, I just could not get myself to continue after she seriously introduced the idea of chakras and energy field/forces. How disappointing to see a medical doctor wander off into an completely unproven and pseudoscientific realm. Discussions of women's health and a holistic approach do not mean uncritically accepting any \\"spiritual\\" claims. If these therapies do work, they can probably be explained through promoting psychological wellbeing, or through the placebo effect(which is not necesarily a bad thing if it helps a person feel better). However, given her uncritical acceptance of what is a marginal philosophy at best, I could not trust any of the other information presented. I didn't know if the medical information had been researched/validated at all, or if it merely \\"sounded good.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Women's Bodies, Freudian Wisdom","review":"This woman is Freud with a shwancy haircut (did Freud have hair?)

Now, we have been surpressed by men etc. etc. etc. It is a Liberal, men bashing book in my opinion. Ban the bra era, and not anything informative but then i didnt get far. I dont need someone to say the history of women, I am an intelligent person. I wanted good, concrete info. on women's medical, well being and health in general.

However, as someone whose first born child was stillborn this past summer, I was extremely put off by the sections in the book that deal with pregnancy loss and infertility. The idea that miscarriages,\\"poor pregnancy outcomes,\\" and infertility is the result of maternal ambivalence and communicating maternal stress (which is vaguely described in the book as emotional stress and conflicts about motherhood) is complete hogwash and harmful to those women and men who are suffering and grieving. People in these situations are already trying to come to terms with sorrowful circumstances and do not need to be told that they were to blame. Readers beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was taken aback!","review":"Parts of this book were wonderful, however, I cannot recommend it for infertile women. I am not infertile because \\"deep down I know my husband is the wrong man to get pregnant with.\\" I am infertile because I have a diagnosed medical condition which makes all my pregnancies ectopic. I believe in the mind/body connection, but this is pushing it.

I was astounded by Dr. Northrup's intuitive insight into a women's mind and I connected to her work very much. She explained some things that I had always wondered about and exposed me to some new concepts which now, some 5 years later, I more truly understand as they reflect changes in my own health, body, and mind.

Dr. Northrup seems to mesh gynelogical information with a lot of New Age philosophy. You are what you eat, you got fibroids because your mindset's wrong, and you can't get pregnant because you don't really want to. She also has good things to say for Shamans, members of Wicca, and Tarot cards.

If you want to take control of your health and be an informed consumer, this book is for you. Dr. Northrup gives you permission to feel, to grieve, to move on, to get better.

Judy seems happy and excited about her performances, moving from up-tempo numbers to heart warming ballads in a way no one else has shown us. Unlike the television show, there is no \\"filler\\" here--just great performance after great performance. It is a gift to lovers of great singing that these filmed recordings exist.

I gently tilted the box further and the nuts, washers and screws came out. Unfortunately, only half the nuts were there and 3 lock washers were missing.This means I have to go to home depot and try to match up the nuts and washers. This is more of an inconvenience than a cost or product misfunction. But somebody packed it that way and it was pure laziness and poor business practice.

He's managed to incorporate Todd Rundgren, Brian Wilson and the other songwriting giants into a unique \\"non-style\\" that's jumpy, irritating and, well, not very musical. A shame for such a fine guitarist with such great recording technique. Somewhere in here are some fabulous songs--hits, even--but I doubt Mike will ever lower himself to that.So who gives it 5 stars? People who prefer novelty and cleverness to catchiness, I guess. Zappa fans. Home recording enthusiasts, maybe.

His metaphors and analogies are frequently a bit far fetched. The writing lacks coherence while his stream of consciousness makes the prose difficult to read. The author rarely points to anything profound or intriguing, though he does write with conviction. There are plenty of other reflective books about medicine that would be better to sample than Judith's Pavilion. If this genre interests you, try something by one of these physicians: Paul Brand (The Gift of Pain, Fearfully and Wonderfully Made), Oliver Sacks (The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat, Awakenings), Lewis Thomas (The Lives of a Cell, The Youngest Science), Richard Selzer (Mortal Lessons, Letters to a Young Doctor), David Graham (Thoughts Along the Way), Harold Klawans (Toscanini's Fumble, Newton's Madness), or Sherwin Nuland (The Wisdom of the Body)."},{"rating":"1","title":"CPR","review":"ONE DAY DOWNLOADING VIDEOS FROM THE WEB I FOUND A VIDEO WICH IS CALLED \\"I WISH\\" AND TO MY SURPRISE THE GUEST VOCALS ON THAT VIDEO WAS ZAKK WYLDE FROM BLACK LABEL SOCIETY...

Have had these knives for a year now and they are very prone to chipping. I hone the edge with a ceramic stick after every use or two to counter this problem, but then I realized the problem was that the Chinese fooled me with another one of their products. You get what you pay for... here is what I found on VG-1:VG-1 (also known as V Gold 1 steel) is a high Carbon (C) Molybdenum (Mo) stainless steel manufactured by Takefu Special Steel Co.,Ltd.[1] It is not the same steel as VG-10. There have been reports that VG-1 might be more chip prone than other comparable stainless steels.These knives also boast these are folded steel(for better strength), I say B.S.

It was beautiful with unique patterns on the blade and very sharp. But within few days we noticed it rusts very quickly. We left a knife in the sink in the morning after breakfast, by the time we came home for dinner the knife had several rust spots. We had to use Barkeeper's friend to clean all the rust out. We've tried to clean and dry the knives immediatly after every use - real pain in the #*@ - but once in a while one will be forgotten for couple hours and then rust immediatly forms. Once, when someone else was helping clean up, one went into the dishwasher. It didn't only have rust all over but the blade edge rusted away! Now the knife has jagged edge!!!

Small downside is the blades stain easily if you leave them out unwashed. The manufacturer recommends washing and drying immediately after use. If they do stain, there are various polishing products to bring them back to looking new. All in all a great set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indie Pop at its Purest","review":"I liked it a whole lot.

I reminds me a lot of later day pavement but with a sense of honest and depth that I find lacking in today's world of Korns and the Backstreet Boys. I see that they have another CD which I will order once I am finished here. I like the mix of disonant guitars and vintage keyboard tinkerings.

I know it have read it many times, and will read it many more times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Wonderful","review":"This is a terrific book and not just for the tween set. I have loved this story ever since I first read it in middle school. I would highly reccommend this for young girls as Kate is an excellent example of an empowered FEMALE protagonist--something which is all too often lacking in the historical fiction written for the young reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting theme.","review":"Kate was never the pretty, adored sister; that role was left to her empty headed sister Alicia, everyone's favorite. Thus it came as no surprise when in 1558 Queen Mary sent Kate away to Elvenwood Hall (The Perilous Gard)to punish Kate for Alicia's misdoing. Then she arrives to find a strange young man called Christopher Heron, the brother of the Lord of Elvenwood, who has become the chosen sacrifice of the druid like fairies of the well in exchange for his niece's return. Kate is caught in the middle of it all. Is she the one who is destined to save them all? This book was a great example of Elizabethen England folk lore come true, with a little romance at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best children's books ever","review":"The Perilous GardThe Sherwood RingThe Perilous Gard is a book I still reread as an adult. The Sherwood Ring is good also. I just wish that Ms. Pope had written MORE.The Perilous Gard is a wonderful rainy afternoon book. The characters seem real and the Elizabethan England that is described seems real and charming but none too easy to live in.The best part of the story is the characterizations of the fairies themselves. Not the fluttery, glittery creatures beloved of Walt Disney, but a real, proud alien race at one with nature. The queen particularly is both admirable and cruel, pitiless and pitiable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I was skeptical about getting the book at first. I am interesting in Tuodor England, but Fairy Folk? Well, I finally got it, and it's a great book. I've always loved historical fiction, but now I'm getting into fantasy. It has romance, action, magic, mystery, and includes everyone's favorite holiday, Halloween."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment","review":"I really don't get how this book has so many good reviews. My friend was just raving about it, and I had high hopes because the plot looked interesting. I read it, regretted starting it after the first chapter, but didn't stop because my friend wanted me to finish it, and I was hoping that it would get better. No such luck.Although the plot is original, the characters are shallow. Kate is the perfect little mary sue whose only flaw is (my oh my!) clumsiness! The romance between Kate and Christopher was bland and unemotional.All the dramatic scenes in the book were... off. I felt like whenever something was supposed to be frightening or shocking, the simple and slow paced language threw me off, and I had to read the page over again to be sure that anything important had actually happened.The story droned on and I actually had to force myself through most of it... Hate to be a downer but it really wasn't that great."},{"rating":"2","title":"my all-eternity favorite","review":"I find it hard to believe that ANYTHING could be better than this book. Pope's words taste like poetry yet includes the most natural, believable, and witty charaterization and dialogue. Every time I read it I find a new glistening phrase, a fresh perspective. As for Kate, she's my favorite novel heroine in existence! Practical, completely human and completely likable. Nothing superimposed about this girl! The magic of this book is its total emmersement in character. When you read it, you not only understand Kate, you ARE Kate. As for anyone casually browsing this page, do yourself the biggest favor of the year and BUY THIS BOOK!!! RIGHT NOW!!! If you don't like it, you can complain to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREEN DAY RULES!","review":"I Bought this CD because I Wanted to own all the green day CD's.

It only works from about four feet away from the eye. Furthermore, there is no display to let you know what function you have selected on the remote so you are constantly guessing as to what controls are being selected. You get what you pay for I guess.

Sounds is great when is simple stereo but when in 5.1 there is hardly any bass. Customer support from Altec gets a big zero as I received no reply after sending 2 e-mails to customer support. In my opinion your money would be better spent on speakers from another company than ALTEC."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"One of the rear satellite speakers did not work for me. I connected the speakers to two different computer systems to rule out problems other than the speakers themselves, and the same problem with both, the right rear satellite speaker would not work. I did check out the sound for a two speaker configuration, and was less than thrilled with the sound quality even at that. The sound was not very strong, almost \\"tinny\\" compared to my Altec Lansing cheapies that I was looking to replace. I returned these speakers for a refund.About the best thing I can say for this VS3251 system is it made me appreciate my old set of speakers a whole lot more after I reconnected them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poland's pseudo cuisine","review":"The book is beautifully illustrated and edited with some potenitally interesting recipes ideas such as beetroot creme brulee. The main idea behind the book is to provide nouvelle cuisine gloss to the good old traditional Polish cooking. However, the book does not carry through this idea very well, resulting sometimes in strange and extremely costly recipes which cannot be afforded by an average cooking enthusiast. Lussiana recommends many fine ingredients, but the way he combines them suggests that he does not really understand their chemistry. Perhaps the trouble is that he is very new to Polish culture which he needs to understand thoroughly to make his new ideas compatible with it. A reading such as Gary Rhodes' \\"New British Classics\\" could serve as an excellent example of new and exciting ideas based on a real understanding of centuries long British traditions and culture topped up with the chef's true talent and passion for cooking."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of Its Type","review":"This is not \\"How to Make a Lebenty-Leben Billion Dollars By Tomorrow Morning at 9:00 am\\" What it is, however, is an intelligent approach towards achieving success.

The new editor looked great, but goodness knows when (or even if) this book will ever appear, which is a huge shame for genealogy buffs since this is a book that ought to be 5 star if and when it ever appears (and it is looking increasingly if it never will).

Amazon needs to develope better communications with the sellers it deals with otherwise customers such as myself will lose confidence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two different albums, two different inspirations","review":"To me it seems So Much For the City was all about being in love, not only with the brilliance of the California Coast but with a woman as well. The music, harmonies and general vibe of the album reflect this. The follow up album seems to dig more into the underbelly of the band and quite possibly the heartbreak of losing the woman. This is just a thought, I really have no knowledge of the singers relationships but I see clues throughout Lets Bottle Bohemia which suggest heartbreak, while the first album seems to emobdy the fire on new love. I also think the second has more of an East Coast, North East in particular vibe. It's not as sunny as the first but still very unique and packs a fist full of soul. I hope to catch them live someday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album","review":"Some bands have a hard time working on a second album. Either they are rushed to release or they try to hard. The Thrills did put out this album pretty fast, but lead singer Conor Deasy, apparently has written 100 songs already or more. Gone are all the songs about Big Sur and Santa Cruz (what was that about?). Now they have cool songs about Corey Haim and Faded Beauty Queens. This is a more accomplished and ultimately a more satifying record. This is the one that people will want to return to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to standard of first album.","review":"Well, I loved the first album 'SO Much For The City' by The Thrills. It kind of reminded me of how The Beach Boys sounded in the 70's; lots of banjo and great hooky melodies.I'm sorry, but the trend doesn't continue on this album. The songs are very forgettable, and have none of the 'California sound'.I have seen the video for the song 'Not For All The Love In The World' and quite like the song, but the chorus doesn't go where I imgaine it should :)Every time I hear it, I want the last bar to go to a certain chord, but it doesn't and disappoints me :SSo, for me, the whole thing suffers from 'second album syndrome'; it sounds like they used up all their good material on the 1st album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed!","review":"From the pictures you can not tell that this is a very SMALL cake and toy. The value for the current price of 9.99 is much better, but for the almost $16.00 it was a true disappointment.

Just enough for 1 window and to put it on properly took about 3 hours. I could have done it in 1 hour if I used some thin flat wood trim but it comes with some cardboard strips that you are supposed to cut to length + wrap in the plastic several times before nailing with the supplied tiny Chinese nails. I hope this protects the cardboard. Do yourself a favor and buy some brads that are slightly longer than the thickness of your fingers. I don't trust the 3M outdoor kits because they rely on double-stick tape which doesn't stick below 50F. Still I only give this 1 star because it is not clear and it is thin. The package says clear but it looks like frosted glass. Are the 3M kits clear?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome bubbles","review":"Sesame Street characters aside, this bubble bath makes awesome amounts of bubbles for a toddler to splash in. The bubbles also seem to last longer than Johnson's and Johnson's products--although this is just a bubble bath, where the J & J products are usually baby washes too. The reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the cap just screws off and you have an open top to pour through (instead of a smaller hole to squeeze product through). I feel like too much glops out and I end up going through the bottle too quickly. Other than that, no complaints."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice bubble bath, with a strong scent","review":"My son loves this bubble bath because it has Elmo on the bottle. But it's nice-- it doesn't irritate his skin or his eyes. The smell is a bit strong for my taste-- the bathroom smelled like watermelon \\"Jolly Rancher\\" candy for a long time after he took his bath.But it's a good product overall and I'm glad my money is going to Sesame Street.

Needless to say, it was not. While this ordinarily wouldn't be a problem, the film you do get simply doesn't hold up. The \\"stylish cinematography\\" I was told to expect wasn't very, and the action sequences just didn't feel very solid.

I didn't want it to end. Too bad it wasn't longer, or a sequal. This is one movie, given the same cast, and a good director, that a sequal would have been welcome.

I found it very hard to watch this movie. It's not funny at all and the propoganda in it is so obvious(I suppose that's a good thing). It does nothing but try to brain-wash any and all things that are natural about being a real man. While I don't believe in being violent towards homosexuals, I do believe that accepting this unnatural behavior, as somehow natural, is the most damaging thing you can do to those who practice this life style. To truly love your neighbor is to help him and to help by warning them of the dangers of their life style.I was so surprised to see these three men playing these roles. It's hard for me to see them as real men in anything else now.A real man will absolutely hate this film. I warn you, you can potentially be brain-washed if you watch it.

Because you don't see John go through the tranformation, its really hard to remember he is a man unless you've seen him in other roles. Wesley is very silly and very camp.

It is far beyond the typical \\"clip coupons\\" and \\"buy what you can in bulk\\" mentality. The author actually advises against most coupon shopping (buy the store brands when you can, they are cheaper than discounted national brands in many/most cases). I can honestly say I am a pretty good bargain shopper, but I got my money's worth in reading this book. There is a lot of information in this book that is obvious after reading about it, but not as obvious before it is pointed out.On the other hand, I thought the book went a little beyond what I would be willing to do. I'm all for stocking my kitchen so that I don't have to purchase items until they are on sale/priced to my liking, but building shelves and hiding them behind curtains in a baby's room or artifically raising the bed to fit more food under it seem extreme."},{"rating":"2","title":"great tips","review":"I was pleased with some of the insight and tips that i was able to get from this book.

Jerry Gentry studied the patients, nurses, and doctors that make up the Grady Hospital Maternity Ward in Atlanta. He follows several mothers on their journey through prenatal care, pregnancy, and the births of their children. He then follows up after the babies are born. I found this book compelling because it demonstrates every aspect of its subjects' lives. You feel like you personally know the people discussed. It is an emotional and monetarial journey of hardships for most of the mothers involved. Being an Atlanta native this novel has given me new respect for Grady hospital.

I love that it has a vintage look and matches everything I wear!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Do not interpret perfection!","review":"The first twelve tracks on this album (with the exception of 9)capture all of the humor and bawd that made the movie the uproarious event it was, but the interpretations don't resemble the songs. And I so wanted to hear Ru Paul sing \\"I'm super.\\" Take it if you can!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the best CD ever made","review":"this cd is the most best cd i ever heard i am going to buy it and listen to the year 2000"},{"rating":"2","title":"IT'S SWEET...SUPER SWEET!!!","review":"This album is the most outragous fun anybody can have. The movie tracks are from our favorite South Park folks.The various artists and their renditions has my fellow workmates and me humming Uncle F**ka and about Kyle's Mom all day long! You must go out a buy this cd...that's what Brian Boitano would do!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hotter than a Bobcat with it's Buns on fire!","review":"This CD has everything. It is the greatest, and the songs from the movie are the money shots. The other songs, expecially the Rap version of \\"Uncle F--KA\\" kinda take away from the goodness. All hail South PArk!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely hysterical!!!","review":"The movie was the most hysterical, irreverent, and totally decadent thing I've seen in a long time; I laughed until tears ran down my face. The songs in the movie (and on this CD) are funny beyond words. \\"Kyle's Mom is a B***h\\" is particularly side-splitting; nobody does it quite like Cartman! \\"Uncle F***A\\" had me rolling in the aisles. If you're having a totally rotten day, pop this CD into your player. You'll be cheered up in no time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hell isnt Good","review":"I thought the songs were kinda funny, but the one song from the movie called \\"Hell isnt Good\\" sounds like James Hetfield from Metallica is singing it, but in the end credits, it says the song was done by DVDA, who is that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't like it.","review":"In my day, we never had swear words. This CD is full of it. If I got in a time machine, I wouldn't buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"The boys sing great, so who told Satan he could sing?","review":"When I saw the movie, I really thought the music was excellent. I'm not too crazy about some of the lyrics, because I found them a bit offensive, but I ignore it. I mostly just like the way Stan,Kyle, Cartman and Kenny sing and I've been a long time fan of south park since the movie. Some other characters sing in some songs too.The people do an awfully good job on the voices. The four boys sing good, but Satan and Saddam stunk! First, the voices sound depressing and ugly that maybe Saddam and Satan should good sind a song with Britney Spears.For the lovable boys of south park, let's hear them sing and as for Satan and Saddam,get a hose, destroy Satan's fire and scream BOOO!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst soundtracks I've ever heard","review":"I liked the movie, the songs were well suited for it. But listening to them in CD, without image, is a total waste of time. IT's boring, requires too much determination to reach the end. I'm sorry about a version of \\" O CANADA \\", performed by Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson from Rush, I vener suspected they could record something so bad ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm really amazed!","review":"I think that not only was the movie funny as hell, but the soundtrack just added insult to the injury! I couldn't stop laughing! The cover songs are alright... the version of \\"What Would Brian Boitano Do?\\" is awesome, its done by Trey Parker & Matt Stone's band, which is even better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for South Park fans, its musically intense","review":"This soundtrack, for those that have seen the movie, is GREAT!!! For those that haven't, the music on this is very funny and cool. It's worth getting even if you're not a South Park fan. There are a lot of great songs on this, both funny and musically cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for all South Park fans","review":"Wow! I can't believe how good this CD actually is. I a lot better than Chef Aid since the cast of the show gets to sing more. The very first song on the CD, which is introduced by Stan is very good and feels very Disneyesque. In fact, most of the songs do, which makes it strange but hilarious."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is a hundred times better then Chef-Aid.","review":"Ive heard the songs: \\"Im Super\\", \\"Good Love\\", \\"What Would Brian Boitano Do\\", \\"Through The Eyes of A Child\\" and the remix of \\"Kyle Mom\\". I think this CD sounds great and alot better then Chef Aid.The Big Gay Al song is hilarious!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hella excellent!","review":"This reminds me of \\"Tenacious D's\\" cd, in the way that, other than being obviously hilarious, the quality of the music is astonishingly good. You don't expect a \\"comedy\\" cd to be this well done. I mean, despite all the language, this is almost the caliber of any other classic musical. Plus of course it's the funniest thing since the \\"Chef Aid\\" soundtrack, but better. All the tracks are good, but \\"Up There\\" and \\"I'm Super\\" are awesome. Also, the \\"Michael Mcdonald\\" song cracks me up, because he's such a well respected singer, yet the lyrics are funny. It's actually one of his best ever performances. The extras on the end of this disc are good, but it's the main songs that make this essential for any fan of \\"South Park\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"south Park the musical","review":"Watch out Sondheim. The most brilliant new musical in town is South Park bigger Longer and uncut. The music is not only great parody (Oklahoma, The Little Mermaid, Les Miz) the songs stand well on their own. The lyrics are clever and the music is catchy. will these guys ever write for Broadway? I hope so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bigger, Longer, and Uncut","review":"I really liked the first half of the CD. The songs that were taken from the movie were awesome. I love Terrence and Philip! But the second half were songs inspired by the movie and just not that good. I did like the Violent Femmes song, but could have done without the others. I just don't like those artists, so other people might not feel the same way as I do. I did enjoy Terrence and Philip singing along to the Canadian National Anthem, but I wish they would release the version that is on the April Fools episode. That is a better version. But this CD is a good CD if you just want to complete your South Park collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than Broadway","review":"I find this to be one of the most hilarious CDs ever. I've listened to it for two years now, and I still laugh every time I hear \\"Through the Eyes of a Child.\\" Don't miss this CD--unless you're easily offended and have no sense of humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hillarious musical comedy","review":"When i went to see the Southpark movie I had no idea it was going to be a musical. I was taken aback by the quality and creativity of the music.OK - the lyrics are not always for the faint of heart, but they are catchy. You will find yourself humming many of the tunes as they become stuck in your head.As with any album, I have found some tracks I can play over and over; with others, once was enough. A friend of mine (with a PhD. in Musicology) became a Southpark fan after hearing this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Somthing to hold you over till the movie is out on video","review":"The movie was the most hilarios I've seen ever. I will see it over and over again and this soundtrack will keep me laughing until I see it again. Though not for the faint of heart, it is a definite must for any South Park fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, but artists renditions are terrible.","review":"If u saw the movie and loved the songs, then this is for you. Everything is there and then some. Now unlike many other people who reviewed this album, I thought CHEF AID was great with who they got and what songs they remade. Trey Parker and Matt Stone unfortunately didn't do so well here picking good artists. The only good remakes are from D.V.D.A., which CONSISTS of Matt and Trey, and perhaps the Violent Femmes for \\"I swear it.\\" However though all the other songs that they sing are great. If u like South Park and Trey Parker's great song writing, then I recommend this CD. And on a side note, for the movie only true South Park fans are going to truly appreciate it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great soundtrack!","review":"I was surprised at how great this CD is. The music and lyrics are clever. Buy this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best musical comedy soundtrack of the 90's, 80's, 70's","review":"This recording is the best parody of Broadway and movie musicals ever. If you tolerate the language (not that hard), the music is everything from Oklahoma to Lloyd Webber to Sondheim to Dreamgirls to almost every idiom of the style. Brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings back the movie moments every time - Very Good","review":"A great way to recapture the film's best moments and so what if the filler isn't all that great, you still get everything you need,and then some w/a great soundtrack to a GREAT movie.....(again, easily offended, step aside and come no further)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good CD","review":"The songs on this CD are very funny, and are just all great songs. Broadway wishes it had a musical score this good. The only bad part of this CD are some of the extra songs added that werent in the movie. These songs arnt nearly as good as the first 10 on the CD. But the first 10 are worht the CD anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"South Park track - bigger, longer, uncut, and EXCELLENT!!","review":"This CD is definitely worth purchasing - it makes me laugh every time I listen to uncle f**ka - definitely the best trackm there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plot does not deliver","review":"You would think with such a powerful cast..Jude Law, Rachel Weisz, Norah Jones and Natalie Portman that there would be a script that could complement their talents. Norah Jones is a woman trying to find herself and goes cross country before discovering that what she wanted was where she left it in NYC. Jude Law does nothing more than smoke a few cigarettes, wipe bar tables and serve Blueberry pie. This movie drags along and has a predictable ending. There are much better rentals than this one. Definitely do not buy!! Have you ever watched a romantic comedy that did not make you laugh? I'll never try Blueberry pie again!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly made","review":"this was really disappointing, great cast, could have been a great romantic comedy but the lines were off, slow and terrible photography."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Region! Possibly a bootleg?","review":"This bluray is only for UK/Europe region. It doesn't work in my NTSC PS3. It's PAL format, and region coded to UK.Not only that but the shrink wrap was very loose, as if it was not done professionally but by an individual.Also, there seems to be no markings on the inside 'ring' of the bluray, which leads me to believe it might be a bootleg as well. I'm not aware if bootlegged blurays exist yet, but it's probably possible.That's the last time I buy a bluray under $10."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe my Favorite Wong kar Wai","review":"It's interesting to see what WKW does when he's got the liberty of the US's wide open spaces. He quotes from Thelma and Louise! Also, unlike his Hong Kong characters, the characters in this movie can connect and ostensibly become a couple. We truly enjoyed this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have trusted other reviews","review":"This movie was both depressing and boring. I love Norah Jones' music, but this has nothing to do with the music. The characters are not very engaging, and all of them sad."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],M={key:0},N={key:1};function W(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return i(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",B,[(i(!0),a(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(i(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(i(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(i(),a("span",N,"Loading...")):(i(),a("span",M,"See more"))],8,x)):b("",!0)])}const H=d(C,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-49e759ce"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/36.md","filePath":"quotesmag/36.md"}'),R={name:"quotesmag/36.md"},G=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(i(),a("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{L as __pageData,G as default};
