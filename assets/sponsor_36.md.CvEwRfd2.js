Worked fine for five years, I live alone and eat out most of the time so I rarely used it. However, I made guacamole one night as I had done several times before and put the peels in the disposal. The next morning I noticed a strange sound when running the disposal, so I looked inside the rubber seal and saw that the peels were gone but the interior was rusted. I then looked under the sink and was horrified to find that it had been leaking for who knows how long, with black mold everywhere. I will never buy another insinkerator product.After looking at reviews on Amazon, the Waste King Legend 8000 seems to be the way to go, with a lifetime in-home service warranty, averaging 4.7 out of 5 stars, and only fifty-two dollars more than the incredibly poor-performing badger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flawed product","review":"I have bought Two of these units in ten years.

Both are good products - time will tell as to how long the Excel lasts - it comes with a 7 year warranty - if it runs the 9+ yrs that the Badger ran, I'll be pretty satisfied...."},{"rating":"1","title":"HATE IT!","review":"This Badger 1 is the model the builder put in our brand new home we had built in 2001. I had to start babying this machine very early on. It wouldn't grind even easy things like eggshells without getting clogged... and meat, NEVER. Many, MANY times I've had to reach into the unit to unstick the grinders that would get locked into a non-spinning position, throwing the balance off. It began leaking and even spraying at times shortly later. Based on other reviews when researching a replacement, the Badger series as a whole is poorly rated. I DO NOT RECOMMEND this disposer. InSinkerator has models other than the Badger series that are way better rated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value","review":"Just replaced a 20+ year old Badger 1 that had rusted out at the dishwasher fitting and the just below the sink drain. There'd been no major problems with the unit over the years, so I bought the same 1/3hp model. The new disposal isn't as beefy as the old one, but.... Installation was fairly easy.

Then it silently damaged the under-the-sink cabinet before we realized it was leaking from the bottom screws. Must be made with substandard materials.

No, it's caused by rusted out metal. The bottom of the end bell assembly, which seperates the motor from the shredder, is completely rusted. There is one hole already. I can poke through the iorn sheet at several other places. In other words, the disposal can at most last about 4 years under light use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to Replace","review":"I had the same item installed in new home for the last 7-years.

Thanks for all the reviews, now I know it's not just ours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short Term Fix for a Larger Problem","review":"I bought this thinking it was engineered for at least 3-4 years but sure enough it lasted just over 12 months. This is an upgrade from the disposer installed in your home most of the time but do not purchase it as a replacement. Spend the extra $50-$100 and do it once rather than $80 here and then $80 in a year. Your time is worth money. This is however a great option if selling your house depends on replacing the disposal."},{"rating":"1","title":"By Evolution model, not Badger","review":"I too have one that leaked water through the casing. I can understand if it fails after awhile where the blades wear out or motor wears out but they shouldn't have a casing that opens up and leaks water in the under sink cabinet.I've replaced this with a more expensive Evolution model. It costs more but I figure over a 10 year span, I'll have saved more money and frustration than buying Badger models over and over. Too many Badger reviews also say their casings leaked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Case Cracked, Blades Rusted","review":"There must be some kind of systematic design flaw with this model.I've owned two of these little monsters, and on both of them, the blades were covered in rust after about 5 years of gentle use. Is this what water and dish soap do to the moving parts in that amount of time? No wonder they won't warranty it for more than a year.On the first unit, the blades just locked up -- I assumed due to the corrosion. On the second unit, the case developed a crack in its side, and water had leaked beneath my cabinet (which went unnoticed until black mold had ruined the cabinet base). The location of the crack doesn't appear to have been any kind of obvious stress point, so I am assuming it was created by interior rust and corrosion.I have to wonder if the more expensive models have this problem as well, or is it just on this low-end model.Advice: If you buy this model for the price, be sure to inspect it on a yearly basis for signs of its demise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great if you like leaks","review":"I did not purchase this through Amazon, it came with the house I purchased a year and a half ago. After only 18 months, this garbage disposal has started leaking through the bottom of the housing. Not the sides, not the top... but the bottom through the reset button, screw threads and all other holes. If you've read anything online about garbage disposal repair, you'll see that this type of leak is the kiss of death. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this unit, you'll only be buying another one a year or two later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"Please save your money and get a better quality product. I bought this product and the housing cracked in less then a year, Will never purchase another one. Its a common problem that will ruin your cabinets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Cracked Casing... Don't Waste Your Money!!!","review":"I am convinced that the number of 'leak' reviews here (and elsewhere) points to one conclusion.... InSinkErator has clearly engineered this disposal to structurally fail so that you will then buy their more expensive products. My unit is just two years old and has multiple cracks in the molded metal casing. The internal wiring is likely to be getting wet, since the cracks are all over the unit.I'm considering buying another brand, but they have conveniently designed the collar (the only well-made part of this unit and hardest part of a new install) to accept any of their higher priced models. I feel like sending them a bill for the water damage this unit has caused.Here's an idea... stop selling this crap and design a slightly more expensive/safer unit that doesn't cause your customers to consider going elsewhere. Let's hear it for the InSinkErator marketing team for tarnishing an established household name through designed failure! Wheee!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy something better","review":"Well, this disposer is cheap. It's also noisy and vibrates a lot, so you get what you pay for. Also it rusted out and started leaking after five years.

I'm yet another owner with a cracked case on my Badger 1 which led to leaks. The internal blades are also completely rusted. The disposer probably only lasted about two years before the crack occurred. The best feature of this disposer is that it's easily replaced with a better unit because of the common mounting system. I can't believe anyone continues to buy this after reading reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap piece of junk!","review":"Loud, inefficient, below grade disposal.

But then the reason I am here is because it looks like we may have to replace it before too much longer. I put apples in it every night and it can't even grind up an apple for me. It is at a point where it will work one day and not the next. I am going to go for a generic brand next time.

I've wasted too much time and money trying to get them to work, having them run dry quickly, mailing defective and even non-fitting cartridges back to sellers, and even having sellers of defective cartridges never make the refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little pricey, but.....","review":"That's my only complaint about this ink. At Amazon the price is lower than office supply stores, and there's no tax and free shipping!!! I've been using it in my HP 940c printer for 31/2 years and have never had a problem. The color is very good in pictures, greeting cards, or whatever. It will usually last about 6 months under normal conditions. If I print a lot of pictures as in online scrapbooking with backgrounds, etc., it runs out faster. The HP website has an activity center with lots of print projects and tips for getting the most out of your ink and printer. One thing I don't do is refill ink cartridges or use any other brand or kind but original HP. Also, be sure to align your print cartridges every time you change them, and clean them according to instructions with your printer if you do get streaks in your printout. This might help with some of the problems I read about in other reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong answer","review":"I have nothing against the product itself. My complaint is the fact that when I entered the information about my printer as to whether or not this cartridge would work, the information I received said it would. Well, it won't. The cartridge fit in the printer, but the printer will not operate with that cartridge. My printer is an HP Deskjet 722C. The HP No. 78 Tri-Color Inkjet Print Cartridge (C6578DN) will not work.

I did receive it promptly but when I inserted it into my computer the ink was obviously dried out because all I got was a faint blue. I looked on the box and found a date of 2005 which to me should not have been sold to me in the end of 2008. I notified the seller and he said send it back and my money would be refunded. I did this and also asked for my expense of shipping it back but he never refunded this.I was looking forward to buying other items on Amazon.com but as this was my first experience I do not know if I can trust the items I will be buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad color ink cartridge","review":"This was the first time I had ever ordered a cartridge from thisthis company.

Remanufactured ink cartridges get a very bad review because they seldom work. I bought from this seller because it LOOKED like it was a factory packed and sealed product, but when it got here, that outer packaging was missing and it came in a bubble pack. I installed the cartridge and ran the test twice on either side of reinstalling it to make sure I had it seated properly. Failed both tests. It is now packed and ready to go back right where it came from. To my mind, the picture this seller uses is false advertising.

Extremely disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HP ink 15 +78 combo-pack","review":"I purchased the tri-color ink cartridge. It would not print vivid colors such as red and yellow. I contacted HP and they insisted that the problem was the (HP)printer that they consider obsolete. I swapped out the old low level HP tri-color cartridge and it printed perfectly. Replacing the old cartrige with the new one produced the same results with the colors not printing. They recommended purchasing one of several other HP printers that use the FHP 78 tri-color ink. Then if the new cartridge still printed muted colors, it could be the ink cartrige itself. HP would not recognize that the cartridge could be defective in my printer. HP did not try and replace the ink or admit that the ink could be the problem. Very poor support for an expensive product (the ink costs $60.) It seems I would have been better off purchasing it at a big box store at a higher price with the hope of better service."},{"rating":"1","title":"HP78 tricolor cartridge","review":"This cartridge only prints blue.

I was deeply impressed by this beautiful relatively unknown record. She is for me one of the few jazz-singers who knows and realy experiences what she is singing. A song like Beautiful Love (like I'm A Fool To Want You, with Gil Evans in 1987)is unable to leave my mind after hearing it twice.What a great talent and, I suppose, what a wonderful personality.A special note for her accompanists on this CD. Charlie Haden and Paul Motion play as fine as ever, but special attention for Tom Harrell, who plays some of the most fantastic introverted flugel- and trumpetsolo's I ever heard, and for the pianist Kikuchi. What a refinement and good taste, always feeling what the music and Helen need. And, not unimportant, a totaly original way of piano-accompaniment, full of new and inventive ideas.A treasure of the highest level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool but probably not for kids","review":"It really looks and feels neat, but I probably wouldn't buy it again.There are a whole bunch of safety warnings on the packaging that this is not intended as a pillow for sleeping - and that it's not a toy for kids either, purely decorative.It also has a strong chemical odor that does fade over time, but is still a bit disturbing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stressing","review":"After you finish this book, you will probably have mixed feelings. Mine were confused, stressed, and I thought the book made me freak out! All I gotta say is that this book is pretty good. It's not as good as the others, but the story is growing more and more.

The person that reveals these illusions violated copyright and patent by showing the secrets to these illusions. There is a difference between this video and instructional videos. This is video merely gives the secrets, whereas an instructional video explains the secrets, as well as, methods, history and other information about the trick, and has enough background in magic to know that half the fun of seeing magic is not knowing the secret. I'm thoroughly displeased as a magician."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Pity!","review":"It is truly a shame when the only source of entertainment we can enjoy as a family is watching a bad egg with a mask give away the secrets to illusions. This tape does not give away secrets of illusions you have seen on T.V. performed by greats like Copperfield, Sigfried and Roy or anything you saw on Worlds Greatest Magic. All this film does is hurt the local Magician in your area who may have saved up enough money to bring one of these illusions to your local mall, fair or school. When are people going to learn that when you know the secret, there is no more magic? If you really appreciate magic and magicians, don't buy this tape.

At first I thought the post office did it, but the tape used to 'repair' the box was the same tape that was originally used for shipping. The pole arrived broken and two rings werent bent severely. Fortunately - Amazon took care of replacement relatively quickly. But I would definitely advise opening up your box from them IMMEDIATELY to see if it's in good shape. The pole is definitely killer for the price.

The casts are 30 yards less than my 15 foot Daiwa Sealine rod. I won't be using this rod again. I should have stuck with the old saying, You get what you pay for. Yeah, it's cheap, but it's also junk. If you want a great 15 foot surf rod, for super long casts, and comfort, I would suggest the 15 foot Daiwa Sealine Surf rod.

Probably overkill for a lot of people. Like others have suggested, sand down the male ends or it's extremely tough to get this rod apart. I sanded with ~400 grit very softly, and checked the connection often. Now it comes apart with ease but stays connected while casting.One note on the shipping. The rod is in three pieces, and it came zip tied and wrapped in soft plastic. No padding or protection at all. I actually couldn't believe it when I opened it. One of the guides was bent really bad, and almost all of them were tweaked. I was able to bend them all back and feel confident that it didn't weaken anything.

I only bought this a few months ago, and already one of the handsets has died completely. Minor problems are: a horrible menu system; caller ID doesn't show the name only the number; if you try to redial a number that just called you it dials the area code first with no \\"1\\" in front of it so if you use it, you'll be calling a wrong number.

One example is the volume controls both the answer machine and the base speaker phone, the two are not calibrated, if you switch between using the base speaker phone and the answering machine you need to adjust the volume each time. <li> Handset interface is not very good, the color screen servers no purpose.

Both have worked flawlessly for us. We went through a variety of 5.8 GHz phones (Motorola, Panasonic, and the gawd-awful 2.4 GHz Siemens), and this AT&T; has beat them hands-down. It has great range, great voice quality, and we especially like the rechargeable NiCad batteries that don't cost as much as a dinner at Outback to replace.Our single gripe is this: when you pick up either ringing phone from its base, you still have to hit \\"Talk\\" to answer the call. Both the Panasonic and the Motorola, and yes, even the Siemens answered the call when you picked up the phone from the base, but not this AT&T; phone. The unfortunate thing is that we became used to this, and STILL put the ringing phone up to our ear and say, \\"Hello? Hello?\\" Our kids just laugh and laugh at this.This gripe is truly minor, though we would expect more from AT&T.; That notwithstanding, we highly recommend this phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good with wireless communication","review":"This is the second 5.8 we purchased and returned. It disconnects our wireless internet when the phone is in use. We have to turn the computer off and reboot to get it back once the call has ended.

We tried the Panasonic KX-TG5240M first which I commented on too.The sound quality seemed to be good and battery life okay, just kills the internet... Really liked some of the features, but was a little complicated to program. You only have to do that once, though.

Armonia y melodia bastante simple, saltos armonicos demasiado fuertes. Nada especial. I think Luis Miguel sings very good, he's cool (for ladies) and talented.

It is a Conan the Barbarian rip off, and not that bad of a film. Crow, Mike and Tom Servo even seem to enjoy it, but of course there are things to be made fun of about the movie.What brings this down and makes this a four star DVD is mostly for the fact that Angel's Revenge is on here. That movie is so boring, MST3k can't save it. I feel asleep during it and so did one of the other people watching it with me, and that was during the day!

On first listen, we were sorely disappointed. The music was not at all what we expected - it was a lot of hip-hop/rap music which we don't listen to much. We didn't listen to it again for a few months after the initial hearing. However, I popped it back in with lowered expectations, and found that there are a few gems on the soundtrack. I do like the CD now, but it's just not what we were expecting. Be sure to listen to the songs on the CD before purchasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected!","review":"I replaced my OEM seat after it started cracking.

People's actual vacation photos of the America I wish was still out there to see on a road trip.

This is the best kind of affectionate satire. Hilarious, amazing stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Good concept, but poor execution. The pictures look like the worst vacation pictures that weren't good enough to make it into the album.

The poor bugger got sacked after having sacrified most of his life fixing things for the boys. The story is clattered with errors but that's probably because it is told straitght from the heart.

The very best of the three origial recordings where taken and placed into one CD...this being the result. The music is haunting, spiritual and relaxing.

In the course of the novel, Francesca meets a fascinating young lawyer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Luskey's/Ryon's - Great customer service","review":"Lyskey's/Ryon's provides a wonderful selection of western wear at very reasonable prices; however, the quality that won me over is their great customer service skills! They help you out in any way possible and are very prompt at shipping your order.

The 20X Toyo Panama Straw Cowboy Hat is wonderful for kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Devil's Trill is the best!","review":"Yami no Matsuei is a great series; visually stunning with a good plot too boot. I'm in heaven. The Devil's Trill arc is my favorite arc (there are only 4 arcs total sadly). In this arc we meet a poor boy who has been possessed by the devil. Tsutsuki and Hisoka must save him before it is too late. A lot of cool violin music in this one and if you're interested Vanessa Mae does play Devil's Trill on her Four Seasons album. Alas, Muraki doesn't play much of a role in this arc but it's still worthwile to watch it. A warning if you haven't seen this show: there are a lot of shounen ai (boy love) hints. If you can't handle that then stay away from this show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shonen fun!","review":"Formerly known as 'Yami No Matsui', 'Descendants of Darkness' has been translated, much to the joy of American viewers - like me. :) This particular story deals with a violinist who involuntarily finds himself in a pact with the devil, and the hot dead guys (known as guardians of death) who are out to fix the situation. This arc is especially coherent, which is a plus. *Lots* of drama. Plenty of blood. Dan Green does a particularly good job as the voice actor for Tsusuke, our violet-eyed protagonist."},{"rating":"2","title":"The wait is over!","review":"It's been almost five years since their last studio release here, and I don't know if this'll be out here soon unless you get this import.

There is little point in buying a powered hub if the power can not be relied on.

The annoying ubiquity of this album finally drove me to the point of giving it a listen (yet, thankfully, not purchase). This album might have been something were it not for the overproduction (too much tinkering), the headache-inducing arrangements (the nascent hooks are very nearly lost) and the laughably pretentious lyrics (\\"nevermore, nevermore, nevermore.\\" you got that right).

If you're someonewho has been through good insight indepth therapy, this book is waytoo simple, a beginner's book.

Says who?","review":"I bought this book a few weeks ago thinking that it will give me a good base to begin my first thermo course next year. I was so lost and confused by the book that I immediately sought help, and my tutor told me that I had completely wasted my money. If you are someone who has never done thermo before, like myself, save your money for something more useful: there is nothing introductory about this text. Try checking out Thermodynamics: An Engineering Approach by Boles (a MUCH better introductory text-book)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Student Review","review":"Having just completed Elliot's introductory thermodynamics course at the University of Akron with the pre-published version of this book, I would have to point out that several of the concepts introduced after chapter 4 are vaguely explained. I say this because several other books had to be used to gain a full understanding of the concepts. The example problems are another area of major concern throughout the entire book. The example problems often have several crucial steps skipped and offer a poor correlation between the homework problems at the end of the chapters. This is not to mention the numerous errors still found in the solutions of the sample problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather incomplete.","review":"I found this book to be rather unsatisfactory. I realize this is an APPLIED thermodynamics book intended for chemical engineers, but I still think it wholly incomprehensive. NOWHERE in the book is there even a sentence regarding the themodynamics of chemical reactions. Aren't chemical reactions important to the engineers performing them? Also, the majority of the mathematics behind all of the derivations is not included. Example: \\"for a throttle, dH=0.\\" I realize this is somewhat intuitive, but mention could at least be made of the reasoning behind it, guys (and preferrably more than one paragraph)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than LEFT BEHIND, but . . .","review":"THE THIRD MILLENNIUM is better than the LEFT BEHIND series because it doesn't try to drag it out, but it's still a pretty poor attempt at depicting the end times of biblical prophecy.

The Third Millennium is poorly written and simplistic beyond belief. Like this - the (evil) President of the United States decrees that all citizens will now carry ID cards starting with the digits 666, because that is his favorite number. Right, I'm sure that's how it's going to happen. And when the Chinese man says \\"ah so\\" I almost threw the book away. (Note to the author: without even mentioning your stereotyping, \\"ah so\\" is Japanese, not Chinese, you moron). This book is an embarrassment.

What was this man thinking when he wrote this? I cringe to think that so many LOVE this book. Folks, this is the reason why Christian literature and arts get such a bad rap from the secular world -- not because of the message, but because it's usually, like this book, cheezy, self-righteous, breathlessly simplistic JUNK.

The plot holes were large enough to manuever a diesel locomotive through, the characters were worse than two-dimensional...they were transparent, and Meier's view of the world is appallingly skewed. Further, The dialogue was stilted and flat, the scenery was non-existant...the entire philosophy was never really explained. Meier apparently believed that his readers would come to see his point of view through sheer force of will. Anyone considering reading, let alone shelling out good, hard-earned American dollars for, this garbage should seriously reconsider."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"This is one of the worst endtimes novels I've ever read. The dialouge is horrible, the characters paper thin and the plot obvious and boring. There's much better out there. Save your money and try We All Fall Down by Caldwell or the Last Day by Kleier. Both are thoughtful, wonderful reads. This is neither"},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of 3rd Millenium","review":"A wise man once said, \\"each day we live we are one step closer to death\\". The days that I spent torturing myself reading this drivel brought me 20 days closer to death. One part in particular stands out when the author chooses to ignore Revelations 10:10 and says, \\"The judgement day willth riseth on the blood covered shores of Jeruselum and death be its name\\". This is an obvious misprint for anyone who knows ANYTHING about the bible. Another horrible blunder by the author was to include a dog and cat as unlikely heroes of Christian soldiers. What the heck was that about!! I have never heard of anything so ridiculous. The one part that saved the entire book was where the doctor and his son went on a spirtual journey through Eden in their dreams. That was biblically accurate and had some real thought provoking moments. Overall, I wouldn't advise this book be read by anyone who seeks enlightenment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why not zero stars?","review":"I'm half way through this book and don't know if I can finish it. Please people, don't 5-star rate a book just because it happens to align with your form of religion. This book is terribly written, the characters are wholly unbelievable, and Meier is now on my list of authors never to read again.I'm actually quite intersted in the subject of this book, but the writing is simply too bad to enjoy. I continue to read it simply for the \\"car wreck\\" phenomenon... i just can't look away. Do yourselves a favor and read the actual bible, not this drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blech...","review":"While this book is more fast-paced than the Left Behind series, it isn't nearly as engaging. And I really wish that Meier hadn't stuck Robert Wise's (co-author of the next two books in the series) name on one of his characters. \\"Terbor Esiw\\" was a little too obvious and just plain stupid, IMHO. The numerology, prophecy explanations, and \\"Bible code\\" stuff was annoying and mind-numbing. Meier's appendix was much more interesting than the actual novel! I guess this is what you get when you let a \\"Christian psychologist\\" write fiction. Blah, blah, blah..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great introduction to the truth of the Bible and the endtime","review":"This was my first end times novel and while I agree with some of the criticisms of the writing style, etc., what Meier did for me as a new Christian was immeasurable! If anything, the book gives a complete, albeit simplistic, overview of the Rapture through the Second Coming of Jesus. I consider it a \\"primer\\" end times novel. After you have a grip on how the end times could happen, it's informative to read other novels that have different perspectives. What no one else has reviewed but which really placed this novel high on my list was the epilogue illustrating the truth and soundness of the Bible through an overview of fulfilled prophecy. Even if you don't like the word play in the novel itself, the epilogue is fascinating and informative reading. In fact, it was the reason that I began to read and research the Bible for myself and the rest, as they say, is history!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD, VERY BAD","review":"This book had potential, but the terrible character developement and choppy flow of the book blew it.

Try it with Colonel Conk's Bay Rum Shaving Soap and you've got yourself a date. I also highly suggest trying the other Clubman Pinaud aftershaves, each of them has an old-fashion barber shop scent that is certainly void into today's men's market.Word of the wise, this IS an alcohol-based aftershave, so some burning of the skin after you shave is expected.

If you want more concise understanding of the concepts, then I highly recommend purchasing the companion workbook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expect to need some back-up ...","review":"I am using this book at the moment for an undergraduate intermediate microeconomics course ...The text is quite verbose, and it really requires reading twice in some parts to pick out what you really need! I suggest having some mathematic text books with lots of economic examples, as a back-up ... this is because I feel the examples in the book are hard to use, in the sense that you are learning something new and the examples are not straight-forward, so make the concepts hard to pick up in some parts of the book.However, microeconomics is a huge subject and I wouldn't expect any one book to cover everything .... so expect to do some further reading to \\"catch\\" all concepts and get a good understanding of all the topics.Overall, the book covers what you need to know ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay","review":"I think this book is okay but as many reviewers have said the math is a little lacking. While math is important to economics, it isn't necessarily for the math's sake that that is so. Incorporating both the math and specific examples utilizing math really clarifies the theory. I found myself confused about what microeconomic theory meant when there wasn't a lot of numerical examples to back it up. There are far better text books to get a really thorough grasp of microeconomic theory, but if you already have that fundamental grasp I think this one might refresh your memory. But I would recommend others if you are looking to learn the theory for the first time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Verbose","review":"I used this book for the Cornell Econ 301 course, a calculus based intro to microeconomics. The professor taught everything in lecture so that the book was used only as a supplement. I read part of the book and found that it is too verbose and repetitive. The author could have explained everything in less than half of the book. The exercises are not helpful. Moreover, this little book is sold for more than a 100 dollars. Not worth the money at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull Blossoms","review":"Apparently, the fact that the author/former journalist has spent many years in prison for killing a policeman, gives this book a pass, for the author's many supporters.

However, the video quality of the Apollo performance is very raw. The producers of this set should have put a disclaimer on the package, or should have done some remastering of the footage, as Led Zeppelin did for their DVD set several years ago.But the performance is great. He starts out with a version of \\"If I Ruled the World.\\" Not the funk that may be expected from the Godfather but none the less, a good version. As the show goes on, it gets funkier and \\" I Got The Feeling\\" is James Brown at his best.I haven't had a chance to view the documentary from this set but I have seen it before on VH1 and it is quite good.Overall, great stuff but don't expect 21st Century quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst of the Worst","review":"I read about this DVD in the newspaper. It sounded like I would have the opportunity to view some of James Brown's great moves and singing.

I grew up feeling that James Brown, Aretha Franklin and the Temptations was the totality of everything positive that we, as children, needed in the ghetto in Chicago to give us direction and keep us within correction. Instead of getting into trouble, we formed groups and sang and danced to their marvelous songs. This item is beautiful, however, the ONLY thing missing is footage of the Famous Flames.

Al, as always, wrings the last drop from them, but some of them just don't contain much musical worth to begin with.

It would be better if the device were a 1/4\\" thinner. Upon installing you must lift away one of the outer 'E' strings to squeeze in the device between the string and the rim of the sound hole. It is bulky and that makes it difficult to avoid rubbing it against the sound hole rim. I hate doing that. My sound hole measures 4-3/8\\" in diameter. If your sound hole is 3/8\\" to 1/2\\" greater in diameter then squeezing might not be an issue.Does it work? Yes, brought up the humidity in the sound hole area 10%-15%.

Seward is a careful and deliberate historian, not hiding her failings but not twisting them to suit a romantic fairy tale or contemporary bias. He is one of the few historians not afraid to discuss the development of her spiritual life, especially after the death of her oldest son. He dismisses the rumors of an affair with Count Fersen as highly unlikely and not in accord with contemporary sources or with the queen's state of mind and moral habits. The build up to her final tragic hours is so well done that one is emotionally drained by glimpsing her sorrow.

I suspect that people who rated it poorly didn't follow correct installation as it is a bit tricky as others have pointed out. Note that it requires a phone with a detachable corded handset, it won't work with a regular cordless phone. I needed it because all my cordless phone headset jacks gets destroyed after a while, and the new cheaper cordless phones don't even have headset jacks any more, so the options were to buy this model and be attached to my desk (which is fine as I mostly talk at my desk), or to buy a more expensive cordless phone system with a headset jack, but then run the risk that the headset jack gets destroyed through over-use as in all my other phones (they last one, at most two years of plugging and unplugging a headset).

I will note that in general, the phone worked, with a few inconveniencies. Editing numbers in the phone book was a pain - to add a \\"1\\" or an area code to a saved number means deleting the whole number and starting over. However, since the handsets 'share' the phone book, the editing needed to only be done once. Still, competing phones have a much easier add/edit feature.After about a year, however, the handsets would not hold a charge. Logically, we replaced the batteries. The new batteries charged three days. The phones only display a 'searching' message, and annoyingly BEEP every 10 minutes or so.We cannot recommend this phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"0 stars - Battery issues","review":"As you'll see from other reviewers, there is definitely a battery issue here.

Replaced the AAA NiMH batteries per vtech customer support's recommendation, and the problem went away for about a month then started happening again. Sent it to vtech for replacement under warranty, and new set received uses a proprietary battery pack. Worked OK for 3 weeks, then the \\"CHECK BATTERY\\" error started AGAIN! Sent the 2nd set back, and just got yet another replacement after 3 weeks wait. Our 1 year warranty is over in about one week, so I'm guessing this 3rd set will wind up in the trash when (not if) it goes bad in a month or so. It seems the numbskulls at vtech blamed the problems on the battery and switched from AAAs to a special battery pack. However, I am certain the problem lies in the charging circuitry since we've seen the problem with both the old and the newer design handsets. We will never buy another vtech phone again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Sound Quality","review":"I purchased this phone about a week ago and will be returning it. The sound quality is awful.

We hang both phones up every night and they are charged at least 8 hours a day. Then the other handset started giving the same message. I looked into replacing the rechargeable batteries but found they were very expensive - not worth it for what I paid for the phone. To V-Tech's credit they sent me a brand-new phone - same model - about a year ago. Just last week the new phone started giving me the same message. I have always loved the V-tech phone and owned another one prior to this for about 5 years.

One of the big selling points of this CD is that it features original Asia member and certified guitar hero, Steve Howe as a special guest. Steve appears on only a few tracks at the end. He might as well have not been included, his quitar playing is barely audible in the mix. Do not buy this CD if you are expecting some great playing by Howe! Only buy it if you are a fan of the new Asia and must have a complete collection. John Payne does an adequate job in the vocal department. The CD does rock at some points and has it's moments, but is certainly not a \\"must have\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings back fond memories.","review":"I saw this particular line-up of ASIA in, of all places, Tulsa, Oklahoma, at the Yucatan Liquor Stand. It was in December 1992, almost a month after this show was recorded at the T & C. The recording, although not the best, is better than most of the live stuff I've heard from the \\"bootleg\\" series of ASIA CDs. Steve Howe was touring with them and as with this show, he didn't come on until later. Me and my friend (both of us YES fans) marveled at the fact that we were not more than 15 feet away from Steve Howe, and most of the \\"kids\\" in the place didn't even know who he was! While the reviews for this CD are typically mixed, I would recommend it for anyone who happened to catch them during the 92/93 tour. \\"Little Rich Boy\\" is a particular favorite, which at the time was played live but not available on the domestic release of AQUA."},{"rating":"1","title":"$9.10....are you crazy","review":"Are you guys crazy paying 9 dollars for 4 bars?

Norman Mclaren, Harry Smith. But I feel like these Brakhage films are a farce of what an art film is supposed to be like. The filmmaker seems to take what he is doing so seriously that it goes into parody of an \\"art\\" film. I've seen college level work and home movies that are more insightful and entertaining. I had the chance once to see Stan Brakhage live in New York to screen one of his newer films a few years back. It was a film he shot in Vancouver of the beach, and, seriously, it was like watching somebody's home movies of the beach. Then afterwards he goes into a discussion about the film and how it represents him dealing with illness and life and death. He was so pretentious and full of himself I had to laugh.

There's obviously no narrative, so the films would have to rely on beauty of composition. Sadly, there is none of that. These films never coalesce into a whole greater than the sum of their parts.

Most of Brakhage's admirers will be quick to point out that the DVD format is inherently deficient (Brakhage was an experimental filmmaker, and explored film's inherent, physical characteristics and opportunities to splendorous degree). It is a facsimile experience, not a full-fledged film screening. BUT we don't all have the means to obtain the films and the venue and rights to do a screening. For those of us who don't live in a community with those opportunities, this DVD is pretty great.As much as it's possible, Brakhage's films make you feel alive, aware of your senses, your desires, and your brain.

It is in a style that is interestingly informative giving the reader a look into the heart and mind of Scotland and the Scots. It contains a background on the history of the nation, but in a way so as not to send one off to sleep. It gives a context to allow one to develope an understanding of the Scottish psyche. Geddes MacGregor is a Scot who has lived out of Scotland, giving him an advantage of knowing his subject but also knowing what people who have never had the opportunity of going to Scotland want to know.

Okay. But the book is not another political history of kings, queens, battles and \\"Why Scotland Hates England.\\" I have a few of those and they're good for the purpose they serve. But this book is indeed an intimate and personal interpretation of Scotland from a man who obviously loves it very much. Great writing, wit, style, informative without being pedantic or dull. It's not a \\"history\\" of Scotland but a \\"portrait,\\" like it says. I first got it from my local public library. After reading it for an hour, I bought my own copy.

However, a month before I was actually able to see her, I had to convince my parents to let me go. I was 16 at the time and I knew that they would never let me go to the concert all by myself, specially in Mexico City. So, I started saving up, before I knew it I had 250 dollars saved up for my ticket to the concert and bus money. When I finally arrived at Mexico and saw her sing Inolvidable,Cuando Se Ama and the rest of the cd I couldn't believe it. She sounded exactlly like in the cd. She is truly one of a kind.

It describes a practice called Self-Remembering which makes us present-in-life and lifts us out of our robotic habits. It describes the emotional and chemical changes which happen in our body and mind when we do this practice. It talks about the two most important places to apply this willed effort (when we remember and when we are under an negative emotion which makes us not want to do it). The book gives a comprehensive advanced psychology which allows us to make deep sense of this practice. The only reservation about the book is that it makes the practice seem harder than it needs to be and it makes the theory feel overintellectual at times. This detracts from its practical value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wisdom along the Way","review":"This details the beginning and ongoing development of the teachings of P.D. Ouspensky that evolved from his years of emersion in Eastern wisdom and the teachings of G.I. Gurdjieff. It is an outstanding follow up to \\"In Search of the Miraculous, Fragments Of an Unknown Teaching\\", his classic work published in 1949 and still in publication. It is my sense that the reader is drawn to such books when their spiritual path crosses a point where they beckon. It is then, while reading, an immediate sense of \\"the familiar\\" or \\"truth\\" is intuitively experienced. Read other reviews for details and should this book call to you, read it. If not, don't force it. Try something else. Maybe \\"The Power of Now\\", by Eckhart Tolle or \\"Faith\\" by Sharon Salzberg. It is not a matter of spiritual progress.

It is not an easy book to read. For the most part, it contains highly esoteric teachings which are largely unimportant. This notwithstanding, some of the topics covered are noteworthy. These include the sections on negative emotions, identification, and the need for sincerity.Anyone interested in studying and learning about highter consciousness should read a book entitled, \\"I Am That,\\" by SRI Nisargadatta Maharaj. This book is the most insightful and comprehensive volume on mysticism I have ever read. Another excellent resource on the same subject is, Handbook to Higher Consciousness, by Ken Keyes.

How Capstick calls taking potshots at animals hundreds of metres away 'fair game' I'll never know. I have worked on game reserves in South Africa and the first thing I learned was that the true measure of one's 'manhood' is not how accurately they can place a pellet in an animals head from afar but rather, one's ability to stalk and coexist. To shoot is easy, but to study, follow and enjoy is the true challenge. Capstick's lame attempts to justify the slaughter as 'conservation' are transparent and represent the consumerism and exploitation that has eaten away at the African habitat through Western Imperialism. If you want to learn about wildlife then look at the modern day animal safari books instead of the primative blood-lusting acts of cowardice which South Africa wishes to erase from its memory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cowardly acts","review":"Anyone interested in books on wildlife may have chanced upon this nut called Peter Hathaway Capstick. I made the mistake of buying this video hoping for some footage of art of tracking different animals. What I watched on the video was truly disgusting, a bunch of cowards going after innocent animals with powerful guns equipped to shoot at animals from safe distances. Mr.Capstick also fashions himself as some kind of a hero with all his talk and posturing as someone knowledgable about the African bush and one may also get the false impression after reading his book, but his true identity is clear on the video. He is a wheezy old geezer who thinks he is being a man by shooting at these animals who would probably not dare to even take a step in the bush without his gun.

The lyrics sound like they were written by someone with a single-digit IQ who was intoxicated as well. How this group-or whatever they really were-got to be so popular is truly beyond me. \\"Taking Care of Business\\" ranks, in my opinion, as one of the stupidest songs ever written in recording history.

Otherwise, this is still the pulse-pounding thriller that we discordians have loved for decades. I don't disagree with the edits or the copyright so much, but I *am* disturbed at the publisher's decision to replace all the commas with small pictures of tree frogs, which is why I've had to reduce my review to 4 stars.

One wonders how his wife must feel to know that her worth is so reduced in his eyes and advertised to the world.I find it unimaginable that any thoughtful, intelligent, self accountable, and intellectually responsible person could endorse the antiquated beliefs expounded in this arrogant and guilt laden confessional. This book is a treatise of judgemental, hypercritical opinion spun as right wing philosophy and is unspeakable. There are a lot of right wing politically oriented people who are quite fine folks who do not need to attack people as this author has chosen to do in the self serving disguise of cruel humor.

His was the only voice of decency and common sense--and humor--in that rag.I agree with Harry that \\"The Left\\" (aka Liberalism) has been taken over by people who want freedom without responsibility, who have no conscience or morals (Clinton being the ultimate example of it), who brook no alternative views (otherwise known as intolerance)--and get away with all of it, thanks to a complicit media. Whereupon 20 years ago being Liberal meant a philosophy of freedom, opportunity and Liberty (religious and otherwise) for all. Yesterday's Liberals are really Libertarians today. What happened?

However, I believe I found an error: Zachary Taylor is listed as the answer to the question, \\"What American general commanded at the capture of Mexico City during the Mexican War?\\" I believe the correct answer is Winfield Scott.That aside, this was a most enjoyable book.

I can't understand why people criticize this cd simply because of its christian lyrics. Just pay attention to the music that so limited amount of people can create: a masterpiece. You can really tell that Neal was not alone while writing One. This time, he was open with drummer Mike Portnoy (especially in Author of Confusion) and bassist Randy George. This CD is heavier than Testimony, although it still contains the great touches of violin and others. If you are open-minded to different types of rythmes in the same song, just buy this album.

This is not Neal's best work (? is) but there is enough here to keep even the pickiest prog fan happy and quite content. There are some Christian lyrics but they are done with very good taste and stick to the flow of the storyline. People that have a problem with these lyrics probably have just completely shut God out of their lives and really can't help but hate the words that shed light because of the darkness they are living in. Kind of like Plato's cave. But they probably don't even know who that is either..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Undiscovered Prog Masterpiece","review":"This is one great concept album. It's a shame it never gets any airplay. The musicianship is fantastic with lots of chord changes and reoccuring themes. This is a great listen.

Normally my son loves the songs and sings along with them but on this one he just fusses for me to skip past the singing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dinobore film.","review":"Despite the characters being as strong as they ever were, this is without doubt the weakest of the series. The main problem is with the villains (a beak-happy bird and a crocodile), who are uninteresting and irritating. Anyway, shouldn't villains in this series be dinosaurs?

Our viewing has coincided with an interest in dinosaurs by my 4 year-old son. So, he's learned a lot about dinosaurs from them. And the movies are wholesome and promote friendship and good behavior.THIS EPISODE WAS A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT BECAUSE OF THE MEAN-SPIRITED BANTERING OF THE TWO VILLAINS. The prehistoric crocodile and pterasaur (dinosaur bird) are constantly telling each other how much they \\"hate\\" each other. There is a song they sing back and forth about how \\"I need you like a hold in the head\\" and that type of thing. And their voices are terribly annoying.I was immediately uncomfortable, but then I heard my son starting to say this stuff to his sister...HEY, I KNOW THE KIDS ARE GOING TO PICK UP MEAN LANGUAGE SOMEWHERE, BUT WHY ENCOURAGE IT?MY ADVICE: LAND BEFORE TIME I-III DO NOT SUFFER FROM THIS LOW LANGUAGE."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's the villians, I tell you! The villains!","review":"This movie is the very embodiment of what annoys me about sequels. Worthless, annoying villians. The crocodile and the bird annoy me to no end. Their pointless short lived song, 'Who needs you, not me' made me unhappy, to put it mildly. They, in esence, sang about not liking each other, and walked away from each other for a grand total of .5 seconds before coimg back to talk about 'how to get those kids'. This baffles me. Why not just get a different source of food and have Little Foot and crew battle the elements? I'd disgard the movie only because of the pointless villians, but the plot all-in-all is slow and dull. I'm not even sure your kids will enjoy this one. It's too boring. It's about as fun as watching paint dry, or grass grow. Wait, maybe I wouldn't go that far. Grass growing and paint drying is a little bit more fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT!?!?!?","review":"WHAT IN THE NAME OF GOD IS THIS?!?! This is definately not a Land Before Time movie! We have two incredibly dumb-as-a-doorknob and very idiotic villians with really boring names. We have an incredily dumb plot where \\"What's his face's grandfather\\" is ill. I mean, COME ON!! Give the audience a better plot like a race against time or something! But introducing a female dinosaur amazingly similair to that dumb dino-brain is just plain boring. Then that brainless oaf Spike actually says one word for once: Ducky. Couldn't he have said something like \\"Wow! I can finally talk?\\" But when we finally think he is going to say something after he discovers he can talk, what does he do? He just inhales and eats a big pile of cowpie.

And I was fairly contented with the amount of information that LP has for this book. It has a detailed coverage of Manhattan and its neighborhoods, and it covers areas outside Manhattan more extensively than the other book.The one complaint I have about this edition is that they do not double-check the maps. The map at p. 282 especially is at fault. For example, the Majestic Theater is at w 44th St. but the map lists it as somewhere in 41st St. Perhaps somebody forgot to proofread the maps this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just stick to Fodor's.","review":"I actually returned this book. It had next to no pictures and was very poorly organized. The categories were neither by theme nor geography, so it was really hard to find anything or make much sense of the book.

If they want to continue to be the go-to reference for me, they have to clean up their act on the digital version and actually field test their product before unleashing it on the unsuspecting public.What they need to to to improve their digital guide:Google style maps with improved scrolling and searchClick on an icon and have the info (eats, drinks, sights) pop up.Better indexing of articlesI still buy the print versions of the LP guides but feel they are far behind in making the digital versions as useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what i ordered","review":"this item arrived, and was not what i ordered. was a MUCH cheaper/lower line/version of a Pro-2 microphone. after contacting seller, and amazon.com, i was refunded my purchase amount. seller gave a \\"song & dance\\" about selling itmes on a thread that was an \\"existing thread\\" because there was no thread for this exact particular item. here's an idea, create a thread for this exact item, and don't list it as something else. in fact, this item was so cheap that the seller never asked for the item back. shows how absolutely CHEAP the item that was sent to me is.FAIL!.

Mom loves it too because the math help not only gives the answer but explains the steps on how to arrive at the answer.For my book...money well spent.

It is ok as a supplement to text books, particularly where a graphing calculator is used, but will not tutor students as claimed in a systematic fashion.

However to me the only consistency was that Lennon was always going to be attracted to Asian women, George will still find fault in religion, Ringo stands by his friends, and Paul will always be the star. However, there was too much drivel and too little fun.

Womanizer who marries American celebrities who are known skanks? Doubt it. Ringo came the closest to the possible. I can see him married, fooling around, drumming for money on weekends barely making ends meet, drinking too much and too concerned about looking good.I could forgive the plot if the writing was better but it's bad. Nothing much happens but a lot of complaining about what could have been. That got boring. And maybe the slang they use is correct but you need a story.

Not the best book, but surely above par."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read for Beatle fanatics","review":"A wonderfully well-told story of an alternate universe that was only another dumb corporate decision away from really happening. Larry has sure nailed the personalities of the four lads. At times laugh out loud funny, at times touchingly poignant, at times frightening at what could have been. This book is a great exercise in imagination by a terrific story-teller. I dug the political subtext - but you don't have to in order to enjoy this book. In the end it proves what a force in the world the Beatles truly were, by showing us what would have happended if they weren't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfying","review":"'Liverpool Fantasy' works primarily as a vision of an alternative England, rather than a world without the Beatles. As other reviewers have pointed out, it's unlikely that John would've faded into the woodwork. His work would not have been as substantial without McCartney (and vice-versa), but he would have been a presence *somewhere*. The author fails to integrate the known characteristics of John, Paul, George, and Ringo effectively and bring them to life.

This book is just like Fires in Winter, which is just like A Heart So Wild, which is just like... Well, you get the idea. Face it: Ms. Lindsey writes by template. She uses one plot, changing only the details such as names, places, physical characteristics. The first time she wrote the plot, it was great, then she wrote it at least 10 times in the 80s alone, and probably more than that in the 90s. It wears thin.

Otherwise, buy with extreme caution.PS, I like, \\"Watch Me Jumpstart,\\" \\"The Devil & Daniel Johnston,\\" \\"Slow Century\\" and all the Talking Heads movies, documentary or otherwise.

But it just would not work on my Windows XP SP2 laptop. Another bluetooth USB dongle works fine for me.Contacted Zoom support- got prompt replies, also got a new beta version of the driver. Exchanged numerous (at least 10) emails and had at least 5 phone sessions. But that didn't help.In the process I definitely learnt about Bluetooth a whole lot but finally had to return the product back because it just wouldn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"zoom bluetooth","review":"I purchsed this card because I wanted a solution that would allow me to have a wireless mouse without a dongle that could snap off a USB port. It also was to provide the ability to use a GPs, bluetooth headphones and syncing my Dell Axim.well the mouse worked fine, however the card does not support the necessary technology to use the headphones and I couldnt get the axim to syncultimatly i sold the card on ebay because it couldnt work with the headphone, now keep in mind this isnt a headset. these were sterio headphone for music.the clencher was when i called zoom and they said they would call me back with a solution. I never heard anything.Due to poor custmer service and a product that is incapable of accomplishing my goal I had no choice but to get rid of it.

At first I tried using the Bluetooth stack from on the mfr provided CD, which didn't work. I then tried uninstalling that and using the Bluetooth support built into Windows XP. I got the network connectivity to work barely (three ping responses and then got the error message \\"general failure\\") just once - couldn't get that to work reliably. And I could not get anything to work with Palm OS sync (apparently other reviewers have had success with Microsoft ActiveSync but I don't have a Windows-based Treo). Finally, trying to sync caused my Treo to crash. That's a PalmOS problem not a Zoom problem, but it made the card useless to me.

I saw the band several times during '79 and the quality of this recording undermines some of my fondest memories of them.There are portions that sound as if you're listening from another room entirely and others with your head stuck in a bass bin. If I remember correctly, these shows were recorded while the Hawks were out of contract, having left Charisma, and they self-recorded these shows and hawked(!) the tapes around until Bronze picked them up - so maybe Bronze cherry-picked the best for 'Live '79'. For the record 'Satellite' is 'The Phenomenon of Luminosity' from 'Church Of Hawkwind'.Whereas 'Live '79' is very good this is poor - sometimes less is more!

Although I'm not a fan of the mystery genre, I was looking forward to reading it. The central plot involving the suicide or possible murder of a civil servant involved in black magic is surpisingly uninteresting, the pace plodding and the 'revelation' predictable. The periphary characters are heavy-handed from the all too free-spirited civil servant couple to the all too anguished Dachau survivor. The only sub-plot of interest involves an adolescent crush which also gives the book its rare suspense. The coincidentals of the plot are absurd to the point of being Dickensian and the story ties up altogether too neatly (and happily) although I did enjoy the final irony of the love-sick teenagers.

The weapons are the sillyest weapons I ever saw in my gaming life, there isn't any enjoyment in using them neither they are realistic neither funny to use (Serious Sam like).All in all I don't recommend this game in any way, save you money to some thing worth.

The later songs on this album are still acoustically beautiful, but do not have the same lyrical appeal as previous albums (with exception to the final track).

Good luck trying to get your iPod *out* of its case once it gets into it. Why, you ask, would you want to get your iPod out of this sleek looking case? Perhaps because, like me, you realize that the case's thickness prevents the use of the docking station (but not the cable by itself), Apple's A/V out cable (which goes into the headphone jack), and Griffin's iTalk voice recorder.If you only plug headphones into your iPod, then the case is great.

I purchased the case and it doesn't fit. I notice some reviews mentioned that their box had two inserts - one for the 30 GB, and one for the 60/80 GB version. Mine didn't. No instructions, bare packaging, doesn't fit.Buyer beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nearly perfect case","review":"This case is excellent. The plastic is very tough and has withstood several drops onto the hard floor (luckily the iPod also was fine). The \\"brushed metal\\" face isn't brushed metal so much as it is a pattern of circular ridges, concentric with the click wheel, so that the whole face feels like an extension of the click wheel, a subtle but nice effect. The plastic parts of the case do scratch, but of course the iPod is protected. My favorite feature is that this case also covers and protects the click wheel.Minor drawbacks: the case is thick enough that it makes the iPod feel more bulky -- indeed, it in fact makes it more bulky (my iPod is an 80 gig Video).

Listen, for example, to how they take the Lennon-McCartney chestnut, \\"Things We Said Today,\\" and make it sound like a new take on a bluegrass song, not just a bluegrass take on a Beatles' song. And just listen to how Chris Hillman's version of Steve Stills's \\"4 + 20\\" sounds so much more convincing than Stills's own melodramatic rendition. There are 12 cuts on this recording, mostly acoustic but with a little electricity thrown in, mostly bluegrass but a with a little country thrown in. The sound quality is clean and well-balanced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much steel!","review":"Well, for me, their first album was everything I could ever ask for; and the second, well, just an average bunch of songs BY COMPARISON - still wonderful, though.

But my car is a 302 V8. For some reason, it seems to be switching between the 2 settings on its own. I can tap it with my finger nail and get it to function properly again for a while. I will have to pull it and maybe try flicking the switch on the back between the 2 settings 100 times or so and see if that fixes the problem.

Just listen to her scat her way thru \\"Yatra Ta\\" the 1st track, and the energy and fun never end. Maria also sounds great on \\"Cry Me A River\\" and a Brazilian version of \\"The Island\\" which Sarah Vaughan would later imortalize in english!

The range is very poor. I can't even get them to go 8 feet in a wall-less (?) room without getting fuzzy and breaking up. Plus, when you get out of range, in order to restore the signal, you have to go all the way back to the receiver and physically TOUCH the bottom of the mic to the antenna. One of the two antenna receivers broke while I was putting it away, and I'm not careless with my stuff.So, trust me, you won't get any good use out of this model. Naxa is not a good brand.

The construction feels very cheap, and the instruction manual makes absolutely no sense as if written by a 3-year old. And the worst of all, only one of the two microphones worked. Even the one that works is horrible--the sound out of the speaker is very weak unless you cup your hand around your mouth and the mic. It uses a 9-volt battery in each of the two mics, and that's another 5 bucks out of my pocket. You know what?

I had way less than the load plugged into it, yet every time I got a brownout, this unit would beep and all devices (including computer & switch) would go offline and stay off until I reset the UPS. Worst part was that any devices NOT plugged in to the unit were usually fine in these situations! What's the point in the unit?

It's my first Leslie Sansone DVD, but I'm sure there will be many more added to my collection soon. The workouts are challenging but I'm still able to do them all the way through without modifications. I started very unfit, but now only a few weeks into it, I can feel a definite difference in my body. I was tired of workouts being ridiculous prancing around and Leslie's workouts are practical, effective, and to the point. Her encouragement is genuine and there's a general light-hearted feel of just getting together with friends. I've only added exercise to my life without changing eating habits yet and the pounds are dropping off. This DVD has been life changing for me and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a real way to lose weight."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Leslie Sansone, that should say it all....","review":"As always, a good solid routine.

Only gets 4 starts because it is not very inspiring and does not have great music.Anyone can do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pleased","review":"This program was recommended to me by a friend in the Weight Watchers community. I was skeptical of how one \\"walks at home\\". It's a cross somewhere between marching and walking in place. In any event, there is a one mile beginner walk and then you can go up to more miles. Incorporated into each walking session are other simple side steps, kicks, knee lifts, hand movements. I'm very pleased with my purchase. If you are just starting out you can do the one mile and that is still a good workout. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happen Leslie?","review":"I love Leslie Sansone's walk exercise programs and I have about 4 DVD's. This is the worst. The music is too low to the point you can barely hear it. Everyone seems like they are off beat. I can't even watch them while they move because it throws off my workout. Because you are basically doing the same moves for every workout I think the music should be good and loud enough to hear as well as the people should be on beat. I am in the process of trying to get rid of it via ebay, so if you want it for cheap, check out ebay later this week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leslie's Greatest Hits","review":"Instead of buying my friend chocolate or candy, I decided to get her this DVD for Valentine's Day since she's trying to get back in shape. I'm a fan of Leslie's 1 mile/2 mile DVD so I thought this was perfect for her because it's low impact cardio but challenging enough to work up a sweat.She is happy with the DVD itself, but not so happy that the package arrived with a big tear and was left in a puddle of water outside for her to collect.From my own personal experience, if you're out of shape and looking to add cardio to your workout regime, this is a great start. The moves are uncomplicated, and you can do as much or as little as your body can manage. And with different work outs, you can mix and match based on your exercise goals.I love that it's basically 5 workouts for the price of one, and with this price who can complain?Leslie needs to put out some more new content, I'm definitely a fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent !!","review":"This DVD is fantastic.

The Penguin Guide had highy recommended this recording, so I gave it a shot.The CD is fantastic. The ballet revolves around, as the title implies, a girl who is not carefully watched; a comic, light-hearted ballet based upon the average individual. The music is also light, but Lanchbery's arrangement adds some depth to the sound and the result is simply enjoyable. The recording is very good, the sound is full and well balanced. Having heard no other recording, I cannot say for myself, but as previously mentioned, the Penguin Guide considers this to be a \\"key\\" recording. The Bonynge bonus is also well performed and cannot disappoint.This recording is well worth your exploration."},{"rating":"2","title":"lust ,lies and cheaters","review":"this was a good story about infidelty in a marriage of both spouses, and the consequence of it . it was a easy read and the author keep the pages turning.good writing style and i will be reading on her next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy this if you liked \\"O Brother Where Art Thou\\"","review":"I completely agree with reviewer Nancy L and only wish I had read her review before wasting my money.

It's not the same.

Taken from the artists' individual albums rather than being recorded for this specific recording, the listener is nonetheless presented with some of the finest bluegrass music in the country today. [Note: I did NOT qualify that statement by gender!] Song selection ranges from the upbeat (\\"If Wishes Were Horses\\"), to the mournful (\\"Sad Situation\\") to the inspirational (\\"Will There Be Any Stars?\\"). Most of these tracks were recorded within the past decade and several have appeared on other Rounder collections (notably Hand-Picked: 25 Years of Bluegrass), but if you're looking for a solid introduction to bluegrass music led by women, this is an excellent primer. RECOMMENDED"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great intro to women's bluegrass","review":"I disagree PROFOUNDLY with the other two reviewers. This is a great introduction to a part of bluegrass that has only recently come to the attention of the public. Of course, bluegrass has only come to the attention of the greater American public via that Down from the Mountain tour and the O Brother Where Art Thou? film. Those of us who have loved bluegrass for any length of time PRIOR to those excursions know that great bluegrass is where you find great instrumentalists and vocalists. This collection shows the very best of both worlds. The singers capture great depth in their emotionally charged songs, and these girls show that the \\"bluegrass boys network\\" is not closed, and that they, too can pick with the best of them. Definitely well worth every penny!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vegetables from the Sea","review":"I did not like the receipts and for that I am sorry I bought the book.

It was more intense subject matter than we'd prefer.I don't recommend this DVD.

His tracks are so down-home cracklin', as is his voice! Slim's fun, gospel-fied, punk-grass will move you and get you movin'. Cameos from the Pedal Steel, Accordion and Trombone elevate the songs. In addition to Slim's furious strumming, the listener is treated to heavy doses of Rhodes electric keys, Hammond b3 organ, \\"Ragtime\\" piano and a sweet drum kit!Yee-ha!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pick this up!","review":"I picked this up based on the fact that it had fun album art and and the tag said foot stamping love songs, this tag is in fact true. This is a up beat collection of love songs and ditties. I really enjoyed the album for its witty light hearted lyrics and fantastic untamed tunes. While lite the musicianship is excelent. Langhorne Slim's voice is enchanting and the tinny quality to the recording really adds to the gritty feel of the album. Overall, this is just a really enjoyable album for listening to by yourself, to play in the background of a party or to dance madly to on the street."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a super soaker","review":"It's not a soaker - not even close.

The book was published shortly after the two authors graduated from their prospective graduate schools at Yale University. The story is a fictionalized acount of Hitlers troops moving east into the Russian steppes during WWII. Levinthal employs model soldiers in a realistic manner to convey the horrors of war and reveal the nature of play. Levinthal, having no direct experience with war, literally played with the soldiers in setting up the scenes. In doing so the only knowledge he used was his education from war movies, television series and magazine stories about war.

In this book Carrell describes the monumental attempt by over two hundred German and Axis allied divisions to conquer lebensraum for the Fuhrer. Translated from the original German, it is the quintessential history of the bloodiest, most ferocious military campaign of the twentieth century.

Shearmur does an excellent job of balancing and constrasting the different ideas represented in the movie plot.Chimes represent the mystery surrounding Prot and give the songs an \\"extra-terrestrial\\" feel, deep violin tones to signify the more somber and saddening parts, and piano to represent the beauty Prot brought to the lives of all he touched.

It's wonderful for removing yourself from your mind for a few minutes. I listen to it while driving on the highway and it's so relaxing, it has a sort of ambient techno-quality to it. It is also great to fall asleep to. If anyone likes Moby they would appreciate this soundtrack.This is similar to The Fog of War, where the movie would not have been as fantastically defined if it weren't for the life-changing soundtrack by Phillip Glass.

Having been trained in the western style of Reiki as well as the more traditional Japanese style Reiki, I found the Reiki Sourcebook to be an excellent source of information about Reiki, its beginnings, its history, the people involved in its development during the early 20th century, as well as some of the techniques. The information on Japanese culture is excellent as is the information on lineage. The glossary is brilliant. The authors have also included a comprehensive list of Reiki associations around the world. This book stands head and shoulders above the many other Reiki books that I have read. It is a must for every Reiki practitioner to have in their library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hanna Montana","review":"My 10 year old daughter lives for this DVD.

Hah? because lots of other people get disapointed when you say that stuff because they like her or love her! Okay, now the good things about it: she can dance well, she's not another Hilary Duff, and last, she actually has talent unlike fergie, paris hilton, jibbs, and so on. So do y'all out there agree with me? If you do, say this review was helpful, if you don't, you're a stinker!

Her father/manager is played by Mr Achy Breaky Heart himself, Billy Ray Cyrus (this is what he's been reduced to).There are 28 episodes on this disc and sure it's often corny and cheesy, but there is something cute and good about it that will have wide appeal to a lot of tweens and pre-teens.

If you like strategy games then you will love this one... I highly recommend this game. And thats just for the single player mode... online play is just addicting. Too many game types to choose from and it seems to be different every time. Great online support, a must have for your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Game","review":"I got this game as soon as I bought my 360. I was amazed at the quality of the graphics of the game. I have an HDTV so it looked like I was in the action myself. The controls are a little hard to get used but you get used to them after a while. There are only two things that I didn't like about this game and that your teamates would sometimes just sit there and get shot at. I also hate that the campainge wasn't as long as I hoped it would be. Everything else was very good about this game. I would recomend this to all who like shooter video games and who love the military."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ghost Recon is one of those must have games","review":"Ghost Recon has been a very succesful franchise for Ubisoft. Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter is probably the best one yet. The game does take a little while to get into the flow of things, but after a while the intensity really picks up. The AI is very good, and the graphics are amazing. GRAW was one of the first smash hits for the 360 as well.If you're a Tom Clancy game fan, I highly recommened this game. After all, it is Ghost Recon."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have","review":"GRAW is one of the best games out there for the xbox360. Great 1st/3rd person shooter and multi player too. I do have to say that this game is hard and the learning curve is pretty shallow. I'll list a few issues but it's still worth buying.- There are some bugs. You and even your team mates can get stuck in walls.- AI for your troops is not the best.- Game felt short."},{"rating":"1","title":"B rate game killed by Bugs","review":"I have played this game to my end point something like 12 times. This took like 6 hours. How did it take 30 minutes to beat it? Simple. Every time that I called in an Apache to take out a tank, it would come in low, sweep around the tank, and then leave without firing a shot, never to return. The tank that it should have killed then murdered the president of mexico, ending the game. w00t. 1337, dude. $2 per minute of first time through gameplay is the worst deal on a video game that I have ever gotten, hands down. If I had paid $30 for Doom95 Freeware, that would have been a better deal. Also, leading up to this point, I fell through several obscure patches of dirt into hewhaY (also known as avoheJ, hallA, or doG), the creatorless zone; hence the name. I don't know how many bugs there would or would not have been in the rest of the game, but it seems that there were at least a few.It doesn't matter how good a game you can't play is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly poor multiplayer","review":"First things first. I am a 45 year old guy that still plays the occasional video game with my son-in-law or son if he's in town.Second, I am a HALO2 fan but lately avoid XBOX Live due to the nasty little children that always seem to be there and only also seem to know one word. Now, if Master Chief could just wash their foul little mouths out with soap that would indeed be \\"sweet\\".Now. GRAW is simply poorly done. This only refers to multiplayer on XBOX Live. You will find that you must wait for everything. Wait for XL to find a game, wait to be allowed into the game, wait while XL finds another game after the host bails out.Yes, the graphics are nice, yes the controls are different from other games (HALO2 specifically). XBOX Live multiplayer is simply frustrating and annoying. I'm glad I didn't pay a ton of money for this thing, it simply isn't worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Next-Gen","review":"I Bought this game with the intention of seeing amazing graphics and spectatular next gen action, and well, that isnt what i got.

There really isn't much more that I can say that hasn't already been said. It's a solid fun game. You can find cheats and it makes it even more fun.I only have a couple of complaints...The online gaming is not very good, props to them for coming up with something a little different than the regular game, but I would have rather had the same features as the regular game (the controls are different, you don't have your HUD (well, at least the part where it displays enemies), etc.Also, it takes too long to reload on any weapon. I just don't think it's realistic at all, it should only take 2 or 3 seconds, and it's more like 5 or 6. When you are in the heat of a battle, you need to be able to reload quicker than that (and realistically, you DO).Other than those two things, it is GREAT!! 10/10 in my book. A must-own game for any XBOX 360 owner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest military game I have ever played!","review":"This game is a must-have for Xbox 360! The graphics are perfect, the gameplay is great, and the storyline is spectacular! You shouldn't have any glitches unless you have a used or scratched one. People unfamiliar with the Ghost Recon series may have problems with staying alive in some levels. The controls are pretty good and the HUD feature is great! It helps you by locating enemies, locating objective areas, and showing where other people or things are even if you are nowhere near it. Some modes in this game, like co-op, are not that good. I think other modes make up for it, like campaign. Many people beginning to play military games WILL like this game. There is a sequel coming out in March. Buy this game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best tactical game ever!","review":"This is a fantastic game! The tactical experience you will have playing this game, is very close to what it takes to actually run a squad. Very true to form!In addition, online play is second to none!

Graphics could use a little improvement though...probably 8 out of ten...but that doesn't make it any less of a game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good shoes","review":"Great shoes.

I mean mandatory need.And oh by the way it really is the greatest guitar sound you've ever heard. And oh by the way, Greg plays with an agility that lets his energy and ideas through unrestricted. And he sings with an emotion that Cobain (may the Lord rest his soul) never achieved.Lots of fans of bad bands think that said bands were \\"too good to become famous\\". You could almost say this about the Wipers, but Greg was anti-\\"success\\", and it worked. Unfortunately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Being from Portland, the Wipers were a band I always knew about but somehow never actually saw. Their heyday in Portland ended right before I turned 21, to my eternal chagrin. Greg Sage is one of the great unkown rock stars of all time, bow down before him.Kurt Cobain wanted to be Greg Sage.

I had to spend sixty-dollars to learn this! If you like multi-players, then this is your average run-of-the-mill multi-player. However, if you are like me and, really only enjoy playing single-player, consider yourself warned, the single-player campaign consists of mulit-player maps with AI competing against you.

Why can't they put them on the back for god's sake? I'm not sure what kind of glue they use on those, but it took a scraper to get it off. Doing so quickly revealed that the color is not consistent all the way through the product. The scratches from taking stickers off turned white. Also, there isn't adequate space in the slots to get a decent size screw in. There are better products out there (i.e. Gladiator) and I'd stay away from the cheaper stuff like this.Update: Everything is assembled and the baskets are attached, but it doesn't take much weight to pull them out of the slats.

I never abused it took very good care of it and now after reading all the reviews most people have had the same issues. I felt that it could rank and hold up to the Wolfgang Puck bistro deep fyrer and it did for two weeks. So I'm back on the market and very disapointed I really liked this unit.

We kept it clean and took good care of it, but to no avail. I called customer service and reported that many of us are seeing this problem, but they could do no more than offer to repair it at a cost of $20-$30 plus $9 shipping, since it was past the year warranty. That is a lot of effort and money and I have had poor experiences with repair jobs where there can be a lot of back and forth before you get a working unit.

I don't think it is the best or most thorough guide out there, but the photographs really bring this book on an even keel with others likeSt. John : Feet, Fins and Four Wheel Drive.I think more important is that the photos in the book and the very concise beach guide make a nice coffee table book for after the trip when you want to show off the places you went.

In general, the book is OK but, what is not true to form is the portrayal of most of sub Saharan Africa as a village. All the stories are about poor kids in villages with mud huts! From the book, one would assume yes, Africa is not a continent but, just a series of villages with no electricity nor running water; perpetuating yet another myth about Africa.It would have been good to also read about the bustling city of Douala where kids rush to catch the school bus or, loud Nairobi with the matatus that take the school kids on field trips.

The author goes to great extent (too far?) pointing out her qualifications and experience with doing this, but is it necessary? A good one-third of the book could be dropped without noticing.

For $29.99, I expected an interactive DVD, at least some chapters!- the exercises are virtually the same that came with the free DVD included with the Performer I purchased! (Level 1), so if you already have Level 1, you are wasting $29.99- the DVD is short, I expected more variations and more exercises.- the teacher is good but nothing spectacular.

I think someone decided to mix Chavela Vargas' authentic voice with some syrupy, sappy guitars and vocals by god-knows-who. It has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with the austere and pure artistry that is Chavela Vargas' voice.

On this album you will find \\"Can't You See\\" and \\"Heard It In A Love Song\\", arguably the most popular of the original band's recordings, and written by Toy Caldwell. Unfortunately, Toy's brother Tommy Caldwell passed away due to an accident in 1980. Tommy was the leader of the band, playing a great bass, and the younger brother of Toy. Toy then passed away in 1993 from a rare type of heart disease.

I'm not familiar with other MTB tunes, but they sure have a lot of albums available. There are no liner notes, so I don't know where the other 8 tracks of this CD came from, but they sound like they are from the early 80's & are very wimpy after hearing the 2 big hits. I also wonder why this album is named after the least interesting song on this collection. I guess I should have gotten a more expensive MTB album if I wanted to hear more great 70's southern rock worthy of being on the same disc with \\"Can't You See\\" & \\"Heard It In A Love Song\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute title.......boring book!","review":"Once again Jane and Shelley have put me to sleep!

I hope Ms. Churchill brings back the old Jane and Shelley soon. I miss them."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of a peep than a scream","review":"I have to admit to being rather ambivalent about Jill Churchill's books at this point (this is the fifth I've read). They're definitely light and fluffy, but perhaps a bit too fluffy. And there is the irony that the main character, Jane, is supposed to be a \\"grammar buff\\", but the book itself had a few obvious grammatical mistakes (I should have written them down at the time, I can't remember them now!). The story was... okay... the writing was... okay. Nothing special, nothing awful - it's one of those books that if you read a few hundred books a year, it's worth giving a quick read. But if you read less than that, or if it's going to take you more than a day to read it, I wouldn't bother. There are far better mystery novels out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"I used to love the Jane Jeffry books","review":"and would look forward eagerly to every new one. The lastest two, however, have been dire. In 'A Midsummer Night's Scream' the plot was banal and the characters two-dimensional. What was Elizabeth for? And Tazz? They served no purpose at all, as far as I could see. Why do Ms Churchill's characters all refer to each other as 'Mrs So-and-so', even after they've been acquainted for some time? It's needlessly old fashioned and grates on me more and more with each new book.My major nitpick, however, is for the gushing comment from the new literary agent Jane has found regarding Jane's grammar. \\"This is she\\" is correct but unbelievably stilted in this day and age. Later in the book, however, Jane told another character \\"You did good.\\" Execrable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing--and bad grammar!","review":"I have read other Jill Churchill novels, and this one definitely is the worst. I would hazard to guess it is ghost-written by a very amateur writer. The detail about needlepoint and food, plus the extra characters who added nothing to the novel, just detracted from the story line. If these extraneous items were omitted, how much of the novel would be left? Characters seemed lacking in any dimensionality at all, with stilted conversation. Do these characters ever work at real jobs? Unbelievable! And to top it off, the stilted, incomplete sentences and bad grammar added to the choppiness of the dull conversation. Compared to other mystery novels, of which I read many, this seemed to be written at kindergarten level. Finally, the recommendations on the cover, which dared to compare this novel to Dame Agatha Christie, were insulting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, this was a lousy book","review":"I second most of the feelings expressed by the people before me who didn't like this book. I've read everything else in this series and this is undoubtedly the weakest of all. The characters are so uninteresting, and the action is unrealistically laid out. I was so bored by it I ended up skimming most of it and then just giving up and reading the last chapter to see how it ended (not that I cared much by that point). And, sheesh, are Mel and Jane ever going to get anywhere in their relationship? I don't understand the two of them at all--we never hear much about their attraction or anything.) A VERY disappointing book. I doubt I'll continue to read the series from here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This has to be one of the worst novels I've ever read. It is terribly written all around. The characters are boring and show little to no personality. This was my first time reading a murder-mystery and it lacked obvious characteristics such as suspense and likeable characters. The characters show no growth emotionally. If I had to take a guess I would say Jeffery wrote this with little interest and passion, a very lazy writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"The Jane Jeffry series, while not towering classics, have generally been decent reads. Sadly, that is not the case in A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S SCREAM. This reads like someone's first attempt at writing a mystery novel.

A complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The first and LAST book I'll read by Jill Churchill","review":"I love mysteries. I picked this book up at the library (thank goodness because I would NOT have paid for this). This is the worst mystery book I've ever read. The murder doesn't happen until way later in the book. The premise of taking needlepoint classes had me yawning. The dialouge didn't seem like real people would speak that way. Also, usually the least suspected person ends up being the murderer, but not in this case. It actually points out a potential suspect and then that suspect is in fact the murderer. There is no surprise element to this book. I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Series going downhill","review":"I used to love the Jane Jeffry series, but the last two installments were really disappointing. I'm certain if that was her first manuscript, Jill Churchill would never be a published author. The mystery takes backseat to needle point instructions, the characters are lifeless and the dialog forced. Someone listening to Jane and Shelley's conversations would never in a million years guess those two are best friends. The biggest disappointment is the lack of the laugh-out-loud humor which was so endearing in the earlier books in the series. A real shame..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I love Agatha Christie novels and other cozy murder mysteries. But this one really isn't worth the time. This is my first Jill Churchill book and I found it lacking in every way. The dialog alone was groan worthy (people just don't converse in real life the way they do in this book)and much of the action unbelievable.Who can possible believe that a police officer in Chicago will know the names and family histories of area residents, give rides to the physical disabled (especially during their work shift) and arrange for family housing in a hospital?The whole story is very flat. A cardboard cutout of life, relationships and situations.

When using the rake, the head of the rake will come loose and the periscoping handle will begin to collapse multiple times before you are finished.

And even worse, I happened to not use the printer for about a week when the black cartridge was about 1/3 full and the color was about 3/4 full. When I tried, the black was clogged beyond salvage. Hate to hammer it home on the brand, but I had a similar problem with a Lexmark a few years ago. I have definitely purchased my last Lexmark.<br /><br />I gave it two stars because when it worked, the quality was decent. So, if you print A LOT, and a lot of pages at once, it may not be so bad.

The suite covers three general classes of hardware: workstations, servers, and handheld devices, and the applications include not only networking but also software distribution and extensive network troubleshooting.The size of the book is determined by the sheer amount of software included in this new suite.

While there are details covering Imaging, I don't see any additional information above and beyond the on-line documentation and the help files. As far as the Middle Tier server - don't bother. The authors didn't. There is a section on installing the server telling the user how to fill in the DNS name and such but no real substance. And that's it!

The only issue I have found with this one is that my previous camera came with a theft prevention cable that could be used in addition to screwing it to the tree. The No Flash does not have this and I suspect it is because they want you to purchase a special box they have now to secure it in place from \\"bears\\".

There are various beeps that will let you know how much time you have left. If the power is out long, I'll shut down. I've never reached the end of the battery life, but I haven't tried to push it either. It's handy to have my DSL router plugged in too, because sometimes the power will go off but the phone stays on fine, so I don't loose connectivity either.

They stayed in place and provided perfect warmth for even more than the five hours per the package. They are very light and are comfortable except for the heat you don't even notice they are there. They do not get too hot either like the hand warmers or toe warmers. I love this product and won't go skiing, or snowshoeing without them. It is very cold up here in Idaho."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have warmer for Fall & Winter!","review":"I LOVE this brands foot warmer.

Also, original package had the \\"Open Here\\" slit on the top of the package; \\"new and unimproved\\" ones open from the left side near the top.Due to the reduced size: (1) Warmth doesn't seem as satisfying, even in the initial hours of use; and (2) Inserts slip around in the shoe, even though it's snug-fitting.I won't buy the Grabbers Warmers brand shoe inserts again. In fact, I came to Amazon today to look for alternatives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not get warm","review":"I purchased 4 pairs of these Grabber foot warmers. I used a pair of these in my snow ski boots and my toes were still cold. Removed after 1 hour and the product was cold with no heat from the warmers. I even left them out for 15 minutes with no heat coming from them. Tossed them in the trash. I returned the remaining warmers with a nice explanation of my experience and to my surprise I was only credited back for the returned, unused items with out any consideration for the shipping. I even called and talked to a company representative without any success concerning my experience with this product. All products received had valid expiration dates way into the future. Product simply did not work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I got a defective product","review":"I bought a 3 pack from esportsonline through Amazon. I opened them and almost instantaneously they started to warm. In 3 minutes, they were hot in my shoes, almost uncomfortably hot but that's because I had thin socks on. After 1 hour, they turned cold and stiff. Maybe mine were defective. I'll give them another try and update this review then. Update: 2nd pair didn't last more than an hour. Weird. I never had this problem with the Grabber toe warmer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really? They heat?","review":"To what, room temperature?

I was looking for a foot warmer that I could re-heat and put on my feet.

I live in a part of Colorado that is very rural and this package was sent to the post office for my zip code; but, it was not my post office and I had to pay an additional shipping charge because the post office sent it to my post office that was only 5 miles away.

You're on a Roll.","review":"As a friend of Jane Juska's for several years and as someone who has read her two books, I want to report that I see her as a wonderful social critic. Her books are endorsements for having the strength to identify what is missing from your life and making changes--whatever your age and even if there is some risk.Would I follow Jane's path or even want to have a relationship with a much, much younger man? No way. Can I learn from Jane's zest for life and insights into living in the moment without judgments of the flaws of others? You bet!The fact that she writes with humor, wit and all-out honesty will make her a treasure for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go, Jane!","review":"I am only half way through this book, and I have to applaud Jane. If you are expecting her to be perfect, or perfectly happy, go elsewhere. At just over half her age I know many women in stale, sad marriages who embody the quote \\"The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation\\". These women are every bit as pathetic as some people purport Juska to be. It's nice to hear from someone who doesn't think that marriage will make them whole, and who goes after what she wants, despite possibly getting her heart broken. Jane Juska doesn't glamorize her choices, as she has been accused of...she has had plenty of bumps as well as successes. THAT is what makes a human story. I hope that I have 1/5 of her courage when I am her age!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Boo. I rushed to buy this book without reading its reviews, just because I loved its precursor. But, as often happens with sequels, this book offered nothing new. The main, interesting story was already told in the first book, and instead the author finds herself whining about not finding love and about not having enough money to buy herself a house. Not worth reading.

The Greensleeves is amazing also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this CD","review":"I had this CD but ended up misplacing it. This is one of my favorite Christmas CD's so I had to replace it.

I copied my favorites to my mp3 player. By far my favorite is \\"My Little Drum\\". Its the most perfectly jazzed Christmas song I ever heard. I love the muffled trumpet that kind of recalls the teacher's voice, the piano is tops, just everything is a perfect groove. Plenty of bass, two types of piano and there is even French horn. It takes perfectly timed jazz genius to do a song like that where you don't care if it takes 3, 7, or 15 minutes just as long as its perfect. \\"My Little Drum\\" is 7 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best intro RPGs ever published","review":"Have you been gaming since 1980 and now want to get your kids interested in the hobby?

They continue to show a lack of organization and because of that I'm now sure they spend a lot of time apologizing to their customers. Tech support is a hit or miss depending who you talk to, if you can understand what they are saying.The real problem is the consumer continues to purchase Dell computers, therefore continuing to make Michael Dell richer. When customers take their business to other competitors and Dell's sales go down, then I believe they will improve their customer service and tech support.If anyone from Dell reads this review, you should be concerned that so many of your cutomers are experiencing similar problems with Dell.

However, these reviewers all appear to have purchased their Axims prior to mid-June of this year, when Dell began shipping the device with the new operating system, Windows Mobile 2003. Dell now has MAJOR problems with the product--it is extremely slow, they have halted new shipments while they try to develop a patch, and there are multiple irate customers posting messages on Dell's \\"community forum\\" message board. For the short time that I had my Axim, I found it extremely frustrating to use due to its slowness, and my e-mail exchanges with Dell's technical support did nothing to reassure me as to an eventual solution to the problem.

It is a little big compared to some of the other handhelds but comparing it to the HP 5555, which is about the same size with comparable functionality but twice the price.

Couldn't be happier. His explanations remain remarkably understandable, and a great complement to help me get my head around the technicalities of drawing, which I had always done by instinct, but never been able to get things like perspective correct.

Worst part is, the tip head wasn't even floating around in the box, which means it was packaged without a thorough look, again.

If you have been listening, really listening, to music for about 20 years, you'll probably enjoy this work. This album is meant for critical listening. An audiophile would probably appreciate it. From what I can tell, it's an all-acoustic recording. The instruments are recorded via a mic. Mark Hollis is not afraid to include silence as part of the song. The songs are uncluttered and \\"simply\\" beautiful. This album should not be in the rock category but, rather jazz. It's truly a work of art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark, bleak and unforgiving","review":"While Talk Talk offered up some inspired moments (Colour of Spring) and endeavoured to break down traditional musical barriers (see Spirit of Eden), this solo offering from Mark Hollis - the band's singer/songwriter - is blacker than black. It continues in the same vein as Laughing Stock, and indeed is an introspective, intriguing record as you'll likely to find. BUT, there's something about this record that sends the spirit spiralling down into deep depression. It's dry like a gravestone, it creaks like an old coffin, and is completely bereft of any kind of kind of humour. I don't know whether anybody out there agrees with me. This is the only record I've ever heard that has had this effect on me.

My problems included getting getting duplicates of one or more colors while missing other colors, non-centered leads that caused sharpening issues, bent and curved pencils that made heir use awkward, imprints that were barely legible, chipped and gouged pencils, and imperfectly finished pencils.A box of 36 Verithin pencils had the same problems and was also missing a pencil.For the price paid for these pencils, you should expect perfection and you're not getting it.

I was thrilled to see that that's what Foley did. I had to wonder how she would ever get the Knight brothers to approve such a match between their little sister and a gangster, but she did it wonderfully.

While waiting for her coach, she gets robbed by a little boy and gives chase. She ends up in an alley where the two gangs of the city are battling.Enter Billy Blade, aristocrat turned gang leader. He escaped his family home when he was fifteen and struck out on his own. The story of how he grew up is heartbreaking.The only problem that I had with this book is that I though Ms. Foley took Jacinda's resistance a little too far. Besides that, the love story was heartwarming and believable. Billy and Jacinda falling in love was a sweet story. Billy was obviously anamored of her at the beginning and decided he was going to catch her.Please take the time to read this book, as I believe you will enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"L-Arginine helps blood circulation","review":"I bought the L-Arginine for my self to improve blood flow.

As a sax player, myself, he is my musical idol. This book is so vague, it hardly covers the man at all. The author is more concerned with the racism and segregated history of jazz. This is o.k. but should be in a different book. We want more on the man. Also, there are errors in the telling. Just two come to mind. Jefferson Davis was born in Kentucky not Mississippi and Lionel Barrymore was not an alcoholic, his brother, John was. Don't get me wrong, this book is a huge undertaking for the story it tells but alot of it is \\"probably\\", \\"maybe\\", \\"people think.\\" It's way too vague on the facts. It is , however, worth a look because there is alot of jazz history worth reading about. I've read the author's other works and they are much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good source on Pres","review":"I don't know what the author's intentions were in writing this book, but it certainly seems as though the life of Lester Young was not the main topic. Daniels spends more time on topics like racism and the unfair treatment of black musicians rather than actually talking about Lester Young. While it is important to talk about these topics in some detail to explain how it affected Lester Young, the author did not have to spend over half the book on them. Here's a little advice Mr. Daniels: If you're going to write a book on the racial inequalities of these times, write a book specifically on that, and with a title that suggests that topic. Don't write a book with a title of \\"The Life and Times of Lester \\"Pres\\" Young\\" and spend nearly the whole time talking about racism and racial inequalities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly biased!","review":"The author is an African-American militant and he's more worried on pamphletizing his political views than on narrating Prez's life.

Alejandro Sanz's vision of the world is very unique, the way he interprets what's around him, from \\"corazon partio\\" where he explains how it feels to have a broken heart, to \\"siempre es de noche\\" where he feels throught the heart of a blind man in love, it is simply outstanding.Great work from one of the most talented singer-songwriter of our time."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favourites!","review":"Every time I listen to \\"más\\" I like it even better.

Together in this sauce, they just do not work. The ginger flavor overpowers everything to the point that the sauce tastes almost soapy. The kick from the habanero is definitely recognized, but it really counteracts the flavor you get from the rest of the sauce.

I also generally dislike most barbeque sauces as well and that's all we buy because my husband likes it. Yuck.But not this sauce! This sauce is so sweet and delicious yet gives that little zing that makes it a favorite in our house, even with my picky husband. I will absolutely continue to buy this and use it on almost everything we eat! It's delicious with chicken, burgers, nuggets, fries, you name it. I even used it in a cold pasta dish I made one night and it was fantastic. Bye bye, BBQ! There's a new sauce in town! ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff!","review":"First, lets start the ingredients. No preservatives, nothing more offensive than a little sugar. Just what it says it is!The taste- wonderful. Sweet, nice sweet ginger flavor, just a bit of a bite. Unless you are super sensitive to heat, don't worry about the Habanero! There is just enough to add a touch of bite and wonderful flavor.We put it on beef and chicken. it would be great on fish or pork or anyplace you want a little mango/ginger flavor. It is said to be a dipping/ finishing sauce, and I am looking forward to using it with Lumpia.Well worth a try and I don't say that very often"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Strange Combination of Flavors","review":"The ingredients of this sauce sound interesting -- mango, ginger, and habanero peppers. The problem is that the sauce is terribly sweet. The mango puree, honey, and sugar contribute too much sweetness which is not offset enough by the peppers. The ginger flavor is virtually lost. We tried the sauce on chicken and the sauce overpowered it, almost completely masking the chicken's flavor. We figured it would devastate fish, so we never tried it on fish. Of course, foods are a matter of individual taste, so if you tend to prefer sweetness in cooked foods, you might enjoy this sauce. However, if your want a sauce to accent rather than dominate a main course, look elsewhere. This one isn't for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sauce that is okay for doctoring up","review":"I am a foodie. So, any sauce has to really impress me. The name sounds good, like a unique flavor has been discovered. Unfortunately, the sauce is overly sweet, the mango lost in the sweetness and the ginger is almost indiscernible in the mess of flavors. Turns out, if you add a bunch of flavors and mix them all up, it tastes like ...a mix of flavors that totally neutralizes any nuances. You can easily make a sauce like this, a sweet/hot sauce, and there are plenty out there that are good straight from the bottle instead of wanting to grab the spice rack to \\"fix\\" this sauce. Not terrible, but not very good, either."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love It - Great Taste, Mild Heat","review":"I loved this sauce and really found that it enhanced the flavor of quite a few different items. I tried it with chicken, steak fajitas, and pork tender roast and I thought it complemented all quite nicely.It is a rather sweet sauce with a very subtle heat. Personally, I would rate it as a very mild heat, but I eat a lot of really spicy foods. I prefer a sauce that is flavorful with a little spice over one that is hot without too much flavor and this sauce really hits the mark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tastes good, a bit too sweet for my taste","review":"It does taste good, and is indeed a bit too sweet.I really liked that this produce is only made of whole ingredients (Mango Puree, Sugar, Honey, Apple Cider Vinegar, Ginger, Habanero Peppers, Spices).

That sauce had a complex mix of heat and sweetness that worked perfectly, creating something almost brilliant. This sauce does not attempt anything so lofty. Instead, it consists of a heavy mango base sweetened with honey. The habanero is present, but only as a very mild background flavor, and the ginger is even further in the background, with almost no impact.And yet, all this sweetness stays very manageable, and that is why this sauce still succeeds at being a pleasant option. It goes well with pretty much anything and is quite unique. If you are new to this line of sauces, I would certainly recommend starting with the raspberry variant. If you are a fan and looking for variety, this will bring a smile to your face as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mango Ginger Habanero Heaven","review":"I cooked salmon in this sauce as a glaze and then added extra when served. It is soooo delicious that it should almost be mandatory to sell it w/ every salmon purchase! It is just the right amount of heat and sweetness for me. I think as more people try this flavor it will become the best selling over the raspberry (also excellent for pork). Of all the 5 flavors I've tried, this is now my favorite. As a health benefit ginger not only has digestive aid properties but also acts as an ant-inflammatory agent. So eat well and stay healthy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT GREAT SAUCE!","review":"Tried it on beef, pork, chicken, fish and this sauce absolutely enhances the food's flavor!

I liked it brushed on my grilled pork chops and it tasted just right and gave it a gentle kick. It was even better on my vegetable and chicken pot stickers. Given the thickness of the sauce, it worked really well as a \\"dipper\\". While I dont think I would cook with it every week, I will definitely repurchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the greatest","review":"I received this sauce from the Vine program. I used it to glaze some chicken, and tasted it on a teaspoon as well. The sause did not have a very lpeasant taste by itself, almost soapy. I thought that possibly cooking it on something would help to enhance the sweetness of it, and I was incorrect. It still tasted soapy, only hotter.The sauce does have a very nice bite to it from the habanero, but the ginger tastes overpowering and really manipulates the flavor too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different but great flavor","review":"I am not a ginger fan but the ginger is quite subtle and the Habanero is not blazing hot.

Unfortunately, to put it brief, it was terrible.Incredibly sweet. Sort of bitter. Has a hot residual effect, not enough to overcome the horrible taste though.I really wanted to like this product, but I couldnt think of a single thing that it would be good on. Sweet like a desert but savory flavored. Im sorry but this is probably the worst tasting sauce I have ever tasted, except for my wife's (sorry honey)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sauce - Not Too Hot","review":"This was my first experience with Fischer & Wieser sauces but it probably won't be the last. Great taste but a bit sweeter than expected and not as hot as expected.The sweetness - once you know it's there - lends itself to a variety of foods: salmon, chicken, blended with cream cheese. The hotness - or lack of it - is fine by me. It gives just enough kick to make it interesting. If you like hot-hot-hot, you may want to try something else. For me, it was just right."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little Spicy and a lot Sweet","review":"This sauce has a nice heat level to it if you're not looking for a burn your mouth kinda kick. The sweetness combined with the ginger is just a little too much for me though. Don't get me wrong I love sweet sauces, but the somehow the ginger combined with the sweetness takes this sauce down to the \\"not bad\\" level.If you like sweet sauces and want a really delicious one I would highly recommend the Fischer & Wieser's Charred Pineapple Bourbon sauce."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much Better then I expected","review":"I love hot food. I LOVE hot food. But the combination of ginger, mango and habanero simply didn't sound all that promising. So, I opened the bottle with hesitancy, and tasted...and was pleasantly surprised.Fischer & Wieser Mango Ginger Habanero Sauce was very good. It's taste went very well with a number of different types of foods. It was very good on a cheeseburger, and even went well as a dipping sauce for chicken. I wouldn't turn this sauce down.With that said, there is room for improvement. It is a little too sweet, preventing some of the subtle tastes of the sauce to shine. A bit of heat would have been welcomed as well. The taste of habanero was virtually non-existent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goes Great with Asian Foods","review":"Although the write-up on this sauce says it is \\"flavored and favored by the Southern Hemisphere\\", the first taste of this mango ginger habanero sauce made me think of Chinese food. The texture is quite nice, thick without being gooey. This is a delicate sauce - the first impressions are of sweet and ginger, then you get the habanero kick, which is nice and mildly spicy.I made grilled chicken and finished it with this sauce. Children and adults alike enjoyed the sweet, ginger flavor and mild spiciness, but thought the sauce became overwhelmed by the grilled flavors. So, I served it with pot stickers. That went over very well and made my family think it would also go well with egg rolls, baked meats or nuggets.My recommendation is using this sauce with mild flavored foods that can use a bit of punch without being overwhelmed by the taste of a heavy sauce. On the other hand, this sauce is delicate, so I recommend not using it on heavily flavored foods."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sauce, especially for salmon","review":"I try to cook salmon twice each week and sometimes it gets painfully boring, and sometimes I don't have time to cook my own sauce. This is the perfect sauce because it's different from my typical balsamic vinegar/garlic/brown sugar based sauce. I wish it had a bit more kick from the habenero but my husband thinks it's the perfect balance of sweet and kick. I am generally not a big fan of the mango by itself but it is a perfect compliment to the ginger and spice. I also like the viscosity of the sauce, especially for salmon. I have used it with our grill, with the fish both wrapped in foil as well as unwrapped."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet honey-like flavor with a wonderful mild burn; yummy with chicken","review":"By itself, the F&W; Mango Ginger Habanero sauce tastes a lot like a mildy spicy honey sauce. The flavors are mild but tasty. But when used on meat, the flavors really come alive. I've enjoyed this sauce on chicken especially.What really makes this sauce stand out is the mild habanero burn that take a few seconds to hit; it is simply wonderful. Not too much, not too little. Not too much to overwhelm, yet not too little that its overlooked or boring. A surprise for the mild kind of sauce that it is.I'm usually not a fan of sweet sauces - I like spicy punchy sauces - but this one is worth keeping, especially for those days when I'm not up to the heat but still want the burn.Worth trying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too dialed down","review":"I had high expectations of something called \\"Mango Ginger Habanero\\" sauce and was more than a bit let down after trying this sauce on grilled chicken. This is three of my favorite flavors rolled into one so my anticipation was high. Instead, it just very sweet taste that reminded me of something I'd dip chicken fingers from a chinese restaurant in versus the expected caribbean zing I was looking forward to. I just didn't expect a duck sauce knock-off. Where was the kick? Habanero is supposed to be hot! I got little mango from this, no ginger and very little heat at all. I was definitely left wanting a more intense flavor and kick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying Sweet","review":"It sounded like it would be a hit...a combination of Mango, Ginger, and Habanero sauce which all three are my favorites...but this product taste anything but annoying sweet. Mango is already a sweet fruit but Fischer and Wieser added more sugar so its no longer just sweet but super annoying sweet.

Hence I found this a little sweeter than the hot sauce I am used to. I tried this on grilled chicken sandwich, and baked fish sandwich; it tasted good, but you may want to add other condiments to spice it up depending upon your taste. If you use this while grilling or baking it tastes better than adding after grilling/baking.

My three favorite flavors on earth. Mango trees of all kinds grow in my back yard. I don't think there is a more flavorful fruit than mango; kind of like a peach but sweeter. Ginger is a unique plant with a zesty fresh aroma and taste. Habanero peppers are extremely hot peppers with a unique aftertaste that stays with you. When you blend all three of these flavors you get a delightful taste that can top or cook well with shrimp, chicken and beef. The only problem with Fischer & Wieser Mango Ginger Habanero Sause is that is watered down a bit. That's my only complaint. Perhaps the Mango is the culprit as it is full of water. If there was a way to concentrate the flavors more then I would give the product 5 stars. Otherwise the product is unique and will be enjoyed by all those who are adventurous and like exotic flavors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sweet Sweet sauce with subtle mango,ginger & habanero taste.

Just not a practical thing for me to keep in the refrigerator, hence the four stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too sweet","review":"I suppose this would make a good dip for chicken wings or other fried things, but it is far too sweet to use as a marinade or glaze. Not too hot, though, so don't get scared by the habanero in the name. The flavor is good, but because it is so sweet, I'm unsure what to use this with. Not the steak or pork chop sauce I thought it might be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than naked chicken: barely.","review":"I used this sauce for dipping chicken and found it rather uninteresting. The primary tastes are ginger and honey; surprisingly there was no mango taste despite mango being the first ingredient on the label (the next two were sweeteners). In fact, I would say that \\"sweet\\" is the main taste. The heat is comparable to the bottom of the medium-range in salsa. The sauce is about the consistency of imitation maple syrup. It was better than eating the chicken straight, but not by much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very sweet and not spicy at all","review":"Personally, I found this too sweet for my taste. The sweetness was the level I would expect from a dessert topping. Not that this is not without its uses. I think that this would make a perfect topping for my waffles, which I am going to try. The habanero is misleading. I detected no heat level at all. It is very similar to a spiced pineapple topping I once tried over ice cream."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious, but not very spicy","review":"This sauce is delicious, but you would think it would be quite hot and spicy, seeing as it has 'habañero' in the name. Habañero peppers are extremely hot and you would think that would be the point of having the word in the name of the sauce, it likely being meant to tell people that this sauce is quite hot, but no; instead, the sauce has a very mild flavor of chili pepper - that's it. Apparently, there is some actual 'habañero' pepper somewhere in the ingredients, but it's toward the end of the list, so evidently, not much. Anyway, the sauce is still quite delicious, just not exactly what one might expect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Sweet for me!","review":"Sugar is the second ingrediant listed and you can taste it. I have tried other products that mix the hot and sweet with success. This marinade just did not suit my tastebuds. Now, to be fair-my family loved it. Yet since I was reviewing and I am the only only to shop, I rated it with my viewpoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious and versatile gentle but progressively hotter \\"sweet heat\\"","review":"This sauce came up a winner with both myself and my dad. Dad is a serious heat-aficionado who grows his own chiles. While we both agreed that there wasn't a whole lot of heat to be had in this sauce, Dad notes that it builds progressively. The sauce is a fun sweet sauce with just the right amount of zing for the average person. I would suggest a scale of mild, medium, and hot mango ginger sauces with the current one being the mild.I have been enjoying this sauce with chicken, steak, and even mixed into some of my omelettes in the morning.Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"This stuff is good!","review":"It says finishing/dipping sauce. We can add jelly to that title. I'm sure it's a great finishing/dipping sauce..it even tasted good right out of the jar. But, I make up concoctions of things I have in the house to suit my tastebuds at the time, and I decided I wanted toast for my snack 2 nights ago. This finishing sauce was great on my toast. I like really hot things, but not on toast. The sauce was just right. This sauce just has a hint on habanero taste, and the sauce is fairly sweet. This would probably be good poured over cream cheese for an extra treat.Would I recommend it? Yes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Taste the Habanero at All","review":"As a fan of spicy foods, I was anxious to try out this sauce. The habanero is one of my favorite peppers, adding great flavor and heat. Unfortunately, this product diluted the habanero taste so that it wasn't significant at all.I tried this sauce as a cooking glaze and a dip with beef, chicken, and pork. If you're looking for sweetness, it adds a very pleasant flavor. Unfortunately, that's not what I'm looking for in a sauce that boasts habanero. The mango, honey, and apple flavors dominate this sauce. The ginger is also apparent, but not as pronounced. The poor, poor habanero is absolutely lost in the shuffle.Overall, this sauce is a pretty big disappointment to me. If it were advertised and marketed as a fruity sauce, I'd be much happier with the product. The company advertises this product as having \\"sweet heat\\". Well, it got half of it right."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is No Raspberry Chipotle Sauce","review":"I gave this stuff a try after I fell in love with the Fischer & Wieser Raspberry Chipotle Sauce, which I mixed with olive oil to make into salad dressing. This Mango Ginger Habanero Sauce is nothing special in my book, for several reasons. First, it is much TOO SPICY for my wimpy taste buds. The Raspberry Chipotle had some bite, but I could handle it. Not this stuff. Second, the flavor combination here doesn't knock me off my feet, like the Raspberry Chipotle variety. The mango and ginger flavors are quite strong, and not complementary, in my opinion. Third, this sauce is not as versatile as the Raspberry Chipotle Sauce. I expected that I would be able to make it into salad dressing, but the bottle had no such suggestions, as with the Raspberry Chipotle. It seems to be good for fewer types of uses. Anyway, it was worth a try, and it was not horrible. My expectations were just too high after trying their Raspberry Chipotle Sauce."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay Sauce - Not much flavor","review":"I was very excited to receive the Mango Ginger Habanero sauce, as I LOVE the Roasted Raspberry Chipotle by Fischer & Wieser. This sauce was a big disappointment. The sauce is too sweet with only a little flavor and a small amount of heat. The raspberry chipotle is bursting with flavors, so I was expecting much more from the mango ginger. I do not plan to buy this sauce in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't taste the mango nor habanero. Too sweet from the honey.","review":"I was quite impressed by Fischer & Weiser's Raspberry Chipotle sauce and had high expectations for the Mango Ginger Habanero flavor. While I really enjoyed the texture and complexity of the Raspberry Chiptole, I find this one to be sort of boring.Much of the essence of a fresh ripe mango is lost upon bottling. While I can taste a hint of (cooked) mango, it is overpowered by the sweetness and flavor of honey. They should have named it Honey Ginger Spicy Sauce. I can taste a good amount of ginger in the middle of my palate, which then gives way to a moderate level of heat from the habanero. While the heat is present, I can't actually taste the unique bright flavor of habaneros in the sauce.The texture is thick and syrupy. It kind of looks like the nasty brown sauce they use in the neighborhood Chinese-American restaurants. Like it's been thickened with a ton of cornstarch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleh.","review":"This sauce was sweeter than I thought it should be with not much exciting flavor. Sort of like the duck sauce that comes in packets at the Chinese takeout, but with some peppery heat mixed in. I detected very little in the way of mango, and the ginger taste was missing too.We tried it with some grilled chicken. Perhaps some egg rolls might have been a better pairing.Normally I like sweetness in a dipping sauce, but it must have flavor behind it, else it risks being rather insipid, like this. Would not purchase again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good finishing sauce","review":"When I first saw the word Habanero in the title of this sauce I was expecting my taste buds to be assaulted by the flavor of those little peppers. However, when I actually tried it (brushed over grilled chicken) I was met with a tangy flavor that did not overpower me at all but enhanced the flavor of the chicken.I will readily admit that I am a picky eater and hesitate to try anything new, but after trying this I am glad I did. Now, more seasoned 'adventerous eaters around me tried this as well and also agreed that it had a good mix of flavoring and was not overpowering, nor was it underwhelming either.All in all a solid addition to spice things up over the summer grill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Huge fan of Michel Odent!

In The Scarlet Letter, Hawthorn goes into a lot of detail about well...everything! Most of my class mates did not like this book because they said the descriptions were too long and he should just get to the point. But that is what really gets you into the story. There are never any questions about a relationship between two people or how the father is tormented with guilt. I recomend this book for open minded readers who will apreciate how he gets you into the story. It really makes you want to keep reading.

It is a common thing in our time to think we are better than those around us and that we have more or better morals than others but as The Scarlet Letter proves, this is not so. I think that those who do not like the novel simply did not understand it for the thought provoking images and issues that it provided.

The plot was so simplistic and uneventful that I would ahve preferred to have read a simple one-paragraph summary, because that is all the more description this boring story needs to fully develop. This story would have made an interesting little legend, but by no means was it an interesting novel. The characters were plastic and fake, the plot was almost worthwhile but for being overdeveloped, drawn out, and dry. The moral is touching, but it's not worth suffering through the novel for.

They are some of the worst songs I have EVER heard! They sing \\"Let's get this party started\\" (which happens to be one of my favorite Korn songs) and they butchered it!

Korn has their own unique way of singing and playing their instruments that many people including my self enjoy very much, this tribute album however does not justify Korn's music at all.

Our favorite was Yawzi Point and Little Lameshur Bay. We arrived at 10:30 and were among 4 people on the beach. The waters were turquiose and the beach beautfully sandy like Trunk Bay but without the crowd. We enjoyed the right side of Yawzi Point accessible from Little Lameshur as the waters were calmer than the left hand side with similar reef to explore. Leinster Bay/Waterlemon Cay was another great find. The thing the book didn't mention was to hang your bag as Mongooses can unzip and will eat your lunch!

This CD differs from the others in that the sound is much more electronic, mixed with more synthesizers. If your are a La Ley lover, you will not be dissapointed. I recommend Guerrillero because they write about the political status in their native Chile and the hardships their people have suffered due to Augusto Pinochet. Another great track is Tanta Ciudad. Fotophobia is very futuristic.

So, i rented it. I am sorry to say it's just as bad, and actually worse. I couldn't even get through thirty minutes of it. The graphics are poor even for a ps2, the sound is awful, the commentary ... and the controls are atrocious. The ski jumping is awful and the bobsled is just as bad. You get never sensation of speed or any sensation at all, really. The gameplay feels really dead. There's no life to any of it.

Also and last but not least the commintary drags on and on but at least you can shut that off.... i didnt give this 1 star because for what it did have it was pretty good but comeon guys its time to make a good olympic games and stop making these jokes."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is no way this could make the Olympic Team","review":"This game is horrible. It only has six different events, and the graphics are not that good. the playability is not that good. it is extremely hard to control the board and skis in the alpine and slolom as well as the snowboarding event. the ski jump is very bad. don't buy this game!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This game stinks on water","review":"I absoloutely hate this game into the ground. I jumped on it when I first played it. I refunded it straight away but they said they couldn't because it was too damaged. So now its sitting in the oven and I'm going to get rid of my ps2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful & excellent love story & adventure","review":"First book I have read from this author it surpassed all my expectations as far as love stories and plot go. It was an excellent read, wonderful story and a really potent love between the hero & heroine. This a an exquisite author. I was so pleased to see this book was the first of a series but I can't buy the rest of the series since they are not out on kindle. So it's a bummer I loved Ms. Clare's story I find her characters thoughtfully portrayed & the love stresses between the characters actually make sense for once. I am just really upset you can't buy the rest of her historical novels on kindle????For everyone else who is looking for an amazing love story look no further buy surrender you will fall in love with the story and the hero & heroine this book was truly wonderful. I can safely say I expect the rest of her historical series to be just as great, but I'm waiting for the kindle edition so I can buy it. Great work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Beautiful","review":"Fans of \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\" will love this adventure/romance! \\"Surrender\\" is a refreshing break from your current Brit-set historicals. This book is highly evocative in every sense: writer's voice, plot, emotional gut punches -- a true page turner! I was in the mood for something different and \\"Surrender\\" delivered.The hero is super sexy and incredibly strong/powerful. The heroine is sympathetic and believable -- a lady brought low and dragged into danger, she rises to the challenge with considerable mettle.\\"Surrender\\" has found a permanent place on my keeper shelve."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great \\"Surrender\\"!","review":"I consume books, with historical fiction being my favorite. This book is in my top 10 amoung the thousands I have read. The book was an exciting one for me since little is found dealing with this period in early American history. The characters were written in a very real manner. The circumstances of life at the time were realisticly shown but not over-emphasized. There is a great story \\"underneath\\" the romance. I originally read this several years ago. Now that the third in the series has been released, I need to read it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surrender","review":"Makes you want to read the rest in the series. I found myself reading to see what was going to happen next. I could imagine myself in that time and place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her Forte'","review":"Clare's forte' is historicals-- Set in a part of history that few authors tackle (other than that Finnemore Cooper guy ;)) The story is full of details that are like little diamonds dropped throughout. Two canteens, one poisoned, one not. The set up of the forts and soldier rankings, the start of the military Rangers (yay!), the structure of indentured servitude.When simply surviving was a days' work, food, shelter, clothing, warmth luxuries, then passion of course would ignite. Especially when you have so little peace and chances for happiness. If you loved Last of the Mohicans, this is more of the same...as good (with a few sniggling nits but not enough to count).Recommended at 5 stars, have re-read. will re-read again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful story!","review":"I discovered Pamela Clare, just 5 months ago and since then I have bought all of her books that are published. I love all of her stories, but the 2 books published so far, about the McKinnon brothers, is my absolute favourites. Her eye for details, her knowledge of early American history and Native Americans during those turbulent years, are amazing! I recommened everyone who love historical romance to read Pamela Clare! I am looking forward to the next installment in the McKinnon brothers saga!"},{"rating":"1","title":"blah","review":"while I liked Pamela Clares other series i didn't like this one. For me it wasn't the heroine almost being rape two or three times or the violence in the book. It was the heroine herself. She was so stupid. About 100 pages in I couldn't stand her. This may be wrong and I'm sorry but I was kinda hoping she did get rape. That was how much I didn't like her. I didn't even finish the book even through I need to finish it to make a character guide for my blog I just don't think I can. I also don't like Ian or his brothers. It will be a long time before I finish the series.Another thing that got me mad how how men kept falling for her Every page the Author had to mention how beautiful the heroine was. Makes me want to gag. I was also hoping her uncle had banned her face instead.I'm Sorry Mrs. Clare. I love you but not this book or series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Violence/Gore 75%, Romance 25%","review":"It's refreshing to read historicals with good detail, but this author went too heavily into the violence of the time. I want to read about ROMANCE when I pick up a romance, not grisly scenes of the heroine being branded with a hot iron, the heroine being beaten, or the hero being flogged. The sex is quite explicit, but this in no way makes up for the extreme graphic violence. I can only give this book two stars, and doubt I'll re-read it. Good colonial adventure, bad romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs a real editor","review":"While I have enjoyed the story greatly, I have one complaint. It may seem harsh to give such a low star rating based on one complaint but this is a large issue. I have an electronic version of this book which I read on my Kindle. Perhaps it is not the author, or editor, at fault but the electronic file I purchased. The vast quantities of typographical errors made reading this text nearly impossibe. Her name up to the mid point or so is Miss Burns, not Miss Bums. While his name is Iain, she has lain with him. One being a person's name, the other a verb, and not interchangable. If english is not your first language, or if you do not have a good grasp of the written word, I implore you to not purchase this book as it will confuse you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I really enjoyed Pamela Clare's contemporary books and on that basis bought three of her books set in the mid-18th century, trusting that I would enjoy them as well. Afraid not. For a start, the ridiculous, purported Scots accents are so distracting that I just ended up annoyed. I could not find much sympathy for Iain and his brothers and did not feel any pull of attraction to him. The over-done analysis of British (e.g. Scottish and English) contemporary politics was a bit puerile and simplistic. I realise that it's popular in American cinema to make the baddies Brits but this was just very thin and unsupported, IMO. Frankly the heroine just did not fit in the timeframe and again the background she was given seemed pretty one dimensional to me. This just wasn't for me. I am sorry that this book was such a disappointment but there were too many jarring, inaccurate and overdrawn themes in the story and characters about whom, frankly, I did not give a damn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pamela Claire at her best!","review":"This is a really great book, that simply transports you back in time. Iain MacKinnon is an awesome hero, that you just fall in love with. I can hardly wait for Pamela Claire's next two books in this series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Read!!","review":"SURRENDER is a wonderful adventure and love story combined. The colonial American setting was refreshing and the romance was sizzling. I'll be sure to check out Pamela Clare's backlist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought for myself","review":"I love historical novels and I have read many of this author's books. The author is a really good writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true soother for mind and soul","review":"Not only is Dan Matz half of Windsor for the Derby, but he did an album with M. Gira called WHAT WE DID. I'd highly recommend that to whoever likes this fine songwriter. This is mellow, maturing, somewhat \\"hushed\\" artful rock. Very consistent, stripped but somehow lush -- with, however, one livelier number that comes just at the right point in the track order and which made my \\"always play twice\\" list. This album is as essential as anything by, say, Iron & Wine."},{"rating":"1","title":"chris isaak","review":"After opening the Chris Isaak CD, it wouldn't play in the car.

Even Joshua Bell's talent can't overcome this mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horner's excellent IRIS","review":"As a musician myself, I immerse myself in all types of classical, film, and opera music -- especially with magnificent writers/performers such as James Horner and Joshua Bell.First, this is the one Horner score that will distinguish itself from his many other soft spoken scores. Many will say, \\"Well, it sounds like his music from 'Spitfire Grill,' and it's nothing original anyway.\\" Liars, liars, pants on fire!! Horner includes some chords from \\"Spitfire Grill,\\" but this score is very much DIFFERENT from the above score -- this is an original score, people!Second, this is a gentle, delicate, and beautiful score -- very much the opposite from \\"The Red Violin\\" score. Bell's solos are incredible throughout the CD -- he is able to play so loudly & yet so softly, too -- incredible!Congrats, Dr. Horner!DEFINITELY worth your money!Dimitri Ntatsos"},{"rating":"2","title":"Obscure film score is a great find","review":"I heard this on a local classical music station and loved it. Joshua Bell is a top flight violinist and if he thought it worthy, then that is a good recommendation right there. The cd lived up to my expectations. James Horner did the score to Titanic among others, and he writes emotionally deep music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful & Ethereal music","review":"I had first heard this music while riding in my car as it played on the radio. I sat transfixed arriving at my destination until its completion, waiting for the announcer to tell me what it was.I quickly wrote down the title and then later realized I had seen this film. James Horner is certainly a well-versed and prolific composer as his list of other film scores attests.This score also includes Kate Winslett singing an old english folk tune, quite beautifully in character, as a young Iris.This composer is quite gifted and Joshua Bell playing violin as soloist is also wonderfully effective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"The step bar is great but for the jeep liberty 06 it only has one curved edge so the picture is not the same as the actual product.Its not as easy to attach and a professional installer is needed which was indicated.Overall, this product is solid, looks great, and has a great price."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you are an Alexanderphile, this is a must.","review":"Reading this book is like having a talk with someone very close to Alexander."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review, by Mark Schurr","review":"Terrible book. Like \\"The Roman Way,\\" \\"The Nature of Alexander\\" presents the man as a great leader when Alexander was an extreme alcoholic who murdered thousands including his best freind in a drunkin frenzy. My hero of the ancient times was Spartacus because he fought for truth and justice. Alexander was a punk kid with way too much power and should be remembered as a sadistic sleeze, not a hero."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid sometimes sentimental bio of Alexander the Great","review":"Make no mistake, this author loved Alexander the Great. The author shows excellent historical knowledge of ancient greek civilization (as her many excellent historical novels will attest) and she presents interesting theories on why Alexander did what he did, from his perspective. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in Alexander the Great. This is the third book on Alexander written by Renault, the first being Fire from Heaven on his unknown early life, and the Persian Boy, which covers him up until his death from a eunuch's perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Would I Believe If I Didn't Believe Anything?","review":"Dr. Groff offers many images and stories which invite us to journey deeper to the place where we meet and are met by one greater than ourselves. He gently and playfully invites the agnostic to risk believing and the believer to risk questioning. He seems to trust that the richest place to walk in life is that thin line between faith and doubt (where we can learn from our the great faith traditions and contemporary culture without dismissing either). As a thirty-something pastor who struggles to believe much of what i've been taught and who continues to find great wisdom and grace in and through my doubts, i appreciate Dr. Groff's commitment to speaking to people like me, who thirst for meaning, but don't often find it where we are told to find it; and who often stumble upon it in the strangest of places. This is a book you'll want to read, return to, and journal with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought it was going to be.","review":"I am a Lay Pastor and was looking for a book for someone struggling with their faith. This book was not what I thought it was going to be. It is alright, but I would not recommend it to someone struggling with their faith.

This book was written with compassion and understantding. It helped to give me perspective. Also, now I think I understand better what is going on in the Catholic Church that I embraced five years ago. In order for me to convert to the Catholic Church from devout Protestantism I had to come to a realization of the necessity of submission to the authority of the Church and the successor of St. Peter. Once I was convinced intellectually of this authority, I was dismayed to find so many Catholics in open rebellion against it. I didn't get it.

He's gonna get to see his great love Kyoko in a revealing swimsuit as he agrees to take little brat Kentaro to the beach. It's too bad that his rival, tennis coach Mitaka is also along for the ride. But he has one thing on his side! Mitaka is deathly afraid of dogs, including Kyoko's Mr. Soichiro. Maybe Yusaku will get to show his macho side and prove he's the better man? That's if he can endure Mitaka and Kyoto going out on a date. Yusaku himself has his own miniature shojo romance going too, when he meets up with Kozue, a former co-worker, when he's desperate for a date.Rumiko Takahashi is a master, or should I say mistress, of creating awesome and endearing characters. Her designs are beautiful and her style is very recognizable. The great thing about Maison Ikkoku is that no single element overwhelms you.

Although you are humorlessly instructed to do the activities in order, repeating the activity-of-the-week daily, the book is still useful in real life. Every few weeks, I flip through the sections for my children's ages and get ideas. The activities are exactly age appropriate- even the ones for young babies. They generally (but not always) use stuff you have around the house. And they are often ideas you might not think of on your own.

They seem to assume that playing with your baby is of no use and teaches them nothing. Instead you must spend ridiculous amounts of time setting up elaborate activities that might entertain baby for a few minutes. I have to assume that a simple set of baby's stacking cups can be as useful a tool for teaching the concept of colors and sizes, and that we don't need an instruction manual for teaching baby what \\"blue\\" means.This book is rather insulting and could only be good for someone who has absolutely no clue what to do with their baby, and who would otherwise just be sitting there dumbly, not speaking to or interacting with their baby at all. If you find this book actually teaches you how to interact with your baby, perhaps you should have gotten a puppy instead. =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful for new parents","review":"My wife and I got this book as a baby shower gift before our first child was born.

After having done some research, apparently red cedar only kills moths and larvae if the fumes are totally sealed up tightly, which is why I chose this cabinet.The planks arrived in great condition, and smelled strongly of cedar. They fit nicely into the bottom of this wooden cabinet - I didn't have to use any adhesive. I laid paper over that, and then the silks. So far, so good.I'm curious to see how long the scent lasts, but I'm hoping that in the tightly sealed cabinet, it will retain the scent for a while. I'm happy to recharge the planks with cedar oil when the time comes, but so far whenever i open the cabinet, a strong smell of cedar wafts out.

This volume contains only a very few examples of the most powerful works of a handful of major mindtwisting visual artists.No, it's not just a gallery. Instead, what we have are explanations - the \\"why?\\" of Escher, the \\"what?\\" of Dali, and the \\"how the -?\\" of modern shadow-sculptures. (The sailing-ship of scissors on the back must be seen.) The origins and evolution of the school of illusion are described in detail, but in such a way that the reading is far from dry.Buy it.

It has a little of this, a little of that, and omits material that some of us might have added.

Next are some rather innocent optical illusions from Sandor del Prete and Jos de Mey. And then we see a few classic works by M. C. Escher.I found Rob Gonsalves' transformations of scenery simply, um, enchanting. Others whose art can be looked at in more than one way include Octavio Ocampo and Rex Whistler.Leave your copy of it on your coffee table and watch the reaction from your friends when they have a look at it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy Customer","review":"I just want to say that I am very pleased with the service I'm getting from Amazon.

Yet when I opened the box, I was disappointed to see that they had used cardboard sleeves to keep the DVDs in. Even worse, they had a rough cardboard edge directly in the middle of the DVD.Due to the packaging, the DVDs shifted around during shipping, and several were scratched. Approximately 5 would start freezing while being played - but not until a good part of an episode!I contacted Amazon, who sent me another box, and allowed me to pick and choose between the better DVDs. I managed to get a complete set that works, with minor scratches, but I'm afraid that storing them inside the Rambaldi DVD sleeves will just scratch them further.Great idea, but the packaging is horrible. You'll spend more time trying to assemble a working set, then it's worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Package","review":"Don't get me wrong, I'm an Alias obsessee. But the packaging for this item was horrible. I received the first one and 90% of the discs were scratched. I then received a replacement and every since one of the discs were scratched.

I'm not sure when they started this exactly - but newer copies of the box have the individual DVD's packaged in thin plastic sleeves that prevent scratching. All of my discs look brand new, without any glue or scuff marks on them. I'm not sure if there's any way to tell from outside the box if it's a newer or older pressing, but it does look like Buena Vista finally addressed the situation.

It looked like they had been packed by someone who had just eaten fried chicken. They were new, but looked used. Two of the disks has major scratches.

Though the plots are intriguing and tied together throughout 6 seasons in amazing ingenuity, if you're questioning this on the basis of whether or not it is a good movie suitable to watch with family values, it is definitely not.There is nothing explicit in it (no nudity or extreme profanity, etc), and the violence is relatively managed and not gory. But fidelity has no place in the TV series, and truth is greatly maligned as this series brings sympathy to the darkness of deceit.I can't recommend this movie to anyone for these reasons...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems with Packaging","review":"Just like many others, I was disappointed upon opening my Rambaldi box to discover that every disc in the set (beside the bonus disc in its hidden compartment) was deeply scratched. With today being Thanksgiving, I haven't been able to contact Amazon to see about securing a replacement, but I will be attempting this soon. It's a shame that greater care wasn't taken when designing the individual season holders inside the main package (which is quite impressive itself). For a limited edition item, this leaves much to be desired, even though the show held within should rate much higher than the rating I've given this set. Buyer beware, and check your discs as soon as you receive this item!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is only about the packaging of the DVD set","review":"Simply, if you are a collector, don't buy this set. It has an essential designing defect. for example there is not even one simple DVD in this box that you can find defectless. all of them are scratched because of wrong desiging of Disc holders, Some have been caused scratches during the packaging line, some in transportation and some at the first time you pull each of them out!. worse is, there are finger prints on many of discs. Box is very good looking inside out, maybe unique but when you want to pull out a disc and play it and when you see the scratches all over not most, ALL OF THEM, you feel you want to throw it out in trashcan! Yes it comes in shrink wrapp but in Amazon terms, it's status is \\"ACCEPTABLE\\" not \\"NEW\\". if they sell it at the price of 30 to 40 dollars it may worth it but in this price buying it just like you roll you money and light is as a cigar!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Scratched and Worthless","review":"I my husband bought me this set as a gift for Christmas, and I couldn't wait to open it.

I had to return all 29 discs for replacement and today (23/1/07) I received back the discs I sent in for replacement in the first place.

This show is completely addictive and you will not be disappointed.The intricate storyline has so many layers that you will appreciate it more each time that you watch it. Without giving away any details...you have Jennifer Garner as the leading lady playing Sydney Bristow a CIA agent. There is nonstop action with secret CIA missions, romance, and a dark, mysterious Davincicodesque subplot based on the prophecies of \\"Rambaldi\\". The acting is fantastic and there are so many characters on the show that I adore.This is an excellent gift for people who like this genre. There are some great tv shows that I would hesitate to purchase the DVDs of for fear that they would not be watched more than once but this show is NOT one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Killer show... Killer DVD set","review":"This is a great box set for you Alias fans. The box itself is well crafted and packed with every episode from seasons 1-5. Each season is arranged in it's own booklet set of disks. These flip like pages in a book.... and the dvds simply slide out of the pages. This set is not like those other annoying dvd set holders that are like accordians and hard to keep organized. In addition to the regular episode disk, there is a secret compartment within the set which contains a bonus dvd with hours of extra footage. Not too mention the last disk in every season contains deleted scenes, tv specials, making of... etc.The only thing I was hoping for was some kind of rambaldi artifact. But, with all the disks in this set... they would have to call it the Rambaldi artifact trunk.Anyway, this is an absolute must have if you are a die hard fan or like conspiracy theory + spy + sci-fi type thrillers.

You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very impressive set!!","review":"I just received this dvd set this afternoon (Thank you Amazon for a quick ship to Canada!) and it is by far the most impressive box set I have gotten. I just love how all 5 seasons fit into the Rambaldi box and how easy it is to open and close back up. I really got into Alias during it's second season but didn't find time to watch much of seasons 4 and 5, so having every single episode in one complete package is great! This is a great set for any Alias fan that doesn't already have the individual seasons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Show Horrible Packaging","review":"I received this as a birthday gift and was concerned due to the fact that so many others had issues regarding scratched discs. Upon opening the box and examining each disc I noticed all mine were also scratched and marred as well which is a shame since the box design is cool. I figured since so many others had the same issue what was the point of exchanging it as I would probably just get another defective item. I then sent all my discs to be professionally repaired and cleaned and this corrected most of the issues although that cost me almost $80. I just cannot believe that a product this expensive could be this defective and as such highly recommend buying the individual seasons in lieu of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Years later, it still has the same awful packaging!","review":"My boyfriend bought me this set a few years ago.

This year he spoke to someone at Amazon who informed him that the packaging had been redesigned, so he bought me the set again.

This makes for some wild instructions and impossible gauges. When changing a machine pattern to a hand knit pattern, you can't simply replace \\"needle\\" with stitch, as is done in this book. Furthermore, some manuevers that are easy and common on a machine are awkward and seldom used when knitting by hand, but this book does not offer alternatives.In short, I find it highly doubtful that any test garments for these patterns were actually produced by hand.

There is less chance of the tactic coming from a busted or unfashionable line.It also seems unfair to trash Aagaard's work simply because it is \\"another puzzle book.\\" One doesn't throw away a Stephen King novel because it is just another horror story. Rather you should judge the work on its merit within the genre. It is a well researched and useful tactics book and will increase your tactical ability.

Its short & sweet. It may not be a full course meal but its certainly a great appetizer. The cd features 5 songs from Jeffrey Osborne..Don't stop...On the wings of love..Congratulations.. Stay with me tonight.. and You should be mine(the woo woo song). There are also 5 songs from Lenny Williams.. Choosing you.. Ooh child.. Shoo doo fu fu ooh.. Since I met you.. and the one that I love most..Cause I love you! Naturally these artist have way more songs, and there are probably more extensive music cds from both artist available, but if you want a nice sample addition of some of their greatest songs this is nice to have."},{"rating":"1","title":"the jewlery is meh","review":"Very small...

The Gables were thinking of buying a summer home in the eastern U.S., and ended up with an architecturally significant villa outside of Venice!Their joys and trials of renovating the villa in a small town with limited BUT ENDEARING craftsmen is wonderful. Sharing their adventures and acceptance in this small town are a joy to anyone who has ever visited the such towns of Italy.The characters are unforgettable, not to mention the honor of living in a Palladian home.Thanks to the Gables."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the point?","review":"I was very interested in reading \\"Palladian Days\\", after seeing the Gables written up in a magazine. Their very interesting and unusual story certainly deserved to be featured in a book. Although the story of their life in this magnificent home held my interest, I was very, very disappointed that Mrs. Gable chose to use her book as a forum to air quite a condescending attitude toward the former owners. This was not alluded to once, or even twice, but was a sub-theme throughout the book. What is the point of this? It came across arrogant, superior, and frankly, rather than siding with Mrs. Gable, I wondered what about her as person would cause her to stoop to such a low level. None of her readers care about hearing her shovel the dirt, but she made a point of highlighting it repeatedly nonetheless. Not too classy, and certainly a huge detraction from an otherwise good story. All I wondered at the end was, \\"What is her agenda????\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly entertaining but a big missed opportunity...","review":"Some people have stories to tell but do not realize the bigger story in their own story. I would say the author missed the story. There is so little of anything to do with Palladio - it's all about the Cornaros (Venetian Rockefeller types in their day) and eternal family lines. And the author's own aspirations for her family to be as dynastic (and own the villa for the next 200 years - very unlikely fairytale). One wonders what the author is really doing buying this house - trying to make her own family into a dynasty? That's what it sounds like sometimes. I listened to the audio version of the book.Bottom line: The personal story is of some interest, but the star of the show - Palladio - gets very short shrift in this book. Alas. What could have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"not again....","review":"Please don't shoot the messenger/ reviewer, but when I find something bad, I just can't say otherwise.....Remember those little photo albums titled Grandma's Brag Book? Palladian Days is somewhat like one of those without the cute pictures. At first these memoirs of expat life in foreign locales were charming and fun, but by now they've been done to death. In this audio version, the narration is performed by the author, Sally Gable, in a not very professional manner. While this volume contains some interesting detail in places, it's just too long and full of labored metaphors and weak jokes. I think if this had been one of the first of this genre that I'd picked up, I might have found it charming. But how many of these can you read and still find fresh?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A special treat for home renovators","review":"As an old house renovator, I found much to love about this story of an American couple who buys a 450-year-old Italian villa for their summer home.

While I'm normally not a fan of nonfiction, I wasn't bored for a moment by this fascinating book. The portrait they paint of Italian life and the amazing historic villa make me want to book a flight and go there right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"useful product","review":"Used this underneath the kennel for our dog.

His stories of Bryant, Jordan, Allison, and many others have a warmth and affection about them, recognizing that there are no perfect people, only ordinary people who sometimes accomplish great things...A very humane book about idols and heroes...It is also a story about Mr. Bolton's growth and understanding that sports, while enjoyable and important, are part of life, not life itself. References to experiences and coverage of the Civil Rights Movement and changes in the newspaper business give this book a depth and perspective many sports books do not have.

It's set in a decently open world full of secrets and Easter eggs, like a giant mankilling chicken that has a golden egg. This, however, has its issues I'd mean to address. Firstly, calling your dragon, there's a known glitch that seemingly randomly your dragon disappears when you walk into a building, wouldn't be an issue if you save often while your dragon is around, but say that you are walking into an automatic save location the dragon can't get into... you've just permanently lost your dragon. Once you come back out, if you call for him he'll never appear... that could be disastrous even with only a few hours of gameplay. More to come as I finish this review later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drakan: the Ancients' Glitch","review":"As a previous reviewer mentioned, there is a major glitch in this game. Your dragon can completely disappear. However, unlike the other reviewer, my dragon disappeared in front of my eyes never to be seen again.

He eases concerns that bad luck is somehow the result of lack of worthiness and verifies that good luck often is experienced by unsavory people. He establishes that, by its very nature, luck is not controlled by other characteristics or occurrences of our lives, but there are things we can do to fully benefit from the good luck that we do have."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Shaving Cream I've Ever Used","review":"This is by far the best shaving cream that I've ever used.

Once you get past the fact that you can mow down a crowd with a AK 47 or chop someone's head off or break their leg and arm there is not much to this game. It plays like this...walk around beating/shooting/stabbing...gangs and the police/corporation and doing silly missions like escorting characters, killing heavily armed/protected business men and things of that nature. You cannot drive ANYTHING...The weapons are pretty cool, as is the fighting action...but the story and actual depth of the game is not all that at all...GTA3 was 100% better...RENT IT BEFORE YOU BUY IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Throwaway","review":"I should have rented before I bought.

Sadly, it did not. The graphics are mediocre, the music is terrible, and the missions are both frustrating and boring. The only slightly fun thing about the game is the CHAOS mode where you can randomly mow down innocent civilians with a chain-gun, but even this gets boring pretty quick, as the same people just keep reappearing.

The game is bad. It is repetitive. I took it back after 2 days. Bad game, easy to beat, and even easier to hate.You walk around and shoot stuff. You find stuff like guns, and shoot otehr things. There are no cool characters. There are like 4 environments that are small, repetitive, and bland. You honestly can't say anything good about this game.On the kaos mode, you can shoot everything for points. All the time you will be under civilian penalty. O THATS REAL FUN! If you shoot a civilian you lose tons of points. For about 2 seconds the penalty is off, but by that time you don't wanna break you boring streak of not killing anything and only shooting controlled burst to avoid killing any civilians.Seriously, there isn't any freedom in this game like gta.

Get Grand Theft Auto 3 instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"All hype but no pipe","review":"...But in and of itself, the game has no real value. The gameplay is shallow and predictable. The missions are lame and the same.... All the characters are lame and have no real depth, the story is pointless and suffers from \\"been there done that\\" deja' vu. It's hard to get into and thanks to the cheat codes it would be impossible to keep up with. The people running around and looting all day get's old after 4 hours. I guess the developes don't expect people to play the game but 20 minutes at a time. After awhile you wonder, where are all these people coming from and how ca they still be looting 3 hours into the game? It gets old fast because the environment never changes, all the level look and feel the same. If they had a clock in it where day and night creat changes... then maybe it would be interesting... because this game is boring and dull...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much replay value","review":"Basically I agree with most of what has been said already, this game gets old pretty quick. The missons are repetitive and pointless and to be honest this games gives you a headache after awhile. It doesnt have the carefully thought out missons and strategy of a GTA3 nor does it have the graphics of GTA3. It looks like a game that Rockstar threw together in a short time and threw onto the shelves, very dissapointing. There are 2 modes; Chaos, which is basically you running around shooting cops, breaking windows, and shooting weapons in an effort to score as many points as you can in 3 minutes, and Revolution mode, which consists of several pointless missons that get old real quick. After Max Payne and GTA3 this is a letdown for fans of Rockstar games, but I guess everyone deserves to have a bad day. Maybe next time..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total hype and a total disappointment","review":"Those who are interested in buying this game because they enjoyed GTA3 are in for a huge disappointment. GTA3's strengths came in the complete recklessness of the violence and the limitlessness and realism of the environment. State of Emergency however has gameplay which must have been designed with children under 12 in mind: it seems like a big cartoon, with unrealistic ultrafast choppy motion, over-colored surroundings, and goofy announcer-style \\"Smash windows for extra points!!!\\" voices. The game play is far more linear than the preview videos would have you believe, and has so many hints along the way that it leads nothing to the imagination. A huge step backwards for Rockstar Games, and one which will make me question 100% before ever buying one of their titles again without renting it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the Point?","review":"When I rented this game, I was expecting another GTA3 except you get to run around rioting. But what I found was nothing near what I hoped for. Instead of the realistic graphics, weapons, and people like in GTA3, I found a cartoonish world without the graphics and realism of of GTA3. In this game, you just go around rioting. I mean smashing windows, burning buildings and cars, tipping over cars, eveything you'd expect in a riot.

All you do is go around killing all of the police that you come by, and doing small tasks for those who tell you what to do. You can shoot the innocent bystanders if you really want to (but in a real revolution why would you want to do that anyway?).The point is that in shooter games like Doom, Red Faction, etc. at least other people are attacking you as well. In military strategy games such as SOCOM II and the type, you have to strategize. Killing EVERYBODY you feel like in an extremely overpacked mall (such as level 1) is just kind of childish.

If you have a choice between GTA3 and SOE just get GTA3. it does what SOE attempts but better. The whole sense of freedom is absent in SOE. No story either.

The storyline is pretty cool, I liked the idea of playing as a revolutionist trying to overthrow a repressive government. But after 15-20 min the game fell through. The game is just too monotonous to be of any replay value. I enjoyed the game at first, but the missions are pretty much the same thing over and over. I trudged through the game anyways, just to see the ending. What really annoyed me was the ending! I thought the ending would be interesting, but it was not worth at all.

Max Payne was a much bigger hit than this. don't git this garbage, unless u r a big fan of riot games, and end up killin ever1, then rent it. Even GTA 1 and 2 were better than this.

If you are interested in buying State of Emergency and you don't have GTA3, rent State of Emergency and buy GTA3.State of Emergency has a good plot and has very good graphics. It also has good but repetitive missions and it has fairly difficult gameplay. I think the game should have more rewards after you complete a place, not just getting another player who isn't better or worse than your starting charactors.Rent the game first before you buy because there are gonna be some people who hate this game and there will be some who think its only decent.

To make this review really short, I'll say this. Playing Grand Theft Auto 3, then playing State of Emergency is like dating the captain of the cheerleading squad all year, then taking her ugly sister to the prom. I think everyone assumed that since both titles were developed by Rockstar Games, that SoE would emulate GTA3. But there is absolutely no discernable storyline. The characters are unbelievably corny, and the game play is tame and shallow. In fact, a robust game of Tetris has more depth than SoE.

It has to be fun.\\"Well, I should have checked myself, buying before renting (which I'm usually much more careful about). The game is fun for about the first 15 minutes and then it loses all of its appeal. You don't have the open active environment that GTA III had and you get motion sickness after a while watching 4 million people run around you.I think this would have been more fun maybe five years ago.

I thought you could wander the city as in GTA3. Nope. The game is split into levels. Small ones at that. I cant say for sure tho, i sold the game after playing the first level for about half an hour. This is lame. The controls are too touchy, graphics arent all that great, missions are lame, and there is a timer in chaos mode, so u cant just go around and do whatever u want. Also, from the decriptions, i thought u would be able to break into stores and stuff, nope again, u can break the windows and that is about it. I was thoroughly disgusted with this game. Rockstar should be ashamed of themselves. This has to be one of the worst games i have ever played.

The stores and such look rather bland. You can't even enter them so it seems lacking in that you can't raise hell inside the stores as well. However, this game takes off in terms of action once you've got 10 or more gang members/corporation members on your tail and you manage to pick up the shotgun or grenade launcher. There's lots and lots of weapons to pick up from tasers, axes, pepper spray, swords, Ak-47's, Uzis, shotguns, grendade launchers, etc. The action gets intense as you try to accomplish your next mission while you've got bogies on your tail, bystanders in the way, and a loaded weapon in your hands. What to do? What to do? Well, anything you want. That's what. Gameplay isn't very original or deep. It's just basic, mindless fun with replay value accomplished by trying to unlock other characters and areas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing like a good old fashioned riot","review":"I don't know what to make of this game. I think the idea is for it to be serious, but I wound up laughing at this game while playing it. You are going against the corporation and all h*ll breaks loose. For that matter, everything breaks loose. The crowd is all rioting by breaking into stores and stealling. You go around with your trusty baseball bat and club people to a nice pulp. But wait till the cops get a hold of you. You won't be a happy camper for long. Basically, the idea is interesting, if not a little warped. But the final verdict is that it is boring to play and has very little story line, if any, to keep you wanting more. I would say I got a few good laughs out of it. You haven't lived until you have seen a town go on a riot rampage. Speaks volumes about how RockStar sees society. Lots of people were looking forward to this game. It is luck that there wasn't a riot after they found out how poor the game was.

After that you have done pretty much everything.Guess what no multiplayer. I mean whats up with dat, this game has been staged to be the all out battle royale of the streets but you have to take turns with your buddies.If you like repetitive missions that lack any content at all then go ahead and buy this game, otherwise stay away and wait for GTA 4, whenever that will hit the shelves hopefully this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"FIRST GRAND THEFT NOW IN A MALL","review":"THIS GAME IS THE BEST THING SINCE GRAND THEFT AUTO3.

This and GTA 3 are the must haves of the Sony PS2 line. Rockstar did it again, a must have for anyone 3-99. (ok, parents, don't get this for your kids, extreme graphic content and blood... [It's] definately for all you dads out there who love beating... anyone you see...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"AAAARRRRGGGHHHH!!!!","review":"WHAT A LETDOWN!!! I bought this game thinking that it was going to be a next level GTA but it wasn't. I never got past the mall because the game was too ridiculous and all you are doing is running around the whole time which is so stupid. Rockstar could have kept this game in the closet."},{"rating":"2","title":"This game Rulez","review":"If you are listening to these idiotz who say it ... . Well, listen again. The only reason they think it ... is because they are only comparing it to Gta3 (that game is better). This is your average beat 'em up games xcept 2 x better. The best parts are the missions, sure they can get violent but if ur not a chicken, u'll know what I mean. The worst part would probably be the lack of multiplayer. But if you like beat 'em up games w/ missions then put this on your \\"to buy\\" list."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment","review":"Normally I like the ideas of a \\"smashmouth\\", in your face type of game but this really stunk. State of Emergency was not fun on the basis of getting beat down by 50 guys isn't fun. I could barely clear the second stage. The only thing that people keep telling me about how fun this game is, is because you're in a RIOT. O.k. what else? - Blank stares and immediate silence -Yeah I thought so.Really, everytime I'd complete a level and from what I thought was a high score, I'd lose twice as many points because of civilian casualities? Um, hello if you're in a RIOT and you're stealing and breaking stuff, wouldn't that make you a criminal too?My thoughts are my own but if you have your heart set on getting this game, rent it first and then see what you think.Happy Gaming!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Save ten bucks and buy it at best buy","review":"I bought this game, primarily, because it looked interesting and it was only $19 at Best Buy. It's okay. No big shakes, really- you are a member of a liberation organization set to bring down an evil corporation which runs the lives of the citizenry. Ultimately predictable, although oddly addictive (especially for those with insomnia- if you can't sleep, and don't want to concentrate on things like plot, it's the game to have). For twenty dollars, the pros outweigh the cons. DON'T spend any more than twenty dollars for it, though! I'm SO glad I didn't shell out fifty bucks for it, when it first came out!Warning to parents: it's violent to the extreme (shooting innocent people who are running away from you, and blowing off the heads of gang members with shotguns), so may not be suitable for a lot of kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not GTA3, but still old-school cool","review":"This game'sgraphics are not ground breaking or all that eye-catchy, but what they are is a bit of a throw-back to the original animated action adventure games. This game is not going for realism like GTA3 achieves, what it is striving for is a fast paced, senseless animated riot and excuse for mindless violence and general brutality, which is exactly what it gives you. If you are looking for GTA3, you may be disappointed, but the gameplay is still cool, the violence is fun and at times almost comical, which is to be expected by it's cartoon-like appearance. What could be cooler then decapitating a random rioter (or a corporate suit) with your shotgun, and then picking up that person's severed head and beating other passersby to death with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent, don't buy.","review":"With ringing denunciations from Sen. Joseph Lieberman and other social watchdogs, State of Emergency looks great on paper. The numerous explosions and cool crowd engine make the game look great in a demo, too. Unfortunately, the game play is ill-thought out. The missions rely on rote memory rather than skill, the set-ups often seem contrived and repetitive.The shoot-em-up Chaos mode is amusing, but the other supplementary games are equally frustrating. The \\"Last Clone Standing\\" game was a bit disturbing-even for people who like senseless violence as much as I do. The mission of this game is to \\"Kill Corporation Clones\\" the only problem is that the clones are unarmed, they don't fight back. They cower, they huddle, they run and scream in pain.I can't give any game that includes optional indiscriminate use of a flamethrower a completely bad review, but State of Emergency is a game that, once played, quickly looses its appeal."},{"rating":"2","title":"good game","review":"the graphics are not the greatest but this game is fun running around killing people and there is millions of different weapons!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great effort from Rockstar","review":"I got this game Friday as Best Buy seemed to have it early. Anyway, it is fun--if fun is over two hundred people running on screen at once and you having the ability to murder all of them. The graphics are cartoonish, possibly to counteract the massive amounts of gore and violence.You know a game is great when you can blow someone's head off and beat another person to death with it.The missions--though there are 175--are kind of bland and follow the same, \\"Go here, kill him, bring me this\\" type of formula. However, SOE is quite possibly the funniest game ever made; you and your friends will laugh, laugh, and laugh some more. Reccommended for anyone who has beat GTA3 and still wants a little more action...This game got four stars from me: it's hilarious, conceptually genious, and deep. However, there is no targeting system. The levels are fun but need a little bit more interaction. The graphics aren't that great.But...SOE is a must-buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment...","review":"This could go as the most over-hyped game of the year. What an absolute let-down!! For what was supposed to be such a great game, it is just mind numbingly stupid. Rockstar, how about adding some precision control to this and maybe some cut-scenes and hmmmmm maybe more spoken word? And can we talk about how TEDIOUS it is to run all the way back through the mall once you've failed the task so that you can run all the way back to try the task again?? I will give the game some credit for the amount of onscreen characters, but beyond that....... And I thought the creators were delaying the release to make the game even better. Shame on me. This one is being traded in ASAP."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's no GTA3","review":"Yup. But it is good at wearing out your thumb. I can imagine how many people will want to buy this game, given that rockstar made the great GTA3. Just don't let the name fool you - this game is just a lot of headache... There's way too much going on on the screen at one time, and it's near impossible to concentrate on the game hero. The game is basically a specialized gta3 (centered on beating people up and breaking things), except it's nowhere near as realistic (you can run straight through people, and the amount of detail is miniscule, compared to gta3).Overall, I strongly recommend renting this game first. Once you do, I'm quite sure you won't want to buy it. Everyone is everywhere at once, and you will find yourself jamming the buttons mindlessly."},{"rating":"1","title":"State of Boredom","review":"Unlike many people, I was not expecting a GTA3 clone when I rented State of Emergency. I've learned to not do that when it comes to games. That fact notwithstanding, I was still pretty disappointed in this game.The premise is not so bad, but the execution leaves much to be desired. The missions get stale very quickly. Though, I didn't play very far into it, so maybe they get better? Serving as an escort for rebellion force members that can't/won't fight is rather disheartening. Also, I have a complaint about the aiming mechanism, namely that there wasn't one. You just sort of have to point your weapon in the general direction of the goons and shoot. Combine this with the sometimes awkward camera angles, and you have a difficult time offing the Corporation with anything but your bare hands or a melee weapon. The game is not all bad, though. The music and sound effects were nicely done, the graphics were excellent, and the sheer chaos of the levels were fantastic.<BR..."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the reasons to own a PS2","review":"This game is so much fun to play.

You can't interact with the environment. You can do 3 things: break windows, kill people, blow up cars. The missions are repetitive, go get something and bring it back. You can't enter the buildings or cars. The worlds are small and not interesting. It's just a lame button masher where you hit or kick tons of enemies until they're dead. The graphics are OK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent it first! For your own good.","review":"The game is fun for the first hour or so. After that first hour, you've now done just about everything the game has to offer.

DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE. Within an hour, you will want to sell this game. The missions are braindead. The enemies keep popping back, even though you killed them. All you have to do is turn around and BAM, they're back like nothing happened. The civilians are so annoying... And the areas are small, unimaginitive at best. You can't even explore. It's go from point a to point b, with no reward at the end. Save your money for something more fun."},{"rating":"1","title":":(","review":"This game was a big disapointment for me. I have been waiting for this game for a long time only to be disapointed with doing the same thing over and over. The only thing that changes in the game is the setting.

In fact, I am taking my back tonight and getting a different game!"},{"rating":"1","title":"GTA3 is better","review":"Although this game is entertaining, its gets old fast and repetitive. The goals are timed and a little too coached. If your a kid you'll love this game, but if your a little more mature and like a more realistic feel to a game, get GTA3.

This game is soooo monotonous. I bought it from the store when it first hit the shelves. I got bored with it after about the first 30 mins.

Just don't say that I didn't warn you."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was OK at first, but just plain annoying afterward.","review":"When I heared of this game, I thought \\"Oh great! A new game by Rockstar!\\". Then I got it. \\"This game is excellent\\" I thought, but two days later, it was the worst game ever made. \\"The word frustrating doesn't even begin to describe it.\\" that was what the U.S version of Playstation Magazine issue number 55 said. Also, why don't the Corporation guards attack the gang members just standing around? \\"GTA 3 is probably the coolest game ever made, but State of Emergency isn't.\\" is another quote from the U.S version of Playstation Magazine issur number 55. But in my opinion, this game blows dogs for quarters. If you want my opinion, just rent the game before you buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"it was fun while it lasted","review":"When i rented SoE, it was quite an experience. seeing so many people on one screen with no slow downs was amazing. while the missons sounded cool, (protect stores, destroy buildings, guide people to safe houses.) they kept popping out in later missions. But another down side was i was playing the game so much, i beat the game in 2 days. To sum everything up, its fast paced action yet ends quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"I got burned [...].","review":"Do not buy this game! You've probably heard the hype, \\"it's made by Rockstar games, the people who did GTA3\\".This game blows. There are 4 levels (in the entire game) each the size of a very small quake 1 multiplayer map, with graphics that look downright PS1-ish.The gameplay [is terrible], the missions consist of running to the opposite side of the room to pick something up, and bring it back. yay. it takes about 30 seconds for a mission.Don't get this one.This game is the kind that makes a strong case for piracy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A game good to have","review":"I just bought the game and played it. I was waiting it for a month. I think it is a good game if you really like the killing part in GTA3. However, don't expect too much on this game. I think probably a player like me would spend a night to finish it. I suggest players use wild screen mode while they play specially for those players can't stand the first person shooting game. It will be fun if you play it with wild screen mode since you will not feel dizzy. I think they can improve the game a lot. Hope rockstar will continue. They already did a good job.

If you're considering this one, I strongly recommend renting it first before committing 50 ones to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why some games should be free","review":"If you like GTA and Midnight Club, do not assume that this Rockstar game is worth the plastic it is pressed on.

This game is horrible, but now it is old, cheaper, yet still horrible. I was one the unfortunate ones who could not get enough of GTA and thought this was the next step up. If you did not get the memo, saying this game is bad is now a truism. I played this game more than once, but that was only because I was really trying to like this game.

This game explores a entirely different world of crime. Not organized crime but more about crimes of hatred. Rioting, as used in this game, is provoked. Organized crime is for a profit to people. In GTA3 you tried to avoid causing damage (tried to avoid) in SOE your objective is to cause damage. I know everyone is entitled to their opinion but dont judge a game based on other very good games.

While the third installment is a little slow to develop, it does not disappoint in telling the final story. It is recommended that you watch all three films back to back to back to fully appreciate the final story since so much of it revolves around \\"Batman Begins\\", rather than \\"The Dark Knight\\". I will watch these three films again many times because the stories as told by Mr. Nolan and the screenwriters are outstanding as told on the big screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!","review":"As soon as i heard about this i knew i had to get it! i'm a big Batman fan. the case is nice looking and sturdy. once you open the box you see the movies and their special features right there. and the fact that it comes with digital copies of the three is even better! can't wait for the Ultimate Collector's Edition next year!"},{"rating":"1","title":"batman trilogy","review":"all movies but the second (dark Knight) does not work cd does not looked scratched but looks like it was damaged with whater or soemthing bc computer and dvd players in the house do not read disc.

Updated 12/20/12","review":"The movies were great and are even better when watching them back to back. However when I bought my Blu-Ray player I made the decision to buy only the premium products (deluxe edition/special editions/directors cuts etc etc) I did not want to clutter up my collection with movies I might watch once or maybe twice. The things I buy now I know I will watch at lease several times. The reason I gave it one star is simply because AFTER you open it there is a little piece of paper telling you that in 2013 there will be a Deluxe Edition box set released. I would have rather waited and paid a little more for the deluxe edition.Also each disk goes from scenes in full screen to letterbox and back again but I am told that is because of the IMAX scenes.If you are like me and want to buy the special/deluxe editions in box sets do not buy this YET."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst quality of a non-rental Blu-ray I have encountered","review":"There are no menus (no there isn't a pop-up either for others that have countered this argument in these reviews) I have tried 3 different Blu-ray players - 1 brand new Pioneer Elite, a 1 year old Sony, and a 1 year old Panasonic.Even if there was a pop-up menu, you can't pause or stop and then resume playing. You can't turn off your player and have it resume either. Phail. Trying to get a replacement copy and see if I just got a bad copy.

It is very easy to break your discs if you aren't careful. If Warner Bros. took more care in their packaging, this would have gotten 3 stars (3 instead of 5 because of the UltraViolet BS). But unfortunately I have to give this a 1 star rating due to the horrible packaging.If you don't care about the special features and you will probably never want to watch them, then consider this a 3 star set. Otherwise it's a 1 star set due to the fact that it's nearly impossible to get those special feature discs out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing the Dark Knight Rises movie disc","review":"It happens to me too!!

A must buy for any Batman Fan!","review":"The cover and the contents of this bare bones set is top notch. I was going to see the third film at the movies until the events that unfolded in the news. For the seventeen dollars and change you get all three movies. The last one, dispite what critics have said, is just as good as the previous films. I ususally like the director's commentary and extras with these sets. There are few extras but the content of these movies more than makes up for it. All three movies are very intense and will last with repeated viewings. I don't have a Blue Ray and really can't afford the cost of upgrading to a new player. However the picture quality is fine and good enough for my current TV set. I'm thinking future editions will have some type of commentary. However there isn't any from the director in this set.

I love the movies but the DVDs (as apposed to Blu-Ray) have exactly one extra - The Journey Of Bruce Wayne featurette. That's it. There is NOTHING beyond that on any disc: no director's commentary, no behind the scenes, nothing. How can there not be any commentary?!?! It doesn't even take up any space! The real drag is that as far as I can tell there is no place to get any of the myriad extras except by getting the Blu-Ray discs. That sucks.It also comes with a booklet with is selections of pictures from the book The Art and Making of The Dark Knight Trilogy... Meh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nolan Did It Right","review":"The Batman Trilogy has to be my favorite trilogy of all time and contains one of my top 5 movies of all time (The Dark Knight).

Fantastic video bargain.For once I don't feel that I have been robbed by an entertainment company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated (If You Can Imagine That)","review":"Let me keep this short and sweet: The Dark Knight Trilogy is one of the best, if not the best, trilogies ever made. If not for The Dark Knight's amazing success, The Dark Knight Rises would not feel so unremarkable by some. Put simply, Christopher Nolan made Batman respectable again, after the Joel Schumaker debacle. If you have not seen these movies, you are doing yourself a disservice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blu ray is AWESOME","review":"This is our first time buying blu ray discs. They are a nice upgrade.

Has a decent amount of features, a great price, nice looking and sleek, and of course the films look great."},{"rating":"2","title":"wish it had dvd version included","review":"Couldn't wait to get this to watch in the privacy of my own home theatre! Just wish it had the dvd versions included so I could put them on my hard drive/media server. I thought Violet would allow me to download the digital version but it only streams it - tried to set up an account but maybe my connection is too slooowww - after three tries at 5' ea, I said screw it - just stick with the discs. The included booklet is pretty cool, but so what- wish the cover design was better (some frank miller art maybe?). Well I'm going to watch it again in a few minutes. I know there are critics out there who point out some gaps in the story line with incredulity. I read comics and I read the news. Gaps in the story line of real life or imagination land are not rare. The movies are bl@p#$n awesome!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Value plus get to watch it off of UV","review":"Thought this was the best comic book series yet so wasn't going to not buy this, but blu-ray disks plus a digital copy to watch them over the holidays when my options are this or whatever the 1940's movie my aunt picks out? ya... came in handy to play on the Roku (didn't have the disks with me)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great service!","review":"Great movies.

What annoys me is the fact that the height and depth are DVD-sized and not Blu Ray sized. Whoever at Warner did this was STUPID. I have it on the end of the shelf but it still sticks out both ways and looks awful. I am also a little appalled at how brazenly Warner includes a coupon for an upcoming \\"ultimate\\" package due next year... like I would buy that too!! Hey, you just bought this new car but we're going to have a bigger, better one next year, so here's a coupon!!! Actually, it's so weird and twisted that it's kind of funny. Simply put: love it, hate it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"good buy","review":"awesome price for all 3 movie on blu-ray considering if you got to target and buy just the dark knight rises on blu ray your going to shell out 30 dollars. my only thing is im reading other reviews and people have already received theirs and mine hasn't even shipped yet. i ordered it the 4th of November and thought i would get it on the release date of the 3rd movie. WTF AMAZON"},{"rating":"1","title":"batman never begins","review":"So i was really excited when I ordered this trilogy, all three on blu-ray in the same box. kinda hard to miss place one. Well went to put in Batman Begins and it would not play. it would roll through the MPAA rating then it would cut to black and freeze up my blu-ray player. I ordered a replacement and I just got it in today and Batman Begins would also not work again!!! I'm done with trying with this box set. It seems like less difficulty to just buy all three individually. Don't get this box set unless you like all the hassle of returning over and over again....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfect","review":"This set would be absolutely perfect if not for the fact that the movies don't come in three individual cases. Personally, I find this to be a drawback because you have to bring the entire box set along if you want to take just one of the three movies to someone else's house. And there's always the security factor. Discs are much safer when they have their own individual packaging. Overall, great set and a fantastic deal at $30, though. Definitely worth taking advantage of this deal. If the price drives back up to around $50, I wouldn't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very smart purchase","review":"Three blu-rays for this price is an excellent deal. All three films in the series warrant multiple viewings. For comic book fans, batman fans, superhero fans and guys ages 15-55 these are a no-brainer. Women and those uninitiated to batman or superheroes can still get enjoyment from the drama and story of these films.This is 5 star series, even despite Christian Bale's bad voice acting. They feature intense action, drama and memorable characters, particularly the villains."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must buy!","review":"Such a great trilogy!

For the $18 price I paid, it was a steal. The presentation is fine and the booklet was a nice surprise. It's all most people want or need."},{"rating":"2","title":"BATMAN!!!","review":"Not just the campy comic book movies you would expect!

I was so overwhelmed at the mastery of the medium that I had just witnessed that I had a hard lump in my throat, tears on the edges of my eyes and several suddenly-caught breaths.

I tried it in a blu-ray player and my ps3 with firmware updates and got nothing. Not only does it not play but it shuts off and freezes the entire blu ray player, and on the ps3 you get to the home screen and there is no play button.

The clock is silver grey, the hands black. The dial illumination is totally insufficient; the black hands do not reflect the light but are casting very irritating dark shadows. It is impossible to read the time and by trying to figure out what is shadow and what are the hands, the light is off again. In addition, the press-down switch for the illumination makes a loud disturbing cracking noise when pressing it down. The only plus is, that the clockwork really is totally silent, no wonder, it has no second hand. The combination of a wonderfully silent clockwork lacking a second hand and lacking proper illumination makes it difficult to find out if the clock is working at all (if you need to know in the middle of the night)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"I owned and used a Braun travel alarm for about twenty years, and it was as reliable as you could want. This newer model so far seems to be the same.It is bulkier than my old one, but the cover is more secure. I wish the cover could lock in its open position as it does in its closed position. As it is, the cover often drags when you lift the clock, and the noise could disturb a lightly sleeping spouse.As another reviewer pointed out, the light does not illuminate the dial well, but I've been able to make out the time anyway. This was true for my older model as well.The alarm is sufficiently loud without being obnoxious. It does not really \\"crescendo\\" as the Braun Web site claims. Rather it, increases the number of beeps per second. That's not what I expected, but it works.The controls are simple and fairly intuitive, better than the earlier model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Braun \\"Travel Alarm\\"","review":"Works very well, but the alarm is unnecessarily louder than it has been in previous models."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their best album","review":"This album was a big hit, and was released just before the band became visible in Tv and popular magazines. They were still sort of underground when they recorded this, and some of their best songs are here. They are a rock n roll band, sort of like the stones, but the lyrics are unique, funny and represent the way many young urban people talk in their everyday life.

They are smart, outrageous, hilarious, and thought-provoking. They make us remember what it was like to have an imagination, before life and conformity squashed it out of us, and the books encourage us, I think, to try to recapture that excitement. And I admire the author for stopping the series while it was still good. Charles Schulz continued with \\"Peanuts\\" decades after the strip stopped being innovative or even interesting, but Watterson knew when to stop, and that is a good thing.

I put it in the garbage after a few weeks, as it was taking up space on my shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"A largely useless, narrow view of a complex man.","review":"In Stalin: Breaker of Nations, Robert Conquest has done what should never be done in historical works. He starts out with a point to prove, then chooses stories which support that point. This is a ridiculously skewed view of a terribly complex human being. Conquest compounds the problem by not footnoting the work at all, so that 90% of his material cannot even be found by anyone wishing to follow his research. He also, in the bibliographical notes, relates how other authors on Stalin have been \\"taken in\\" by various accounts, which are more neutral in their portrayal of Stalin... yet fails to expound on what other, more negative, sources have taken him in. For a simple work of character assasination (of a figure for whom this has been done MANY times), this work is acceptable. As a historical work, it is essentially useless"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cold War Lies","review":"This is one of the most historically inaccurate books published on the Cold War, and in specific Stalin. Robert Conquest is the head of the \\"cold warriors\\" who simply re-wrote history to fit their propaganda purposes. Conquest actually worked for a division of British Intelligence in the 50's and 60's which created anti-communist propaganda, based on sheer fabrication and lies. This work is no different. It stinks of right wing anti-communist propaganda and fabrication. The original anti-Stalin propaganda first came into the US in the 30's via Hearst, who relied on sources from his good friend Adolf Hitler. For a more objective and less politically motivated look at Stalin I would reccomend \\"The Soviet Communist Party Reconsidered\\" by J. Arch Getty, \\"Life & Terror In Stalin's Russia\\" Thurston, \\"Stalin: Man Of History\\" by Ian Grey, among many others. Please do not take this book seriously!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No surprises. The information supplied prior to ordering was 100% accurate","review":"I purchsed this for a university class.

It helps me keep track of my steps in a day when I am very busy and can't find the time to work out. It is very accurate, easy to read, and compactible.

After 3 weeks I still had not received a replacement so I called. Omron told me they were out of stock, despite the fact that Amazon and plenty of other retailers seemed to have plenty. I finally got my replacement about a week after that. It came with a bill for $8.00. Apparently the warranty doesn't cover return shipping, even when you have a defective product that fails during the warranty period. So they don't keep replacements in stock, don't notify customers of delays and don't cover the full cost of replacing a defective product.This is not a company with a customer friendly culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny!","review":"This pedometer works extremely well. I wear mine daily (on my waist). It is very accurate. I also appreciate the calories burned feature as it keeps me from eating those extra little goodies that have only 250 or 300 calories per bag when I realize that I have to walk 3 miles to work that little bag off. I have not used the computer application. One down side, there isn't a daily \\"reset\\" button, so if you walk a bit and then have a specific area to walk that you want to measure, you can't reset it to zero as it resets itself overnight."},{"rating":"2","title":"MY COUSINS DREAM COME TRUE","review":"My cousins daughter is 2 yrs old.

Too Bad I Can't Hear Much Of The Dialogue","review":"I'm sure that this is an interesting movie, except that the dialogue in the soundtrack has been recorded many levels lower than the general background sound level in the movie. I hate movies like this where the soundtrack has not been normalized. With both the Windows volume at max, Amazon Unbox volume at max and my headphone's volume at max, the dialogue was barely discernible, although the general background sound of the movie was then too loud. I don't understand why motion picture sound engineers do this. At least Amazon could have normalized the soundtrack levels before offering this movie for download."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"The sound was terrible. I couldn't hear the audio and therefore was not able to watch it. Please fix it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio is horrendous","review":"Given the way this movie plays on Amazon Instant Video, it alternates from being impossible to hear the dialogue to having your ears blown out by loud effects like an alarm going off. I tried watching it on my TV through my Xbox (using the Amazon Instant Video app) -- could not hear any of the dialogue and yet non-dialogue sound like thunder would be so loud my neighbors could likely hear it. So I moved to watching this on my PC with headphones. Slightly more manageable but had to constantly move the audio up and down -- I felt like a guy fiddling constantly with the knob trying to tune into ham radio in bits and pieces. Not worth the headache."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not useful","review":"Perhaps the author is a better speaker than she is a writer and perhaps her workshops are more inspiring and insightful than her books? Unfortunately this book was neither informative nor inspiring. It consists of rambling remeniscenses about the author's life, which seem unrelated to what the author supposedly set out to do (to make the details of your life meaningful and manageable). She rehashes cliches and clobbers us over the head with heavy-handed metaphors. Ugh. The only thing that could have saved this book was better editing , which would have left you with 1 page of material that was worth reading (the exercise of walking through your home and assessing what you love and what you don't). There are far better books than this, using far better exercises to help you discover what you love, what your values are etc. Don't waste your money or your time on this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An inspiring read!","review":"\\"Organizing for the Spirit\\" is a wonderfully insightful and inspiring book! Not only does Sunny Schlenger help me organize the clutter but she also reminds me that to be able to continue to give of myself to my family and my community that it is absolutely necessary to take care of my spirit by focusing on those things that bring joy into my life. She energizes me to rediscover my dreams that have been lost under my list of to do's and provides meaningful exercises to help me work towards those dreams. I find Sunny's book to be a helping hand in guiding me towards my inner happiness.

This could have been a brilliant novel about a man's unrealistic expectations of women, about gender roles, about what (if anything) really separates humans from machines, about creators and the created... but instead, it ends up being a rather tedious and pointless story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, thin, cursory -- and lazy","review":"I borrow the words \\"disappointing,\\" \\"thin,\\" and \\"cursory\\" from other Amazon reviewers, and I agree with them fully. I would add \\"lazy.\\" I read the Artificial Woman right after Little Big Man, a novel by the same author written 40 years earlier. Little Big Man shows hard work -- lots of historical detail woven into a complex story and told with a distinctive voice. Artificial Woman has none of these virtues. It reads as though the author had a kernel of a decent idea but didn't feel like putting much energy into the project. There is some sex, but it is uninteresting. There is some science, but of the comic book variety. There is some politics, but it is inane. Skip this one unless you feel you simply must read everything by this prolific author based on the remarkable talent he has shown in other stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cable Spotty -- Bad Quality","review":"I received the cable in place of my old HDMI cable. The cable often did not work as I connected my laptop to my TV. I had to play around with it a lot to get it to work. I tried it with other devices and it still was inconsistent.

Just to make sure it wasn't something with the specific content I was selecting, I moved the Apple TV and used the old cable, and it worked fine.

It certainly supports the frequency, but about two or three times per minute I would lose signal for a second then it would come back. Secondly there was noise in the line (only while at > 24hz) causing horizontal lines to intermittently show up for a brief second.I'm now going to have to order some better cables as 24hz isn't sufficient for my home theater system, fast movement results in a blur and a frame is dropped about every two seconds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead on arrival -- Got what I paid for","review":"I guess there is something that is not a surprise when you only pay $5 for a 25 foot HDMI cable, but I expected it to work somewhat.

When I started noticing audio cutting out and little white dots appearing on the screen. I investigated to ensure it wasn't the T.V. or the XBOX. It is clearly the HDMI cable though. As when I hook up other cabled the problem goes away. The price was great and it seemed solidly built at first but considering it went out less than 6 months after I bought it I have to give it a poor rating as it really is not that great of an HDMI cable after all.

I plugged them in to my TV w/o issue, but when I removed them they bent (one bent and was unusable, one bent so severely it was torn and broken). I was shocked that the minor angle and amount of pressure I used caused this. I never even got to view an image on them b/c they were so flimsy they bent / broke in set up.

Later on, I decided to get my WDTV as close as 1 meter away from the projector and used a $1.50 HDMI cable that is 3 ft. long. It worked very well.

I'd even wonder if others lurk in the Philadelphia vaults that could be added, say 7, 9 or 11.

It will surely not hold up to customers rotating it around by the tips of the thin, brittle plastic arms and it won't be their fault. There are metal ones out there that are more attractive and cost less. Do yourself a favor and skip this overpriced piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"3-sided Black Rotating revolving earring countertop display","review":"This thing was a flimsy piece of crap that fell apart within the first 15-minutes we used it.

Some of the poems are religious; others are sexual, but almost all of them are startling in their intensity. I recommend this book with all my heart. But be aware that this book will require some work.

Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"my life with the saints","review":"a very interesting and thought-provoking book of essays ... I found the modern saints most intriguing"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Life with the Saints","review":"James Martin has a gift for making the saints come alive. His personal approach to how the saints have guided his spiritual and way of looking at life through their eyes has had me looking deeper into my own thinking. I would recommend this book to anyone who has basic knowledge of how the lives of saints can shape our lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Life With The Saints","review":"One of the most practical books about the saints that I have ever read, most of whom are modern day ordinary people. This is a terrific read and Fr. Martin's insightful reflections will enable many people to understand a little better how certain individuals can inspire us by their commitment to God by being faithful in an extraordinary wayI have told numerous people about this book and highly recommend it not only for Catholics, but to all who wish to know what it means to be a saint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"I picked this book up at my local library several days ago. It's wonderful. So wonderful, I am going to purchase my own copy. I felt like Father Martin was sitting next to me; talking about his faith journey. With his telling, I feel more equipped to discern my own journey. Now, if he just had not listed books to read in the back of the book. Stacks of books I want to read are conquering my household."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting and accessible","review":"I'm a Protestant with little knowledge or connection to any Catholic saints, yet I picked up this book because I find the subject interesting, the way I enjoy touring churches and cathedrals when on holiday in Europe. James Martin writes in a way that makes you feel you are sitting with him having a chat and his biographies and explanations of the lives of many saints with whom he has felt a personal connection are very easily read and bring to light the reason these individuals are held in such esteem. I found each chapter fascinating and though I am not Catholic and would be uncomfortable praying to a saint, I have a deeper understanding of the lives of these particular saints and the attraction many people have to them. Highly recommended to anyone with an interest in saints, faith or just looking for an enjoyable, inspirational read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was expecting better than this","review":"My Life With the Saints is Fr. Martin's memoir of his relationship with some of his favorite saints. In each chapter he tells about an event in his life and gives a short biography on the saint whom connected with him at the time.About half of the people mentioned such as Thomas Merton, whom the author seems to most admire, Fr. Arupe, Dorothy Day and Mother Theresa have not been cannonized and except for Mother Theresa it's not likely that they will be.The book pretty much falls down when the author talks about the cannonized saints. He completely fails to capture St. Therese but does better with the Jesuit saints. The chapters on St. Bernadette and the Ugandan martyrs were very good but two chapters don't justify buying the whole book.I was actually surprised with how theologically slight this book is. Coming from a Jesuit I was expecting something with more depth and it really feels like it was written for kids or older teens. I was not satisfied at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Saint book","review":"This book is not a good source on Saints. There are so many other beautiful Saint books out there to read.

SJ Martin was a excellent reader of biography of saints as well as of his own life. He introduced several of his favorite saints with the real life impact on his experience. I recommend this book to every one who is not so familiar with Catholic saints' story but very keen on learning and understanding their virtues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book - Excellent Service","review":"Fresh new look on the lives of the saints and how we can follow this same path."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Life With the Saints","review":"I especially recommend this book as one way to come to know about the saints of history.

Mrs. Baker goes beyond and above to provide examples on the techniques used by professional translators to solve issues they encounter in the real world.

Plenty of room for planner stuff, credit cards, and the pen/stylus I bought.Only 3 negatives:1. With the PDA and all the planner stuff, it ends up very thick and barely zips shut (good thing it has a heavy-duty zipper).2. The PDA is secured behind a leather protector and held in place by elastic bands. On the bottom, in order to leave room for the USB connector slot, one of the elastic bands covers up the AC adapter port. You can get it in there, but it takes some effort.3. The planner is \\"pocket\\" sized. Franklin-Covey (the manufacturer) makes very few accessories, and it seems everyone else (DayTimer, etc.) make none. One thing I liked about my old planner was the checkbook insert.So, if those things won't bother you, I highly recommend this product to carry your Cassiopedia in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old same old","review":"This book is no more than a rehash of what has already been written about in countless other books on JKD.

My order arrived and the battery kit (battery, replacement tool & cover with \\"O\\" ring) had been relabeled. The \\"new\\" part number was correct but this was NOT the battery kit for the t6. This kit had no tool, a different cover (lacking the short straight edge) and a battery that was 3 mm too large for the watch.I placed a subsequent order on Suunto's web site and everything was good.

AND THERE WAS A RODENT SIZED HOLE ON THE SIDE OF THE BOX!!!!!!!! So, needless to say I will not NOT be reordering these again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspired","review":"Wow, what a great experience this live performance is! Instead of a slick, impersonal production, I was treated to something very organic and engaging. How the producers controlled the sound so expertly in that stone environment is beyond my knowledge, but it is wonderful. The 5.1 surround sound really filled my room. That combined with the video angles and close-ups really showed the inner workings of a major concert. I felt as though I was there. This is an amazing piece with a Jewish orchestra and choir singing a Christian Masterpiece in a Catholic church run by German Benedictine priests. Think about it. There's alot to consider here. Truly inspired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"It was clear from the start that this was going to be an amature performance when the 'Father' of the church instructed the audience to turn off their cell phones - why in the world would you record this in 5.1 for all to see over and over again! The musicians are of average quality and the performance seems to be home-grown. The emotional appeal (in Israel where Jesus walked) is not enough to make this DVD anything but interesting. Get the Handel Messiah w/Cleobury, Dawson, Summers, & Brandenburg Consort - they get an A+ in my book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Metal at its best!","review":"This is a really wonderful addition to anyone's Guitar Tab collection. A collection of BOC's best songs are placed in an easy to read format for all guitarists. Fans and non-fans alike will enjoy this book which is tabbed out surprisingly well in comparison to some of the other BOC books I've seen. Highly recommended, although I caution some of the guitar work is quite complex. May not be suitable for the beginner."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"Some of the tab positioning seems off to me but very good. Some things played on B and G strings seem more likely played down in a lower position on the E and B string. Then again might just be me learning it that way and it's hard to break old habits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong characters make make a great story.","review":"If this is an example (a weak example if old reviews are to be believed) of Wiggs' writing, I'm buying everything she ever wrote. Jackson and Leah are complicated, interesting, appealing people, and the character of Caroline is finely drawn. Great story, realistic portrayal of morphine addiction, accurate depiction of education and life of a woman doctor in the late 19th century. Picked it up on a whim, but it's a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good book","review":"Having never read anything by Wiggs before, I took a chance and ordered this one, expecting a run-of- the-mill story. I WAS WRONG! Thoroughly enjoyed the story, characterizations, and writing style of the author.Was it the best book i've ever read? No. There were a couple of parts i ended up skimming, but it was definitely worth reading. I also look forward to reading other books by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"A romance to sweep you away to another place and time!","review":"A perfect 10 for this heartwarmer of a book.

My reading group decided to pick this as the book for June and we were all sorely unimpressed. Not only is her research on the local area almost nonexistent but the literary style rates a low mark for lack of description, lack of an inner voice to propel the story, but is too trite and formulamatic to be at all interesting. Would never read another of this kind again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some Good Authors Write Bad Books","review":"This is the first book of Susan Wiggs' that I've read that did not meet her usual standard of excellence. The story and characters were lethargic and undeveloped. I read half of the book and didn't bother to finish it. If you're contemplating reading this one, skip it and move on to one of her five-star rated books. Wiggs is a worthy author, she just missed the boat on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The drifter","review":"Again another excellent book by susan wiggs.

It gave a realistic look of addiction and how people become so manipulative and calculating to \\"feed\\" their addiction.. The reader finds themselves caught up in this drama involving the main characters of Leah, Jackson, and the self-destructive, Caroline. The dedication that Jackson had to help Caroline was admirable....but Caroline's behavior towards both Jackson and Leah was appaling. Jackson was so devoted to \\"saving\\" Caroline and was willing to risk everything for her. It was a sad look at what many families are facing in modern society today.This romance had extra elements in it that kept the plot strong and the reader's interest level high. I know others will love this book as well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The description for this item is extremely misleading!","review":"This is for the study guide edition of the book!

Oh, and I do happen to like cats, by the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable as always","review":"This book was enjoyable as books in this series always are. This one was another where Qwill leaves behind Pickax and his usual cast of supporting characters. On this occasion he wants to avoid another freezing Pickax winter. This gives the author the opportunity to show how unhappy Qwill now becomes outside his Moose County environment and away from Polly Duncan.The most interesting books of this series are the ones set outside Pickax as this gives Qwill and the cats the chance to relate to new characters and situations.This is a book in the cosy genre; the plotting is not its strength and I don't think ever was meant to be. Like other books in this series, it was a wonderfully warm and engaging read."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a natural High!","review":"Not only is this the best addition to the Cat Who series, it reminds me so much of my own treasured one, Mr. Cheddar.

It's a world of stark realities and human failings, where our tenuous grip on what is and what is not blurs until indistinctness.

So for everyday use my wife and I have been purchasing Timex watches for many years. We have been going through 3 or 4 of these watches every year at the 30 to 45 dollar price range. We saw a friend wearing a easy large face Wenger model with easy to read numbers. He had owned it for quite some time with no problems. So for the price of two timex watches, I got a basic Wenger model with a good warrantee (3years). It's smart looking works great, won't break my bank account if it gets lost and is nice enough to wear as a dress watch for posh evening adventures where Rolex and Omega timepieces rule."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its very pretty... but","review":"I received this bracelet for Christmas and really love it.

After only 2 weeks of wearing this bracelet The pretty mettle pieces that connect the larger round circles started stretching out and are at risk of falling off (and poke me in the wrist and have gotten caught on shirts). I find it weird that those pieces are not fixed in a way that they are a solid piece of metal.I have not contacted anyone about this issue and so I don't know how they would have resolved it.The bracelet is beautiful but is not for everyday wear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tomita - Electronic Pioneer","review":"Isao Tomita's use of electronic synthesisers in the early to mid 1970s was truly inspirational.

The remix is clean. However, the sound levels are too high or too low in many places. So, the volume will be so soft sometimes that you can't hear it. But, if you turn it up to a normal volume, then a few minutes later it will suddenly become so loud it will shake the rafters in your house, and very possibly, blow out your speakers! There's a warning in the liner notes that says \\"due to the nature of 24/96 technology,...you may be startled by the powerful dynamics of the music.\\" I was startled, to say the least.

It's a great song with an awesome intro. There is nothing bad I can say about this CD. I would have given it five stars, but the vocalist on the album sounds a bit amateur.

Its worth $5 for the laugh, but skip the CD version, unless you enjoy hair so teased its transparent. Vinnie spends the whole album double tapping away, not really achieving anything. The rest of the band doesn't really do anything either. Its basically just a look at what I can do record, with plenty of taps, dive bombs, and tremlo. Alot of guys at that point were trying to outdo each other and the basis for the shredding was technique. That is majorly lacking here, as is taste. He plays as if he justs wants to prove he can do more than Eddie Van Halen. Vinnie can play, all of the tricks do take a degree of talent, but nothing makes him or this record special except for utter cheesiness.

The book is bland, relatively uninformative, and shallow. While the book's superficiliaty makes it more accessible to non-mathetical readers, the final product is less palatable to all readers. It is impossible to introduce and explain the occurrence of numbers and patterns in the universe without using at least simple arithmetic. In striving to reach readers of all abilities, Mr Stewart has alienated the entire audience.Mr Stewart's writing style, however, is admirable: clear, concise and precise. The reader is left with the impression that he would be an excellent teacher, and could adequately handle the topic. (Excluding his curious, defensive, intermittent apology for 'pure' (vs. applied) mathematical reserach.)Ill-researched and ill-presented, 'Nature's Numbers' is a cursory review that is not worth the time it takes to read it. Readers are strongly advised to avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"fascinating look at the relationship of math to our world","review":"Mr. Stewart delivers an excellent insight into the role mathematics plays in the everyday world. Ever easy to understand, the author takes us on an exciting journey into the role math takes on in the places we may least expect. A truly enjoyable read for the non-mathematical and a must for the serious or amateur mathematician. Riveting from the onset, this book keeps your attention and wraps up in a climatic section on chaos theory with some remarkable insights in the epilogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the pictures?","review":"This book promises to introduce the world of mathematics to the layman but doesn't quite deliver.

A great bibliography leads readers to better work."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Real\\" Baroque, in this case, is \\"Real Boring\\" Continuo","review":"I'm not quite sure why these performers would qualify as \\"real\\" baroque players (it seems anybody making that distinction would like to revoke the membership cards of performers they might consider too \\"romantic\\"), but I would characterize Moroney as \\"real boring.\\" He has nothing of the color and variety of Koopman's continuo, certainly nothing of the contrapuntal ingenuity of Hill's, and none of the fire of the youngest generation of continuo players trained on the Continent. In fact, his tepid chord-chord continuo playing lacks much melodic finesse and seems to this listener simply like a much watered-down version of Leonhardt's style. Not much variety of arpeggiation, no interesting passing-tone or other colorful dissonances to spice things up.

And anyone wanting to know the inside story of how it really felt to be part of the most dangerous times in the history of mankind should pick this up. You would expect a book about atomic bomb testing and military life on a dull island to be dour, but it is anything but. With strange characters that surrounded Harris and side-splitting exchanges between them, and a Col. Klink-type character in the clueless Major, it is every bit as humorous as Catch-22. The absurdity of war is replaced by the absurdity of isolation and atomic bomb radiation deemed as harmless. It is a shame that people aren't exposed to this (no pun intended) book more, because everyone I've recommended it to has loved it.

This author elected to go down the predictable Liberal path of overdramatizing what took place,and being overly moralizing and sanctimonious In the reviewers section at the beginning of the book is a review by Christie brinkley, This should be enough warning about how bad this book will be, when a brain dead Celebrity like Christie Brinkley reviews something.Skip this book and instead read IVY-Mike by W.G.

I even like it's first sentence: \\"To anyone who has ever been owned by a cat, it will come as no surprise that there are all sorts of things about your cat you will never, as long as you live, forget.\\"Sadly, further down the reading, it got tired. Too much historical details and whatever else. I had to force myself to continue reading and there came a point I just can't do it anymore. I waved the white flag.

The main narrative about the rescue of a stray cat, who the author adopts and eventually calls Polar Bear is entertaining, but too much has been done to make it \\"cute\\", like pages of imagined conversation between the author and the cat. There are also tons of digressions, about animal cruelty, historic views of cats and so on. It is also very dated in its discussion of the animal rights movement.

I think one's feelings about it will be pretty well predicted by one's feelings about self-described \\"curmudgeons\\" such as the author. Personally, I am very tired of people who take pride in their own intractable nature and think it is some sort of blessing on the world for teaching others to be patient. Additionally, the author appears to be someone who loves to hear himself talk/write, which can also be a bit tiresome.On the plus side, his descriptions of life with a cat are apt and adorable, and I picked up a few new vocabulary words, and a little bit of history of the animal rights movement.So it wasn't a waste of time to read it, but I wouldn't do it again, or recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Cat's World","review":"\\"The Cat Who Came for Christmas\\" is an utter joy to read. If one obtains pleasure from cats as I do, Amory's memoir will allow them to purr and feel the feline's silky fur against their skin.As an animal activist, Amory did not own his own cat, but suddenly, out of nowhere; he is (owned) by a stray that he calls Polar Bear. If anybody has ever had a cat, they know that she will take over the entire house as Amory's cat does. Didn't you know that cats are the center of the universe?Amory talks to Polar Bear as if he's his best friend, and the reader enters into a dialogue of sweet ecstasy. Amory takes the cat's personality and characteristics and makes him human. It's almost as if Polar Bear should be sitting at the kitchen table with a knife and fork eating his Fancy Feast!The writing is beautiful.... long flowing sentences.... charming insight about the cat's world, life, beauty, grace, and breathtaking nine lives.

For example, it mentions \\"rack and pinion\\" but doesn't show an example. On the other hand it shows a lock-needle automatic unit but without labels to point out what I should be seeing. It should at least show specific steps for a generic SLR and a Range Finder. Then it could continue the way it does. It should show one how to use the tools -- at least one picture.

Also only 4 stars since there are a lot of really long, overly artistic, yet ultimately staged shots of him getting ready and hanging out in his apartment which is a little awkward.Overall, the movie strikes a great balance between a good amount of amazing concert footage and a number of interesting interview segments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't use this outdated book.

I bought a much better cover at Costco for $32 vs over $150 for the Cover Craft.

Director Benjamin Morgan and Brant Smith's efforts to get their baby into film festivals and then expect to be suddenly surrounded by distributors wanting to get their hands on the film were touching. No go with Sundance but Berlin accepted, where it joined the dozens of other (better?) films on show. It turns out that word of mouth marketing worked best to pull in the punters.

Some of the facts of Steve Martin's early days are interesting, but the thread gets lost once Martin becomes famous. You can sense his (Martin's) moving beyond Walker's circle (probably for good reason), and a suggestion of Walker's need to hang on. There is a very interesting book waiting to be written about this gifted and brilliant comedian/actor/writer, but this is definitely not that book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"After 50 pages is was apparent that this one trick pony should not have been allowed in the show. I know that's harsh, but fans will want more substance from a so-called insider who builds his effort around childhood pranks and high school clowning. His perceived present impressions of Martin are derived from 'dozens of letters' that are rarely if ever cited. Also difficult to read are the author's implied contributions to the development of Steve's talent with mock protestations of his own implication.A more focused approach would have presented the material only in the context of that time period instead the author writes with broad strokes and thus sacrifices credibility by claiming to have insight on the present Mr. Martin.There is a story here; it's just not presented well. No doubt, the author and Martin have a definite bond--one that would have made a nice photo essay for Vanity Fair.(Take away half a star for amateur publishing.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"More about Morris Walker than Steve Martin","review":"I'm a big fan of Steve Martin but I can't believe he allowed his childhood friend to publish this book! My best guess is Martin felt sorry for Walker and he thought Walker could use the money. This book details several unamusing incidents (and a couple of truly funny ones) in laborious detail in young Steve's and Morris' life. It is certainly not a biography of Martin but more a very detailed but poorly written account of Walker and Martin's pre-adolescent friendship. I feel bad writing this because Walker is probably a very nice fellow but he comes off in his writing as a person with a lot of issues with the fact that his childhood friend got famous and wealthy and Walker didn't. I was amazed to see that the average review here was 4 stars but I noticed most of them were about the audio tape. Maybe the tape is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for everyone","review":"You will believe that Morris Walker was best buddies with Steve Martin for six years in school a long time ago. You will also agree that while Mr. Martin has made some very smart career decisions and been quite lucky, Mr. Walker has had the opposite experience. This is, at essence, an extremely honest and open book about two show business careers with wildly differing trajectories.The world is better that this book was written. The author is a gifted storyteller with a couple of dozen good tales to tell. His loving outlook on life will charm many people. It made me nostalgic for my own high school days, about 12 years after these two.Ultimately, however, I felt more uncomfortable than charmed, because Steve Martin has so clearly moved on from his high school days and comes across as patient and tolerant of his old friend's two-decade obsession with writing this book. I don't need to know about the author's sister's hookup with Steve. Too much sharing for my taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Want to read a book about Morris Walker?","review":"Being a long time fan of Steve Martin's, I snapped up this book when I saw it.

This book is not very explanitive even on the simple things. Example, I want to mount a cdrom and look for the way to do it. The book says to look at the enclosed How to on the cd-rom for information on the mounting cdroms.The book has several sections. The HOWTO basically gives an outline of the actual HOWTO.

Plot twists keep you guessing, and the POV transitions make for one of the most intresting and page-turning novels I have ever read. Keeping Billy in the first person POV forces the reader to focus on the novel's title character, while the backstory unfolds...introducing many mysterious and unforgettable characters. Kellerman brings some past characters in for cameo appearances. This is a must read for those who don't like predictable stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made a fan out of me!","review":"My first Jonathon Kellerman book but will not be my last.

Mr. Adams has a very distinctive voice. When he first began reading I groaned aloud because it sounded very different from most of the male reader's voices I have heard before. But then he just amazed me by bringing each successive character to life. His rendition of the story was outstanding.Mr. Kellerman's characters have depth and were very believable-especially Billy! The resourceful little tyke and the tenacious Petra made me want to clap my hands and cheer out loud. Recommended !"},{"rating":"2","title":"A new direction","review":"This is not an Alex Delaware novel,though he does have a cameo appearance. It is a novel of suspense involving one of Kellermans' most appealing protaganists ever, Billy Straight. If you liked his Delaware series [which I feel has absolutely run its course] you will be charmed by some of the characters in this book, and amazed by the quality of the writing here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dinwiddie's Opinion","review":"Although the subject matter was depressing Billy Straight was a very good mystery - right up to the very end!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mom loved it!","review":"I bought this book for my mom.

Even though you had an idea who the bad guy was (but did you?) I was fascinated with the back and forth between characters. My only disappointment was the last page - I felt let down - I wanted to know what happens with Billy, Petra and the rest of the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kellerman is better than this!","review":"I must confess I love Jonathon Kellerman's writing and I love his previous books. Alex Delaware, Milo Sturgis and Daniel Sharavi are such compelling charactors and the books (not including the last few) have always been top notch. But now it almost seems that Kellerman is sacrificing quality for quantity. Too many books in the past two years and none of them have been as good as his previous work. Kellerman is too good for that! If he takes two years to write this next one instead of dashing it off in a couple of months it would be so good! But \\"Billy Straight,\\" unfortunately, is not a very good read. It's too predictable, boring and the plot is so busy and full of uneccesary charactors and subplots that are never really resolved that we don't even care that they are left hanging. Jonathon Kellerman, I am your biggest fan! I know you can do better! I eagerly await your next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally disappointed","review":"I love Kellerman. I have read all of his books - but this is pretty lame. Too much time spent trying to write like a tough cop, and the pitiful 'cameo' of Alex Delaware at the end seems like a ploy to suck in the loyal following to read this thing. I usually finish a Kellerman novel in under 24 hours. This took weeks, because I just couldn't find enough interest to keep picking it up. I had to re-read \\"Over The Edge\\" (my favorite Delaware novel) just to keep up my faith in the author. Better luck next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kellerman's first disappointing book","review":"I love Kellerman and have read all his books but this is the first one that I have not enjoyed. I did not like the writing style and found the characters' thoughts to be very dull and simple-minded.

Late one night he watches from his hiding place as a man viciously butchers a woman. The victim turns out to be the ex-wife of a television celebrity with a history of domestic violence. Billy becomes the center of terrifying attention--from the media, from violent bounty hunters, and from the murderer himself. As he runs for his life, relying on his native wit and instincts for survival, Billy is also tracked by a potential savior: Petra Connor, a tough, gifted, beautiful LAPD detective.Well, of course she's gifted and beautiful. Of course the murderer is cunning and manipulative, trying to implicate his best friend, his faithful protector as the true felon. Of course Billy is the long-lost grandson of a Hollywood matron. The story is predictable--and disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jonathan Kellerman does it again","review":"If you like Jonathan Kellerman, you will again be pleased by Billy Straight."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very subtle mystery!","review":"This has been my first J. Kellerman novel. And I liked it very much. You notice right away that he is a professional child psychologist. The way he describes Billy shows a subtle understanding of troubled children. But the author is also a pro novelist with a highly developed sense of plot and suspense. I read this novel not like other mysteries, I forced myself to read it slowly to enjoy all the characters with their daily and unusual troubles and their psychologically solid presentation. This has not been my last Joe Kellerman. I thank amazon.de for the recommendation!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing peice of work","review":"This is the first book that I've read by Kellerman and after reading it I want to read more! Each new chapter had me guesing on who the killer was and my first guess turned to be the right one. I loved it when he'd{Kellerman} skip to a new character, making you think that that new person had a part in Lisa's murder. Although the ending kind of dissapointed me by what happenes to Billy, but all in all...Excellent!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A new detective with a fresh approach.","review":"I enjoyed this novel a great deal more than the last two I read:- The Web and The Clinic. I think perhaps Kellerman is getting a bit jaded with Alex Dellaware and needs to write about someone new. He has stayed with the child psychology angle, but treated it in a different way. His new detective is interesting, and I look forward to more Patra in the future.I also enjoyed The Butchers Theatre. Maybe a rest from Dellaware, and a return in a couple of years would be a good thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"quite entertaing and moving novel.","review":"The main character detective Patra was a strong person who gave it her all.

Then I saw that it was introducing new characters. I remembered reading \\"The Butcher's Theatre\\" and I really liked the diversion from the Alex Delaware novels so I bought \\"Bill Straight\\" and from page one I was glad I did! It was well put together and I couldn't get enough of Petra, she was wonderful. I hope to hear more from her in novels to come, and her wonderful partner, I got kinda caught up in his wife's illness, in the next book I hope she's alright."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who wrote this book?","review":"I have read all of Kellerman's adult fiction novels and absolutely loved them. This book was boring compared to the others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has potential but falls flat","review":"Fine writing style, quite creative really, with good character development. But the story was a bit weak. The situations and resolutions were a bit too convenient. Flipping back and forth between the sub plots was ok, but they didn't cohere very well. Billy Staight's situation had little contribution in the end. The Ramsey investigation was small. What did Stu's character have to do with anything other than an attempt to show a considerate, domestic side of Petra. I really expected Stu to play a major role but he became unnecessary to the story. So some of the sub plots went nowhere. The Grandmother?Overall there was some real potential with this book but too many loose ends and lack of build up. However, I am really looking forward to starting on the Alex Delaware series. Looking forward to finding a character as strong as Sanford's Lucas Davenport."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your time and money on this one !","review":"Sorry to have to disagree, once again, with the majority of my fellow amateur reviewers, but I feel that not only was this book boring, but the author himself seemed bored and distracted. Plot hackneyed. Characters cardboard. Take the O.J. trial, add a bit of American Psycho, The Collector, The Client, and Nancy Drew and what you wind up with, stinks ! What a mish mosh. Stereotypes all over the place. Reading something like this reminds me why I generally prefer non-fiction and true crime. (And yes, I'm ashamed to admit that I read the whole thing. Hope springs eternal.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best thriller I've read this year","review":"A friend put me on to Jonathan Kellerman a few months back after they visited here. This is my fourth of J. Kellerman so far and the best yet. The best of a dozen thrillers I've consumed this year. It has everything: narratives from a number of characters, the very believable investigation and dynamics of the LAPD, characters with depth, lots of loose ends that all come together etc. Very current, i.e. \\"references to not screwing this up like the O.J. case\\", etc. But most of all it has quality, style and authenticity that are fairly rare these days. Could make a great movie, if they didn't stray from the plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best effort by far","review":"I have read other Kellerman books and this one was not like the others. The writing seemed forced (meeting a deadline, perhaps?) and the sentences read like haiku rather than prose. Example: \\"Firm and loud. No one to hear her. The missus was upstairs. So many other rooms between them, all empty and closed off.\\" The shifting point of views were distracting. It would have been an excellent book if he had chosen Billy's voice as the main one. Petra was a whiny character for such a \\"strong\\" woman. Skip this one, read the Delaware novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Billy Straight","review":"I have read every book Jonathan Kellerman ever wrote. This was the most boring book of his I have ever read. He seems to ramble on and on. I did not like the way he wrote from both angles. His characters had no personalities, except for Billy and he wasn't written about enough. Sorry Jonathan...."},{"rating":"1","title":"What an awful book","review":"If I could give it \\"no stars\\", I would. I skipped page after page after page when it came to the street boy's chapters. The horrible stuff that happened to him was just too awful to read. One thing more horrible than the next kept happening to him and it was all too unnecessary and graphically disgusting. I didn't start reading his narratives until halfway through the book when it was relevant to the story. What a disgusting book this was. I love all of the Jonathan Kellerman books I've read up until now and so I didn't pay attention to the negative reviews on it. Some of his really fabulous books go some \\"one star\\" reviews, so I chose to ignore these and go with the 4 and 5 star reviews. Man, was I ever wrong. He told this story via 5 different people and it was just ridiculous. I found the book to be appallingly awful. I'm just glad it wasn't my first Kellerman novel, or else it would have been my last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jonathan Kellerman outdoes himself once again!","review":"I always enjoy his style of writing.Though very detailed, it captures the heart of the person he is describing. Case in point: Billy Straight. An abused boy from a disfunctional home, it zooms in on his moment to moment feelings as he struggles through the labryrinth of Los Angeles, trying to make all the right decisions to stay alive.Also, the Los Feliz area is one I am familiar with, so it it fun to read the details of libraries and schools that I see. I look forward to his next book. I always do!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Jonathan Kellerman is one of my favorite authors but this book didn't measure up. There are three parallel stories going at once which breaks up the narrative flow. The characters are not well-developed. What happened to the great psychological insights I've come to expect? Worst of all, there is not much suspense, no amazing twist where some minor character reveals the key needed to unravel the mystery. There was potential here -- a good idea for a plot and potentially interesting characters. It's as if this were the rough draft and not the polished version. I recommend all his other novels except The Web; my favorite is Silent Partner."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was he thinking?","review":"I expect more of Mr. Kellerman, the plot was thin, I know \\"who done it\\", there was no mystery, just some plodding, predictable detective work, characters seemed prediictable as well, hard working woman \\"D\\" , idiot boss, . . . I'm a fan, but this one left me cold, wanted to just get it done, and move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jonathan Kellerman wrote this one? Read like a Faye K. book","review":"Started off creating some new and intriguing characters with the detectives. Could have developed them a whole lot more. Why call this an Alex Delaware book when he is casually mentioned and hardly given a part? And Milo is briefly mentioned 2 times? The ending is rushed--did Jonathan really write this book? I expect a lot more from him--how about a re-write?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughable","review":"Don't bother reading this book. It was my first and last book by Kellerman. The characterisation was laughable. I don't think the street kid would have survived for more than a couple of days on the streets, if such a character as Billy could ever come to exist in the real world, that is. Billys character is a joke, at least to me. The book might provide you with a few hours of distraction from the real world, but don't expect anything deeper than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I have read all of Kellerman's books. This by far is one of the worst books I have ever read. Could not even finish the book. Please bring back Dr. D."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"A real no-brainer from Jonathan Kellerman. The plot was weak, and just barely enough to hold my attention. Oh, Jonathan tries to throw you off as to \\"who dunnit\\" but it becomes painfully obvious long before the end. Poor character development and a few chapters that made no sense until the end are interspersed here and there. And those chapters could have been left out completely. If you are looking for something interesting to read, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Kellerman Novel Yet","review":"This book was terrible, though some of Kellermans early Alex Delaware novels were actually quite good (When the Bough Breaks). Billy Straight is flawed almost from the beginning, the plot or mystery is a no brainer, the culprit is obviously one of two characters, and since you know that there is going to be a \\"twist\\" at the end, it is of course not the person that Kellerman tries to lead you to believe it is. In his more recent books Kellerman seems to have become some kind of an avenging angel, all of the \\"bad guys\\" in his books come to terrible ends, this time again, that are all too convenient. Plot aside, Kellerman indulges in every stereotype available, from the racist Russian to the kindly jewish grandfather. Petra, the central character is completely one dimensional. I wish Kellerman would not have tried to put himself in the place of a woman. Almost always when male writers try to do this the result is what you get here, completely unnatural."},{"rating":"1","title":"Packaged very poorly...","review":"Unfortunately, when I received this ring in the mail, not only was the silver bent (so the ring was at a weird angle), but the lapis stone had fallen out.
