The build quality is very poor. You have to attach a platform to the top and bottom of each stand. 3 of the 4 were ok, the 4th one didn't \\"take\\" and I had to drill a new, deeper hole and use a much longer screw.

They were very easy to assemble. Well worth the price! I would have liked them better if the plastic feet on them were rubber. This would have made for a better non-skid grip for my hardwood floors. But it's nothing major. I wouldn't let that keep you from purchasing these. The floor base is heavy and this allows for a good anti-tilt for your speakers. There are little spikes for the top base and my Onkyos fit perfectly between them. The black finish is a perfect match for any HDTV. Seems to be kind of like a thick laquer finish. Awesome stuff!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"assembley","review":"the assembly was quick and easy. the only problem i had was when i tried sliding on the back panel used to hide the speaker wires, it chipped the wood in various areas. also to ensure my speakers where secure i had to use two sided tape on the based. overall i love it, it looks good. pretty decent for the cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a Remastered cd!

I bought three other \\"enhanced\\" Iron Maiden cd's and I got scammed on those as well. The packaging on the 1998 and 2002 are identical. Make sure you buy the 2002. Maiden pisses me off for putting out way too many repeat cd's of the same material. They use distorted lawyer words like \\"enhanced\\" and make different song compilation cd's.

For those used to heavier stuff, it may seem kind childish but it Maiden's truly is the cream of Heavy Metal and \\"Somewhere in time\\" is the cream os Iron's work. Listen to \\"Somewhere in time\\", \\"Sea of Madness\\" and \\"Alexander the great\\" and you'll soon see what I mean. \\"Wasted years\\" was a bit too much played but is still a good track anyway.

I'm getting old!","review":"I worked as a temporary roadie for this show in Munich, Germany in 1986. The show will stay in my memory forever as the best concert I have ever seen. Bruce Dickinson was in rare form that night, never missing a beat when Eddie (In this incarnation a huge robot with his own separate generator to keep him going) \\"attacked\\" him on stage. Theatrics notwithstanding, the quality of the performance was up to the usually high Maiden standard, the pyrotechnics near perfect. I have always considered them Metal's ambassadors of intelligent yet fun hard rock. This album is proof that they are. I own most of their work, and still consider \\"Alexander the Great\\" their masterpiece...Simply brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different from all other Maiden albums","review":"Definitely different from all other Maiden albums, but you gotta love some of these tracks. Sure, Deja Vu and Long distance runner are kind of stinkers, but the rest are good, and I have to give it 5 stars just for Alexander the Great - yes, the lyrics are basically a history narrative, but this song to me is one of their best of all their catalog."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite After Powerslave.","review":"They changed direction a lot from Powerslave which was a very fast paced and energetic album. They slow down a bit and get more progressive. They incorporated synthesizer into their music which gives it a more atmospheric sound throughout. The band evolved and start to show a lot of maturity in their music. It may not be as heavy as their early stuff but it's original and they put a lot of effort into it. Rather than the ancient Egyptian theme on Powerslave, Somewhere In Time takes a completely different theme. More of a futuristic, sci-fi theme like \\"Caught Somewhere In Time\\". The whole album's solid throughout but my absolute favorite tracks is \\"The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner\\". The songs are all unique and I've never heard an album that sounded like it before."},{"rating":"2","title":"maiden at their best.","review":"this is the first maiden album i heard. caught somewhere in time is a great fast moving opener w one of my fav solos. wasted years is a little more melodic, classic maiden sound. sea of madness and heaven can wait are good but not great. not a bad song on the album. stranger in a strange land starts off w a nice rumbling bass line by harris, one of the best bass players in the world. then goes into a nice little riff. great song. the band uses guitar synth on this album for the first time. it worked well. buy this album, it's worth all 60 however minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Justified!","review":"Maiden had evolved into a new metal standard in 1986. Not only did they lead the metal world with the greatest artwork on covers, but their music took a new form and justifed everything they had done in the past. Iron Maiden to Powerslave were just the stepping stones to this standard classic.The CD Starts out with CAUGHT SOMEWHERE IN TIME, a galloping bassline, and parallel guitar make it, not only a classic, but ahead of its time. The rest of the CD id in pure form. My favorite track, however, is ALEXANDER THE GREAT. The intro starts out with a whisper of that era, and slowly builds to the howl of, I feel, the battle cry of the great warrior of History.Iron Maiden did not dissapoint with this CD. It is very well mixed and produced, and remains a standard in my collection of CD's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, Someone Agrees With Me","review":"Since this album came out many years ago when I was a wee youngster, I've argued, sometimes violently ;-), with numerous Iron Maiden fans that this is their best album. It's their best technical album by far, but the spirit of it is also fantastic. I'm female so no one takes me seriously, I guess, but I'm still convinced this is one their best and I'll continue to argue it. This album isn't as dark as the others, which may be why I like it so much, but if you can't love Wasted Years and Sea of Madness, then there is something wrong with you. I truly love every song on this album and Bruce Dickinson's vocals are _absolutely_beautiful_. If you can only buy one Iron Maiden album ever in your life, buy this one. I'll be buried with this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah, It's a Classic","review":"It's hard to believe that for a few years, there were many people who thought that Maiden had sold out and would never release another good album again, but today pretty much everyone agrees that this is as much of a classic as some of their earlier stuff. The use of synthesizers broadens the bands sound, but they are not overused. \\"Caught Somewhere in Time\\" is probably my favorite Maiden song of all time along with my favorite Maiden guitar soloing of all time. \\"Wasted Years,\\" \\"Stranger in a Strange Land,\\" and \\"Heaven Can Wait\\" are essential Maiden as well as great live songs. \\"Alexander the Great\\" is an 8 minute history lesson, but is actually one of Maiden's better 80's epics, with a great instrumental section in the middle. The enhanced edition includes lyrics, videos for \\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\" and \\"Wasted Years\\" and phtots of the band on tour. Anyone looking into getting into Iron Maiden is encouraged not to pass this up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of Maiden","review":"My first and favourite Maiden album. Fantastic production, inspiring and emotional Adrian Smith's guitar playing and some progressive elements. No weak songs on this one. Somewhere in Time was ahead of it's time and is actually still ahead of our time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thinking man's metal rocks again","review":"I was 14 or so when I first bought this album, now at 33 I still love this album. One of the things I have always liked the best about Iron Maiden is the historical content of their lyrics. With Alexander the Great, Powerslave etc the tradition continued. Of course the music itself rocks, and Bruce Dickinson gives a stellar performance. All in all this is one of the best albums this group ever released."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent album.","review":"One of Maiden's best. Re-mastered with a lot of skill. Nice thick booklet of lyrics and photos and of course the best cover art of the lot. Best track, Stranger In A Strange Land but there's not really a weak track on the album and Bruce's delivery is simply outstanding. This and Seventh Son have to be their finest hour. The enhanced features are good too and even if you have the old edition this is well worth getting for the truly great digital remastering. Go, on! Stop reading this and buy it now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, but not too good either","review":"I'm a Maiden fan, but frankly, was a little disappointed with this one. Wasted Years is a good song, but other than that, I don't see anything special here. I recommend earlier albums like Killers, Number of the Beast, and Powerslave. I enjoyed Fear of the Dark as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Iron Maiden and Synthesizers don't mix","review":"This was the first Iron Maiden album which was not great. This album marked a very big change in the band's music. On Somewhere in Time, keyboards were very evident on the album. There are some good songs on this album like Deja Vu, Sea of Madness and Stranger in a Strange Land, but there are also some awful songs like Heaven Can Wait and The Loneliness of a Long Distance Runner. If you are want to get into Iron Maiden, don't buy this one first I would reccomend KILLERS of PIECE OF MIND to start off with. If you already enjoy the early Iron Maiden albums, give this one a shot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from the remaster","review":"If I wanted to hear a loud mass of indiscriminate white noise I'd listen to a Nine Inch Nails album. When I listen to an Iron Maiden album I'd actually like to hear the singer and the individual instruments layered on one another. This 2002 remaster is overly loud, compressed, and digitized. Stick with the original CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Iron Maiden Album","review":"I still remember the first time I heard this album almost 18 years ago. It blew my mind, at the time I didn't pay too much attention to the lyrics but as time went by and my english got better, i started paying attention. My personal favorites Wasted Years, The loneliness of the long distance runner, Deja Vu, Alexander the Great. Up to this day, anytime I feel down and life seems to get hard, I listen to the loneliness of the long distance runner....I've got to keep running the courseI've got to keep running and win atAll costsI've got to keep going be strongMust be so determined and push myself onNever fails to give me a lift. Too bad I never saw them perform this live. This is a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very fine piece of heavy metal art","review":"Maiden once again delivers an above average album with brilliant chords and licks. \\"Heaven Can Wait\\" and \\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\" are the highlights of the album. \\"Wasted Years\\" is another good one. On the down side, there is an unfortunately bad word to describe both \\"Deja Vu\\" and \\"Alexander the Great\\": BORING! I don't want a song that's a history lesson. I want to listen to music, not learn about ambitious Macedonians, or mental conditions. Besides those songs, it's a grand album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhere Lame","review":"The best thing about this album is the artwork on the cover. I remember way back in high school, I couldn't wait for this album to come out. I had been reared on Number of the Beast, Piece of Mind, and Powerslave, and I thought this album would have to be awesome. Instead, I got this synthesizer laden recording with only the faintest hints of the Maiden I had come to know and love.The lyrics are hackneyed at best (witness the clumsy \\"Heaven Can Wait\\" and the tortuous \\"Alexander the Great\\") All the songs here are smothered in synthesizer, which just doesn't fit Maiden's metal style. It's like they found a new toy and didn't know when to stop using it.To this day, I don't understand why there are no Dickinson songs included here. He started using his song-writing skills on Piece of Mind, but he penned nothing here. Perhaps he heard the direction the band was going and decided not to waste his talents."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor Maiden Record","review":"The best thing about this dissappointing Maiden record is the cover, which contains a complete history of the band, up to that point. The record itself seemed to me to be an excuse to go on tour. Unfortunately, not one song stands out. I would pass on this one for the new Maiden fan, but the more hardcore may enjoy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maiden Lose Me","review":"It was all downhill from here. Bruce is worn out from the Slavery tour and the songs just don't cut it. There's hardly a decent lick on the album and there no fun in it. They seem to be having so much more fun on Powerslave, particularly with: Back in the Village, Aces, 2 Minutes.Harris has run out of ideas: Alexander is just a terrible rehash of Rime of the Ancient Mariner. And what went wrong with chorus's; repeating a song's title over and over again: \\"Heaven Can Wait! Heaven Can Wait! Heaven Can Wait!\\" or \\"Caught Somewhere in Time! Caught Somewhere in Time! Caught Somewhere in Time!\\" is just lame.Me and my mates tried to like this when it came out. But in the end it was no good...the next album was just as weak. End of Maiden and Metallica just blew them away with Puppets."},{"rating":"2","title":"The beginning of a Reign of Terror.","review":"This is Maiden in Prime form. Coming off of Powerslave and the Live After Death tour, Maiden hits the studio for this Eight track Jaugernaut. With powerful tracks like Stranger in a Strange Land and Wasted Years that catch you with their melody and have you humming the tune all day long, this album marked the beginning of the worldwide domination of Iron Maiden as the Leaders of the NWOBHM. Anyone just getting into Maiden has to have this album, but only after buying \\"Piece of Mind\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"deja vu","review":"this is by far one of maidens best!very high energy playing,and extremly powerful vocals!this is how metal should be done!its refreshing to listen to musicians who truly know how to play there instruments.Adrian smith is an amazing guitarist/its kinda funny they now have 3 guitarist!anyway go out and get this!UP THE IRONS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A transitional album","review":"Somewhere In Time came between what I consider to be the two best albums in the Iron Maiden catalog. On this one, they use synthesizers for the first time, and for the most part it works. Whereas the synthesizers became more a part of the main structure of the music on Seventh Son, on this album they're used mostly for texture.Strip away the electronics, and you're left with good ol' fashioned Maiden: Steve's propulsive, in-your-face bass, Dave and Adrian's guitars either in harmony or trading solos, Bruce's soaring voice and Nicko's drumming. The band shared writing duties on this one more equitably than they did on past albums, although there's not a single writing credit for Bruce.As for the songs, my favorites are the first two, \\"Caught Somewhere In Time\\" and \\"Wasted Years\\". Pretty much all the material here is good, but I have to take a couple points off \\"Alexander The Great\\"; the music is terrific, but the lyrics read like an encyclopedia entry."},{"rating":"2","title":"not their best","review":"this isn't maiden's best album, but it's still maiden in their prime. I bought this baby when it first came out and i still love it. great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic album","review":"Another very good album by Maiden (not excellent ). It has Heaven and Hell + Alexander the great , which are excellent songs and the other songs are good and average.The strange thing is that Maiden that time always had an excellent album , so many people tell some not so good words about this (and they have there rights). Nowadays Maiden come with a bad album after a more bad album , and most people say good things about them. After Fear of the dark they come with bad (not even average ) albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good collection of Goldmans essays","review":"The other reviewers are correct in stating this is not the best collection of Emma Goldman's work, but for an introduction to her thought it will serve that function perfectly. There are some of her best here, \\"Anarchism: What it Really Stands For,\\" \\"Minorities vs. Majorities,\\" \\"Prisons: A Social Crime and Failure\\" and \\"Patriotism: A Menace to Liberty\\" are some of the most powerful anarchist statements you will find. Much of the last half of the book deals with women's rights, Emma was also a feminist. Other books may be more complete, but if you want the other essays they are available all over the Internet.I also recommend Michael Bakunin's works, especially \\"God and the State.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing introduction to Emma Goldman","review":"These essays aren't centered on anarchism, she has essays about many different political opinions, but it's a good idea of what an author Goldman is.I say author, because that's what she is. She's an amazing author and speaker, and she really gets me fired up. Sometimes when I'm home alone, I like to read her stuff out loud, it get's me on the verge of screaming sometimes. She's no Kropotkin, but she presents her ideas in such a beautiful way. I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in political activism/propoganda of the deed etc., or in the history of such phenomenon."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE classic on anarchism!","review":"A friend of mine recommended this book. I'm into poli-sci and love the classics, so I went ahead and picked it up, and I must say I really enjoyed it. The author touches on a number of topics all written from an anarchist's perspective, and many of the topics are still timely like prison reform, political violence, race relations and minorities, women's rights, patriotism, and socialism just to name a few. She does an excellent job of presenting her ideas, which she does very matter-of-factly and most eloquently. If you are interested in political philosophy, I believe you will really enjoy this classic on anarchism. It's one of the few political ideologies that puts its trust in the people, and that alone makes it a strange and rare (and refreshing) thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!!!!!!","review":"Through the book I gained a lot of insight about Emma's personal beliefs, and anarchy in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary how true her words are","review":"Something about Emma Goldman makes me feel that anarchy is the best form of government, but I am not as convincing as her"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the paper it was printed on","review":"The only thing this book is good for is explaining an overview of IP multicasting to a non-technical audience.

Argh.This is the first O'Reily book that I disliked and found to be poorly written (and O'Reily has much of my money, too). I doubt I will invest in the rest of this series.I bought Sams \\"Teach yourself Java in 21 days\\" and so far have found it very capable. If Niemeyer used the form of Sams' book (examples and organization), but with his knowledge, then this could be a 5-star book. Maybe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great introduction to Java","review":"I am an ASP/SQL Server developer, and wanted to learn Java. I started reading two others and just gave up on them. This was the first book on Java that helped me understand the concept behind the language and how everything fits together. As a beginner to Java (but not to programming), I liked how it gave me a broad introduction to a variety of topics. I now have at least a bit of a clue about JSP, Servlets, and EJB. I am also pleased that this book covered Swing, the new GUI toolkit. Thanks to this book, I now feel competent in the language and can move on to more advanced stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time or money","review":"As with most people, I usually dig O'Reilly books, but I made a big mistake here. Unlike other \\"Leaning\\" books, Learning PERL for example, this learning book did more to put me to sleep rather than teach me anything about Java. There were really only examples in the first chapter, then it lost it's track and felt more like someone's thesis on the subject than a real commercial book.This book was very successful at turning me away from Java and O'Reilly for a while, until I found \\"Head First Java\\". If your looking to learn about Java, look at Head First, it's much better, fun and you actually learn something about java, good programming, OO and all the great subjects that come along with those."},{"rating":"2","title":"This isn't just a tutorial for beginners","review":"Patrick Niemeyer and Jonathan Knudsen's Learning Java appears in its 3rd updated edition to cover J2SE 5.0. This isn't just a tutorial for beginners: it moves from a basic introduction and application examples all the way to advanced topics such as advanced Java 5.0 features and writing threaded programs. So don't expect a simple introduction - though the lessons are designed as a 'classroom in a book' - chapters are quite technical and Java programmers with programming backgrounds will be pleased with its depth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Book for O'Reilly","review":"First off, I've had 6 years of C/C++, Perl, and a Little Oracle experience. After picking up O'Reilly's Learning Perl book, I was more than Dissappointed with this one. The chapters don't seem to follow any logical flow. Way too much concept and overhead for very little gain. They started explaining concepts and in depth details, before covering basic syntax. Most people who pick up these books have a basic understanding of programming, and are more interested in the syntax of a language. Once you know one language (the semantics), most other languages are fairly similar. Yet, the authors of this book wanted to explain inheritance (both Single inheritance and the ability of multiple inheritance via the implements opertor) when they haven't even covered the basic syntax of the language like strings and arrays. This is very illogical. It's almost as if they explained points a, and points F and tried to work their way to the middle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomprehensible","review":"I have studied Visual Basic programming for a year and a half.

Ray Liotta has been wrongly convicted of a crime and is sent to an island-prison colony divided into two camps: unreformable criminals and reformed, peace-seeking, criminals. It is evident by Ray Liotta's character and his predicament that this is a good guy vs. bad guys movie. The dialogue is, for the most part weak, and the film is too long. For a movie of this sort, I would recommend watching \\"Escape from New York\\" or \\"Running Man\\" instead: they're shorter, have better stories, and better actors all together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"Great movie, lots of action, good plot, good acting, recommend to anyone liking action movies.

I regret buying them (bought them second-hand, and can't return them...damn!). They are VERY uncomfortable. The padding around the speaker is insufficient, so the metal speaker itself presses hard against your ear. After 10 minutes they give you a headache. Plus, the reception sucks BIG TIME. Every time you move your head one way or the other you get shocked with static in your ear. Also, the range IS NOT what they claim. It may be 50-feet or so (NOT 300 ft./100m like they claim). Don't waste your money on these."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star is too much","review":"These headphones were comfortable to me only for a few minutes at a time.

The author uses verbal imagery descriptive of 9/11 to create the illusion that the world is getting more violent and godless. He then definitively utilises a newspaper article to illustrate his beliefs. Unfortunately most folk won't do what I did and google the article where they would find out that it happened the year I was born, 1964! Absolutely no connection there!

Clearly the book is the work of a salesman selling you cheap theology for your consumption but not for your edification. 1 Billion strong the Roman Catholic membership is a lot to say compared to a denomination claiming less than 16million in membership. Furthermore the seventh day adventist church was established primarily to address another sensationalized event; they predicted the end of the world at the turn of the twentieth century. So sensationalize this author will; it worked to build a herd of assuming poorly cathechised followersin the late 1800's.Establishment of the so called whore of Babylon church in Rome is entirely misrepresented and its true establishment and references to this is necessarily not included from the Holy Bible, this writers chief reference."},{"rating":"1","title":"National Sunday Law","review":"This was an amusing, yet disjointed little read.

The size is perfect, however I do wish the top plate was just a little larger considering the size of my speakers, but it's not that a big deal. They sit fine and as long as they're not in a bad location, you shouldn't have to worry about them getting knocked over. The base is plenty big and sturdy to stay upright. Assembly was easy, everything fit together perfectly. The back piece to hide your speaker cable may give some people problems but really, it's not hard at all. Just insert one side first and then fold the top corner over into the other side and work your way down. My only issue is that the height was acutally a little less than the advertised 30\\". More like 28 1/2 - 29 which was ok with me, but if I had smaller speakers, like satellites, I'd probably want the 36\\" high stands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality but just a bit lacking visually.","review":"These stands are very good. They are a bit small for the speakers I put on them but I knew that before buying them so I can't take that away in a review. The only concern I have with these is that one of the stands when put together is not completely square and it is noticeable. I don't think my wife knows or many other people since they don't build stuff like I do and have an eye for it. However I know that it is off and it bugs me so that is the reason for the four stars on construction and appearance. The actual build quality is very sturdy. I don't worry about these getting knocked down. I have bumped into them multiple times and they don't budge. The wire control system on the back isn't necessary but I have one of the plastic things on just to keep the wires in line not to hide them. I would definitely buy these again especially if I knew that I just got a bad stand that isnt the usual."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sanus NF30 Speaker Stands","review":"Theses speaker stands were very easy to put together and setup.

They are also sturdy for their size. I have some 5 1/4in bookshelf speakers on them right now and they're about the perfect size for these stands. I'd be hesitant to go much larger than that. One negative is that the plastic panels that are used to hide the wires behind the post are hard to install since you have to bend them about 180deg and push the edges in some grooves. The other negative is that the carpet spikes that came with the stands are fairly small and don't go through my carpet and padding all the way. Overall I can't complain too much since they were priced so well, so I'm satisfied with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid mid range speaker stands","review":"I was very pleased with this product. The purchase comes with two stands. The stands were easy to assemble. The stands are pressboard wood. They are solid and the paint on them hasn't chipped or flaked, except for one place...read on to find out. I have fairly large speakers and the stands support them well.The only thing I didn't like very much was the way the wire cover was implemented on the back of the stand. You get two pieces of flat, semi-flexible plastic that you insert into two slots cut on the back of the stand. You have to bend the plastic into a half pipe and then slide them down the base of the stand while keeping the plastic half pipe in the slot. It took a couple of tries to get the plastic pieces to bend and then slide into the slots that retain them. I nicked the top of the wood at the top and it chipped a bit of the paint off. However, once I figured it out and got them in it looks pretty good.Effective and attractive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Right for the price","review":"These aren't the best stands in the world, but they have to be the best in this price range.

It lacks the emotional punch of Westerberg's lyrics, but the hooks are Mats-like ala Tim and Pleased to Meet Me. It is similar, but stands alone apart from the Replacement's cds.

The movie seemed to be forced along from scene to scene without the moments being able to naturally evolve. I'm not sure if it was poor direction or just personal preference, but Weaver's character seemed like it needed to be more external, rather than the quiet crazy. Her ability doesn't shine until she is covered in latex and prosthetics.All in all, it was okay, but I have no desire to see it again.

Sigourney Weaver is scary in this movie, it took me a while to see that it was her on both cover pictures. This movie is quite smart in its plot and not that gruesome, except when Lady Claudia rubs the heart against her body. I really loved the setting of this movie which is in the Tcheque Republic.

It was okay if you have nothing else to watch. Sigh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Decent","review":"This isn't a movie for little kids, although it is nonetheless a fairy tale. The problem with a movie like this is that it's very hard to figure out who its target audience is supposed to be.I'm a college student, and I liked this movie enough after I saw it on TV several years ago to buy it and add to my Fantasy DVD collection. I'm a huge fairy tale fan, so this movie is right up my alley.It's a pretty dark movie, but of course our \\"Snow White\\" will be alright in the end, so it's nothing depressing. And it's got a hint of romance, so as a girl, I can appreciate this:) Just don't try to compare it to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs or anything!Bottom line: This movie isn't for everyone, but I liked it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"i found this movie by accident, enjoyed very much, just had a weird feeling of profanity...LOL...isnt just a fairy tail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful version","review":"This is an amazing version of Snow White, Sam Neil, Sigorney Weaver and Monica Keenan are all amazing. Also really amazing is the actor, who's name escapes me at the moment, who was Billy in the TV series Ally McBeal as the \\"Prince\\"! The character is not a real prince but he is amazing in a role so completely different from his TV works I was stunned to recognize him!Some folks are comparing this to the original Snow White tale, well that isn't really true this doesn't have too much to do with the Grimms faiy tale either it is more like what was done with Ever After. (although much scarier) a sort of what if Snow White were real. Not even all the \\"magic\\" is real but sort of trick of ancient herbology. Not so much fairy tale magic until the Wicked stepmother transforms herself but it is a very well done version of the tale. Very dark and haunting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snow White Rocks!!!","review":"This version of the Grimms Brothers Fairy Tale is excellent. The digital transfer to DVD is so good that I felt like I could have walked right into my television set. Once again Signourey Weaver nails her performance as the wicked step-mom Claudia. All starts out fine but then things quickly pick up as step-mom and step-daughter battle it out to the final blow. This version is top knotch all the way, I was very pleased with everyone's performance, the movie's photography and storyline. I recommend this to anyone who loves a good suspenseful movie while reliving a childhood story at the same time. Also the chills are more from the suspense side and little to no emphasis on blood and gore. My only recommendation is that younger kids don't need to see this version unless you want them sleeping with you for a week. I give it my thumbs up rating as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic pulp fiction","review":"These macho pulp novels were the grown-up comic books or graphic novels of their day.

It gives essential insight into the creative process and bedraggled production of one of the greatest films of the 20th Century. The interviews are sometimes intense, some of them with cast members describing their surrealistic experience on the movie, many with a frantic, enraged Coppola (not aware of himself being taped), grabbing for a branch on the shore as the river hurtles him downstream towards an ending he hasn't even written yet.

It is filled with fatuous plot twists that are less than interesting, and it is rather hard to care what happens to any of the characters.

I would get purple and yellow lines whenever we went into 1080i mode. I am betting since my Panasonic set was made in 2003 that there now might exist some compatability issues with the most recent 1080i products and the JX-S111 did not account for this...

The chair is fairly lightweight for its purpose, but dragging it all over NYC to concerts in the park or sporting events can get tiresome. In other words, if you don't have a car, I suggest getting a couple of the single chairs so that you can share the burden.

Looking at it, you think, \\"Only 6 songs?!\\" This is FANTASTIC stuff and some of his best piano playing. HOWEVER!!! the remaster sounds odd to me. Wierd echoes (Get back! back back, Get back! back back, Get back to where you once belonged....) permeate the thing. I don't know. It doesn't sound right like the non-remaster did. They fooled with it too much. The liner notes are nice. Amoreena is a WONDERFUL song, but he messes up they lyrics, which is why I'm sure they left it off the album. So why put it back on? I'm sure Elton winces when he hears it. Answer: bonus track. THIS IS A MUST HAVE, but TRY to get the pre-remastered version and borrow your friend's copy of the liner notes...

Many live albums have equalled this, even his own, but none have surpassed this one for the rock 'n' soul style of Elton John's early career. Sir Elton's voice will never sound like this again, and that alone is reason to buy a copy. Feel sorry for yourself that you'll never hear it like this, but rejoice that the performance (and an entire era) has been captured for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excuse me?","review":"I've been listening to this brilliant album since it first came out and I've just become aware that there are a number of unreleased tracks from this performance. Will someone please wake up and release a full set (original mastering please)! This is one of the top five live recordings of all time and it's a tragedy that half of the performance hasn't been heard since (not that I'm aware of, anyway). I defy anyone to come up with another album with better songs, higher energy, and such phenomenally tight performances. To those who think Elton John is just some old, irrelevant pop star, check this out and you'll be treated to one of the best rock performances ever recorded by anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A young Khmer(Cambodian) girl, Linn Yann","review":"Very inspiring movie.

Much of it had its origin in politically motivated slander by former associate John Wilkes, another fascinating character. Mannix's book is an enjoyable read, but don't take it too seriously since, as with most who have written about Dashwood's \\"Hell Fie Club,\\" he didn't want any real research (and possible attendant debunking) to get in the way of any good stories. This is even more enjoyable if read in tandem with a good biography of Dashwood so that you can sort out the BS for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUST SEE!","review":"I normally don't like this kind of humor but this DVD is so flippin hilarious I actually got a headache from laughing so hard.

As the main review states, it may be a little confusion as it jumps from clip to clip, but it's carefully edited so you get all the jokes. One small thing though. The BBC had nothing to do with the making of this show. This show would never have been allowed on the BBC. This show was made and produced by Channel 4, where the more risque of shows are broadcast. If you like this you should also check out his earlier DVD complimation, however this may be deleted already.Have fun and enjoy. For American's I recommend a bottle of valium to go with it.

South Park continues to steamroll political correctness in season 7. My favorite episode is \\"Grey Dawn\\", where the town takes action against elderly drivers. It was especailly timely where I am from, we had 3 incidents involving elderly drivers versus buildings in less than 2 weeks (a Cracker Barrel restaurant, a Chase bank and a Kroger grocery store). I'm a Little Bit Country, Lil' Crime Stoppers, Red Man's Greed, Raisins, and It's Christmas in Canada are also totally hilarious. I love what a little manipulative b@st@rd Cartman is, especially in Casa Bonita and Christian Rock Hard. The creators of South Park love to use song, pop culture references and sight gags. They mock everything from music sharing, gangs, reality TV, Hooters, Mormons, Indian casinos, New Foundland, stem-cell research, and the metroseual craze without apology."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must buy!!!!!!!","review":"this is 1 of south parks best seris its has so many great epidsodes such as casa bonita toliet paper south park is gay nd many more hialarious epidsodes u must buy if ur a south park fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"C'mon, 'Trapped in the Closet' was genius.

I found it incredibly distracting, especially since I love this show. I called Paramount, who admitted there was a problem and that they're working on repressing the set (sidenote: they took my number down but have yet to call me back regarding a refund).Long story short: wait until you're sure the problem has been fixed before spending your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"South Park at its Best/Worst","review":"Another excellent season of shows in this boxed set. However, the sound quality is very poor. It's most noticeable during any music. I see others have commented on this as well.

I have no doubt South Park is going to be one of those Landmark television media successes that will go into the history books as not just a controversal cartoon that dared to talk about issues that most shy from, in a candid manner that has had jaws dropping ever since the program first aired, but also as an incredibly insightful commentary of today's culture and society."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anyone else have audio issues?","review":"South Park is my all-time favorite show, and hence I own every season. I just picked up season seven and was disappointed with the audio. It seems to get really low in places, and really high in others.

The book is full of mistakes that even a Basis Administrator with 6 months experience would know. For example, the author says that the SAP SID must be 3 characters long, must start with the letter S followed by any other 2 characters, with SAP being the exception, like we all know this is a load of hogwash. Save your money, because in my opinion the author's only intention is to make some money out of you, despite his dismal inexperience in SAP. I will never buy another book written by the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Implementating SAP in Oracle","review":"If you are the DBA or the person responsible for supporting SAP on an ORACLE database, this is a must read book. The book is filled with information that will help you hit the ground running. This book goes beyond the topic of SAP and covers Oracle concepts such as free lists that provide a foundation to better understand performance and tuning considerations.

Janet was never much of a singer anyway, but at least her vocals were clearer and stronger back in the day. I don't know, maybe age is having an affect on her vocals. Anyway, the melody to this song is nice, but that's it. Janet's and Nelly's vocals both ruined the song big time. \\"Call On Me\\" is weak and will be forgotten like yesterday."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Queen Of Pop Is Back","review":"Janet has returned with a hot summer jam.

I am always excited to hear Janet on the radio.I will also agree that at times, the music can overshadow Janet's voice since it's soft. Nevertheless, I really enjoy listening to her.This song is really nice. However, not enough people are feelin it because it's not getting the radio airplay it deserves. The beat is dope, clean and the words are sincere and catchy (which I love hearing from her.) Nice collaboration with Nelly. I love it when Janet experiments with R&B;, because she does a good job at it.My main issue with the track is that it's too short.In my opinion, cool down singles usually do well, when they're the second or third single. This is definitely a song I can put on repeat for more than five repitions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Janet does the unexpected again","review":"Call on me did not immediately grab me when I heard it the first time. In fact, I was slightly dissapointed. After several listens it started to grow on me and now I constantly play it. I like how Janet does the unexpected for first releases (e.g., TTWLG, Got till it's gone, etc). Most people expected her to come out with a club banger. Janet and Nelly's vocals compliment each other very well along with Jermaine Dupri's laid back melody and beats. I wish the radio version (album mix) was a little longer, but I still enjoy it and the extended album mix more than makes up for the length. Nice slow introduction and anticipation for 20 Y.O."},{"rating":"2","title":"Search ended finally --and successfully","review":"When I was a young kid I saw this movie in my local theater. It made a lasting impression on me. The impact of fame and good looks for the boxer fascinated me. I thought about this movie, this morality play many times over the years. However, I could never remember the movie's name. For years I watched TV movies hoping I would see this film again. About a year ago I met a movie buff, and I explained the plot to him. He said it was Kid Monk Baroni. After obtaining the video, I was surprised to find the boxer I could never forget was Leonard Nimoy. I still think it's a great film --even after a half century!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"JOE PIKE IS THE MAN","review":"The only complaint I have with this book is that is too short. I wanted the story to keep going. That is how enjoyable it was. I am a big Robert Crais fan and have read all his books. This rates right up there with all the other Elvis Cole novels. The MVP of the story goes to Joe Pike. He has to be the most indelible character in fiction. If I ever would want a bodyguard, Joe would be it. For those that have not read The Last Detective yet.......Does Joe meet his match? Do not miss reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Good Crais","review":"Crais' books seem to be either real bad or real good and I'm happy to say this is real good. As others have noted, not as good as \\"L.A. Requiem\\" but certainly good enough to keep me glued from beginning to end. The characters here are not too subtle -- they're either really really evil or really really noble. And the kid's just a little too precocious. But, all in all, it was a very entertaining, engrossing read. I like Crais and will continue to look forward to his offerings. (Interestingly, Crais salutes fellow author Michael Connelly by having Cole bump into Harry Bosch, who lives down the road from Cole. They promise to get together for a beer. Very nice touch!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast paced","review":"And Pike say \\"Bears.\\" I will laugh at that statement until the day I die.I found it an interesting read with the POV shifts.

But the book just failed to pull me in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad dialogue, no suspense, pathetic plot...","review":"This story is terrible. I don't even know where to start, so I'll sum it up with this: The dialogue is a joke (it's like these characters are robots programmed to say the most obvious, dry thing they can), the plot is awful, and the suspense is non-existent. I read this book because other readers of Dennis Lehane (who's had masterpieces like \\"Mystic River,\\" \\"Gone, Baby, Gone,\\" \\"Darkness, Take my Hand,\\" \\"Sacred,\\" and \\"Prayers for Rain\\") recommended Robert Crais.This is my first Robert Crais book, and it's most certainly my last.

I was so disappointed. I could not believe that Elvis Cole had no idea or clue who kidnapped Ben! Robert Crais had that telegraphed from the first page!! I was also disappointed in the military descriptions--very many telling mistakes. I was most disappointed in the very many grammatical mistakes that were made by the author. He could definitely use a college level writing class to improve his grammar. He writes as though he has no understanding of the English language. I was very disappointed in this book. I will read no more of this author; he does not deserve my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not exactly a page turner","review":"I bought this book by relying on the first fourcustomer reviews, all five stars.

This is his best Elvis Cole novel to date and it's just about perfect. I like a little more retribution when it's called for and I would have added another dab or two of the old ultra-violence, but that's a small cavil. The plotting is exquisite, the characterization touching, and the themes resonant and pulsating. I don't want to spoil anything, but the rearrangement of part of Elvis' life with a look ahead to future plots is wonderfully clever.I am one who thought (as he himself feared) that Crais revealed too much about Joe in the previous novel but the revelations about Elvis here are apt. They work very well, as do further revelations about Joe.Reader warning: this is not the joking, wisecracking Elvis of yore. Things are far more serious this time and the unrelenting plot and dark, driving tone are sustained throughout.Powerful stuff.

Whoever did it is a professional...he is used to stalking humans, and is NOT one for failure. Cole, along with his silent-but-deadly partner/friend Joe Pike, is about to enter a world where no one can be trusted, where danger lurks around every corner...and where hope may only be an illusion.Robert Crais is a great writer. Though he has written other novels with different characters (Carol Starkey, who appeared in his novel DEMOLITION ANGEL, plays a role here), his best have always been his Elvis Cole mysteries. An engaging and multi-leveled character, Elvis Cole is often overlooked in today's reading world...but shouldn't be. And neither should Crais. THE LAST DETECTIVE is a great, thrilling read by a great, engaging author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping Detective Novel","review":"The Last Detective is the first Robert Crais novel I've ever read, but I have a feeling it won't be my last. The novel is a gripping, compelling read--the story of a young boy's kidnapping and the desperate search by those who love him to get him back. Elvis Cole is watching his girl friend's son Ben while she is away travelling when Ben mysteriously disappears. Has he been kidnapped, or has he merely run away? Do the kidnappers have anything to do with Elvis' past, or is it something else? These are some of the questions Elvis and co. struggle with while trying to find Ben. The novel is well-written, full of smart dialogue, very enjoyable. Have fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"More basic info","review":"Not my favorite by him but all are good. It gives some basic info into why the characters are the way they are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definite attention keeping read","review":"Having never read a novel by Crais, my comments don't relate to prior Elvis Cole books. But this book stands on its own as an interesting and attention demanding distraction. The overall plot turns out to be one that relies on the unlikely events that happen in an action film, rather than the character depth of a superior novel. That's ok by me because the pace is great and the asides on the backgrounds of Fallon, Cole, and Pike are really well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best effort","review":"Mr. Crais is a very good writer, unfortunately this in not his best effort.

I think this way because of the age of Rifka in the book. I ecspecially like it when Rifka is stuck on Eliis Island and when it is her turn to go through expection and she satnds up for herself to the dactor, when she says, \\"Just because i don't have hair doesn't mean I won't get married, and if I get married or not it is non of your buisness.\\" Everything about this book is believable the characters, the setting, everything.

The young Rifka's experiences along her travels are both shocking and tragic. But also very inspirational.I told my daughter that I wished Rifka hadn't encountered so many heartbreaks along the way and she reminded me, \\"It has to be that way because it is based on a true story.\\"In the end, the book left me feeling both grateful and proud to be living in a country free of political, religious, and sexist oppression.

They haven't progressed to making the shiny, flawless pop that would be shown on their later albums, but instead pounded out an abrasive, messy album that brings to mind a studio-based version of \\"Black Sea\\". And it RULES. The singles \\"Wake Up\\" and the gorgeous \\"This World Over\\" are two of my favorite XTC songs, and there's also some clunky, kickbutt material in \\"Seagulls Screaming,\\" \\"Shake You Donkey Up,\\" and the magnificent closer \\"Train Running Low On Soul Coal.\\" The bonus tracks this time around are pretty weak, and most of the album doesn't gel at all, but I don't really care, because it RULES. Out of the 11 songs that make up the actual album, not one is a duffer, and all are nearly perfect. Buy it, even though no one else seems to like this one as much as I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second Best","review":"This is XTC's second best album, Mummer being their best.

When my friends would hear \\"This World Over\\" they would say \\"Is that the Police\\"? Also songs like \\"Reign Of Blows\\" and \\"Train Running Low On Soul Coal\\" are among the hardest rocking tracks ever to be released by XTC. Coming off the pastoral \\"Mummer\\" this was quite a surprise. The release is a lot like a train for the most part, Big, Loud, and Noisy. The irony is that although is is big, bold, and brash, it still was not in step with increasingly pop flavored keyboard driven New-Wave music of the moment. If this was a last chance effort for a stab at rock stardom it is a pretty decent one. Still for a band that had accomplished as much as XTC, and was about to accomplish even more (\\"Skylarking\\" and \\"Oranges and Lemons\\") this one is not quite up to par with their best."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Title Says It All","review":"Most of XTC's recordings fall into one of two categories: mannered or wild. The Big Express is definitely the latter: overproduced, uninhibited, and spilling over with great musical ideas. Listen for Andy Partridge's mastery of marrying lyrics to musical ideas (All You Pretty Girls, Shake You Donkey) and building up tension in verses, only to release it in ecstatically catchy choruses (You're the Wish You Are I Had, Train Running Low on Soul Coal). There are more great ideas in this record than there are in the entire collections of some popular artists. With all of this going for TBE, it's a shame someone didn't hit the brakes on the production: the Linn Drum threatens to swallow a few songs whole, and there seems to be a compelling need to fill in every space with something clever."},{"rating":"1","title":"ccar3","review":"The book came fine and was the right book but the binding was broken and all the pages were falling out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Unhappy","review":"I made my purchase on 12/30/11.

The book's chief merit is that it doesn't deny their existence, but its chief defect is that it attempts, largely unsuccessfully, to try to interpret these characteristics in a more favorable light. I agree that some of these favorable interpretations are reasonable: for example, I agree that the greater amoralism of gays opens up certain aesthetic or artistic possibilities, at least given a certain understanding of art. But from the point of view that is most interesting to me, as someone trying to assess the romantic possibilities, I disagree that something very good can be built on such things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have other king sets and these sheets are much smaller.

From what I gather they are tearing up the NYC scene with a sound that is reminiscent of the Marshall Tucker Band, but with a lot more excitement and energy. In my opinion, the album displays a lot of musical versatility, and features great lyrics combined with rock-a-billy rythyms that move the soul. I would suggest this album to anyone that is looking for tunes that break today's canned, cookie-cutter music selections and enjoys listening to honest, hard-working music."},{"rating":"1","title":"A steady decline","review":"Ok the first movie was scary I have seen in the most and it still kind of creeps me out and most horror movies don't. This movie set Freddy up to be a joke man, but at least in part four and five the acting is better. I will say one good thing about this movie didn't give it another star but at least the hero's had fears and freddy played on that, but super powers made the less scary. Oh ok I just imagine something than I kill Freddy with it, this reminds me of a later episode as well where freddy and the dream have a imagination stand off. This was at least too early in the serious for this should to happen should have been a movie or two later. I don't know why people like this movie but to me it plain reeks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie was an absolute suck fest","review":"I thought about rating this movie a 2 but I know that it will haunt me for the rest of my life. I seen this movie and every time I look at it, it hurt my freakin eyes. The movie takes place mostly in a psychiatric hospital and poor helpless teens are being terrorized by Freddy. But does it really matter? Because you don't care for the characters in the first place. Good let them die. The sooner they die, the sooner this movie is over. The plot had no freakin point. And the actors might as well been on drugz thru out the movie. But I must admit, the director must have some talent for making this movie as bad as it was. Almost as bad as \\"The Blair Witch Project\\" Do you got something to say about what I wrote? And I know you do.

It works because it revolves around a bunch of pretty cool teens who are good actors. God, if Fishburne agreed to be in it, it's got to have something going for it. The whole 'dream warrior' angle is a bit childish for a horror flick but it's still all good.Watch it for the teens, Magencamp's grey streak and Zsa Zsa's death."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors","review":"IF YOU THINK YOU'LL GET OUT ALIVE,YOU MUST BE DREAMING.THIS ONE WAS GOOD.

She begins work at a Psycho ward with sleep depraved and suicidal teens. She begins to learn that the kids are dying right and left. They say a man with a claw on his right hand is stalking them when they go to sleep. So she begins to teach the kids that in there dreams they can fight. While Freddy slowly, but surely kills all the teens he can. The teens begin to learn how to become Dream Warriors. Down to the last five kids in the ward. Nancy and the kids agree to fight Kruger in there dreams. With great acting for a horror film, great deaths, great scenes, great frights and even a few great laughs. Nightmare on Elm Street 3: The Dream Warriors is the best of the Nightmare on Elm Streets."},{"rating":"2","title":"old enemies, new heroes","review":"When I first saw this one it hadn't made too much sense to me till I saw the first and then it filled a lot of questions. Personally, I thought that was probably the best of the sequels since it picked up where the first left off and brought it to a new area. But if there had to be one problem with this one it would be with that one doctor since she did not want to listen to the kids and the ending result of that was that half the kids were killed. Also it seems that in every movie that there is always one or two interfering grown-ups and it always comes to the same thing and that is they've got to go against the clock before that character is killed. There were some really good parts in the film I thought that some of the best scenes in this were when they were showing off their powers, and I liked the fight between their doctor and Freddy's skeleton, as well. All in all, I found this one to be really good. Check this one out, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think this movie is very well done and very good","review":"Nightmare on elm street 3 acting wise is execellent. Heather Langenkamp does a great job as returning Nancy thomson. Patricia Arquette does a good job in this movie. Robert Englund does a great job as Freddy(Like in everyone of the Nightmare on elm street movies). The visual effects of this movie are well done. The story line of this movie is great its different from the first 2 and 5-7. I would suggest to almost anyone to watch this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"SHOCK, SHOCK....HORROR!","review":"Good movie. I would have to say that this was the second best nightmare out of the lot. Nothing could live up to the first one though. It delivers shocks. But is very like the other movies before it. But apart from that, I enjoyed it! Give it a go!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good Friday night chiller.","review":"Blood and gore, especially large quantities, have never been my personal taste for a good movie, but I must admit that this film did have a lot of the factors that it takes to make a good horror picture. The unstoppable Freddie Krueger is again haunting the dreams of children, and the dreams begin to turn into reality for those plagued by them. One by one, they begin to fall victim to Freddie, until Nancy, the survivor of the first saga, begins to stop himfrom killing off the children. Not a bad movie in a long line of klunker films."},{"rating":"2","title":"DOKKEN GETS THE EXTRA STAR","review":"Make sure if you rent the origional version of this movie, stay tuned after the credits and watch the masters of the 80's,DOKKEN perform their awsome video, \\"Dream Warriors\\".

It claims to continue from where the first film left off. BUT IT DOESN'T. We are never told what the ending of the first film is meant to be. And wasn't Heather Langenkamp killed in that final dream? I only watched this film because it is the only Elm Street film, apart from 1, that Wes Craven was involved in. The only thing this films got going for it is that Heather Langenkamp's teeth aren't quite as obtrusive as they were in the first film.Trust me, Don't bother to waste the time to watch this movie. Buy Scream instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Personal favorite.","review":"This is my favorite Elm movie and possibly my favorite old school slasher flick. Having been tormented by Fredy, and being afraid to sleep, the children are placed in a mental insitution, but it's walls won't save them form the sinister Freddy. Being fed up with not sleeping and fear, the children team up to stop Freddy on his home court. Think of it like Goonies in hell. What makes this film great is the unique approach of having the once helpless victim attempt to turn the tide on the aggressor by beating him at his own game. You'll have to watch to see what happens but it's interesting to see the kids turn and fight instead of tucking their tails between their legs and running. Of corse, who could blame them?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best \\"Freddie\\" Movie","review":"Nancy (Heather Langenkamp) has grown up and become a psychiatrist specializing in dream therapy.

Working with a male doctor assigned to the case, Nancy helps the kids realize their special abilities within the nightmare world. When Freddy captures one of the teens, she leads a rescue attempt into Krueger's domain, in hopes of putting his spirit to rest once and for all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing special, but watchable","review":"Freddy is on a mission to gain his revenge by killing off all the kids of the parents that torched him years ago. This sequel still has quite a number of good scares and killings which will be enjoyed by a number of fans of the series. Nancy's return also makes it a worth see. Probably one of the best Freddy sequels."},{"rating":"2","title":"The quintessential 80's horror flick","review":"This was totally eighties, from the \\"Dream Warriors\\" theme song sung by 80's hair band Dokken (Watch for the cool video with Patricia Arquette and George Lynch fighting off Freddy) to the \\"Dungeons and Dragons\\" power of one of the Dream Warriors. Heather Langenkamp is back playing a grown up and much sexier Nancy who is now a psychologist trying to help out the last of the Elm Street children, a group of disturbed teens locked up in a mental ward. Freddy is at his wisecracking best, and was actually cheered on by audiences in 1987 as he killed off the heroic teens! interesting little subplot about how Freddy came into the world, an errie tale told by his scary Mother Superior type mommy. See a young Lawrence Fishburne in his first role. Dr. Gordon tries in vain to seduce sexy Nancy but Freddy spoils his plans....all in all, a fun cool movie, one of the best of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MASTERPIECE OF MODERN HORROR!","review":"This is one of the greatest horror films ever made. It has fright, gore, black humor, and a top notch story. The best death scenes are when the boy sleepwalks to the abandoned building, and when Nancy's dad is impaled on a car fin. This movie is so exciting and dazzling, the special effects are incredible, and so is the acting (Craig Wasson in particular). The only scene I thought was gratuitous was when the nurse took her clothes off. It didn't really fit with the rest. But basically, this film is a mind-blowing masterpiece, and if you miss it, you sure are missing something!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BETTER THAN PART 2!","review":"I am so happy that Nancy Thompson returns in this movie!This is one of my favorites in the series.In this horror tale Freddy drives a bunch of teens to suicide until Nancy walks in and helps the teens survive the night.One of the teens,Kristen Parker has a special gift.She can bring people into thier dreams.So now,in the dreamland,everyone must find Freddy and kill him before he kills them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nightmare on elm street - Wes Craven= A true Nightmare","review":"Freddy returns to extract revenge on the children of Elm Street. But will the powers of the group of teens and Nancy Thompson destroy Freddy for good? The film is not anything like the first or last film. Wes Craven returned to help write this film BUT he did not direct. That was a let down. This is the first film that made Freddy a staple of Pop culture. Robert Englund, Heather Langenkamp, and John Saxton return along with a new face on Elm street, Laurence Fishburne. I don't think this film lived up to what it could have been. It would have generated more fear with Wes Craven directing. Not a terrible dissapointment. Not the best in the series either."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOES 3: Dream Warriors","review":"This is a great movie for one liners and many interesting characters. It is set in an institute where a group of troubled teens are terrorized by Freddy. They must all go into the same dream to fight off Freddy with the help of Nancy Thompson. Definitely the best NOES sequel, besides \\"New Nightmare\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Nightmare","review":"I was dressed up at my school as freddy krueger yesterday (for my halloween dance) and then i watched this movie.

WATCH THIS AWESOME SH**."},{"rating":"2","title":"Imaginative, Innovative, & Well Played","review":"Definitely the BEST of the series! If just for 1 installment - Freddy Krueger can claim to be the King of the horror genre. A brilliance of sarcastic antagonism, sadism & cynical intrigue woven together.Hands down, this is the most imaginative of the thrilling franchise. The year is 1987 & yet it's like seeing a modern day galore of special effects!5 out of 5 stars! Highly Recommended, after you've enjoyed part 1, & stayed awake through part 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best one","review":"For Freddy fans, this is a favorite. Freddy spends his time going through the dreams of teenagers in a mental hospital. Kristen is a girl who has the power to pull people into her dreams and this is how they attempt to fight Mr. Krueger. By getting in touch with their special 'dream powers' the teens take on Freddy, mostly to meet their doom, but good prevails. While fighting Freddy in his own realm is impossible, in the real world, his bones are found and buried with holy water and a crucifix. Freddy is defeated! Oh wait here comes part 4.Freddy has some great kills in this one like 'the puppet', 'the TV', 'the drug-dealer, and the near killing of Joey as the hot blonde nurse. Now that was some major tongue power."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT a dictionary.","review":"This book only has two or three items on every page.When they say over 100 items (words, phrases, ORsentences), they mean it.

It's the best find I've made in years. I am a big George Harrison fan and bought it because of him. I don't know why everyone says he sounds \\"weak\\". I certainly don't think so! He sounds happy and upbeat------makes one think of the music that was yet to come. Wise to the end. Just like John, he left us as he was entering new ventures and directions. R.est I.n P.eace Mr. Leg End.After listening to the sound clips on Amazon, I knew I would like the rest of the album. I just didn't know how much! It's non stop fun and surprises. By the way Amazon (US), you missed a track on your listing--there are 22 tracks (same as the UK version). You skipped Chris Difford \\"Town and Country Rhythm and Blues\\", track # 14. Besides the US version having a tackier cover than the UK'scover, it appears to be the same.For a breath of fresh air and full time fun, get this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than just one song here!","review":"It seems a great shame that many people have only shown interest in this album due to the contribution of the late George Harrison. Certainly there is plenty here that not all will enjoy but there is also a great amount here which surpasses Harrison's work but lack his status in the US. Both Suggs and Paul Weller(vocalists with the biggest bands of the early eighties in Britain, Madness & the Jam)produce excellent and well rounded songs that capture their own styles. Sam Brown, massively underrated everywhere creates a beautiful and touching melody that would possibly stand as the most talked about track if she had the fame of other female pop vocalists and Marc Almond of Soft Cell surpasses his original version of 'Say hello, Wave goodbye' with the help of Jools Holland.Overall, not an album for everyone but certainly an album to be judged by the music alone and nothing else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Your Parent's Music","review":"Well, there are about three good cuts on this CD, out of 22. The George Harrison song is a nice take on his \\"All Things Must Pass\\"/Phil Spector sound, and probably worth the price. [The Paul Carrack and Mark Knopler contributions are pretty good too.] But there are some real rotten things here! The totally repellant Marc Almond song, the painful fake soul of Eric Clapton (hint: shut up and play the guitar, you're not Ray Charles), the truly embarrassing John Cale take on 'I Wanna Be Around...', the grim 'Revolution' by some half-dead Cobain wannabe...I could go on, but I won't.The whole thing comes across as a karaoke evening at some dismal club, with a terrible big band instead of the canned backings, and unsuspecting guests being asked to do 'their thing'. The arrangements are blarey and annoying, just like the hams who used to back sixties TV shows in Britain. I couldn't wait for it to be over!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING music","review":"When I got this for my birthday I'll admit it just sat on the desk for ages in its wrapping before I finally listened to it. But when I did, it just BLEW ME AWAY! The Sting number, \\"Seventh Son\\", Eric Bibb's \\"All that you are\\" and the tracks \\"It's so blue\\" and \\"I wanna be around\\" are the best, with some fantastic big band style and god knows what. This is real \\"feel good\\" music and not just that but I think the variety of style is very great, unlike some other commenters's views. You have to really listen to it lots to understand that, and get the real feel of it. This album is a winner and better than all the other Jools Holland discs. What an amazing performance. I think all the artists did a great job but Jool's Holland's piano arrangement in track 15 is so skillful and complex. I can't understand how anyone could not like most of these tracks. Fantastic work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small World Big Band","review":"\`Small World, Big Band' is a collection of tracks from Jools Holland and some well known friends.The selection of tracks here are in his typical boogie woogie, blues or soul style and the friends he duets with are varied and eclectic. From Sting to George Harrison, Mica Paris and David Gilmour to Eric Clapton, each person he duets with adds their own unique feel to the song they feature on.Personal favourites have to be \`Nobody But You' with Ruby Turner with it's soul blues feel and \`Mademoiselle Will Decide' with Mark Knopfler, but to be honest all the songs are good and sit very comfortably alongside one another.If you like Jools' music then this should be right up your street and if you like blues in general then there should plenty here for you to enjoy. Give it a try, you shouldn't be disappointed.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising","review":"Possibly one of the biggest secrets on Amazon. An amazing ensemble of 5-star talent, originality and downright guts. Look at the list of players. Jools Holland (he of BBC America fame) piano mastery is a serious WOW factor.

While the first two components are beautiful and looked great, the tub spout in the set looked/felt very thin/cheap. I'm into details and that detail was ruining the look of our new elegant bathtub. I saw the American Standard tub spout on Amazon and thought it was so beautiful. My next thought was 'wow, $50 for just a faucet!' but ordered it anyway.

My favorite tracks are \\"Turn It Up Or Turn It Off\\", (which I think has some poignant lyrics despite its hard rockin melodies),\\"Eastern European Carny Man\\",\\"Whiskey Soul Woman\\" and the quirky \\"Patron Lady Beautiful\\".

The album, with two exceptions, is loud, brutish, harmonic, and highly cohesive. Kevn Kinney's lyrics are thoughtful with tinges of aggravation, frustration, and hopefulness. \\"Turn it Up or Turn It Off\\" is a brilliant song as are \\"Back Against the Wall\\" and \\"Whisky Soul Woman\\".

Whereas \\"Courageous\\" is loaded with top notch songwriting and killer hooks, \\"Smoke\\" is marred by a decided absence of the same. Even when it starts to take off, like on the intermittentaly powerful \\"Patron Lady Beautiful,\\" or the beautifully accoustic \\"What's the Difference,\\" inappropriate sonic intrusions mar the groove. It's as if the band deliberately sabotaged their strengths in an effort to avoid merely repeating their past success. The second half is considerably better than the first, and the best song on the disc is rocking \\"Whiskey Soul Woman.\\"Overall, a failed effort that marked the beginning of DNC's unfortunate fade into obscurity.

((Be sure to have an enclosure until it dries.)) When dry it is translucent and looks very much like water. You can add more layers or you can move the almost dry fluid to make ripples.

I got it back in 1994 when it has been released. It's a classic for me ever since. A customer below wrote it and it's true. This CD belongs to a time when Mariah was at the height of her career. She was awesome way back in the early 90! I loved her music so much during that period of time. This christmas album is one of the highlights of her career. She sounds amazing on every song! I can highly recommend everyone to buy this christmas album. If you are looking for something special, get this one! You will not be dissapointed!

But, \\"All I want for Christmas is You\\" is one of the worst. It ranks down there with \\"Santa Baby\\", and its infamy owes as much to its stale genre as it does to Ms. Carey's singing style.

Well Mariah is no Ronnie Spector and she's certainly no Mahalia Jackson, but that doesn't stop her from giving in to her werewolf-like \\"howl at the moon\\" tendencies whenever she opens her mouth.Still, this shrill CD sold millions and gets played to death on the radio and in grocery and department stores everywhere, which only goes to show that there's no accounting for people's taste (or much hope for us as a species, either)."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Only Like \\"O Holy Night\\"","review":"Well, Miss Carey, the only song i like on this album is \\"O Holy Night\\" Celine Also Did Better.

She definately shows with this album that she can do anything!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Christmas Album!","review":"This album may not even be 20 years old, but it's already a classic!

That song is reason enough to get this album, it's the best original christmas song to come out in the last 15-20 years! For the hardcore \\"lambs\\", this is a must have because of the videos, they're great fun for Mariah fanatics. However, the regular album is more than enough if you're just a fan of great holiday music.

A tad too religious to give it five stars, however."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christmas shouldn't be bootylicious...","review":"Mariah's beautiful voice belongs more on the dance floor than on a Christmas album. \\"All I want for Christmas is You\\" is one of the worst in this respect, though it remains one of the most overplayed songs on the radio. The slinky, spandex Santa suit on the front cover tells you all you need to know. Christmas music should not sound bootylicious. Several other tracks on this album share that sound (though not all of them). If you're looking for something more traditional, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ah Mariah","review":"Does this woman know how to sing a song the way it was written?

This album is great and stands the test of time. Each year when I pop it in it sounds just as good as when it was first released. No one can carry a high pitched tune like the incomparable Mariah Carey. Add this to your collection today! All I want for Chritsmas and Holy Night are priceless gems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas has Never Been Better","review":"\\"Merry Christmas\\" is quite possibly the best Christmas album ever recorded. Mariah's voice is phenominal and it shines like a star on songs like Oh Holy Night (which I never cared for until I heard her version), Hark! The Herald Angel, and Miss You Most. Then, when thinking of the album, nothing grabs your attention and makes you wanna jump up and scream \\"Amen!\\" more than \\"Jesus What A Wonderful Child.\\"The CD is breathtaking. The power of her voice is amazing.

Celine album has 16 songs on it - not 10, this album is trite and tacky selection: santa claus this and that. while Celine's Christmas album is Classy, well done and timeless."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's no such thing as Santa..........","review":"And whilst your listening to this CD, that will be more clear than ever, as you will wonder what you did wrong to deserve such a toturous experience. Mariah's voice seems undeveloped, and the production is non-existent. The songs are contrived and cliche, and the overall quality is poor. Mariah's huge ego stops this album from having any real warmth, and her snobbery shines through on many of the songs, paricularly 'All i want for chistmas', where it is obvious that she is a woman who always gets what she wants. For a supeior, and warmer christmas album, purchase Dolly Parton's 'Home For Christmas'."},{"rating":"1","title":"She puts the \\"ho\\" into \\"Ho! Ho! Ho!\\"","review":"Make it stop! Make it stop!!IF Mariah Carey had recorded this when she was drunk or stoned, it would have sounded one hell of a lot better! As it stand, she just does all her usual aimless, pointless and pretentious vocalising.Drink more booze before you record music, Ms Carey! It might help a lot!Expect to see this turkey in the bargain bins in supermarkets, along with the horrendous Destiny's Child \\"Ex-mas\\" album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bubblegum crap","review":"This album is horrible. She annoys the crap out of me. I don't have this album, but my cousin does and she put it on and i was dyig cuz it was so bad!! Mariah's songs suck.

Joy to the world!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleeky Christmas","review":"I bought this album thinking I was gonna enjoy some Christmas music but this CD just didn't sit well with me. I was skipping through the songs bigtime. Oh Holy night was so boooring and seemed to drag on forever especially in the first 2 long drawn out verses. Most of the other selections were just average or borderline 'typical Christmas song'. I honestly don't recommend this as a worthwhile purchase.Other christmas albums which I purchased from Amazon were Celine Dion's 'These Are Special Times' and 'Christmas Extraordinaire', Mannheim . Now these 2 albums are Christmas Master-Pieces. Don't miss out on these two."},{"rating":"1","title":"mariah may have the best selling christmas album","review":"but elvis presley's best selling album of all time is his christmas album. If this album was most popular it would have outsold music box"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Glutony of Mimi","review":"No one ever poredicted a come back for mariah, let alone the one she experienced this year. You would think that she would appreciate it, and be humble about it. yet, she seems to want more and more. This new Dual Disc edition of merry Christmas, like her re-releases of mimi, is a cheap attempt to rip her fans (lambs) off and make more money. She is pushing it with this release, and she is going way too far.Say no industry greed, say no to mariah!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The spirit of taking, as demonstrated by mariah","review":"Mimi seems to love nothing more than raping her fans of their hard earned cash, As she seems adament in re-hashing any stale recording she has made.The truth is, when it comes to making a christmas album, mariah doesn't have the spirit or warmth to pull off any sense of spirit or joy it takes to produce a worthy christmas album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy Cheer","review":"I guess I'm more of a traditionalist when it comes to Christmas music, because I found this album to be a travesty. Carey (a singer whom I like and buy on a regular basis) butchers what should be simple, thoughtful, gentle Christmas carols. There's an excess of excess, if you know what I mean. At least if what she were doing was real gospel (which I love), that would be thrilling. In the case of this album, there's more shrill than thrill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Merry Christmas, and a happy bank account","review":"Trust mariah to be first on the badwagon of Dual Disc re-releases of older albums. Considering she is releasing a fifth version of her mimi album late december, this comes as no suprise!!Give this a pass, and show the music industry that we are not lambs who fork out our hard earned cash for any trashy release!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The voice is raspy and thin","review":"I wouldn't recommend this CD. It's not very well produced and her voice sounds tired in quite a few of the songs. I don't like the arrangements. Think of Hip Hop rhythms and pumping beats and off color lyrics. I don't see this as a Christmas album. Who wants rappers beats for Christmas! Horrendous. I prefer light upbeat melody's at this special time of year. This cd just puts me in a bad mood."},{"rating":"1","title":"A contrived and substance-free christmas album","review":"This album is as flat as they come, and the dual disc re-release is as cheap and lame as they get! Don't waste your hard-earned cash on such a lame sounding album, from an artist who seems to love 're-releasing' every mediocre album she 'creates'. Her greed is disgraceful, and her fans are blind (and deaf)!!At least she is skinny on this album cover, unlike her recent bulging pattern."},{"rating":"1","title":"An utterly offensive christmas album, to both Jesus and Christians","review":"Mariah spreads some offensive messages throughout this album, and hints that lust is what we all, as humans, want for christmas. She offends the memory of jesus, our savior, who died for her sins, just so she can get some implants and wear a short dress. jesus would be appalled at the message spread by this so called 'christmas' album. Her musical whoring is unacceptable, and good christians should avoid this album at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing, classic, timeless, the epitome of Christmas","review":"this album is everything, often imitated, never ever duplicated. there's big ballads, fun upbeat songs, and gospel anthems. it is a Christmas classic and tradition. the 2 bonus tracks add something even more stunning to the album. nobody can ever or will ever touch this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Christmas album. EVER","review":"I don't know what the reviewer was thinking when they wrote that whitney's \\"One Wish\\" is better. im a huge whitney houston fan, but OH MY GOD, there's no comparison between these 2 albums. Mariah absolutely nails the christmas feeling on this album, her voice is stunning. I love the mix of traditional songs and her own writing. Apparently this album recently overtook elvis's xmas cd to become the Biggest Selling Christmas Album of all time!! every year it comes out again, and every year it's a huge hit. again. people who hate Mariah all go out and buy it. and trust me there's a reason for that. if u buy this album, u WON'T be disappointed, altho it will probably leave you wanting more.

I heartily recommend the 1st over the 2nd. In fact, the 2nd edition is actually missing material from the first - even though the 2nd is ALMOST TWICE THE SIZE of the first.This is the worst part.. the best reason to even own the 1st edition (the only reason basically IMHO) is a section near the back of the book. And get this.. thats the only part they took out for the second edition.Thats right, they added a bunch of useless text, and gutted the only thing that made the first edition of any value.I have both on my bookshelf, the 2nd edition is in perfect condition and collects dust.

The compass is useless. Every time I've calibrated the compass it seems at first to be OK, but a few days later it's way off again. I made sure not to store it near any metallic or magnetic objects, but it still goes bonkers. Now it won't even calibrate any more - when I rotate the watch 360 degrees in the horizontal plane after \\"calibration\\", the compass needle won't turn a complete circle.

Road To Freedom has a level of depth that you haven't seen in a Soul/R&B album since Stevie Wonder's or Curtis Mayfield's work in the mid to late 70's. The fact that this group is British doubles the amazement for me. Don't get me wrong; there are a lot of great albums out there. It's just that I feel this stands far above anything else.

I used to attempt to defend (10 years ago) the band when someone would say 'I am so tired of Aerosmith', but they are no longer defendable.Give them some slack. Do you expect to be doing in 30 years what you are doing today? Why should we expect a band to do so.

I cleaned the area with alcohol spirits, let it dry, and applied two coats of dye. When I rubbed a white cloth on the test area, a lot of dye came off. Then I applied leather conditioner and waited a day to let it sit, and tested again. The product still wipes off. I noticed some people say the product is hard to get off of skin.

However, the problem lies in it's durability. After approximately 3 months, the volume control casing split in two, exposing the small board and wires inside. Promptly giving it a quick fix (super glue), it worked fine again. Another month or so after that, the wires on the inside of the cable started to split, causing nasty scratches in the music that continued to get worse, and worse, and worse.

Garfinkel portrays our world as a hopeless technical dystopia where insurance companies rip you off, telemarketers bother you at dinnertime, terrorists run free and the average person is powerless to do anything about it.The book's unrelenting pessimism makes it unbalanced and ultimately hurts the author's credibility. For example, instead of giving a nod to the progress being made by pro-privacy agencies such as the Department of Health and Human Services and the state Consumer Protection Boards, Garfinkel dwells on abuses by the FBI and \\"faceless\\" corporations.I'd skip this one unless you need another reason to be mad at insurance companies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half-baked paranoia","review":"This book is filled with a lot of paranoid ramblings, fear-mongering, and technical inaccuracies.

I couldn't cut the large branches that other reviewers talk about, but up to an inch or so was no problem. I managed to bring down a big pile of sticks in a short amount of time.The current version of the pruner does not look like the one Amazon shows.

There are many places you can't use ladder (slope or hard to reach middle part of the tree). We actually got a shorter version of this tool first from HomeDepot and had good experience (light, cut well). When we saw the same tool in telescoping version on Amazon, we decided to give it a try. It works well but since it's telescope style, it could be heavy for small figures but I have to say all other telescoping pruners out there are heavier than this. Best we could ever find for controlling sizes of big trees. I have good experience with Fiskars product in general. By the way, we bought this on Amazon back in 2010 and we have been using it every spring and summer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great idea!","review":"Easy to trim very high branches.

If what I am experiencing appeals to you buy it otherwise be careful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"Hey,This is a great product - better than any other pruner I have used (I've used a lot of them). I have one of these (bought many, many, years ago from Menards) at my cabin in Michigan. It works great on both hardwoods and softwoods. It has been used & abused, and I have never had a problem with it. It always works flawlessly. There is no reaching for a rope that just gets tangled up in branches with this thing. Just line up the adjustable cutting head on a branch, pull the handle (that is built into the pole), and clip - you are done. Anyway, I bought another one through Amazon, recently, for my use at home. Unfortunately, Menards/HomeDepot (in the Chicago area) no longer sell this version of the pruning stik. They sell a much shorter version that does not nearly have the reach this one has. Also, I shopped around and this Amazon retailer seemed to have the best deal (including shipping) on this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have For Your Property With Large Trees","review":"I enjoy gardening and try to do everything myself. I have a Acre of land with alot of mature trees and was never able to prune the lower 15-20 feet. Every 2 years I had to hire someone at a cost of several hundred dollars. No more, the Pruning Stick does a beautiful job. Its very well built and it cuts like butter. I love it.

The cutting action is so effortless, I couldn't tell whether a smaller branch had been severed, as there was virtually no resistance.

The best thing is Fiskars has a lifetime warranty that they honor - If you dont mind waiting a month."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective Product - Fiskars will not respond","review":"I have purchased other fiskars products in the past and was always impressed with the quality. The telescoping pruning stik, however, has been a big dissappiontment. The upper portion of the telescoping handle slips out of the bottom portion before the saw can bite. I felt the allen scres holding the locking lever were loose, but tightening results in no real change. I have attempted to contact Fiskars with no luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice design but not durable","review":"Most home improvement stores no longer carry this product for a reason. Yes, the design is attractive and the tool is user-friendly, like other Fiskars products, but this is not a heavy-duty tool and it will not last. I quickly damaged the saw blade, and found this is hard to replace. After a few more uses, the bypass pruner broke. The failure was at the hinge, which has a plastic joint. In attempting to prune a branch that fit into the jaw (which it should therefore be able to cut), the force of the cut made the metal blade come off this joint and damage the joint in the process. My recommendation is therefore to look for a pruner with all-metal construction and easy to find replacement blades. I replaced mine with a Corona, which is heavier, but appropriately heavier duty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fiskars telescoping pruning stik","review":"Since we have several high bushes to trim each year, we needed a cutting devise that would help to do the difficult tasks.Now that we have the new Fiskars telescoping pruning stik, most high bush trimming is done without too much difficuly. We are happy to have purchased this tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trims branches with ease and no more tangled mess!","review":"I bought this thing quite a while back in 2009 and to this day it's working like a champ. The best features of this is the ability to turn the cutting head and not having a long rope that gets tangled around.It does cut like butter as some say and I believe that's due to two things: The sharpness of the blade and the design of the cutting mechanism which is chain controlled.I am also in my late sixties and until I bought this thing had been struggling with using the rope system, and a pulling mechanism which left my hand sore from trying to pull on the rope. Being on a 10 foot ladder and trying to fight a heavy pruner and a tangled rope can be quite an adventure for an old dude like me. To an old person, 10' is long way to fall!My only one wish is that it was longer, but then again that would be a never ending complaint as we try to cut higher and higher branches. At some point, the thing would get too long and too heavy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the rest","review":"I have had this tool for two years and it gets normal use among 10 trees. The swivel cutting head alone makes this tool special. Adjusting the head to the angle of the branch makes all the difference. You will be much more precise in your cuts. The chain ratchet is very smooth and requires less force than rope cutters. And to those who complain it does not have the capacity, I have easily cut many 1-1/4 inch branches with no problem. Ensure that the strap is adjusted so the cutters are fully open when the pull handle is retracted. I wipe the cutters after every use and apply a touch of lubricant. These are better than the others I have used. They make pruning almost a pleasure.."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of all Tree Pruners","review":"This is the best tree pruner I have ever had. It can go up to 15 feet to prune and it has a saw to get larger branches and you dont have to deal with a rope to do the pruning which hurts your hand. This has a rotating head that helps in small places to prune branches. It has a chain that works the tension for cutting the branches. I can reach everything from just standing on the ground no more ladders for me. This is the best tool I have ever bought. Phyl"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job","review":"Good tool to have on hand if you have a lot of trees. I bought it mainly to trim up branches in our back yard that I couldn't reach with our two-handed pruner. Overall I like this pruner and it does a great job cutting with ease with the pull of the handle. Using the saw blade is somewhat tricky if you can't get the leverage on the stick to saw the branch off. If you extend out the stick all the way, it is wobbly but it still does the job. Overall, I would recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tree pruning essential","review":"I have used this tool for three years in Europe for getting to higher branches. Can't imagine how one can keep trees orderly without this device. The Fiskars name means Fiskars quality. The included saw for thicker branches is as good as the 'special' palm saw I had already bought before Fiskars marketed it in the USA. So, if you live in sub-tropical climes, don't bother to buy anything except this Fiskars tool for looking after palms and other trees... If you live further north, it's an equally essential tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best thing since sliced bread","review":"No more tangled rope!

I has a good story line with the guy who has to live in the cemetery to battle the dead that soon come back to life after being buried but other than that the story goes no where. The lead character finds himself falling in love with a recent widow who was married to a older man but really did love him so she visits everyday. You can see where this goes he falls for the girl and so on. This movie just did not do anything scary or really that gory. It was like a love story with Zombies. How boring is that. why so many people like this film is beyond me. Give me a George Romero film any day over this bore. I fell for all the hype and bought it thinking this is a can't miss.

It seems they keep coming back to life for some reason or the other. Okay, that premise (if played correctly) could be funny. This was not. A script that was SO disjointed, accompanied by scenes that were even worse, do not make for a good time. \\"Cemetery Man\\" is another Italian horror movie, but the trouble with this one is, well, it's just not that good.

Similar to The Evil Dead and Bad Taste in it's campish splendor yet still mantains it's own fresh and original voice. This movie is soaked in an overwhelming sense of melancholy and also offers plentiful doses of black humor throughout. Rupert Everett delivers an against type performance as a brooding, impotent, cemetery worker who must dispose of the living dead after they resurrect themselves in his cemetery. This movie is unlike much of what else is out there. There is also a philosophical side to this one, which is very rare in a campy film. I'd recommend this one to people who like Italian horror films and Peter Jackson's early work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"One of my favorite zombie films.

And they very much resemble their namesakes.Director Soavi is from the distinguished Bava-Argento line of filmakers, and has inherited their ability to make the horrifying look drop-dead gorgeous. Not to mention that this film has one of the most stunning sex-on-top-of-a-grave scenes you'll ever see. It gets your attention, but the surreal humor and wonderful visuals will compell you all the way to its delight of an ending. \\"The Truman Show\\" is the only film in recent memory that has come vaguely close to such closing profundity and beauty.Please ignore the pathetic American retitling of this film and check out Everett before he was anyone's best friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"smooth,stunning,stylish,and thought provoking","review":"Michele Soavi is the future of horror movies,maybe the future of movie making. Whith his limited budget and his equally limited resources he has crafted a picture that asks what is our ultimate purpose or destiny. Where do we go when we die,and if there is any chance we can come back,what difference would we make. Ultimately this movie makes the viewer realize,in a subtle fashion,the difference between life and death. \\"They all end up here eventually\\" is a quote from the movie in a chilling scene from this materpiece. This movie is more of a social statement than a horror movie so don't expect dazzling special effects,but do expect a keen sense of the human condition,ambience,a terriffic soundtrack,and unforgettable performances from(yes)Ruppert everett and his co-star Nagi(characters name).

This ranks down there with some of the worst I have ever seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good production","review":"The producers of this film made some very wise choices - instead of trying to make a blockbuster film with their VERY modest budget, they chose instead to focus on the story and leaving what would otherwise have required some serious (and expensive) special effects, to your imagination. This works surprisingly well in this film.The Gospel of Jesus Christ is clearly spelled out, and gives a basically believable look at what the future of this very country (USA) holds if we continue on the path we are on...Thought-provoking, and inspiring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only if you are Christian ... otherwise ...","review":"This Movie - if good for you ONLY if you are Christian or a Jesusfan ... otherwise, you might find the movie going to a direction that doesn't suit you.Personally, I didn't enjoy the movie - at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"The end of the world according to Christians","review":"This movie is an interpretation of Revelations (which was actually a warning against about worshiping emperors such as Nero and Caligula). Stephen Baldwin has a part as an all knowing Christian who not only talks to God but God talks to him. I laughed when he came out of the shadows in a way that screamed \\"Look who's a Christian!\\". Oh good, a D-list actor \\"found\\" Jesus. I liked when he got a good beating. God didn't seem to warn him that was coming! And I loved the line a Christian used. \\"Your beliefs are irrelevant to the facts\\". Duh, yeah, why do you people get mad when I say that?Actually, the acting by these unknown actors isn't bad.

Most people destroy this album, saying \\"it's not Helloween\\" or stating that it was inspired by commercial reasons (the band's own ambition of making money or fulfilling a contractual obligation). Those complaints have some truth (eventhough the mastermind behind was Michael Kiske, who has since abandoned metal)., but they miss the main point: Chameleon is a GOOD album, with some great, emotional songs, like \\"Windmill\\" or the AWESOME closers \\"I Believe\\" and \\"Longing\\" which alone make the album worthy. Yeah, there's some weird stuff, sometimes succesful (\\"When the Sinner\\"), sometimes plain dumb (\\"revolution\\"). I'm sure that if another band released this album, many people would find it great. It's not your typical metal album, and certainly not the trademark Helloween style (and not their finest hour) but a correct, sometimes briliant opus. Open your mind and enjoy it..(if you like it, try Michael Kiske's \\"Instant Clarity\\", in the same pop-rock vein)."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album sucks!","review":"Man I spent good money on this chameleon album and I felt like I was listening to michael jackson. I no longer like kiske anymore and not even place vendom can win me back, He is truly a worthless A hole like all his true die hard purist fans (not all).

How the band managed to survive this nuclear level catastrophe is a miracle, if it weren't for the strength and solid reputation they garnered on their Kai Hansen era back catalogue, trust me, this would have been the last ever Helloween album. They took the incredible momentum they had garnered on the \\"Keepers\\" albums and completely squandered it, this was a band on the verge of a big breakout, could have possibly achieved the success of a Metallic/Anthrax/Megadeth, but alas we will never know, they corrected their problems too late, the \\"metal\\" train had left the station, let this be a cautionary tale to other metal bands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Helloween's Suckfest","review":"This album sucks.

You can thank me later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Split","review":"I'm a Helloween fan, and I like this album a lot. The first doesn't lead to the second, though. If I were to consider this album among the Helloween work, I'd rank it low. It's a really well done hard rock album, though, and for that I can appreciate it. The only real link to early Helloween is that this seems to be a showcase of Michael Kiske's voice, backed by a hard rock soundtrack. There's little to appease the Helloween fan who was in it for the chunky, staccato elements of the Keepers albums, but all of the melody is here. This is a good album, but if you're expecting Keeper 3, you'll be disappointed. If you want great vocals in a good hard rock setting, you'll like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Experiments can be good...","review":"But here, they're just so extreme that the album is a disaster of epic proportions. Helloween's 5th album, 1993's 'Chameleon,' is experimental to such an extreme that it falls apart after the first few tracks. Admittedly, there are a few decent tracks. Those tracks are: \\"First Time\\" (one of two songs on this album that could be classified as \\"metal,\\") \\"When The Sinner\\" (an upbeat, somewhat perky jazz-influenced rock song with a bit of horns in the background,) \\"Giants\\" (another song that could be classified as \\"metal,\\") and \\"Step Out Of Hell\\" (which is a good hard rocker, but not metal, but WHO CARES!) Overall, the rest of the album is just plain bad, especially \\"Windmill\\" (it just makes me cringe when I realize the great Michael Weikath wrote that 5-minute pile.) Overall, not recommended for the true Helloween fan, but if you like extreme amounts of experimentation, then this is for you. Otherwise, TRUE metalheads should AVOID!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No power-metal here, almost no metal at all.","review":"Ah, Chameleon. The end of Kiske's era. Chameleon is more a experimental album than anything else. Helloween did almost everything here (except country and rap!). There's a couple of good sort-of-metal songs: The First Time and Giants. The lyrics had nothing to do with anything that Helloween ever done before, not even with Pink Bubbles...Not a good album to buy, but listen to it once or twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain bad music...","review":"After KEEPER II, Kai Hansen left the boat. Helloween suffered a lot of legal contract problems, and became totally dominated by Mr. Greed, Michael Weikath. After a 3 years without recording, came the awful PINK BUBBLES GO NOWHERE (I'm joking, the title is PINK BUBBLES GO APE). Other than the title, this album had a song called HEAVY METAL HAMSTERS.. Unbeliavable. No wonder Kai Hansen left the boat.Sesing they were not able anymore to perform power metal at its best, they decide to go \\"eclectic\\" and went to places never explored before. Good intention, tragic results... CHAMELEON is thw worst thing Helloween ever produced, it almost destroyed their careers."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL !!!!","review":"Skip away from this horrible album !!! This is one of the worst things ever recorded by a \\"metal\\" band.

CAN SOMEBODY TELL ME !","review":"AFter the great twin albuns \\"KEEPER OF THE SEVEN KEYS\\", guitarrist and founder member Kai Hansen left the boat. Best thing he did. After that, Helloween replaced him with Roland Grapow (an excellent guitar player) and released the average \\"PINK BUBBLES GO APE\\". THen, came this atomic bomb called \\"CHAMELEON\\", which set the pattern for Helloween future: a band playing only for money, souless, led by ambitious guitarrist Mike Weikath, trying desperately to gain mainstream attention and led without mercy by Iron Maiden's manager, Rod Smallwood. This CD contains a lot of horns, keyboards and whatever you can figure it out listening to it. It's one of the greatest waste of time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"FAILURE","review":"Trying to change the sound and their music to try to innovate is not bad at all. But doing it making lousy music that you can't figure out what they're about, is sad. HELLOWEEN was going through serious troubles at the time ( drummer Ingo was on his way to suicide ). This album was catastrophic to the band's career."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Helloween album ever !","review":"How can someone rate this CD 5 stars?! It almost ended Hellowwen career. The intentions of the band on it are clear and noble: trying to change their sound a little bit, experimenting new things (including horns!), writing different stuff. This was the brainchild of singer Michael Kiske, and the result was terrible, and he left the band after the album.Sometime later, drummer Ingo commited suicide. Listen to it carefully. This CD is no good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD","review":"It isn't the Best cd by Helloween, but it's a good cd. The voice of Michael Kiske is very good, but the songs are more or less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth & funky rock grooves, tastefully done.","review":"From first listen to Soul Patch, you know these guys are special. Obviously not your typical garage band, their diverse sounds and musically complex grooves go down with a spoon full of sugar. Unlike many bands that try too hard to sound \\"complex\\" and musically sophisticated, Soul Patch does it naturally; it never sounds forced and it never sounds complex. Musicians will appreciate the technique, while your average listener will love the groove! I challenge anyone to listen to \\"Make Me Feel\\" and \\"Drink the Girl\\" and not have the choruses ring in your head the rest of the day (but don't worry, its not the annoying ring that pop gives you). And \\"Arabic Ska\\" is definitely worth much more than 2 dollars! I promise you that while listening to this album, you will bop your head to the groove. Bypass the luge lessons, but definitely take your Summers In Rangoon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Think Moxy Fruvous meets Morphine","review":"Tongue-in-cheek lyrics and upbeat rhythms keep this gem of a album going.

You will not be disappointed. From the catchy feelgood jams of \\"Make Me Feel,\\" to the manic \\"Arabic Ska,\\" you will hear a satisfying eclectic mix of funky, jazzadelic, fusion-jam pop. So there!! Or you can just buy 5 falafels or half a lap-dance...\\"Baltic Dungeon\\" is my personal favorite, but don't miss the classic homage \\"Drink the Girl.\\" What can I say -- this band is destined for B-i-i-i-i-g thangs!!!!!!!!

The interactive pockets and tags in the back of the book for you to complete later were a wonderful project that really made me see, \\"The big picture!\\" I would recommend this book to anyone who loves to scrapbook, who needs a good (if not GREAT!) system to putting pages into their albums (hers is magnificent!) and who would love some extra motivation and inspiration in their hobby.

Stacey Julian gives you all sorts of reasons why you should scrapbook and ways to enjoy doing it. She reminds you of the important things in life that should be scrapbooked and gives you permission to not scrap every photo, not scrap chronologically, and not scrap anything you are not interested in scrapping. Somehow, I had the expectation that this book was an idea book showing layouts that used a single large photo or \\"a big picture\\", which it is not. Many of the layouts use multiple pictures on a page, and there was significantly more writing than I expected. There are lots of layouts featured in the book, and they all follow the simple style seen in the Simple Scrapbooks magazine.

It did neither for me. For me, scrapbooking has always been about preserving my memories. It also gives me a creative outlet. I thought her organizational system was interesting, but it would never work for me. I may not scrap in chronological order, but I'd like my layouts to at least flow in some sort of chronological order. I also thought her layouts in the book were horrible and completely uninspiring.

This book has so many fun projects and ideas that I can see me completing. Normally I love the books and think the ideas are great but they don't fit what I want to accomplish or can't see myself completing. This one is so different.

I would come out and find one area of the yard flooded and the rest dry. A sprinkler this expensive should last more than one season. I'm going to buy a cheap one and throw it away if it quits.

Plus, that didn't help me because our office already had 3GB cards and up. Also, with the amount of money that they want for this DIGITAL machine, it needs to be updated to fit the capacity for which everything is going.

These stories are, for the most point, pretentious and awkward. Come on--\\"the snowy Bible hums?\\" \\"Her breasts balloon, the sky opens inside them?\\" What the hell does that mean? I can't even visualize it. Kudos to Phillips for experimentation, but it doesn't work. I have to say that I do like \\"Lechery\\" and evidently so do many others, because it is heavily anthologized. \\"Black Tickets\\" is also compelling: bleak, black worlds these. Yet in the end these stories feel thin and undeveloped: abstractions rather than gritty experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great product! and love it!!","review":"I haven't found the usability so difficult, and rather found it easy to use.Initially, I really loved this unit.Then, about 3 months later, it started having trouble, and hasn't worked right since.

Now I can confirm another reviewer's comment about the poorly written manual and can add that Panasonic support is equally poor. It took the company 5 days to acknowledge my email requesting help with connecting the unit to a satellite receiver and answering basic questions about set-up. After 5 days of waiting all I have is an acknowledgment of my email but no answers to my simple questions. I've had this expensive recorder for 2 weeks now and can't even watch a DVD video on it.

It can only read JPEG-TIFF stills from pc or SD cards. The only way to import any video into the HHD for editing is by connecting VHS, S-VHS, or a direct feed from your digital camera, or TV.The unit it easy to work, and does a nice job with the DVD's from VHS.

Although it has a pretty good cast-Sharon Stone and Timothy Hutton--the plot is confusing--it jumps around alot and is boring--to say the least. The actors seem to just walk thru their roles in a senseless plot. I guess they needed the money.

This character study focuses on four people, probably in their late 30s or early 40s (we really don't know, but the couple has a son who seems to be about 16), who for various reasons are unhappy with themselves, with their lives, and with each other. Unfortunately, since we do not know how any of them arrived at where they are, all we are given is a snapshot in time with no past reference points, which really does not allow the viewer to develop much empathy for any of the characters. If a film is going to be a character study, then the writer needs to provide some background and better-developed characters so the viewer to somehow relate to them. And oh yes - we have another film where after a traumatic event two of the characters miraculously begin to cope with their problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"When A Movie Viewer Falls","review":"God-awful movie. I was first attrated to the movie at a popular video store because of the actors and the description on the movie sleeve. However, the description is a complete misrepresentation: \\"When a lonely housewife (Sharon Stone) faces the reality of her dying marriage to Gary (Timothy Hutton), she seeks comfort in unlawful and forbidden activities.\\" Her role was minor and we see her shoplifting twice. On the front of the sleeve: \\"WHEN A MAN FALLS in the end . . . she got what she wanted.\\" Well, I didn't see it coming and I never saw it coming because we don't really know what she wanted. Then, the final paragraph, \\"WHEN A MAN FALLS is a gripping psychological thriller sure to keep you mesmerized right up until the shocking end!\\" The only thing I wanted to grip was my own throat for putting myself through this unthrilling unpsychological bore of an incoherent mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopeless","review":"I see that a couple of reviewers were kind enough to award some extra stars for the potential of a film like this one. Sorry, but every movie has the potential to be a good one; but when it is poorly scripted, poorly plotted and poorly acted, it will be a horrible film. This is a horrible, horrible film, which wanders as aimlessly as its characters. I seem to be beating a dead horse, but I felt compelled to add my voice to the chorus of those who literally felt cheated by the misrepresentation of what this film aimed to be. Or, is that the point? Is all of life a misrepresentation; perhaps a sort of waking dream? What if . . . nah, don't bother -- the message is hopeless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome plan seeks better editor","review":"The plan itself is excellent and I've tried several.

The acting in this film was completely awful. They even had to throw special apearences from famous actors to keep this movie entertaining and I think they failed at that. I know freddy isnt suppose to be scary anymore but come on,they could at least have had a couple of the horror movie elements in the film. The only thing good about this film were the Death scenes although not as gory as some of the previous films were still very entertaining. The last 20 minutes of this film was so boring they had to make it in 3-D to get people to stay in the theatres and finish it. With the poor acting and the worst ending I ve ever seen in a movie I give this film only 2 stars.

Second, I'm not always fond of adding a \\"family\\" angle to any kind of series. Especially so late. And third, Freddy's clowning is just over-the-top. For those of you who think Dream Child was bad, this one makes me want to cry.They made him a complete joke. The kills are comedic...well except for Carlos. You would think, as Freddy's \\"final\\" send-off, they would have taken a little bit more care with this one. Tried to make it his best movie ever.

Go figure.), the 2nd and 6th were awful, and the middle three are pretty good. Nightmare 3, 4 and 5 are not great movies, but enjoyable as horror/comedies with great special effects.

Unfortunately no one tried to follow through on it. The acting is horrible and the freddy deaths are like something out of a looney toons cartoon. Freddy delivers way too many one liners and they aren't even clever or funny. The idea of Freddy being able to travel to other Elm Streets and kill new victims was a great idea, but unfortunately the idea turns into $#!% on screen. The best part, seriously, is the end. Not the movie part but the credits. This is due to the fact that horrible movie is over and you get to see the deaths from other NOES movies.

Along with John, Carlos and Spencer-all who die rather quickly at the helm of Freddy. Maggie, Traci and Doc finally devise a way to kill Freddy by taking him out of the dream world and killing him as a human.

Instead of Freddy being a terror, he wise-cracks and is \\"jokey\\" too much in the film. Just not scary.the script is thread-bare at this point in the series. I couldn't really make heads or tails of it. From what I could discern, Freddy had a daughter, and in this film she is a psychologist for at-risk youth in a group home.

I read through the first chapter or so of Linux Core Commentary and it seems much more well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Justification for all the things we really want to do!","review":"Ms. Holland has provided me with extensive support for all of those guilty pleasures I too often deny myself.

This book covers it all from the pre-writing phases of research, character development, outlines and plot structure to the writing phase of screenplay format, scene development and overall layout and ends with suggestions on how to further develop and revise your work when it is finished and eventually sell it. I recommend this book to anyone, as it covers topics that will make any screenwriter's work (whether beginner or pro) fuller and richer and the process all the more simpler."},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong title","review":"This book should be retitled \\"Writing a book for dummies\\".

In other words, lots of theory but nothing practical to back it up. If I'm not mistaken, the author has never, ever actually written a screenplay and have it produced.Those are strikes one and two against this book. Strike three is that, yes there is some valuable information contained between the covers but it's SO disjointed, you have to constantly go back and forth throughout it in order to try to make any sense out it. My advice? Buy something written by people who ARE in the movie business and NOT from the \\"Joe College\\" types who live off of tenure so they really don't have to prove anything to anyone.

Some of the claims are clearly fiction and it's hard to sort it all out.This book does a great job of cutting through the hype and getting to the facts to that we can make good choices about the environment. Choices based on facts not hype.One of the first things that Lomborg shows is that everyone has a horse in this race - there are no unbiased observers.

Lomborg uses data which is clearly not supposed to be used for the purpose he uses, mis-quotes people, aggregates data sets which aren't meant to go together, all to enable him to present the image he wants to portray. Personally, I can only comment on the chapter on forests, but after talking to my fellow classmates, it is clear he has done the same for the other chapters we were asked to critique. I can only assume he wants create a media frenzy which will push his book sales.Please email me if you want to read my essay critique of the chapter on forests.Thanks,Joseph Gair"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Needed Corrective","review":"What most critics of this book seem to overlook is that the vast majority of the literature on the environment comes from a certain apocalyptic vein. Even the ex-vice-president's book was so bleak and negative-I'm surprised it didn't come back to haunt him in the campaign (Earth in the Balance-Gore). The truth is the trends are favorable, and almost all the predictions by the fanatics have been proven false, and furthermore, it has been an increase in wealth and affluence that spurs this trend, not a return to cave-dwelling! And if the truth were told, most environmentalist have their own personal fiefdoms they chose to protect, and are not interested in what we may or may not leave to \\"future generations\\"!

The current selection on libertarian Andrew Sullivan's book club, Lomborg's book is also the subject of an informed article in Reason magazine which exposes the tepid, hypocritical, and self-serving criticisms leveled at it by the incestuous enviromentalist/anti-industrial complex. A dangerous book indeed, in the best sense of the word."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deception at it's best","review":"When you read this book, be sure and check his sources. Remember what you have learned in school about argument from improper authourity. Most of Mr. Lomborg's sources are not from accepted scientific sources but are mostly ancedotal stories in non scientific articles, etc. Then he accepts and rejects the same sources as needed to support his arguement. Many of the supporting reviews of this book have accepted what the author has said at face value. All I ask is for everyone who reads this book to make sure what you see is what you get."},{"rating":"1","title":"The methods of denial are endless","review":"Here is the real Litany that Lomborg endorses, the sacred Litany that most of us in the privileged world live by:1.

Resources are infinite and economic growth is infinite.4. Technology will save us.Lomborg is blinded by the same cultural ideology that got us in this mess in the first place. The Skeptical Environmentalist is the same old rhetoric (Litany) cloaked in scholarship and statistics. He wants us to believe The System would work just fine if the pesky Chicken Little environmentalists would just stop frightening people with their lies and exaggerations.Don't waste your money unless you want to hear a Litany of cop outs that are made to justify our destructive behavior."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scientific Dishonesty","review":"Potential readers should be aware that, according to a recent New York Times article, the Danish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty issued a report calling Lomborg's book an example of \\"systematic one-sidedness\\" and that \\"the publication of the work under consideration is deemed to fall within the concept of scientific dishonesty,\\" as defined by Danish rules for scientific integrity.

A classic example of the fox guarding the henhouse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skeptical about The Skeptical Environmentalist","review":"The book is badly flawed.It is selective, ignoring, for example, undeniable coral reef degradation, which is caused by a mix of human (e.g., pollution run off, dynamite and cyanide fishing, anchor damage) and natural (e.g., El Nino) causes.It contains self-contradictions, perhaps due to different students doing the research for different chapters (e.g., page 96 \\"The population is growing more and more slowly\\" whereas page 46 [Fig. 11] shows population growth on the steepest part of the population versus date curve....I wish I could rate it zero stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Measuring the difference between science and statistics","review":"Bjorn Lomborg has an education in statistics and is the head of the environmental agency in Denmark as we speak. He was elected to fill that position as the far right prime minister Anders Fogh Andersen was elected. He represents a very conservative philosophy concerning the future of the environment and one should be very cautious when reading that he is representing the environment at all. The book is a classic example of how and why people believe what they read. If it makes people feel better to believe that they can drive as many cars that suit their needs and not concern themselves with the water pollution that kills so many precious lives, then who can argue that. Their decision was made far before reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scientists don't get funding when they say everything is OK.","review":"Well researched, well documented, and thoughtful. People who believe there are many environmental problems should look at the history of bad environmental predictions, notably in the 1970's the impending Ice Age and 1980's the horrible problems of Acid Rain. Acid Rain has proven harmless and now environmentalists predict Global Warming not an Ice Age. In another 20 years extreme environmentalists will be back to calling for an Ice Age after Global Warming fails them. Also, there is good reason for scientists to make extreme predictions ... $$$$.

Lomborg does skepticism a disservice by having so little regard for solid research, for recent research, and for accuracy.For an excellent point by point review of just how Lomborg oversimplifies to the point of inaccuracy, take a look at the review on the Scientific American website: www.sciam.comWhile it's wrong to exaggerate the problems that we face or to simply frighten the public without giving good information and solid alternatives, Lomborg seems to go in the opposite direction by painting an unrealisticly cheery picture in the name of \\"skepticism.\\"It's sad, really because the average citizen needs real facts, in a language that she, or he, can understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Selective science","review":"Earlier this year, Lomborg was discredited by his academic peers for his selective and incomplete science.

It does not question the fundamental behind climate change. Interestingly tho, it advocates that we leave climate change alone given the huge cost of solving the problem. Bjorn recommends that efforts are instead focused on aid to places like Africa. He rightly claims that these issues can be dealt with less money. This does however ignore the fact that climate change will damage Africa by providing it with additional drought, heat and extreme weather conditions. A recent UK commons select committee report for example(HM Government, 2005) www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_committees/environmental_audit_committee.cfm.suggests that our Africa efforts will be made obsolete by the effects of climate change. Bjion points out that Kyoto does not do enough to avoid climate change. I agree with this finding but believe that the recommendation should be to take a tougher line. To avoid the problem would be the wrong solution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who Hired Lomborg to Write this Book?!","review":"All I can say is: Beware of spin!

Do not let the title of his work trick you- this analysis of the environment is actually false and puts pollution and the degrading state of our planet on the back burner to technology and economical interests. The \\"facts\\" that he uses are based on sketchy research done by scientists \\"sponsored\\" (ie: paid off) by large, polluting companies. This book should be taken with a grain of salt and not used by those who wish to destroy our environment as evidence because in fact it is not an accurate assessment. If there is anything to be skeptical about, it is Mr. Lomborg and the information he presents in his book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money or time","review":"I have a hard time believing that anyone looking at the hard facts facing environmental issues today could write a book like this. The conclusions that Bjorn draws seem to indicate that his research was funded by corporations with vested interest in maintaining the status quo -- the perilous path where short-term profiteering and exploitation outweigh the long-term risks.Extremely disappointing. There are many other books out there that paint a more accurate, realistic picture of our true situation and give thoughts on how to re-stabilize our co-existence with our planet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prioritization","review":"I have not come across any criticisms on this book which dispute any of the facts or methodologies used by Lomborg. Instead, they are driven by emotion. The mentality of the people who do not like this book is that all animals must be saved, we cannot tolerate any deaths due to pesticides, we must vastly reduce carbon dioxide emissions, etc.The primary point of the book is that we do not have infinite wealth, so we need to prioritize our spending so it has the greatest positive impact for the planet and human population. The only way to do this is to have a clear understanding of which problems are most important, so we can prioritize our spending on those issues.To those who say that every environmental problem is important, I doubt that you would put your money (unbearably higher taxes and higher prices for everything else you enjoy) where your mouth is."},{"rating":"1","title":"but you don't have to take my word for it","review":"anyone interested in reading this book, or better yet, anyone who has read this book, should read the ongoing review that Scientific American magazine has done on it. ...BR>In its January 2002 issue, Scientific American gave some real experts on the environment 11 pages to critique Lomborg's work, and their accusations are startling. From taking quotations out of context, to citing outdated sources, to only presenting one side of a hotly debated issue, \\"The Skeptical Environmentalist\\" leaves readers with good reason to remain skeptical.

The only credit that I would give Lomborg is that of being very creative with numbers. I read a little background on him to test the credibility of his claims and he seems marginally trained (considering that he is a mathmatician and not a life or social scientist) for his assertions. The very things he critizes environmentalists about, such as sloppy source work and using skewed numbers, are what he seems most guilty of. I could complain about this book for a very long time: I will not. If you are environmentalist do not read this book: it will only make you mad.

Every good scientist is. But there is a difference between critical thinking and lack of understanding.

While being skeptical about environmental issues is probably a good idea, this is not the book where you will find reasonable arguments on both sides. Lomborg picks his data to support predetermined conclusions, not the other way around. He often chooses to cite studies or reports that are over 30 years old while ignoring or downplaying more current information. The data he presents are often superficial and misleading. He makes no attempt to help the reader see the data in context - yet that is what rational skepticism is all about. In each chapter he concludes by saying nothing serious is really wrong. So if you want a book that says, \\"Don't worry - be happy,\\" lull yourself to sleep with this one.

As he says himself, without the scare tactics of parties like greenpeace, the world would be in much worse condition than it is. I think that, as a book for the general public, it could cause an alarming rise in apathy.

This movie is a story of a young orphan who, at the end of the XVIIth century decides after the death of her mother to live with her aunt at a inn in the Cornwales. In fact, this inn is a thieves' den who wrecked ships to take their freight. The most impressive character of the movie is the governor played by Charles Laughton who becomes mad. The light used for the movie is very good and helps to build a climate of anxiety. You can enjoy this movie which ends the English period of Hitchcock with brilliance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak film, weaker print","review":"This is a quite corny adventure film, one of the least significant movies Hitchcock ever made. It deserves the two stars by Maltin. Yes, Charles Laughton is good as the major villain, although his makeup could have used some work at times, especially during closeups. Yes, 19-year-old Maureen O'Hara is beautiful, even if her clothes never stay wet after swimming and her makeup never gets smeared. Yes, young Robert Newton is okay, even if his commission bearing his police credentials remain dry and clear after being in the ocean. But on the whole, this is a melodrama one can live without. Young people especially will guffaw at the hammy ending.A worse problem is the print. It's inferior. And at one point there is a jump that eliminates five or ten minutes of the story. There is no excuse for putting this sort of print on DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing links","review":"It's a shame the quality of this video is poor. The movie is fascinating. The sound quality, however, is so variable that much of the dialogue vanishes. One key transition scene is missing entirely. Maureen O'Hara is seen dripping wet in her \\"chemise\\" in one scene, then the picture freezes and she is transported, without explanation and fully clothed, to Jamaica Inn. There must be a better print of this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jamaica Inn","review":"Charles Laughton was really great in this movie and his role was believable but to me, I really wasn't all that nuts about Maureen O'Hara's role because I read the book at least five times (one as a book report in Highschool) and she wasn't really close to the Mary Yellan I knew from the book. It was indeed a pretty well done film but if you want to see the version which is closer to the book, you must see the 1980's version (I believe that is the time the film was made) with Jane Seymour as a true to the book Mary Yellan, Patrick McGoohan as the Uncle, Trever Eve as the young horse thief she falls in love with and the talented Billie Whitelaw as the spooked Aunt Patience. This is a movie worth seeing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda flimsy","review":"Scales is kinda flimsy and not real accurate - hard to accurately set the ounces. when measure 5 to 10 oz is ok but if you try to measure one or two ounces it doesn't seem to be so well.

Obsessed with writing a report on sexual fantasies, decent and charming writer, Mark Demetrius, (played beautifully by Vincent Spano) goes about it the sexy way--by doing phone interviews with ladies with erotic stories to tell. His obsession goes from the office to real life and before he knows it, he is entangled in a web of lies, sex, and murder!

After showing major promise with her work on D-Mob's \\"C'mon and Get My Love\\" and her debut CD \\"Move to This\\", Dennis and collaborator Shep Pettibone (Madonna's \\"Erotica\\" and many other remixed classics) came out with this near-masterpiece, foreshadowing the dance-pop success of the late 90's and early 00's of Spice Girls and Kylie Minogue. \\"You Lied to Me\\" was the first single and is just one of the many hook-laden pop confections that dominate this album. In fact, there's not a clunker in the bunch, and \\"Moments of Love\\" is one of the most beautiful songs ever written (if you liked her ballad \\"Too Many Walls\\", you'll love this.) I'm glad to see Ms. Dennis's talents haven't gone unnoticed today, as she's now a major behind-the-scenes hit maker (Kylie's \\"Fever\\" among others.) She's also a total fox, but that's beside the point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Dance-Pop","review":"This is an above average second effort. There is good production & arrangement and a great vocal proformance by Cathy, but the only misstep is that the producers try to recreate the prefection of \\"Move to This\\" with some success.

A true fan will probably enjoy hearing the instruments mixed a little differently but if you want the songs to sound like you remember them you should buy the Greatest Hits package.

A label who served him well for many years, but if you think Barry is resting on his larels and riding on his early hits . . .You are very mistaken!Barry has indeed moved on. Check out his new album for Concord Records, \\"Here at the Mayflower\\". Phenomenal!! Barry hasn't lost a step I assure you. If anything, he's even better.So, hopefully \\"Ultimate Manilow\\" will lead the hesitant to discover how talented Barry truly is. There are 30 albums availabe to back it up. Thanks Barry!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT AS GOOD AS THE OLD GREATEST HITS PACKAGE!","review":"I am a longtime Manilow fan. I admit it. I own everything they've released. When I put this on I was so disappointed. The songs don't sound right. The arrangements sound very different. It seems like I hear a lot more bass and a lot less of everything else.

He has a rich quality to his voice that is strong and impeccable, truly unique. The lyrics to his songs transmit an uncommon quality of simplicity, emotion and grace, owing to his popularity. His classic style has not been duplicated, to my knowledge, in recent years by anyone with his special self discipline and dedication to a public who clearly loves his music. He humbly gives them what they want graciously and without pretense, a rare quality in performers which when combined with talent (which he clearly has) insures longevity and a comfortable and dignified prominence. In short, he does a great job and uses his skills and talents well for the benefit of his listeners."},{"rating":"2","title":"the ballads are great","review":"The slow ballads are enjoyable to listen to, but the upbeat disco tunes, especially \\"It's a miracle\\" are dated and very annoying.The best of the set are \\"Old Songs\\" and \\"Somewhere down the Road\\" , both from the same original album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barry's Back, Baby!","review":"This compilation brings back many wonderful memories. This is timeless, classic love songs blended in with just a bit of a beat. Kudos to reviving the beautiful \\"Ships\\" and \\"When October Goes\\" but couldn't you have considered \\"All the Time\\"? Oh, well, Barry's back, and that's enough for me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Music is great, but the remastering: better?","review":"There is no dispute that the music represents a nice package. Herein is the best from Barry and for essentially the 70's period: brings back memories...However, as a discriminating fan who nowadays appreciates a decent remastering job with original first generation tapes, what was the problem with Arista who could have done a 24-bit remastering (with some deeper bass, for instance) and somewhat what was done with the Air Supply catalog (Definitive greatest hits)? That technicality precluded me to allow an otherwise a 5 star vote. The package is still, worth getting and enjoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"This man does not need an introduction...

How many artists can you sing to from cover-to-cover? When you play this, you may hesitate on a few of the lyrics but after the first run through, you'll be back twenty years.There is something comforting in listening to these hits again. Does Barry have the same crisp voice that we heard long ago? No, but his voice has wisdom and experience that can't be replicated. We've grown as his fans and I would be disappointed if he sounded the same.This is twenty of his best and if you are a fan, you shouldn't be disappointed.

Arista left out songs like \\"Read them and Weep\\" (#16 on pop charts/#1 on Adult Contemporary charts for 8 consecutive weeks); \\"When I wanted you\\" (top 20 pop charts/top 5 AC)and \\"Memory\\" (top 40 pop charts/top 5 AC charts). If you're really looking for a collection that includes more songs and spans more years of chart activity (mostly AC), I suggest you buy \\"The Songs 1975-1989\\" (UK import).AND BY ALL MEANS BUY 'HERE AT THE MAYFLOWER', his 2001 debut for Concord Records and one of the best albums he's ever done."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL!!","review":"Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful!

It's quite obvious that they're simply trying to suck more dollars out of the unsuspecting public.I've always been a huge Barry Manilow fan -- growing up with his heartful, albeit sappy, ballads. Too bad this particular CD is such poor quality.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!P.S. To the reviewer who slammed BM: If you don't like his music to begin with, why in the world did you buy his CD? And, if you didn't buy it, don't waste our time writing reviews!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not like I remember them: save your $$ !","review":"I bought this cd, expecting all the tunes to be like they were on the radio. \\"Mandy\\" was the first clue that this disc was going to be a disappointment. And it is a HUGE disappointment. I am now in the process, again, of seriously searching for an authentic Manilow disc that plays the songs the way I know them and love them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barry's the man!","review":"Ok Barry's my man and has been for well over 30 years-and there's a reason for that. He's just plain incredible! Anything he does from writing to arranging, playing and singing is nothing short of perfection. I love him and I love this CD.Buy it! it's a great cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I Love Barry Manilow music. I had ruined my prior CD and was happy to find it here at Amazon.com. Thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ultimate Manilow","review":"What's not to like? Every song is a hit and for even non-Barry fanatics the music is irresistible! I listen to it all the time and never get tired of hearing him sing."},{"rating":"1","title":"please 5 stars","review":"barry manilow songs are great. my favorites daybreak (live) not studio recording. does not give feeling. neither did it's a miracle on this cd. then the cd was not remastered to sound good. when turned up high. the speakers rumbeled. i hope his other essential collection has that. comeing soon. not buying it. if it dont have it's a miracle right or daybreak (live). lucky i got his greatest hits back in 1989. true to the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's like this...","review":"you either Love FISH or you don't. it's that simple. those of us here in the United States who have been lucky enough to catch this underpromoted musical genius doing his thing have been rewarded.Internal Exile was Fish's second solo album, and it is a bit more mature then it's predecesser. He strteches out on the excellent opening track SHADOWPLAY and takes the listener on a good ride for the next 50 or so minutes.I love FISH as a performer. He doesn't care about the trappings of the music biz. He does his own thing in his own time. Support this much maligned and underappreciated artist while serving yourself to an enjoyable musical experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fish's Best Solo Recording","review":"A wonderful album with engaging lyrics and great music. This is the kind of recording you can listen to over and over without tiring of it. All of you Marillion fans out there, if you havent already found this, you must do so. You will be very pleasently surprised. The title track is a thought-provoking commentary on the state of Scotland today that you cant help but sing along with. A must-have for any Marillion and Fish fan.\\"A lion sleeps in a tenement close, in a country that is tired and deaf to its roar.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Predictable!","review":"If you've seen horror movies before then you'll easily be able to predict what happens in this movie after the first 20 minutes or so. Although there are some creepy scenes towards the end; the film, for the most part, suffers from a paper thin plot, sub par acting, and a lack of excitement. Like a reviewer said before me, the film is choppy and many scenes are very tedious and boring making it hard to not hit your fast forward button.I wasn't really expecting too much from this film and \\"Room 6\\" delivered pretty much what I expected. There are much better horror films out there, I'd suggest renting this before you buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quest : Try sitting thru this movie","review":"Room 6 happens to be the worst film in the horror genre. I have seen many half attempts but they all somehow seem to be better directed than Room 6. The movie is predictable, boring , not funny , full of goofs and has the worst climax ever. I thought before writing a review for it because it's not fun to write reviews for such meaningless BS filled dramas. The acting was below par,there was no direction and one couldn't sit thru the film if one tried.Do not watch. Just close this window.Watch Hostel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Room 6? ......what a sleeper!","review":"You want a play by play of this movie, then watch it! This movie is predictable, cliche and it moves like a made for t.v. movie, or an hour and a half long episode of the twilight zone, or the outer limits. For horror fans- gorey it is not! some ok make up jobs fill out the special effects portion of this film. Plus some choppy editing make some of this film annoying to watch. Christine taylor gives good face in this movie, very expressive, however you get tired of her screaming and gasping through the films duration. The only thing that kept my interest is the hospital sequences, I thought were moody and creepy, not gross creepy, but forbodding and ominous. Story line wise the hospital sequences were also weak as far as character development, and tying up loose ends. Unless you're a die hard Christine Taylor fan, this movie is only good for a rental, its definately not worth the retail pricetag anywhere. Bottom line....very dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Room 6.","review":"This movie has a good plot but that's where it ends,this type of movie where one is in a different place....then....etc..(I am not going to spoil a spoiled movie) I do like the fact that they show what the little girl did was wrong. (euthanasia is wrong). other than that, the hospital is never explained, are they a cult ? vampires? both? not enough scares, there is a part where the nurses get naked and drink blood. (that's the highlight of the movie,except the blood)"},{"rating":"1","title":"low budget shocker disappoints","review":"This Anchor Bay direct to video flick has a terrific premise about a manwho is in an automobile accident and is taken to a hospital that haslong been closed. His girlfriend tries to find him. The suspense isexcellent. Then, once the truth is revealed, the movie slows and theeffects are largely overdone and cheap, with a lot of ambiguity as tojust what happened. It would have been much better if there were noghosts and the story had a logical conclusion. Still, it will give theviewer a few good moments. I guess you could do worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"MISERABLE ! ! ! BAD acting, BAD dialog and BAD script","review":"\\"ROOM 6 - DVD\\"LOOK...If I can stop just one person from blowing your hard earned money, not to mention your precious time, on this horrible movie then I'll feel like my job is done here. I'm so ticked off I waisted my time and money on this garbage I just had to warn the public myself. Don't get me wrong, I can like a bad movie but ROOM 6 is just flat out horrible.The dialog has to be the worst. The story line is used and worn out. The acting is flat out terrible(no one was good in this flop!). But what I couldn't get over was how staged everything felt. I felt like I was on the set of the movie(which I've never been) and I just wanted to say, \\"let's do that take again\\". Seriously, the acting is terrible, terrible, terrible.HEED MY WARNING...SAVE YOUR MONEY.I give, ROOM 6, 2 thumbs down and 2 middle fingers straight to the producers!!! Oh yeah, one other thing... I want my money back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid western from Louis L'Amour","review":"For a change of pace, I thought I'd go back to read some westerns. Where better than old Louie L'Amour's vast collection of works. This title was fast paced, lots of action, interesting characters (the Sean Connery film was pretty close to this novel's storyline) and the usual deadly Apaches and ruthless gunmen out for themselves. L'Amour's novels are condensed, so don't expect a sprawling epic for the most part, just tight stories and lots of gunplay and galloping stallions and sweat. One major problem with this one, his main characters are constantly 'squatting on their heels'. This happens a lot in this one. A minor point, but why know kneeling or one one knee or some such. Lots of hot coffee gets consumed also. Still, a solid action-packed western with a fleshed out lead characer that was nicely done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shalako all LaMoue books","review":"I really enjoy reading Louis LaMour's books and am trying to collect all his books (except for the Hopolong Cassidy books, don't care as much for them)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weep not, child","review":"The story concerns itself with an important period in the life of the author's tribe in Kenya in the 1950's - the Mau Mau Emergency at a time when I myself lived in Kenya. It does not pretend to be other than a subjective fictional account and yet is more accurate than the recent supposed historical account by Caroline Elkins, outrageously inaccurate as that is. Ngugi's book goes to the heart of a young boy whose burning desire is to get an education at a time when conflict and killing were all around him. It is beautifully and simply told with a very authentic 'young' voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Republished stories that should have been updated.","review":"I made the mistake of buying this book and not checking the publication date of the stories. Both are from the 70's and could have used some updating. The Publisher Weekly review was right on about the stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a shame!","review":"I realize that the 2 stories were written in the 70's but that is no excuse for the terribly-written male characters. It almost seems like this author is a real man-hater or perhaps, that she's into being dominated & humiliated by men. Why else write so-called romance stories where the men treat the women SO badly & the women take it? I have a bit of the \\"old-fashioned gal\\" in me & would love to be with a strong, confident man but I would NEVER be with either of the men in the 2 stories in \\"Maybe This Christmas\\". I've enjoyed a few of Janet Dailey's books in the past but I'm glad I didn't actually have to pay for this one. It would have been a waste of my limited funds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid, stupid, stupid!","review":"I picked this book up at the library just so I could get a taste of Janet Dailey - OMG, what a waste of my time! I didn't even bother reading the second story - Darling Jenny was more than enough! I skipped through so much of it because it literally hurt my head to read it. Just flat out awful and the storyline was just flat out stupid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero Stars!","review":"This book purchase was a HUGE mistake! It is a 2-in-1 book, and the two stories are from 1973 and 1974. They are Neanderthal romances at best - the male leads are domineering, aggressive, inconsiderate, and completely unheroic. These are not romance stories by any stretch of the imagination, and the book itself is a bit like a wolf in sheep's clothing. The cover indicates that you might be in for a nice Christmas tale or two, but the cover was just a sales feature. The stories have nothing at all to do with Christmas and, in fact, do not even take place at Christmas-time. I think it was a horrible way to introduce readers to this author, especially if you have never read her stuff before (which I hadn't). Perhaps this author has improved her storytelling since the 70s, but based on this nonsense I wouldn't waste my time with her again. The stories were poorly written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Car Jammin'","review":"I sing along to this album everyday while rocking out in my car!I have seen Til live many times and am always satisfied at the end of the show. He is a kick-ass lyricist, and multi-talented musician. I love this album, even when it starts to leans towards the strange...

The VHS is out of print so it costs more, but was worth it.

I naively bought this yesterday. The track list does not come on the case, so i too, bought it assuming it was the same version as the vhs, but boy was i wrong. One of the greatest musical events in history, and they come up with this crap? NO METALLICA!!!! Seriously????? And then, Robert Plant did 3 THREE songs, including the mind blowing Innuendo and a stunning Thank You, and they get cut out. Extreme, Guns, Def .... But Zucherro??? Oh, he's in there!!! Really bad choice here, why on earth did they decide to chop this up? $20 bucks down the drain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been Complete","review":"Well, I bought it and returned it when I found out that they had edited the first half of the concert. I had the original taped from MTV back in 92 and lost it but then I purchased the VHS which to my disappointment had Bob Geldof & Spinal Tap removed among other things. Which is still not as bad as this DVD - Somebody please release the whole thing!! Thank You"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Laserdisc is so much better, since it has the whole show","review":"My long time waiting for a DVD version of that old but great Laserdisc was wasted. It's absolutely depressing what they did here, by cutting some of the best parts of the original show.The Queen Medley by the great band Extreme was probably the best part of this show, not only because the way they played, but also because the playlist choice. A Medley of Bohemian Rhapsody, Bycicle Race, Another One Bites Dust, Keep Yourselves Alive, and others leading to one of the most beautiful moments of the show: the Radio Ga Ga ending, leading the audience to tears.Although the sound has been improved and a new and useless \\"extra materials\\" has been added, it doesn't worth the content they cut (opening act, Metallica, Def Leppard, GnR, Extreme and others).I would never exchange the old original laserdisc for this useles \\"extra materials\\" with a bunch of new footage."},{"rating":"1","title":"COMPLETELY DISAPPOINTING!","review":"If I could give it a \\"0\\" stars I would. They cut all the best performances out of this DVD from the original airing. ESPECIALLY the amazing Extreme Medley...as well as Def Leppard performing \\"Now I'm Here\\" with Brian May (which was ironic as they showed Joe Elliott and Brian May in the cover booklet.I wish I could get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Extreme? No dice. Don't buy this garbage.","review":"Unbelievable. Simply unbelievable. How these \\"so called\\" video editors could cut out the very best performance of the entire concert is beyond me. Without the show stopping performance of Extreme and their melody of Queen tunes this is just an average concert. Whoever is responsible for cutting Extreme out of the final cut should be ashamed of themselves. They need to find a new line of work because evidently they aren't even qualified to edit my home movies.What a disappointment this DVD was. :("},{"rating":"2","title":"This is real rock and roll played for the fans!","review":"I was born in 1951 and this is not my kind of music but I've enjoyed the VHS version of this concert again and again for many years now. In this video, the fans are the stars - the crowd is wonderful -10s of thousands of happy-as-can-be fans and all entertainers are at their peak and prime - there's no oldies here! This is real rock and roll; turn up the volume! All the performances are excellent, its a beautiful summer day, the sound and technical aspects are perfect - and it's almost 3 hours long! This is definitely one of the finest concert videos of all times!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally disappointed","review":"i can't wait to see the dvd version that i have been waited for years to released. However to my disappointment, it's no more in the oringinal full version, such as the opening perfomance byMetallica, Extreme and others. i was so regret that i gave away my LD version to my friend. i wish that the producing company could release the full version. i knew all the fans out there wouldn't mind to buy it one more time"},{"rating":"1","title":"ripped off dvd missing songs","review":"I agree to all those folks that seen or have this concert before . had been edited for no reason .previously i have this before ba ck in the early 90s on laser disc. It was 2 laser disc set for this concert but it was complete. on the intro of the concert is metallica ,followed by the extreme and def leppard, where all this song at now since this dvd is a 2 disc set .too bad . not worth it to buy . buy it on vhs instead or a laser disc.so u can see some missing performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Parts of the Concert","review":"When I purchased the product, I was expecting a full length concert but to my disappointment, lots of missing parts of it was not included in the DVD.

I was not informed that the DVD I was purchasing during the time contains and limited to only selected concert performances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor taste","review":"I was so excited to finally be finding this on DVD, but like so many others, I am extremely disappointed in that not only were all of the opening acts and footage of Freddie's performances cut out, also Elizabeth Taylor's appearance was cut out! She was one of the main people behind putting this concert together not only for the sake of raising money for AIDS Research, but also in honor of \\"Queen\\" and Freddie. Cutting this out was in extremely poor taste! I am so glad I still have my video and that it still works well, but this DVD needs to be re-released with all of the proper footage that is suppose to be on this recording!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SKIP THIS ONE","review":"I have bought this DVD 2 months ago from Australia.

It is much much much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"All concert videos should be this great","review":"Phenomenal show, great sound, tremendous camera work. A must if you're a true Queen fan. No one should miss Elton John and Axl Rose doing their \\"Bohemian Rapsody\\" duet. I have played this video so many times, I'm on my second cassette. I can't break this one, because it is so hard to find. Please, please put this out on DVD!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tribute Worthy of Freddie Mercury","review":"Freddie Mercury's life is honored and celebrated in this amazing concert. If you're a Queen fan, this DVD should bring a smile to your face, an occasional tear to your eye and joy to your heart. There are many outstanding performances including Elton John, Slash, David Bowie, Annie Lennox and, most notably, a brilliant performance by George Michael singing Somebody to Love(certainly a surprise to me!). It was great to hear Roger Taylor and Brian May singing some of Queen's songs (although neither one has a voice as strong as Freddie's). I strongly recommend this DVD to anyone who is a Queen fan, or a fan of any of the other performers. OUTSTANDING!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD - Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert 1992","review":"When I bought this DVD, I was under the impression it was a re-release of the VHS concert. I have the VHS version and was wanting to update my collection. The problem is - the quality of video on the DVD is very poor, most of the concert was cut out, the commentary by the celebrities about AIDS awareness was edited out as well. (Half the basis behind the concert in the first place.) My opinion - DO NOT BUY THIS DVD !!! I'm throwing mine away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Move on, you don't want this one....","review":"As a fan of both Queen and the bands that perform at this show I can honestly say this is the worst edition of the concert ever published.I recorded it when it aired live on MTV, and I'd still have it if my dad hadn't taped over it! They did an absolutely horrid job compiling this show. So much is missing. Robert Plant's oustanding cover of \\"Innuendo\\" is missing, as is Def Leppard's cover of \\"Now I'm Here\\" and Extreme's 15 minute long Queen medley.I also hate the menu design, it's very difficult to navigate.On the positive side there are plenty of extra goodies, such as band interviews and all the videos they played on the big video screens in the stadium in between acts.Overall this is not nearly worth the 20+ dollar price tag."},{"rating":"1","title":"...Go Buy the VHS...","review":"I was so excited to see this out on DVD, I went right out and bought it without checking it out. I've worn out 2 VHS tapes of the concert. Why am I [mad]? Because they cut out a good 45 minutes of music. Three incredible Metallica songs, a very good Guns n Roses set, a fun Xtreme medley, and an amazing Def Leppard/Brian May version of Here I am. Don't get me wrong, the other songs are also great, but why cut anything?I can't believe anyone who has the tape or the VideoDisc could ever give this a good review. This a big business trying to make a quick buck by ripping off people who don't know any better and impulse-buying dummies like me.At least they could have put the remaining songs on the second DVD. Don't buy this DVD. There's plenty of new VHS tapes available on Ebay for about 20 bucks.I'd give it one star...but for Freddie, I'll give it 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a great concert but the DVD sucks","review":"This DVD set is a huge disappointment. How could the DVD have FEWER matertials than the VHS version?! I was expecting to see not just what they have on the VHS, but also the ones they edited out, but no! They have 2 discs and this is all they could put in? I just couldn't believe it! Guess I should buy the VHS tape on eBay instead..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quit Editing","review":"I don't own this DVD but based on the reviews I will not be purchasing it. I orginally taped this concert when it was on MTV years ago. Because my TV was a piece of junk at the time, the sound quality was terrible but I still have the tape. I ended up buying the official VHS tape when they released it but found that they had edited out some of the things that were shown on MTV when the concert first aired. Overall the VHS release still kicks... but I was somewhat disappointed. Now it sounds like they have edited out even more for the DVD. I am writing because I would like to see a multiple DVD un-edited version of this concert in it's entirety. I don't care what it costs. Put everything in there.

After Reading the rib bending section (Mark calls them \\"frames\\") I realized that Mark Starr offers some more novice-friendly solutions to skin on frame construction.

At least you could return it without the hassle of packing it up and going to the post office and mailing it back in hopes you'd get reimbursed most of the cost.This was one of a few products that I was not satisfied with, but did not return because it was not worth the hassle.

It looked cute and colorful. It is very small, has very few toys and afer assembling it I discovered not only was the giraffe velcro piece coming detached but that particular piece doesn't come with a toy. I am not crazy at the idea that the toys velcro instead of being stationary or having links to hold them in place. I read another review on the site I purchased it from that a Mother's baby choked on the butterflies after removing them by grabbing ahold of them. Her father discovered her choking child thankfully. The tiger only plays 2 tunes and not nearly long enough. The only plus I would even consider giving this is the bright colors and easy assembly but simply not worth it!

Seriously, how is that long enough to be able to put \\"musical\\" in the title? The pillow is pointless because it's so small. He liked the mirror and the toucan, but they only kept him entertained for maybe a minute before he became fussy with those also.

There is really not much to it, the velcro pieces pull off easily, the music player hangs down in the baby's face so if they roll over they hit their head on it, and the mirror/ball/flap on the end is pointless. The flap was almost permanently folded down, the ball barely spins, and the mirror is tiny. My son never cared anything for this playmat; when he got a little older he used it to stand up. All in all, this thing is a complete waste of money. If this playmat actually entertains a baby, it won't last very long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for Price and Size","review":"My baby loves playing on this mat, obviously he has nothing else to compare to, so he doesn't know what he is missing from the larger dome style playmats. I bought this for the size and portability. Downside, not enough toys and long enough music for him to play and hear. I attach more toys to the bar for him to play and also bought a kick activated musical board. Overall a good buy for the size."},{"rating":"1","title":"velcro wears easily","review":"I bought this mat as I thought it would be good for my daughter to grow with. The velcro butterflies and toucan seemed like a good idea at first, but now that she's had it for about a month the velcro has worn and the butterflies don't stick for very long. She still likes the musical tiger, but the butterflies were what held her interest and now she can pull them off immediately. She's 4 months old and I bought it when she was a little over 3 months old. I think it's worth it to spend a little more and get a bigger play mat without velcro as it will last longer. She loves to play on the Tiny Love activity mat that our babysitter has."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gym","review":"This is a very nice gym with lots of fun, engaging activities for baby.

Last, the narrow width is really bad - once your baby gets excited in the gym and tries to roll over, they can't - they will be prevented by the narrowness and the toy bar. One one of the larger square gyms, rolling over would be no problem, and rolling over is such an important skill. I feel like another gym would have offered a lot more possibilities and growth!

I rented this movie at Blockbuster and it was really good. It's a very ingenious idea about a man , Freddy Kruegar(Robert Engund) who wants revenge on the people who killed him by taking away their most precious gift- THEIR KIDS! and what made it more ingenious was that he did it in a place where not even the parents could save them- IN THEIR DREAMS. The only person who suspects this is a neighborhood girl, Nancy Thompson(Heather Langenkamp). She and the help of her boyfriend Glenn (Johhny Depp) try to do what they can to stop this madness. One thing that made it hard for them was staying awake. If you'll horror movies then you will like the feeling of your heart pumping 100 times a minute as Freddy stalks his victims.

I am writing this review only as a recomendation to those who want to add this title to their collection. Obviously, this film is the paramount of the series, the rest of which can be forgotten for the most part! This is Freddy before his charcter was turned into more of a comedian than a slasher! A frightful good time, not to be missed! Four Stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Introducing Freddy Kreuger","review":"This was probably one of the best and inventive horror flicks of the 80's. Wes Craven intorduced us to a killer we could not escape if we tried. Freddy Kreuger was not some flesh and blood stalker, but a hellish demon that haunted your dreams.The flim is well directed and acted. It is also very well written. For a movie in which few die, the chase sequences make up for killing scenes. These chase scenes are top rate, the staircase one in particular.This movie also introduced us to Johnny Depp. The movie though is not Freddy's show, much like the sequels that followed. This is a showcase for Heather Lagenkamp's character Nancy. Nancy is probably the most well written horror heroines since Jamie Lee Curtis' Laurie Strode.This movie is the best in the series, it's a shame New Line just greenlit \\"Freddy vs Jason\\" a film sure to taint this films legacy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Freddys better","review":"I counted down for this Blu Ray and I wasn't disappointed at all.

This movie is a classic! Everyone knows the infamous Freddy Kruegar. This movie is, I imagine, way less scary today than when it came out, but it's still awesome!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting concept poorly delivered","review":"I think people are more scared of the IDEA of getting killed in your dreams and not being able to wake up and save yourself than they are of this movie. Because, I gotta tell ya, it wasn't scary. Yeah the idea of seeing one of your freinds being helplessly dragged around the ceiling while cuts start forming on her is unnerving, but really I was just waiting for people to die. This movie didn't suck me in one bit, didn't make me believe anything other than Freddy could very well be the most evil man in the slasher genre. He specifically targeted kids when he was alive, and that creeped me out more than thinking of him as a dream haunter. I don't know. Talks of a prequel are coming to fruition, and I think THAT would be a truly terrifying film. Skip this and go for what I consider to be the scariest film of all time, \\"Halloween.\\" It's way better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty bad.","review":"I think this movie is supposed to be very scary but I can't say that it scared me at all. In fact the creepiest part was that morbid song the kids sing at the beginning: \\"One, Two, Freddy's coming for you\\" etc. The only reason I am giving it two stars is because it was a very good, different idea. The problem is that a horror movie is supposed to be just that: horrifying. I fell asleep during the movie, so obviously Freddy getting into my dreams was not a big issue. Maybe its a classic and I don't know what I am talking about, but I didn't like this movie much."},{"rating":"1","title":"a terrible movie!","review":"The first time i saw this movie was when i was 5-years old and it did not scare me at all...i just recently saw it again and i saw all of the stupid parts in it...it was a very cheesy movie,had alot of corny special effects in it.

It baffles me how people could consider this a great film. it is a great film to go to sleep to. The effects are poor and unconvincing, and the acting is awful, there is no suspense and Freedy Kruger could make me laugh if this weren't such a dopey film. Avoid this as one should all wes craven films including scream."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Movie Series in the world","review":"All I need to say is that the Nightmare on Elm street series is a extremely great series, and the minute I saw the first one it was my favorite movie.

I saw this film when it came out and I could never figure out why it was scary.

I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 cause it was alot better than all of those pointless sequals that were yet to come, but it still lacks what all the other horror movies of that time like halloween and friday the 13th had. The story is about a child murderer who was burned to death years back and now returns years later to haught people in their dreams and when he kills you in your dream you die for real. Even though im not a fan of this film i suggest you check it out for yourself especially if your a horror fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"I REALLY DIDNT CARE FOR THIS MOVIE TOO MUCH.

He's a phantom, ghost like apparatus that is all too real. The ultimate BoogyMan. When you fall asleep, he stalks you. If he kills you in your sleep, you never wake up, cause your dead. This original idea went over well and audiences ate it up. The sequels were hit and miss, but always there was the razor glove, Freddy's classic one liners, and kill scenes that would do Jason and Michael proud. This is the flick that started it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Character and script originality make Elm Street a classic","review":"With this movie began my love of horror. Robert Englund's twisted humor and evil appearance made \\"Nightmare on Elm Street\\" the 80's horror classic. I can't forget to mention Wes Craven's pyschotic imagination and stunning originality which have set the standard for supernatural slashers ever since. The sequels have all paled in comparison to the original with only Englund's presence giving them any attention. \\"Halloween\\" and \\"Friday the 13th\\" may have come first, but the character of Freddy Krueger makes Micheal Myers and Jason fade into the crowd of mindless slashers. Freddy is one of a kind and so is \\"Nightmare on Elm Street\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I don't care that most people say that \\"halloween\\" was the first slasher film. This is what really started the slasher genre. The plot is about Freddy Krueger, a child murderer who is burned alive by the parents of elm street.

This is one of the greatest horror films ever made. So if you haven't seen it, SEE IT!! That's all I have to say"},{"rating":"2","title":"i liked this nightmare!","review":"Its pretty rare horror movies give me the creeps, if ever and this one was pretty convincing if you put yourself in the shoes of the victim/girl, also the most eerie part of the movie has to be that creepy ghostly Ryme that these kids sing in the movie.

I noticed Freddy standing beside the school, so I took off running to get away from him but I tripped! I woke up after that. See that? A Nightmare on Elm Street really tormented us children! Back then I KNOW I wasn't the only child afraid to go to sleep after watching this film. It can really get into your head.It's really a fantastic film, too.

Everyone has heard of Freddy by now, but back when this first came out, it was new and original. Heather Langenkamp plays the lead character Nancy, who suffers through seeing her friends picked off one by one by the diabolical Freddy. She has no clue what to do or how to stop him until she realizes how when she was able to take a souvenir from the dream, Freddy's hat, then Nancy makes a plan to catch him and destroy him. Wes Craven directs this movie wonderfully and honestly. Heather Langenkamp and Robert Englund give the best performances in the movie. GRADE: B+"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wes Craven's groundbreaking tale of revenge.","review":"The premise is chilling enough. A killer who stalks you in your dreams. If you die in your dreams you die in real life. Your only protection: DON'T FALL ASLEEP. Wes Craven has taken this premise and sculpted a movie that will literally creep through you. The bulk of the film is shot at nighttime, which Craven skillfully uses to creat some very disturbing atmosphere. He twists and distroys our feeling of safety. Stairs turn to piles of goo as the heroine (very well acted by Heather Langenkamp) tries to flee. He uses every nightmare cliche out there to make us feel unsure and unsafe. We feel that the killer can be anywhere, at any time. Because, in nightmares, there are no boundaries. Our perception becomes warped. This film has become a great excuse for insomnia and will make you think twice before going to bed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great action, story, and suspense","review":"A Nightmare on Elm Street is a well made horror movie.

The first one was a true classic horror film and they tried to use that to continue on doing horrors.In the first one it shows you how Freddy Krueger who lives in the boiler room in secondary school but is only there in teenagers dreams.When one of the girls tells her friends about her weird and terrifying dreams, they realise they were having the same dream. That night, the girl who confessed first was killed in her sleep and her boyfriend who was sleeping in the room with her was blamed.When Nancy realises that Freddy is really there, she has to try and stay awake, but she cant forever...If you like blood, gore and jumpy bits, this film is for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Horror Movie","review":"I LOVE this film, along with the rest of the movies in the series.

I had already seen all 9 Friday the 13ths. This was okay, and it was an interesting concept, but it just wasn't that good. It was neither really scary nor funny. One scene with Johnny Depp's character, near the end, was hilarious, but that was it. It also did not explain how to kill Freddy, and the ending sucked. No offense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Movie","review":"I thought this was a really cool movie. Much better than some of the newer teen horror releases.

Wes Craven came up with a delectably twisted villain in this little gem, and Robert Englund played Freddy Krueger with just the right amount of gleeful malevolence. This is not as good as HOLLOWEEN, but there are some marvelously creepy moments, despite the not-all-that-wonderful special effects. The acting wasn't too bad either, nor were the characters as cardboard-like, supremely brain-dead, or totally unlikeable as those in most slice-and-dice horror pics.

Okay fair enough A Nightmare On Elm Street had all this, but they did'nt use these characteristics to what I expected. I expected this Movie to be a scary movie, yet the movie tended to drag on to a slightly boring plot which led the movie to a disappointing ending.Yes the movie had a story line about a Psychopathic child murderer who kills under 18's in thier sleep on Elm Street, but this very good story line was spoilt by the way the film was set out.Overall not a \\"Bad\\" movie but not Good movie either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost insulting.","review":"Have we learned nothing from George Romero? Romero tried to teach us (in vain, apparently) that horror movies didn't have to be mindless. They didn't have to be one dimensional. Look at his \\"Dead\\" trilogy. Those three films (Yes, he ONLY NEEDED THREE) not only had the most gore this side of a Turkish Prison, but they also offered political satire and Romero's views of the world today (for the era in which he made the films, not 1999). That being said, I find all these mindless slasher films (and their countless, desperate money generating sequels) to be insulting in a small way. I'm not trying to turn people off of this film, I'm just ranting. I do that a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool movie!","review":"I heard of this series, and decided to rent the first one.

I'll admit that I'm rough on my bag, but I bought this one expecting durability. The plastic strap clips are busting on me and the telescopic handle just popped off on me when I rolled it over an indentation.Three weeks ago it would have gotten four or five stars (four because I'm not crazy about the sickly gray color of it).

Basically the thesis is that it's good to be unhappy. The main characters are sick that this world has no unhappiness and they want the right to be unhappy. I cannot understand this since I would rather be happy than not. If this was just a satire about an immoral modern society, then I could understand. His predictions certainly are not too far off the map. If you are curious, try this book, but personally I did not find it enlightening."},{"rating":"1","title":"1984? I don't think so.

Whereas 1984 had a plot, characters and a point Brave New World had none. It is basically a description of a futuristic world with this bit thrown in about The Savage. The Savage is a strange combination that Heller made up of religion, primative life, and something like voodoo. Not a very impressive book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book for a rainy day","review":"This book is more the type to read when you just don't feel like doing anything and want to just sit down and read, because once you pick it up you can never put it down...

And, of course, by reading it you are undermining one of the basics of this distopian society: buy new things all the time. Sound familar? You beat it does. The characters aren't as well developed as I would ideally like but the focus is on a society where the individual is lost so there is a reason (or that's what I tell myself ;-)) A great read for high schoolers just investigating the world around them with a critical mind and a terrifying read for those of us caught up in the material world already."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brave New World not as deep as 1984","review":"Aldous Huxley's 1932 novel Brave New World presents a vision of consumerism and mechanization, where social strata are bred into the biology of factory-produced twins, and stuporous stability is the highest government ideal. I found myself captivated by the book's system of society, its veneration of Henry Ford, and culture of instant gratification. If Orwell's vision was pure fascism, this is pure capitalism.On the downside, Brave New World is nowhere as intellectually deep as 1984. The plot and characters are underdeveloped and inconsequential. Huxley makes the joy of reading solely in its exploration of his (brave new) world, but that can only carry the book so far. Throw in a compelling plot, differentiated tone of story-telling, and dynamic characters and it might have been perfect.Continued at: [...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"Once again a book that garners acclaim but leaves you (me anyway) feeling like you wasted precious moments of your life--ala On The Road.

One is given a choice between insanity and lunacy as Huxley says in his forward. I picked neither. The book was dark and depressing. This might have been the point, but I don't have to like it. I would have liked it more had there been a main character that was more of a hero or an individual in this society of clones. If it would have been more about Helmholtz's struggles or if John would have been less crazy, I think it would have been better for me. Instead we are faced with the horror of drug addicted society members and the insanity of a savage that has a warped set of morals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland","review":"A prophetic vision of a distant future, where humans are hatched, and choice is a thing of the past. Brave New World describes a regimented, worldwide government where men and women are bred into a particular caste, and conditioned from infancy to appreciate their lives as workers and consumers. Sometimes it seemed an attack against communism, at other times a treatise on \`stability with happiness' versus \`instability with human struggle.' Regretfully, the characters were unlovable, and at times seemed barely human. The struggle against the government turned out to be not much of a struggle at all, more of a polite conversation with some tears. There was no fear or darkness, and only a little bit of contention. Towards the end, the characters turned didactic, quoting Shakespeare and waxing scholarly. It made the story feel more like an essay than a book. For a touching futuristic tale of governmental intrusion, read Orwell's 1984 instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"good book/ terrible quality","review":"amazing story line, i love the author just there are scribbles on every page and many sections are hi-lighted i dont think i could ever buy another book from international books"},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"this has got to be the most boring book i have ever read, & maybe that is because i am younger & it was written in 1932 but it was horrible i didn't understand a dang word.. i am very dissapointed too i was really looking forward to this book .."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful story","review":"Fantastic read.

Huxley's Alpha, Beta and Gamma groups of people that have been cloned and taught to do certain things, strikes a very familiar chord with recent events and debates going on now on the ethic's of cloning. What if Hitler had these technologies during WWII so he was able to not only exterminate the Jews but to clone more people with the dominant traits he thought so superior? We (as a society) have already been confronted with Orwell's Big Brotherly surveillance of society as can be seen in the movie \\"Enemy of the State.\\" What will happen when and if the cloning technologies of \\"Brave New World\\" also enter our society?

It's very interesting to think about what can happen in a distant future.It's great to consider how babies could be created by men, the ways of finding satisfaction, and the different types of people that could exist in an upcoming civilization. The vision I found in the book - a \\"perfect\\" world, without feelings , where everyone is only searching for personal pleasure - could be very shocking, but very realistic.On the other hand, the story has no much action, that's why some parts could be tedious to read. The descriptions are great, but sometimes they are too long. The story could be better with more action.However, this is a very good book, and I recommend people to read it and analyze it carefully, because I'm sure they will discover many things about our current society that could encourage us to a Brave New World."},{"rating":"2","title":"very thoughtful","review":"i was told to read this book this one day when conversing over the book \\"1984.\\" so as i read this book, i had 1984 in mind and may have influenced my perception of Huxley's book.it is a tremendous book about what life could be like in the future. in one way, our society is already heading in that direction with how free we are with our sexuality. i was in romania on a visit two months ago and saw a program from England on TV about sexuality. the program was amazingly blatant in its advice to people. it said things like \\"yeah if your husband isnt pleasing you enough, then a secret lover will work.\\" and other things similar.it was also very interesting how Socialist the society seemed in Huxley's book. i dont know if he was criticizing Socialism (or at the time Communism) or saying that it was inevitable that society would lead to that.in the end though, it is a worth while read for anyone who wants to think. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Commentary or Prophetic muses...","review":"Aldous Huxley creates in this book the \\"Brave New World\\", a hilarious commentary on what may be considered a scientific ideal set in the future, or commentary on the expectations in his own 20th century realizations of a scientific movement. Either way, the \\"Brave New World\\" does not disappoint the reader. You can expect a little hilarity in every chapter concerning his observations indicative of a heightened sense of awareness of the concerns in society. Those things that the modern world takes for granted are copiously elaborated in his \\"Brave New World\\", unexpected and uniquely distinguished with an air of humor. His observations are elaborate and of a keen sense and the writing is excellent and a joy to read. The chapters are relatively short and never laborious or containing any sense of tedium.

Mediocre writing, snail-like pacing, and shallow stereotypes (the semi-rebellious anti-hero, the hard-core Messiah/revolutionary figure, the orthodox romantic interest, the benevolent omnipotent despot are Bernard, Savage, Lenina and Mond, respectively) aside, the idea of this book is absurd. Sure, the denizens of Huxley's Ford-ruled world (and the replacement of \\"God\\" with \\"Ford\\"; I found that amusing for, oh, about three seconds) seem perfectly happy to me, and the book is written in such a cock-eyes and unbelievable manner that this \\"Brave New World\\" doesn't seems at all depressing; it just seems like another way to live life. This is a crushingly pointless book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Actually, not that good.","review":"The characters are irritating and one-dimensional. The too frequent shifting points of view are unnecessary and confusing. Aside from the occasional glimmers of dry wit (not including the \\"Our Ford\\" joke which tires out quickly), the writing is for the most part flat. Even the orgy scenes manage to be dull. The latter half of the novel is simply a rant of Huxley's personal beliefs, all of which have been stated elsewhere and more eloquently. There are no real deep societal insights. In short, extremely overrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some truths about society,most do hit predicting the future.","review":"This book can be related to the society in whole.

The only thing that I did not like was the ending of the book. Although it was symbolic, it left you hanging and wondering what would happen next. The interesting thing about this book was that, Huxley wrote it so long ago that he could not have possiably know what was going to happen in the future. The funny thing is that the book is starting to come true in some ways. Recentley, scientist have made advances in the study of cloning and been successful in recreating animals. This book seems like a prophecy of sorts."},{"rating":"2","title":"You have to be brave to read this book","review":"This is a great book to challenge the belief that there should be no pain, aging, sickness, etc. in our life.The government believes that by controlling everything in the environment, and by creating classes of people based on chemical tampering and subliminal programming during the incubation process (as babies are developing in the lab), people can be made to have a \\"happy\\" and productive life. The problem is that emotion, spirituality, liberty, and questioning is not allowed to disturb the tranquility of this existence.The Savage from a reservation outside of this environment is brought into the story about a third of the way into it to question this type of life.I think the story dragged a little bit, which is why I gave it four, instead of five, stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Viva Huxley!","review":"Aldous Huxley's genius is fully revealed in this wicked satire, which in addition has become an uncannily accurate look at trends in the technology and society of our own time. There are so many points in this book where you are ready to laugh and shudder at the same time. While there are many frivolous puns and jokes scattered throughout, not to mention ridiculously overblown character interactions, the message is ultimately quite serious. We are still prostrating ourselves at the feet of corporations which claim to be advancing the cause of science, being \\"connected\\" and \\"happy\\" is now more important than anything, and journalistic ethics have indeed evaporated. This novel is in some ways the best portrait of the 1990s yet written--our own contemporary writers, for the most part, are too inhibited or ignorant to say what's really going on."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"The Emperor has no clothes!\\"","review":"There could not,to my thinking, be a greater gap between celebrity of a book and its actual merit. The writing is vapid, tiresome, and often unintelligible. Often praised as of far more psychological and societal value than 1984 or ANIMAL FARM, such claims are thoroughgoingly absurd. In fact, I quite wonder what substances got into Huxley's bloodstream and crossed the brain barrier when he was writing this drivel-ridden casuistry.P.S. My dismissive contribution here may prompt some of Huxley's ardent devotees to desire initiation of a mass debate. No thanks.

Aesthetic standards can't be grounded.Thus, don't listen to anyone who tries to distinguish between \\"serious\\" works of literature like this one and allegedly \\"lesser\\" novels. The distinction is entirely illusory, because no novels are \\"better\\" than any others, and the concept of a \\"great novel\\" is an intellectual hoax.I prefer books with red covers.

If you want to evaluate the plausibility of it, fine, but the result has little bearing on the quality of the novel. That said, everything else about \\"Brave New World\\" is mediocre. The plot seems convinient (not to mention boring), and once a few chapters have passed, Huxley just ceases development of his vision to instead focus attention on characters - who end up being underdeveloped anyway.(If you haven't read it yet, I still suggest you read it, and judge for yourself.

Why people think it's so great, I'd really like to know. Maybe I missed something. But to me, it seemed like a great premise that never went anywhere. It completely fizzled and died about 2/3 of the way through. Huxley couldn't decide what storyline he wanted to use, and finally picked the silliest, most childish one. He also had trouble figuring out which of his characters was the protagonist. First it was Lenina, then it was her lover (I forget his name), then it was the \\"savage\\", and so forth. So, yes, Huxley and Orwell have written books with similar ideas. The only difference between the two is that Orwell carries off his storyline in a mature and captivating manner, like a true writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Woe of the World","review":"I had read this book as a required reading in college (many years ago) and I had forgotten how dismal I thought it was back then.

It appears that Huxley simply entered random words on paper as they popped up in his brain(?). Brave New Worlds, indeed.I would suggest reading Mad Magazine instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brave New World","review":"Brave New World is boring at the beginning, but it becomes more interesting later. I wouldn't recommend the book for everyone because it is very suggestive. I am reading it in my senior English class. This book has so much immorality that it shouldn't be allowed in schools. The book has good points and reveals problems in any society, but that doesn't mean that just because it is educational that it should be used in a school setting. I would suggest that if the book would interest someone they may want to read it on their own time, and not for a school class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh....","review":"So anyways, I picked this book up thinking it would be an interesting tale about the future and totalitarianism. While it was about that, I found it difficult to find a plot. Aldous Huxley kind of rambles for a hundred pages, and then he introduces what then becomes the main character, Mr. Savage.

Being a book lover I dove into the book reading the first 3 chapters before the day was out. It was then I found what a perverted, warped mind Aldous Huxley had. The book is about a man named Bernard Marx. Benard lives in a society where almost everyone is genetically engineered in a laboratory. As children they are manipulated to become one of the four social classes: Alphas, Betas, Deltas, and Epsilons. As adults, people in this society take drugs daily, and are encouraged to have intercourse with many diffrn't people, and prejudice among classes is common. In short this book is about people who's average lifestyle contains all of the wrongs commited today.

The first few pages intrigued me and as the novel progressed I became bored. I absolutely began to become disappointed in the praise that others have offered for it. I quit reading the book 3/4ths of the way through, returning it to the library shelves where it belongs as eye candy for the people who want to say they read it when they haven't. I read it, hated it, returned it. Good use of language but redundant in its explanations.Sorry to all you Huxley fans but I wasn't impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"An OK Novel","review":"I didn't really enjoy reading this book too much. The main characters were annoying, and the writing style was unnecessarily confusing. The only redeeming quality to the book was the valid and interesting points on civilization as a whole.

With it's idealistic philosophies and overdrawn characters, it leaves much to be desired by the realist. This book, who's plot is well known enough that I do not think I need to delve into it here, is very indicative of the whole genre. All of the characters are cardboard cutouts of the denziens of the utopian novel. There's the bewildered outsider, there's the one who can't accept the system, there's the one who accepts it whole heartedly, there's the victim of said society, etc, etc, etc. Yes, the book does raise important objections to the Totalitarian state and religious fidelity to science, however, these are actually fairly common objections that you do not need to read a 250 page book to figure out. If you loved 1984, give it a shot I guess.

Setting the anti-technology standard carried through by cumming's poetry and Orwell's prose a half-generation later, Huxley adopts a sensationalist, slightly racy stance toward his subject matter: technology vis-a-vis power. True to his cinematographic experience (Huxley later turned to film writing), this book is part tabloid, part far-fetched sci-fi, and all fun. It's a literary masterpiece to boot, with substance to back up the style. A must read!

In under three hundred pages, readers find themseves disgusted and intrigued. This intense book provokes an unexplored question: What is more important Happiness or Freedom? You choose. A world with \\"conditioned\\" people; humans that are hypnotized to believe they are happy. With not a worry, no parents or babies (you were born out of a bottle), no resumees (you already have a job according to your caste) and no marriage (you can never fall in love). Nothing to complain about. If they do, a little Soma does the trick. Takes them to cloud nine. But things aren't as simple as they seem....a little visit from the savage John, an unconditioned man, changes the lives of three human robots living in this dystopia. But in the end, it changes his own life. He finds the truth within himself and for the world around him. He discovers this Brave New World."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great classic","review":"This book is such a thought-provoking novel.

I feel that the author has given us two extremes in the shape of Civilized Society and Savage Reseravation. The ideal society lies somewhere in between the two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutly LOVE it! Great book for high schoolers and adults","review":"I was assigned this book for 11th grade British Literature. At the beginning of the book, it is very risque (especially for an assigned book) for example - the society thinks children are not normal if they don't like to participate in erotic play.

If you liked Brave New World, you'll love The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book focusing on the improbability of such a utopia.","review":"Brave New World. Such a fitting title. A venture into the reaches of insanity. Who but Huxley could have imagined such a concept? Mass production of humans, unlimited sex, legal 'coke'...Although initially appearing a perfect society , the scene quickly changes as one discovers his savage side, his human side. Finding oneself to be independent, and not 'one cell in the tissue of society.' Such a society is an impossibility, and must be regarded as one. A great read for any sci-fi lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's like like everyone has their drug of choice like in BNW","review":"ok, i really liked this book, aldous huxley is a great writer and somewhat twisted to write such fun reading and i read it a lot faster htan 1984, i liked orwells novel better but BNW was a lot faster read, i notice da bucnh of communist reffernces it seemed tho, Bernard Marx...?

Brave New World is a lot like 1984. For example it dealt with society in the feature and described a totalatarian government. Except in Brave New Wold there is not much of a story line and you never get to know the characters. The whole book is pretty much just describing how their society is run.

Really, it's more an exposition of a future possible state, with archetypes instead of characters, and long, highly technical descriptions of factories and flying machines. Don't look for subtle emotions or subtle anything here - I guess that wasn't the point.For a dystopian novel, I'd highly recommend Orwell's 1984 instead.But two stars for Brave New World's prescience and the obvious smarts of its author, and that affecting scene of the conditioning of the Delta babies (poor things!).Lastly, I am surprised this is required reading for many English classes - it could really turn off students to dystopian literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"You just gotta read it","review":"I couldn't stand 1984, though I'm going to make myself read it again anyway just to see how much better Brave New World really is...but so far I'm saying its a must read book."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing book","review":"One of my favorite books to read, I recommend every single person in America to read this fantastic novel.Crazy how we have been heading in this direction for a while :/I want to read more by Huxley"},{"rating":"2","title":"Indescribable!","review":"Brave New World is the most unusual novel that I have ever read. As one who has been a reader for a very long time, this was by far the most odd, slightly scary honestly in its intelligence and it is completely AWEsome. I've read all types of novels- from older to the more modern, and Aldous Huxley (though so far this is the only novel by him that I've read) is easily the best author. His writing- though with beautiful, high vocabulary and complex sentences- is easy to understand. The novel is simply beautiful in the way that it makes you look inside your society and yourself and showers a variety of different views on you without making it seem overwhelming. I had to read this book for school and I don't think my school could have chosen a better required reading novel. It spans many ages probably around 13+ and I totally recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Interesting Read","review":"The first time I ever read Brave New World, I thought it was quite a confusing book. I couldn't understand the structure of the society described and why the characters did the things they did. Now that I am older, I have a much better understanding of what was being described in the novel. The importance of individualism and being naturally human is implied in the story. John the Savage may be the perfect example of how real humans would react to such a negative society as described in the book. Aldous Huxley was a genius in his ability to incorporate such philosophical arguments into a story that people of all ages could enjoy.Zachary B.

Aldous Huxley definitely got aquainted with mescaline or \\"mescal\\" while he was writing this book. The setting for this story is in a way even scarier than that of Orwell's 1984. In BNW's society there is no war,poverty,or sadness, the entire population is basically sedated by wonderdrug \\"soma\\".I don't want to say much because this book is definitely worth reading and figuring out for yourself, although it may be very difficult at times.This is a great book, it is the first of Huxley's works that I have read, but I am planning on reading \\"Island\\" real soon.

I think the message of the story goes back to what Freud said (from what I understand by reading Civilization and its Discontents, although I'm no expert): humans are the enemy of society and civilization. The fututristic government portrayed in the book recognizes this and seeks to end this threat by killing all instict and individuality. It's pretty interesting and I liked it a lot. The end is really sad because it shows that there will always be certain people who cannot fit in to society and will always be different, and therefore ostracized."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Troubling Tale of Future Civilization","review":"Aldous Huxley's \\"Brave New World\\" frightfully ventures beyond the borders of society deep within the labyrinths of a distraught future managed through control of physiology, control of psychology, and control of society. The dystopian future portrayed in this novel is both outstanding and rather cold - with a depressing conclusion and little resolve this book is set apart from others of its kind simply by the mere fact that it acts as a \\"what if\\" in regards to our future. The real frightening prospect is the fact that some of the core elements defined within this dystopian society do not seem that farfetched from modern culture.If you like philosophically betraying reads centered in the possibilities of tomorrow I highly recommend this outstanding book. At times I found the text somewhat dry but the message and suppositions it presented were well worth the hardships in this fantastic science fiction novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Sci-Fi","review":"I very much enjoy earlier science fiction -- E.E. Doc Smith, for instance -- and \\"Brave New World\\" (1932) was not an exception. It's an interesting book raising some searching questions about our own society through the vision of a utopian/dystopian future. Whether you see it as a utopia or dystopia depends on what you value in life, the risks you are prepared to take and how you feel society can be bettered. Personally, I saw the main society portrayed as mostly suppressive. All over a very good read and recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Rating 4/5 due to the writing style being somewhat difficult to grasp at times.

As great of an author as Aldous Huxley is.....he bogged this book down with every word in the english language. I'm no scholar or human encyclopedia, but I'm far from a moron. After learning the reasoning behind Jim Morrison's band name selection, \\"The Doors\\", I found myself researching Aldous Huxley's \\"The Doors of Perception.\\" This was put into action because Jim Morrison was all about experimental drug usage and his decisions in life and poetry selections were due in part to many of his readings from Aldous Huxley's books.

It gives a great bit of the author's insight and fears of what the future may hold. I believe it portrays an excellent example of the fear that author had in mind about how certain individuals/organizations can (and may be currently using to) control the masses, by the use of drugs, religion and the chemical alteration of it's citizens. Then an outsider comes into this society, rocks the boat and becomes a celebrity of sorts. But your interpretation may be different. The controlling is a much different matter in the book where instead in this reveiw it sounds crazy, but it all fits. I really liked it, and you might too.

Let your urges go free.

It helped me understand many things about life, love, family... and appreciate much more my life and everything around me but most of all, this book taught me how important is every \\"single\\" person in the world and that everyone is different and not best or worse for that... it's just the most wonderful taught about life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly mediocre","review":"Having heard mostly good things about the book - I gave it a shot. The story line was confusing, none of the characters were terribly interesting and the whole plot was rather random, if I do say.To be honest I read the book about a year and I remember little - it was that forgettable. I do remember at the time wondering if it would ever just end - I did finish the book (I never just put down a book because I always tend to get invested just enough to wonder if the good part is coming soon). I do remember the letdown of nothing interesting or insightful ever coming.While I've certainly read worse, unfortunately, I cannot recommend the book to others. I'm not saying it's a bad book -certainly many other readers and reviewers have enjoyed this book much more than I have. It just goes to show the varying degrees of human interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for weak swimmers","review":"The beginning is like swimming up current; the reader has to kind of force his/her way into the story, which is made hard by the boring torrents of Huxley's writing style and I often found myself wishing I'd be lodged under a rock to drown in the river that is this book, to just die there and be free from the thoughts that spill into these pages. But, I make it a point to always finish a book, and surprisingly, at times I found myself captivated in the story. The first few chapters make this book hard to get into, but, on the bright side, it picks up a little and there are some beautifully written descriptions that erase my regret for ever picking up this book. However, if you are impatient or easily bored, you won't make it far. If you want a story that'll captivate you from the first page, don't even bother with this book.

Having read it a second time, I have even more respect for the work and marvel at the predictions that Huxley made. While he certainly was poking fun at society with most of his predictions, the more fearful ones certainly leave one somewhat unsettled. One must ask how close we have come to his Utopian society in our modern age. The intrusions of the press as it strives to give us the real story might be the most frightening parallel between the book and our society. For all the moments when the book scares us, makes us laugh or forces us to ponder our fate, it is a real masterpiece. Even more so when one considers it was written seventy years ago.

I thought it was a scary thought to think of this as \\"the future\\", and it made me think. Also I thought it was really wierd that Huxley wrote this story in the thirties. Sometimes this made the book of the 'future' humerous, but sometimes it was scary, because somethings are even starting to come true. Overall I thought it was a good book and I would recommend it to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book Ever","review":"Huxley provides a gloom view on utopia. Absolutely marvelous. Truely makes you consider why everything is the way it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disillusioned","review":"I love the book. One thing to remember when reading this book is; it was written in 1932. That makes it scary. I am not giving it five stars because it loses its appeal after each time I re-read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepy Brilliance","review":"The concept is startling at least, horrifying more accurately put. No matter what he was under the influence of while writing this book, Aldus Huxley poses a fascinating scenario of a new world with new rules. Find yourself absorbed in this alternate world order and re-examine how things are, how they could be, and perhaps how you think they should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"A challenging but Interesting Book","review":"Brave New World is a very interesting book that draws you in. This book makes you think about a different world other than the world we live in today and how people think differently as a result. The author uses different points of view and changes from character to character to make the reading interesting.I feel that the only weakness in this book is the level of explanation or depth. They throw you right into the story without much explanation or background. This gives the book an appealing aspect but also makes it confusing to read.If you are planning on reading this book you should know that there is some very challenging vocabulary. These words would make it very challenging to read this book at a young age.But overall I think this is an awesome book if you are in the mood for a dystopian adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brave New World CD","review":"My son is in High School. This is a required reading book for honors English. He suffers from Dyslexia so he is allowed to listen to the books. Having classics like Brave New World available on CD help him to be able to complete assignments. This CD is read by Michael York. Having the familiar voice of an actor we know makes the listening easier. The story is brought to life."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor cousin to richer dystopias","review":"It might be easy to spot what aspects of our society Huxley is satirising, in his heavy-handed way, and take THEM seriously; but it's impossible to take Huxley's society seriously. He undercuts his own earnest world-building in order to get a cheap laugh. Worse, he leaves out crucial details which might give us some clue as to what's going on. That we aren't told whether or not Huxley's Brave New People are really happy, is fair enough. That we aren't even told enough to be able to deduce whether or not they are happy is inexcusable: it undercuts any possible moral Huxley may be trying to impart, and believe me, he's certainly trying to impart some moral or other. (He scarcely stops trying long enough to tell a story.) George Orwell was another left-wing British writer inspired by Yvgeny Zamyatin's \\"We\\", and his vision is vastly better - as is \\"We\\" itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindle Formatting - Mediocre","review":"This review isn't a book review (though I thoroughly enjoyed the book), but rather a comment about the Kindle's formatting:The formatting leaves a little to be desired: not always clear breaks, some typos, and a few random euro-language letter swaps for English letters; but overall very readable.

I was not only shocked by the adult content back then but also the fact that someone from so long ago could predict the future in so many ways. Now that I've started to reread it, it still surprises me. How could someone predict something like cloning?? It's not the easiest book to read. When I come across a word I've never heard of, I smile and tell myself the author was trying to prove how smart he was. But don't be put off, it is an interesting read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The World After Ford","review":"I enjoyed reading Brave New World by Aldous Huxley and watching the lives of the characters unfold from the beginning. The growth and dismantling of the characters brings you right into their world. This world Huxley created 60 years ago is very similar to today.

Everything deals with how to get as many clones as they can, sex, and artificial happiness.The beginning of the book was very slow, but then so was the whole book. I never could understand what Huxley was trying to portray with all the recreational sex and artificial happiness, which was achieved by taking a pill supplement. By writing about the future, as he characterizes it, he is telling us about how dark and disgusting the world might be in the future. Something must be wrong with him if he thinks this is how the world will turn out.I give this book 1.1 stars out of 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy, Ponderous, Boring Book","review":"I have been a voracious reader for 54 years...since I was 3 years old and I think that this is one of the WORST books that I have ever read. I only read it because it was required reading by my daughter in high school and I had never read it. I still can't figure out why the school system would want teenagers to read that indiscriminate sex and taking drugs is the preferred state of existence. I certainly don't think that they would understand that subliminal message about not rebelling against authority or you will die.Take it off the list. It will make teenagers quit reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well Written but not for me","review":"I met a friend at the library every month and we read the same book together like a small book club, so when we decided to read Brave New World I was excited because I always wanted to read this Unfortunately I was disappointed with it and I didn't enjoy this at all, and had I not made a commitment to reading the book I most likely would have not finished it.I did feel that the it was well written and I'm in awe of how much of what the author wrote in the early 1930s as fiction has become fact in the present. What I didn't like about the book was the use of drugs and how drug use was considered normal and how children was encouraged to play sexual games. My only complaint with the writing of this book is with the character of Bernard. I thought that he would be the character to rebel against the system but he seemed to sell out at the end.I guess science fiction isn't my genre and I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who felt the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was only good, as opposed to doubleplusgood","review":"i concur completely with the review further up that says it was a bit disappointing. i also found a bit more to be desired, because i had had it suggested to me because i had enjoyed 1984 so much. it does have lots of relevance, and it does make you think, but there is still much to be desired in the story and the characters. i was particularly upset by one thing, they introduced a character at the beginning, i dont recall his name, he was pretty much the antithesis of the main character, very strong and handsome, but he too was not content with the world they lived in. i thought that he would come up later in the book, perhaps become a prominent character, but there was no mention of him from then on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary to think.","review":"After reading this book the one thing i felt was fear. What i was afraid of im afraid i cannot totally say without spoiling the book. What i can say is this, Huxley was a literary prophet his work in Brave new world was so prophetic it scares me.

No new information is presented and no attempt is made to systematize the knowledge. The book is best characterized as a monologue, with lots of repetitions and banalities, and no adequate final summary.It is, perhaps, of some value for the complete novice on web design, to show that web design can be dealt with rationally, but then again, the chances that novice designers have to deal with large websites is extremely low.There is therefore no reason to buy this book.I give it two stars because it is well written and not incoherent. But why it was written, I don't know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book - covering all the nuts and bolts of IA","review":"Very good book that has some really good sections on IA documentation, planning navigation, and good tools for putting things to gether.

It clearly explains the need for serious information analysis before even putting the first tag on your page.

But most importantly it gave me the tools to go into my \\"web task force meeting\\" (the bane of any webmaster's existence) with the tools to get everyone on the same page. The resulting website pleased everyone and thanks to this book, allowed me to design an open-ended structure for easy growth and continued web development."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good introduction to IA of content-driven website","review":"This is a good book if you want to get into the field of information architecture. It covers some of the most important issues a information architect faces on a daily basis. Some of the techniques the book talked about will be very helpful for you in a diverse web team. However, this book mostly concentrates on static-content web site. More and more of the websites today are task-driven, and this book doesn't cover much, if any, on this topic. It might have something to do with the time that this book was released, since a couple of years ago, static sites were still the mainstream.Overall, it is a good book for a beginner.

These are people who think that IA is just something that anyone can go out there and do, whether they have internet developement experience or not. They believe that IA is not really important.After reading some of this book and taking notes, I was able to present my ideas and the book's ideas in a way that made it clear to my boss and co-workers that IA isn't something that can be skimmed over.I haven't finished the book yet but already I feel I've gained a bunch of insight and new ideas on how to work the information architecture angle of a site, and from there, work to build a better site."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's contents will be a must for my pupils","review":"I have learned a lot about what the title says.

If you are completely new to web navigation design you might benefit from this book, but the authors do not present a coherent methodology. In fact, I have found navigation design information on the web to be vastly superior to the authors' ideas. Information Architecture is an incredibly misleading title, the guts of the book deal only in mainstream navigation ideas. The authors simply summarize information that is readily available and completely avoid any innovative ideas or future directions of web site design. Bottom line, don't waste $20 on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"These guys know way more than they're letting on.","review":"This is a good primer on Information Architecture. But I get the feeling that these guys decided just to knock off after 150 pages. That was easier than contending with the knotty implications of all the conflicting structural imperatives that IAs deal with day in and day out.Given that the authors work at nothing but Information Architecture, I sincerely hope that they have a far greater depth of knowledge than this book conveys.Mostly, the message that rings through this brochure is: \\"Principle x is highly valuable sometimes, but it all depends on how it interacts with principles y and z, and you'll just have to figure out what's the most important as you go along.\\"Well, duh. Those compromises between design principles are the hard part of the job, and the authors don't provide a solid practical or theoretical framework for working through the compromise process."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I just wanted it for my library - had already read it but it's a really great book for both Web and new software paradigms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for explaining concepts","review":"Provides in depth coverage of how to organize and provide access to information for the Web. I like it because it gives you a comprehensive tour of all the major concepts, systems, and strategies used to organize information for your web site.Because it covers a lot of ground, its not necessarily a how-to guide book, but rather is more of a deep introspective of what information architecture (IA) is, as an academic discipline. In that regard, it is quite insightful and offers many good resources of how the field evolved, and where its at today, and what role it plays in the ever changing business community.If anything, as a result of reading this book, I found that I now have a deeper appreciation for what it takes to create a systems-wide approach towards the organization of information. In particular, an appreciation for what it takes to design information for users to help them find the information that they need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal book on information architecture","review":"I bought this book shortly before starting my new job as the webmaster for a division of the federal governement.

I was, however, looking for more specifically technical information, along the lines of algorithms and integration techniques.

Again, if IA is your whole intention, then this is a great resource, but if you're looking for technical detail, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"An ok overview of the topic, with very little useful info","review":"Although this book does provide a nice overview of the field of IA, it provided me with very little useful information in regards to advanced IA techniques and practices. The few bits of useful information that I found we're sandwiched between pages upon pages of common sense, no-brainer techniques.If your a beginner in the fields, or an outsider hoping to learn about IA, perhaps you might benefit from this book.

Despite a fantastic and thorough beginning, the book really falls short in the end when it tries to cover the years 1952-1996 in only 35 pages. The second half of Gene's life deserves at least as much time as the first half! It's like there needs to be a second volume, but this one was going to press. More info was needed on Gene's relationships with his family, especially after the emphasis on his love of family in his early life. It was apparent that the author was unable to speak to Gene's surviving family members in writing this book. Despite that, the author did a good job with the sources he did use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shamefully shoddy......","review":"I have my own personal barometer to indicate whether or not a book is second-rate (or worse). I start counting the typos, and when I hit \\"five,\\" I officially distrust the author/editors. I hit five by the third chapter and knew I was in for a bumpy ride. This author should have concentrated on spell-checking and fact-checking, rather than obsessing with his thinly veiled,homophobic assertions (as mentioned by another reader, his repeated reference to \\"Leo McCrary\\" nearly made me hurl the book across the room!). This really was a maddening read, and it is hardly the biography that the great Gene Kelly deserves.

I did not know they were there and so what I got from this book was this fantastically gifted man and the passions of his life. This compact life is really full of drama. The monologues, debated in other comments, are based on the things Kelly expressed in other ways, as I understand it, but they weren't necessary. I was not bothered by the concise description of the many long years of fizzles and disappointments in Kelly's later life. I can recommend this book as a very enjoyable read, and quite good for young readers, but it seems clear a big, fat, long, unimpeachably correct bio would make a lot of other people happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored me in the first chapter","review":"I love Gene Kelly but I don't love this book. I don't see the point in the AFI tribute, just get to the history.

Apart from the misleading \\"thoughts\\" that Gene Kelly should have had during the AFI Awards, which is the author's invention,nearly 60 % of the describing of this Gala is wrong: Fred Astaire could not have talked to his younger wife, as she was not there. The younger lady with him was his daughter Ava! The author also let Fred Astaire's first wife die five years prior to her original death. So that was not the reason for Mr.Astaires first retirement. The list could go on forever. The book makes a nice reading, unfortunately many facts are totally wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh","review":"It might have been good when it was written, but I found the story lines uninteresting, the lead character was annoying and it isn't a very good read.

There is a splitter on the 1/4\\" jack, the idea is that you plug the cable into your guitar and then the USB plug at the other end of the LightSnake goes to your PC, stick another guitar cable into the splitter which then goes to your amp so you can hear what you are recording. The splitter didn't work on mine. Another thing a didn't like is this, why do that splitter thing at all? why not just monitor through the PC (or in my case iBook running Garageband)? Had no problem doing that with my Lexicon Omega. And here's another weird thing. I plugged in an acoustic guitar and my Mac was unable to adjust the input volume at all, odd. Then I plugged in my electric guitar and was fully able to adjust the input volume. How could my Mac decide to disable the input volume on one analog input signal, and not on another analog input signal? Makes no sense! I cannot recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Light Snake, dead on arrival.","review":"I bought Light Snake for a Christmas present for some aspiring young musicians. The text on the package indicated that the product would work with most audio-recording software. I can tell you that it doesn't. I tried everything I could dream up to make it work. I even tried to install one of the demo software packages that came with the Light Snake cord. The software wouldn't run unless I gave it my car's VIN, my driver's license, house keys and my mother's maiden name (figuratively of course -- for, um, \\"registration\\" purposes). Since that was an unacceptable solution and the product wouldn't work on anything I have at my disposal (including Cakewalk [itself an extremely glitchy product]), I had to capitulate to the 10' money-eating boa.

This turned out to be incorrect. I did get it to blink while setting the sound input to USB, but it never recognized what it was, just \\"unknown USB source\\". It did not get recognized in Garage Band either, which is why I bought it to start with. On a whim, I found a 1/8 converter, popped that on my regular guitar cord, and plugged it in the Mac. Surprise, it started working.Go figure. I'll try it a few more times before completely giving up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy.","review":"This thing is crap.

It works with my PC recorder and my Sony software but they are limited environments to do multi track recording in. I wanted it to work with Cakewalk but it doesn't see the cable.

I've heard many people just give up on this product without actually getting it to work in the first place. Yes it's true that the company who makes the lightsnake cable declares it as plug and play but that doesn't mean you can pop open any program. With that being said I have gotten this product to work on Mac OSX10, Vista, and XP. Furthermore I have also gotten this cable to record using Adobe Audition, Sony Acid pro 6 and GarageBand. The trick to making this work on XP/Vista is a driver called ASIO4All which will then let you select the usb cable as an input. Use google to answer your questions before giving a bad review.

Mihaly, is a character that many can relate too! We all want to discover who we really are at some point or another. This book kept me reading till the very end. I turly enjoyed it, and I would recommend it to all who want to lose themselves in a good book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"The Traveler I must say was a great work. I really liked the way the main character explained his past, it was almost like a separate book in itself. I was impressed by the vocabulary and the knowledge that was used in the descriptions and details, and how well done the profile’s of each character was drawn out. Even more so how the story had many emotions flowing, like romance, depression, friendship, hate, happiness, etc. A great story full of detail and knowledge for any reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Traveler","review":"The Traveler is Peter Hargitai's translation of Antal Szerb's novel.

The newlywed couple, Mihaly and Erzsi, comes across a separation on the day of their honeymoon when Mihaly takes the opposing train from his wife. Mihaly never seemed to overlook his childhood with his friends, Tamas and Eva, who all had an obsession with the desire of suicide. Tamas and Mihaly loved the fact that they were both Eva's victims in their childhood games. Just the idea of death was an arousing tool that filled them with extreme curiosity. Mihaly seems to continue with this infatuation of death until he is faced with a time that he is going to die and becomes terrified of it. Not only does this book deal with the thought of death eroticism, but it also deals with the idea of androgyny throughout the novel. Personally, I would highly recommend this book to anyone and rate it with five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Traveler","review":"Antal Szerb THE TRAVELER translated by Peter Hargitai is an excellent read. It is a very interesting story with an odd plot to go along with an even odder main character. Mihaly the protagonist throughout the novel is struggling to find himself. Mihaly is a character unlike any other created in other novels. He has an odd sense of contentment as he claims his highlight of his childhood was dying. Throughout the novel he is trying to find himself and he finally grasps the point of his life when dying is no more than a phase of life you go through instead of something that sends you to ecstasy.

The author uses a lot of detail throughout the story, which allows the reader to create mental pictures of what's going on.

Mihaly, I thought through the beginning of the book was confused about his sexuality as he says he has feelings for his best friend Tamas. But as I was intrigued by this love story I find it's more of a self dicovery. Him and his wife get seperated by getting on two different trains, but it seems to Mihaly that it was maybe more of a favor to him. Being obsessed with his passed he goes on a journey to find something like it or to discover who he really is. Peter Hargitai translated this book in a way that you could feel and see what Antal Szerb did. He makes you feel as if you were there."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book we can all relate to","review":"The Traveler is one book that everyone can relate to, especially in one of those moments when you just want to be alone.

He goes on a journey on his own to find himself, and heals the many problems he has and is going through. This book kept my attention from beginning to end.

Throughout his adolescence, Mihaly is confused about his infatuation with his best friend, Tamas, and homosexuality comes into question along with death and a second birth.During his stay in Ravenna, he is found by an old friend, Janos Szepetneki. This unexpected run in with Janos somewhat inspires him to leave his wife, unintentionally, and goes on a journey where he runs into old friends and manages to transform his psyche.

But for long time fans and newcomers alike, this is essential XTC. You get classic XTC pop brilliance with the first few tracks, mixed with the beautiful oddity of songs like \\"Crocodile,\\" \\"That Wave,\\" \\"Then She Appeared,\\" and \\"Ugly Underneath.\\" And then there are the wonderful ballads like \\"Wrapped in Grey\\" and \\"Books are Burning.\\" In case you care, my personal favorites are \\"Ugly Underneath\\" and \\"Wrapped in Grey.\\" There are a couple of weak tracks here too, notably Colin Moulding's epically repetitive and sucktastic \\"War Dance,\\" but the length and strength of the rest of the album make up for it. If you do get this, and you probably should, you will be listening to it for a very long time, especially if you have enjoyed anything else that XTC has ever done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and often preachy","review":"There are 3 songs on this album that I ever listen to anymore: \\"Peter Pumpkinhead,\\" \\"Dear Madame Barnum,\\" and \\"My Bird Perfroms.\\" The rest of the songs leave me cold. Lyrically, I found the album heavyhanded and preachy, even in \\"Peter Pumpkinhead,\\" which is saved by the fact that it rocks a little bit. I read in an interview one of the members saying that he was most proud of \\"The Smartest Monkeys\\" because it was one of the \\"most subtle\\" songs to date. I just laughed and laughed. \\"Smartest Monkeys\\" is the most heavy handed sermon I've heard in a long while.If your favorite XTC songs are along the lines of \\"Senses Working Overtime,\\" \\"Earn Enough For Us,\\" or \\"Mayor of Simpleton,\\" then you'll be disappointed. If you really enjoy nodding your head and saying \\"yes!\\" as XTC points out that there is greed and suffering in the world because of all those OTHER people, then you'll think this is a fine CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"So good it hurts!","review":"One of the many things I don't understand is why XTC are not recognised as one of the greatest bands the UK ever produced. Funny how even people who agree about a record's excellence can still have wildly differing views about the songs on it, though. Many reviewers here seem to particularly like \\"The Disappointed\\" and \\"Then she appeared\\" which are the two tracks I could do without (especially the former - a real clunker which put me in mind of the Bay City Rollers), whereas I really like \\"The Smartest Monkeys\\", partly for Colin Mouldings exceptionally intelligent bass line. Speaking of Moulding, Bungalow demonstrates that he is actually a singer of quite staggering ability. I never new he had it in him quite to that extent. I'll happily add my voice to the chorus of approval for \\"Wrapped in Grey\\", though. Songs really just don't come any better. Oh, and of course there is the mighty Dave Mattacks on drums, which is never a bad thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and Disappointing","review":"Bland, bland, bland. The only XTC CD in my collection that gets less play than this one is WHITE MUSIC.This is an album that WASN'T worth the wait. The lyrical and musical playfulness that marked such outstanding efforts as ENGLISH SETTLEMENT and BLACK SEA are nowhere to be seen here.I am all for artists stretching out in different musical directions.

I was given this CD years ago by a friend, and I just dropped by to see what kind of rating it was getting here, and my eyes almost popped out the sockets... the is THE WORST cd i have ever owned. There are only about 3 songs I can listen to on this cd that don't either put me to sleep or give me a headache. \\"That Wave\\"? What the heck is that? It's definately not music. I truly believe that to like this CD you have to be on alot of drugs. I have never heard any of their other CD's, so I won't bash the band in general, but I know I never want to hear anything by this band ever again. I only wish I could have given it 0 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"The good news: If you like this kind of thing there is plenty of it","review":"Released in 1992, this is XTC's tenth album (depending on how you are counting). It was also the last XTC album for seven years. The sound quality is mediocre. It has 17 tracks and is about 62 minutes long.I liked earlier XTC work. I found this one to be lush mush. It is spineless. I don't know how people can compare this to Pet Sounds. I think people just throw out names.The 13 compositions by Andy Partridge are mostly boring and sometime cringe inducing bad smarmy pop. The 4 Colin Mouling songs have some life in them and remind me more of the earlier XTC, like Skylarking.Of course, that is just my opinion. Some people love this kind of British pop."},{"rating":"1","title":"An XTC fan, but hugely disappointed","review":"Not at all their best effort.

When so many groups seem to exhaust their creative abilities in one album, Partidge and Moulding continue to grow as songwriters, producing better melodies, arrangements and lyrics with every record.XTC started as a sort of punk band with \\"White Noise\\" but rapidly evolved into one of the best exponants of the melodic British Pop tradition that seems to have started with the Beatles and continues on through groups like 10CC, Squeeze and a few others.Nonesuch has an amazing range of styles, from the hard-rocking Peter Pumkinhead to the lyrical \\"My Bird Performs\\" and the dark \\"Rook\\". There's fiercely biting social commentary in \\"The Smartest Monkeys\\", traditional English ballad in \\"Wrapped in Grey\\" and many other delights.The more I listen to Nonesuch, the more I become absolutely enchanted with it. Certainly one my desert island albums, and maybe, just maybe the finest British Pop album ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most underappreciated album of the decade...","review":"If you love rich lyrics, challenging yet sweeping arrangements, complex and addicting melodies, then look no further to this 1992 album of XTCs last work before they went on strike. From songs of loss to social jabs XTC lose none of their thrust and power, and wrap it all in the tastiest coating imaginable in the recording arts. Marvel at the production (drum sound on Peter Pumpkinhead), tremble at the intimacy (crawl inside Rook if you dare), air guitar along (Books are Burning, Smartest Monkeys), but you will love this album. And at under $7, what the heck have you got to lose? Listen to the piss and pathos of Andy's singing and let the magical XTC lift your spirit up and fire a few shots into your soul... you won't come away the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their greatest","review":"If you like XTC and have not heard this one, get it. It inspires me in a way that only great music can. I'll never forget where I was when I first heard it. In my opinion its their most solid album overall--even better than oranges & lemons and skylarking. Yes, that good. I'm not giving it five stars because although it is remarkable, I would't call it a classic of the caliber that alters the music of its time, like Revolver or Velvet Underground or Sex Pistols, but, it is a masterpiece of the recorded pop-music art form for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly dated","review":"I probably hadn't listened to this album in at least five years, and decided to give it a listen the other day. I now realize why I always play \\"Oranges And Lemons\\" \\"Skylarking\\" and even \\"Black Sea\\" and never play this CD. The production and sound are very synth heavy, and all the previous comments about the \\"preachiness\\" of the album are very apt. The lyrics are very heavy handed, and the album really isn't much fun to listen to.I've been a huge XTC fan for many years, but the above listed albums (along with \\"English Settlement,\\" another favorite) are much, much better representations of the band than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Boring Letdown","review":"As an avid XTC fan, I was highly dissapointed with this album. The progressions and riffs lack inspiration and the lyrics are unsually weak. The dark \\"Rook\\" and ebullient \\"Omnibus\\" are the only entertaining tracks. Oddly \\"Peter Punkinhead\\", I believe, was the single of this album- a heavy handed, predictible tune.

Each was amazing and talented in his own right, but together they created magic. This album captures at least some of the electricity that the blending of their two voices created when you heard them live.One night Vince was playing at the Flick alone because Fred had done one of his occasional disappearing acts. All of a sudden, as Vince began a song up on stage, Fred's voice filled the small club and meshed with Vince's, causing all of us who knew and appreciated them to catch our breath and hold onto the moment. A little of that is on this disc. Not as much as I would like, but enough to remember the time and the two talents that make this album so special."},{"rating":"2","title":"Someone PLEASE rate this, so, I can buy it without sweating it!","review":"Granted, These are cultured pearls instead of their most expensive cousin \\"sea pearls\\".

Dream Master is a great piece of horror film-making, one of Renny Harlin's first films, which he would follow with Die Hard 2, Cliffhanger and Deep Blue Sea. It isn't my favourite in the series, that award goes to New Nightmare which found Craven in Scream Territory. The disc has a fantastic video transfer (It's never looked so good on home video) and a booming Dolby Digital 5.1 remix. But for the die hard Nightmare aficionados, the remastered Stereo Soundtrack is also included to recreate the way it sounded during it's theatrical run. I give the disc high marks for it's Video and Audio. After all, if your reading this review you've more than likely already seen the film, and it's the opinion of humble buyers like myself that matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"2nd worst of the series","review":"Besides A nightmare on Elm Street 2 freddy's Revenge this is the worst of the series.

This is a dark comedy and has some interesting imagery in the style of labrynth but not much.The scene where the girl gets turned into a roach was disgusting and very creative. There is a scene where one of the guys gets turned into a part of a pizza and then he gets eaten by Freddy, that was funny.This movie has no plot and has some lame scenes like when one of the kids turns into a karate kid and tries to fight off Freddy (yawn that was boring).There is not too much violence and gore in this one. The limited amount of gore in this movie is cheesy.Also I like how Freddy has funny one liners. I thought Freddy's Dead was a bit more interesting and wild than this one.

Next to # 3 this the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"You could easily fall asleep hrough this.","review":"This is the last Nightmare On Elm Street film I'd show to a hater of the series to try and convert them. It's filled with everything the critics hate about Freddy films. For a start the special effects seem to have been deemed more important than any kind of decent script. Freddy is no more than a wise-cracking clown, the sets are garish and any suspence is swiftly killed off by painful over-acting. The ending is very good special-effects-wise, but plot-wise it's the feeblest (anti)climax I've ever seen in a horror film. The heroine shows Freddy has reflction! What is he, Medusa the Gorgan? Freddy had actually already seen his reflection in this film in some shining barbells, so the whole scene just falls flat on its face. If you're a fan of Freddy films then there's a few memorable moments, but this is more of a teen idol film than a horror film, the series producers obviously milking every last drop from the Freddy character."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of The Best Nightmares","review":"By this, the fourth outing for Freddy, the feel of the Elm Street series has changed substantially. What it lacks in the suspense that Wes Craven gave us in the first film, it makes up for in energy and black humour. Though this movie has a quality to it that is more surreal than scary, it still ranks as one of the better of the seven, with a strong performance by its lead female, Lisa Wilcox. Well worth checking out if you liked the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best one of the whole series!!","review":"I really think that this movie is so strong i can watch it the whole day and i don't get tired of watching it.It's a very good movie , for me is the best of the series because is developes strong characters that fight against freddy krueger in a strongly way , i recommend it 100% good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Freddy''s Funniest Film","review":"This doesn't have the well-known cast of the previous Nightmare 3 movie but the special effects are still good.....each very different and some of them very funny. They make this perhaps the most entertaining entry in the series.I mean, where else can you see terrfied faces on pepperoni slices (on a pizza)?!The storyline, however, features its usual dumb and ridiculous theology and has its usual share of unlikable obnoxious teens. Their parents weren't pictured as any better, perhaps worse.In fact, the kids and parents are so bad you wind up rooting for Freddy to do them in.Perhaps that's the idea!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspired and uninspiring.","review":"A lot of people like this. I can't quite understand why. The makers of this film admitted that all they did was film a lot of special-effects sequences and then find any old excuse to cobble them together. It's a shame that Wes Craven's original idea for this film, involving time-travel in dreams, wasn't used. Instead all we get is special-effects and nothing else, just some tosh about Kristen (quite obviously played by a different actress, her character also completely different) giving her dream powers to somebody.Unmemorable sequel, Freddy now about as scary as a court jester. There's an excellent soundtrack, but it's completely wasted on this dross."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not exactly good...but definitely enjoyable!","review":"While NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 4 is by no means a good movie (it does not compare to one, three or seven in terms of writing, etc.), it is enormously entertaining. It is also total eye-candy. The special effects and sets are awesome, and the dream sequences are more surreal than in previous NIGHTMARE flicks.I know it's bad, but I can watch it over and over again, unlike 5 and 6 where I could barely get through the first viewings."},{"rating":"2","title":"good movie","review":"this movie is a great movie, another very well done movie. well acted movie, very good story line but doesn't have the scaring ability as 3 and 1 had."},{"rating":"2","title":"nightmare 4","review":"This is great movie from the Nightmare Elm street series.

There are plenty of moments that should make you 'jump'. There are also moments where you'll chuckle. This is where Freddy started getting comedic. I don't know about you, but I would personally like to be comedically entertained before being brutally murdered.

The first Nightmare on Elm Street was good. That's what got my hopes up. I finally see it and it's almost as bad as The Perfect Score. I think that the incredible horror of Freddy Kruger got lost in cheesy special effects by this movie. The Freddy that made me afraid to sleep would have never turned a girl into a cocroach. Freddy might as well have just thrown away his glove after part 2. All of the above made it stupid. This is why it wasn't scary. It had no dunts. For those of you out of the know, I'll give you a dictionary definition of a dunt.Dunt-dunt-A moment in horror movies where a scary image showing up very suddenly,such as a killer jumping out from behind the door and catch you off guard.

To have the series end with DREAM WARRIORS would have been a perfectly fitting way to finish the story. (After all, didn't Freddy's mother, Amanda, say that the way to put him to rest was by giving him a proper burial?) Instead, Freddy returns, this time revived by dog piss, and kills off the last three elm street kids whom Nancy Thompson sacraficed herself to protect, and who had fought so hard to save each other in the last film. The lesson seems to be that you will really defeat evil. You may succed in slowing it down, but it will always return and get you in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master","review":"This Nightmare on Elm Street is by far the worse thus far in the series.

It might have been interesting then. Instead she's just the main character who gets to survive until the ending.Freddy comes back, kills off the survivors from the third movie and then moves on to the rest of them. From then it's all the same. A character fights off sleep, goes to sleep. Freddy shows up, says a few one liners and the character dies. A few of the characters try to fight, but they are pretty vacant and the \\"I don't believe in you\\" tactic no longer works like it did in the first one. Eventually Freddy gets put back into the hereafter and somehow we are supposed to cheer on the redhead who puts him there, or something like that.The only reason I give it two stars is that it has some cute lines and if you watch it like a dark comedy it's not so bad, but it really shows the rut into which the series fell."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Movie is a nightmare!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is a terrible Movie, I mean, they never Thought about the deaths.

As always, a couple of good killings, but also quite number of hopeless ones.

There are several thousand flashy special effects as a result of the heroine Alice doing no more than showing Freddy his reflection (he'd actually seen his reflection in this film already in some shiny barbells). The camera-work and special effects are all very show-offy, but they fail to hide the weakest plot ever to (dis)grace a N on ES film and a complete lack of scaryness or suspence. Freddy is now no more than a wise-cracking comic-book villain and most of his victims just come across as unsympathetic and often over-the-top."},{"rating":"1","title":"NIGHTMARE...I DON'T THINK SO!","review":"O.k so Nightmare 3 was good but when 4 came along I was not suprised when I was not intrigued. It was o.k. I think it gets a bit stupid when they keep pulling each other into their dreams. It is neither scary or as original as the others.

This is one thing in the series that is really good- it doesn't get boring. I was entertained in seeing the new things that were brought into this new addition to the NOES series. I love the fact that I will always see something new and i won't be yawning in it.It is about a girl who can bring people into her dreams, sometimes putting them in danger, sometimes wanting them to get her out of danger. It was fun to see her do this. She is scared of Freddy, and that brings him back into the dreams to kill once again.

Most train videos only explain the basics - whistle, steam, coal etc.. but this video talks about all kinds of cool train parts that most videos never show. I love how they even show how they clean the inside of city buses with large vacuums that attach to the front door and suck everything out.

You have the word shown on the left side of the screen, a picture in the upper corner and the person signing on the right side of the screen so you have to look on the left for the word/words or in the upper left corner for the picture while the person is signing on the right side of the screen. Sometimes you may not catch all the sign because you are reading the word and/or words, or the word is signed to fast. The sign is only made once and if you don't catch it the first time you will have to replay. You will need to have some experience under your belt before using this video. I do not recommend it for beginners. Also, there is no spoken sound on this video(only music)so you cannot rely on hearing a word, you have to be able to read or look at the picture. You must also know the alphabet in sign languare because some of the words or pictures are simple spelled out.

Abrams was the UN's urban trouble-shooter. If there was an outcry about slums, squalor and squatting in Zamistan, or anywhere, Charlie was hired to write a report. He found that the problems were caused by corrupt officials. Those officials lived the good life in New York as UN delegates, who ordered the Secretary General to make sure Abrams' report was never read, especially by journalists. wonks or students. Charlie was a liberal academic who realized the world wanted reports about problems, not solutions. He had a large team, and he owned the urban trouble-shooting profession. World-wide. When California Goveror Pat Brown decided that housing problems in California needed looking-into he hired Chalie Abrams of New York - who else? Actually, the job was farmed out.

There is a bit of good information here, but it is overshadowed by the choppy editing job and the writer's less than satisfactory grasp of the English language. The film goes off on many short tangents as well that add nothing to the story, a whole lot of speculation is presented as absolute fact, and quite a bit of information that is used is just flat out wrong.

Once you have a new major-mode, it's pretty easy to figure out how it works, by pressing C-h b or C-h m. This book is about the easy stuff; it covers a lot of major- and minor modes. However, it hardly tells you anything at all about the way Emacs is structured and configured. And that is one of the hardest things to figure out when you're starting to use Emacs. (I know by experience, I had to go through quite some pain before I was able to work with it properly.)So if you want more verbose explanations of major Emacs modes, this is the book you want.

They were very disappointed with this fake-looking, slow and poorly-acted attempt that fails miserably to recreate the magic of the original Our Gang. The characters are mismatched too! What made the original work was that many of what was done was impromptu with the kids acting at being themselves. In this movie, the kids are trying to copy other people working from a script and it just doesn't work.Try to find the originals on video if you can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little Rascals DVD","review":"Great movie, we used to have this on VHS but it got lost so we decided to buy it on DVD.

I don't remember the origional show being like that. If you are a mom that wants your kid to grow up a nice young man then do not get this movie.

Most actors in this movie are very unknown, the only one I recognized was Blake McIver Ewing, who was in some other movies like one of the \\"Problem Child\\" movies, and had occassional roles as Derek in the hit sit-com \\"Full House\\". But the most fun in this movie were the many many cameos. There were very small roles for big stars as Mell Brooks (\\"Spaceballs\\"), Mary-Kate & Ashley Olsen (\\"Full House\\"), Whoopi Goldberg (\\"Sister act\\") and many others."},{"rating":"1","title":"O-Tay? No Way!","review":"This is one of those projects that was doomed to failure at the very beginning. The children who were cast for this film were obviously picked for their looks only, as none of them displays any trace of talent, as evidenced by their lifeless delivery of lines. The script seems to have been patched together from bits and pieces of the old gags, with some dreadfully unfunny new lines added. The direction is also terribly inept; it is quite obvious that Ms. Spheeris has no idea what she is doing. It is very sad to see a legendary comedy series thus desecrated. Those persons responsible for producing this disaster should be ashamed of themselves; this film is nothing less than a travesty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!!!","review":"dvd was scratched and dirty.

Wise man, that Spanky. While this is not bad for children or adults, why not just buy the originals instead? Basically all they've done here was take several of the original films, such as \\"Mail and Female\\" and \\"Rushin' Ballet\\", and string them together as a movie. Another problem I had was the clash of time periods - the characters dress like the originals and engage in the same types of activities, yet the film obviously takes place in the 1990's. Children simply don't build go-carts or wear bowties anymore. Why not just fully update the gang into the 1990's or make this a period piece instead? At best, this is a colorful, cute and lively romp, but nothing more."},{"rating":"2","title":"waaaaah! half a scene missing","review":"i loved this movie. it was so funny and cute. but sadly there is a courtroom scene with alfalfa that has been cut in half. it's too bad, it was hilarious as it was. i was really looking forward to seeing that scene again. i miss it. if that's the way it is, i wonder what other scenes have been altered. but it's funny from start to finish. buy with confidence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny movie","review":"For a remake of a classic series, this movie was actually pretty entertaining. You have an all-new cast of actors of course, but I think they did a fine job in this movie. One of the main plot points is that they want to build a clubhouse, but they need money for building supplies, which lead to shenanigans from the gang. I've never seen an original episode of the Little Rascals, so I have no idea how this holds up to the original, but I found it funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet, Innocent Fun For All Ages","review":"This was a very cute movie! The story of the rascals, Spanky, Alfalfa, and the rest of the gang are members of the He-Man Woman Hater's Club. Alfalfa threatens their existence when he falls for Darla.

How will it end? Very cute and funny. Well acted too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as the original, but great nonetheless","review":"This remake of the classic Little Rascals leaves something to be desired. How could it not? The original Little Rascals provided some of the most entertaining moments ever filmed. There is no way this one would be able to live up to the original. That having been said, this movie was very good. It is a great family movie, with many reworked classic moments (like the He-Man Woman Haters Club) as well as some new material. The casting for this movie was great, and the celebrity cameos add to the fun. It is hard to find a good, enjoyable family movie, but the new Little Rascals certainly deserves a place amongst family favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"BURN THIS FILM!","review":"This movie is horrible.

Isn't Darla just the luckiest girl in the world? Alfalfa faces some competition though in this film from a refined young man who has googly eyes for Darla. It's unfortunate that the clubhouse of the He-man Woman Hater's Club gets caught in the flames of love and burns down. (It helps to know the number for 911 in case of emergency.)The romantical Alfalfa is torn between his pals and Darla. His best friend Spanky doesn't make it easy on him. Acts of rivalry between Alfalfa and the refined Waldo, whose wealthy father just bought the oil refinery, continue and hits its apex in a go-kart race with a wild driving scene. After certain events, the He-man Woman Haters Club rethinks their club membership rules. There are special appearances in this movie by Mel Brooks, very young Mary-Kate and Ashley, Daryl Hannah, Lea Thompson, Whoopi Goldberg, Raven Simone, Reba McEntire and Donald Trump."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this movie!!!","review":"This movie is so good,how they try to get wood to build their new tree house, how they listen to the girl and boy talk,(you will have to watch the movie to get that), and how they they win the race with the tip of hair.it's just so funny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"not amazing but I enjoyed it","review":"i have never seen a episode of the show and don't plan on it but for whatever reason i saw this movie and thought it was a nice little movie.

Someone just getting to know the jazz bass will be hearing a lot of names listed as important bass players (and seeing their names on liner notes), and you can find a nice summary of the context and contribution of each of these guys in this book.The parts in the book about actually playing make it a good companion to a more methodical bass method book, with transcriptions of great players' solos as well as more exercise-oriented pieces developed by Goldsby to help your technique."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good instruction and background history book","review":"Having been a electric bass player for 25+ years I recently purchased an NS double bass. I bought this book to learn some jazz licks but also get a look into why various jazz double bass players use certain progressions and transitions. This book provided all of that and more. Not in tab, so it keeps my up on my sight reading. If your looking to just learn some songs, this may not be for you. But if your wanting to get into the theory of jazz bass playing this is well worth the money. The CD doesn't cover all of the licks, but provides enough to get an idea of the rhythm and progressions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good resource for music and information.","review":"I found this book to be a great resource from a historical and musical standpoint. It's a good reference material for bassists of the past and has some great practice routines, music written out in the style of many different players and lists some essential albums. This book is not intended for beginning bassists(because it doesn't just stick to 1st position) but could be beneficial to both beginning and advanced players alike . This is NOT a method book but could be considered a great resource for any bassist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, boring, boring","review":"What a boring album!

This woman should be punished for writing this book; the Multnomah Book Company should be punished for allowing this book to be published. I will NEVER support this company again and I urge you to do the same. Buy this book if you would like a fight in your relationship!

I actually listened to the entire audio book out of sheer curiosity about how dumb this author. My fiance and I had a nice laugh about how ridiculous this book is. The book focuses on having women constantly adjust themselves to meet men's needs.

She definitely covers important factors that are so obvious yet us women just fail to realize it because... it's so obvious!She explains a lot of things about the inner workings of a man's mind that I just couldn't understand.

As I began reading some of these facts, they helped me to communicate with all men better, not just my husband. Furthermore, with a better understanding and insight on how men process our words and actions is also a road map on how to raise boys. I am purchasing this book for all of my girlfriends and sisters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Colorful jacket on the book is great","review":"I read this book in like, 5 hours. Reads like a compilation of Cosmo articles. I really thought the insights into the male mind and emotional patterns would be more in depth. But it's all based on her surveys, which were a little bit elementary in my opinion. But the content is valuable.Pros about this book would be the tone that she writes in. It's all very positive, very Stand By Your Man, support him , understand him. He needs respect, He needs to be the provider, He needs sex and he needs you to stay in shape and look good for him.Better than the latest, greatest manuals on \\"how to catch a man.\\" For two reasons, one, is that spirituality is an important third party in relationships, which she points to often. And, that the book is geared towards married women and women in relationships and upholds men as partners, full of tenderness and feeling, as opposed to gamers or predators."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"Shaunti Feldhahn is a good author.

No, thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous book","review":"This book is dangerous for your marriage. It will cause women to be suspicious of their husbands based on some of the inof in the book, that is not true of all and maybe not even most men.

These statements will lead women to think their husbands are perverted and not thinking about them. DO NOT RECOMMEND."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Refreshing Book","review":"I read this book with other women and watched the video that the author put together.

Although people are individuals and therefore I tend to shy away from books like this, a friend recommended it so I read it. I still think that people are individuals, but in general I think this author has captured many truths about men. It was interesting to read and filled willed with information. I think most women will enjoy this book and many will find it enlightening. Other really good, must reads for women are Smart Women Finish Rich by David Bach and Enchanted by Nancy Madore."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a bunch of useless crap to the modern woman","review":"Unfortunately, this book is only going to help you if you're a fat nagging religious close minded wife who's let herself go.For the modern woman with common sense (and who doesn't have her man beg her for sex, for instance) this book is completely useless. I can think of a few women who'd benefit from it (church ladies?), but most of the things on this book are common sense to a well educated wordly woman. I also found Shaunti Feldhahn's way of writing very anoying...at the beggining of the book, it feels like she goes on and on about respect forever. I get it, respect the man, there's no need to say it 30 times with different words.It was definitly a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Swear I'm Going To Get Sick","review":"Every evangelical Christian book I've read about relationships/men and women keeps harping on the same oldsterotypes.The sterotypes are as follows:men want respect,women want lovemen are visual,women are emotionalmen hide their feelings,women express every feelingmen care about the appearance of their spouse,women care aboutbeing provided forI don't know what kind of men she interviewed but she must haveinterviewed men too dense to realize they were acting outsocial constraits believing they are \\"hardwired\\".What bothersme the most is the chapter where she says men can't help looking at a pretty body.Hello!! Women look at men's bodies too!I don't believe these right winged fools will ever write adecent book about relationships,since they want to keep peoplein endless circles of status quo thinking to suit their ownpurposes.I'm glad I'm a different relgion now.Too many Christians are caught up in sterotypical thinking and it hurtsrelationships."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"Leaning what my husband really thinking opened up new world, and started falling love again."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Women Only","review":"Fabulous book!

As a non-Christian and a non-religious person, this solutions seems like a cop-out to me. I wanted a guide to not only better understand the amazing person I am with, but more importantly to get some guidance on how to deal with man vs. woman issues, which this book does not offer for non-Christains. So if you are like me, I suggest finding something that does not provide only faith based answers.Good luck and happy reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book gives good information, yet it uses information from other books and articles","review":"I read this book and noticed that a lot of the information concerning men came from another book that I had just read titled Love and Respect by Dr. Emerson Eggerichs. Shaunti Feldham even refers to Emerson Eggerichs by name and uses words directly from his book and his website. Why write a book and have half of your book have quotes from another author's book? Shaunti Feldham said that she did a lot of research and surveys, however most of the book seems to be other authors ideas, articles, and quotes."},{"rating":"1","title":"No new information","review":"For Women Only: What You Need to Know about the Inner Lives of Men by Shaunti Feldhahn: This book gives many honest answers from different men in various surveys asking about respect, romance, sex, career and many other various topics. Although the author includes many surveys that show what men want, it doesn't go in detail on the age group, cultural backgrounds or religious backgrounds of these men. To say that most men think a certain way based on a general survey was not very persuasive to me. Even though the topics of the books were very interesting, each chapter was very short and the author failed to go deeper in depth into things that I wanted to learn more. Overall, I didn't find this book enjoyable. I didn't learn anything new about men that I don't already know. However, it served as a reminder of things that I should be aware more on a daily basis."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Helpful Tool!","review":"Ever wanted to know your husband more?To understand where he's coming from?Then I believe this book might be for YOU!This book gives insight to women. An insight woman don't naturally have.As I read the book, I shared what I was learning with my husband. His reactions ranged from \\"I don't think I have that issue\\" to \\"You didn't know that?\\"It provided a foundation of understanding for temptations my husband faces,and feelings he doesn't know how to share. It is a generalization, of course, but what a great tool to open communication and find out where your husband is in these areas.I learned so much more about my husband by reading the book and talking with him about it. However, I wish more scripture would have been used.I defiantly would give a thumbs up for a great tool!This book was provided by Waterbrook Multnomah Puplishing. Review was solely based on my own honest opinions. I was under no obligation to offer a favorable review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent MUST read for all women","review":"This book should be given to any woman who is, will be, has been, or would like to be in a relationship with a man. It is invaluable. It is simple to read yet filled with information that could save marriage IF the reader is serious about doing their part."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book! Really helped me to understand men better!","review":"I loved this book! It gave me greater insight into men and what causes them to respond to women the way they do.

It helped me understand SO many things. I think it can make any wife a better wife, and any marriage better. Please read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read \\"The Second Sex\\" instead","review":"In regard to all of the so-called \\"hard wiring\\" of selfish impulses that Shaunti tries to pass of as unavoidable, I would like to refer to them as conditioned behaviors. Despite the inherent \\"datedness\\" of Beauvoir's work (come on, it was published in 1949!), there could be an interesting dialogue about how women choose to resign themselves to passive roles and capitulation between the two books. If you want to find a reason to play into all of the broad societal expectations about your personal appearance, your sexual boundaries, and general steps to becoming a Stepford wife, then this is your book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Comedy gold","review":"My husband and I got a good laugh out of this. So, it helped my marriage in that way. To read why it's such an awful book, give the other one star reviews a read. I wish I had before I bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book! Really eye-opening!","review":"I think this book is a must-read by any Christian married woman. It really makes you think about your man and how he thinks. I was surprised at some of the negative reviews of this book, but I will warn you that you will probably be convicted when reading this book. It has really changed the way I view some of my husbands actions and how I communicate with him. In just a few days, I'm seeing a change (a good change) in our marriage, especially with communication. I highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read for Wives who want to improve their marriage","review":"I bought this book because it truly is a book that should be read annually by wives who have a desire to improve their marriages. Obviously marriage takes a lot of hard work, so no one can just sit back and hope for the best. We need to be actively improving and changing ourselves. This book gave me the insight into how my husband thinks, so I can better meet his needs. I loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great information!","review":"None of this is new information, but she has a way of presenting it that has been really helpful to me. I'm in marragie counseling and my counselor recomended it to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"How Well Do You Listen?","review":"In any relationship, we have the ability to communicate rather than assume what the other is thinking. But that requires listening to the other person from their point of view. In the past I placed my views and opinions on others and thought that was the truth. This book provided me with another possibility. I enjoyed this work because it took a look at how men and women communicate and express themselves. The author's helped me to see other options. I can now support my partner and allow him to express himself freely. I no longer need to agree or disagree. I can just listen.There is another book that further enlightened me on the power of listening and how it supports relationships. It's called \\"How to Create a Magical Relationship\\" by Ariel and Shya Kane. I suggest reading these books, giving yourself new possibilities for a brilliant relationship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helped me understand myself.","review":"As a counselor none of the categories that Shaunti uses surprised me but she did put different words to it that were helpful. As men we do have significantly different struggles than women and she points that out well. I felt honored in this book as a man who is viewed as having a good heart and who seeks to love his wife. I think this view (which has an intentional focus and not a covering the whole spectrum focus) can lead some to feel that she isn't standing for what a woman desires in a relationship. I think she'll get to that in future books. With regards to some of the negative reviews I believe they miss out. Communication only goes so far unless one understands or is curious about some basic differences in the genders. Even with understanding it can be difficult to share accurately what truly lies at the depths of our hearts.I recommend this book to men and women and look forward to Shaunti's book on For men only about women."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money!","review":"My husband and I bought the \\"For Couples Only\\" set of \\"For Women Only\\" and \\"For Men Only\\", and I wish we'd saved the money. I can't speak for his book, but mine was a total waste. Every point made in the book made me think either one of two things: 1) REALLY?! She didn't know that?! Who doesn't know that?!; or 2) I must be the worst wife ever.On point 2), it made me feel like everything I say could potentially damage my poor hubby's fragile ego. To listen to Feldhahn talk, everything I say is something that I don't realize he takes as an insult or something I think is encouraging but he takes as being patronizing. So what, am I just not supposed to talk? (Rolls eyes)My husband and I actually have a great relationship, but this book (which we bought to strengthen it) just made me feel insecure. If you still think you MUST read this book, do yourself a favor and check it out from the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Women Only.

It highly recommend it to ALL women out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book About Understanding Men","review":"I know there are a lot of books out there on men but Shaunti is the first person to actually get her data directly from men. I've learned more about men reading this book than any other, Christian or secular! Every woman in the world should read this book regardless of your faith. This is the best education on males you will every get but be prepared; some of it will be hard to hear. However if you really want to know the truth about men and how they think and approach relationships with women then you must read this truly insightful book! I think it can save a lot of relationships and marriages!"},{"rating":"2","title":"what an eye opener!","review":"My husband gave me this book when it was first released. He was so excited that someone, especially a woman, was saying these things. I was shocked at what I didn't know about him or men. There are difficult truths here but someone needs to say them. It was a great communication tool for him to discuss things he could never say himself. I found myself saying \\"Is that really true?\\" over and over and his response was always \\"You didn't know that?\\" Since then I have given several of them out to my friends. Their experience was the same.Read this book and discuss it with your husband. He will confirm that what Shaunti writes is accurate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible advice","review":"This book advocates women being the paragon of Christian virtue in public and quite the opposite in private to appease their husbands. It also says that men cannot help but desire a beautiful/scantily clad woman that comes into his field of vision. A woman or anyone should be able to be themselves in public and private. And men and women both who are in a committed relationship should never think of another person with lust if they are in love."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to Cater to your Husband and ignore your own needs.","review":"A well-meaning friend sent this to me. Perhaps I'm a bad wife, but i couldn't help but wonder where the compromise came in.If you were to take this book as gospel, you'd have long bitten off your tongue to stop saying anything your husband could consider derrogatory or disrespectful, you'd be starving yourself (but cooking gourmet dinners for him) lest he think you weren't 'taking care of yourself', and faking orgasms every night because \\"men need sex; it's the physical equivalent of them talking to you\\".So if you want a marraige like that, I'd definitely say 'follow this book to the letter.' If you want your marriage to be all about him, then read this book and follow the directions. Or, better yet, if you want to feel guilty because despite your best efforts, you dare speak your mind and say no to sex every now and again because you're -- gasp! -- tired, or worse, BUSY! Read this book.otherwise, don't bother. It'll just make you mad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Redundant and boring","review":"The biggest issue I had with this book is the author says that men are secretly hiding insecurities and they always care about what somebody else thinks. If a man said this, I would be intrigued, because he knows what he is talking about because HE IS A MAN and he knows what's going on. Also, she's basing the whole book on survey results. She's coming to the conclusion that most men are like this or that because 70 percent of the men she polled said so. If you go on the website, you can see how the questions were answered. Honestly, I got more out of her survey results online than reading her book. I would have preferred to read a book about men from a MAN'S perspective"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have no respect for yourself as a woman, you'll love this book","review":"This book was not only an insult to my intelligence, but also an assault on my education in psychology.

While some of the information were things that I had figured out after having been married for almost 12 years, others were so totally eye opening I had to go talk to my husband and ask if it were really true! The information in this book has totally changed the way I interact with my husband - I truly wish this information was taught to me as a teenager - It would have saved so much confusion and heartache! If you are a woman in relationship with a man, or wanting to be in relationship with a man, read this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for husbands, but fathers, brothers, etc.","review":"This is a must-have book for any woman who wants to better understand the men in her life (and what woman doesn't??). Although its focus is on marriage, the ideas apply to not just husbands, but fathers, brothers, etc. (And I'm quite sure what I learned from this book came into play when I wrote Last Chance Rescue, which has a male lead character.) I didn't feel it was advocating a \\"subservient\\" role to the wife. And I'm pretty touchy about that kind of thing! - Tracey Cramer-Kelly, author, Last Chance Rescue"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish I read this 25 years ago!","review":"This simple, easy read is fabulous for getting women to see things from the man's perspective. When my husband and I were first married we figured that we were basically the same and so we put ourselves in the other person's shoes in order to make decisions about how to behave and what to say. This eye opening book shows that you really can't just put yourself in the other person's shoes because the other person is fundamentally different! Great book. Read this before you get married or when you are first married! Don't wait for your silver anniversary to read it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A transformative book","review":"Shaunti Feldman's well-researched book has transformed in my relationships with the men in my life. Previously, I had no idea that the word respect was key in communicating love to them. When I used the word to tell my brother what I considered his greatest contribution to the family, he warmed up enormously, and he still initiates hugs weeks later. For my significant other, I grew longer hair, although it's more labor intensive, because I now realize that my appearance reflects on him among his male friends.

I find that my husband and I are both human beings and tend to have similar needs and wants, and if not, well, we have imaginations too. Oh, and mouths and human speech.Feldman suggests that men and women are vastly different from each other and have a different need for respect or love (age old \\"men want respect, women want love\\"). The revelation that \\"men will choose to be respected without being loved over being loved without being respected\\" is blighted by the false dichotomy, ludicrous and offensive to people everywhere.

While some of the topics are harder than others (and for each woman different sections will be harder to read), I really think she did a fabulous job presenting the information she found.

The book promised fun problems that would not take long to complete.The problems in the book were essentially the same type of exercises as my son had been assigned in school over the prior two years, by which he had been bored. They were neither particularly interesting nor conceptually challenging. My son read a few and had no interest in doing them. I looked through the book to find two somewhat conceptually interesting exercises (which I still did not find all that interesting) and told my son he should do those. He did them within 30 seconds. That the was the last time he looked at the book.In short the book did not help maintain my son's interest in math over the summer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This is a great book for those getting married again.

A bit more technical than most of the sequels."},{"rating":"2","title":"At last, Ive seen it!","review":"Ignore my previous review because now I have actually seen this installment. Why do people not like this one? It was better than part 4 and Freddy has a much darker/sinister look about him. It has superb f/x and a gothic style setting.

And it's true that there are some great Freddy Krueger sequences and imaginative setes (although the final showdown has echoes of Labarynth with its anti-gravity staircases). But really this is no more than 'another Freddy film'. Its dark and sinister atmosphere mean it's better than the dreadful Part 4, and the idea of an unborn baby's dreams being invaded is a novel twist, but things are generally rather aimless. The heroine doesn't stand out from the thousands of others in films of this type. She certainly lost a lot of my sympathy when she started stamping on those tarantulas. I'd like to think that no real spiders were harmed during the making of this film. To sum up, if you're a special effects fan then go and see this.

It is here where the series begins to try to dish up more details on Freddy's past to add to the story; but hardly anything can save this dismal installment. Freddy's one liners are stupid and aren't funny one bit, the acting is simply horrid (Robert Englund just looks more bored in his role than ever before), and the film as a whole isn't scary one bit. The few saving graces of The Dream Child are Hopkins' stylish direction and some nice kills and gore effects, but for the most part this entry is just plain dull."},{"rating":"2","title":"SON-OF-A-KRUEGER!","review":"One of the BEST I've seen in the 'Nightmare' series would have to be this fifth installment, \\"A Nightmare On Elm Street 5: The Dream Child\\". Sure it's quite possibly the weakest of the bunch due to that it lacks even more horror and suspense than the fourth did. However, the improved special effects and the disturbing visuals make up for it. Alice (of NOES 4) returns once again to battle the evil monster, Freddy Krueger after discovering what may become of her unborn child. After her boyfriend, Danny dies, Alice (with the help of her friends) tries to solve the mystery to how Freddy is killing them all off one by one even when she is not asleep to pull them in! I'd have to say that the jokes and humor may be a little weak in this one, but it somehow proves to be a worthy sequel next to 'The Dream Master'. Filled with spectacular performances, imagination, and spellbound revelations, NOES 5 is sure to attract even the most hardcore Freddy fan! CHECK IT OUT!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"poor","review":"A Nightmare on Elm Street 5 reeks of a bad script. Don't even bother with this film.

There is ver little fight back and action. The victins deaths are corney and stupid. There are some cheezy lines like don;t sleep and drive.

The return of Amada Kruker freedys mother Last seen in Nigmare on Elm Street three Dream Warriors. My Recomendations see 1-4 four and Freddys dead and Freedy versus Jason.

Freddy is invading the dreams of the unborn child of Lisa Wilcox. It maybe sounds interesting but it isn't. That's cause the thin script has enough in it to make a shortfilm but not a feature. There is no story, just a lot of special effects. But the special effects are good so I give this 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"ITS A BOY!","review":"Better than part 4 but doesnt hold a candle to the first three films. This time around Alice is pregnant and Freddy uses her unborn babys dreams to get to her friends. Some very good special effects and some over the top blood and gore make this a worthy addition to the series, but I still prefer the dark and evil Freddy other than the wisecracking icon he has become.Another good thing about this movie is it goes into detail about Freddys mother and even shows how freddy was born."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darkest of them all","review":"Yes, these are horror films and they're very dark. However, this one is the darkest of them all as far as I'm concerned. Freddy's make-up is brilliant. Very spooky. And there is a lot of genuine scares in this film. And the movie doesn't let up on Freddy's bizarre ways of tormenting his victims. Gretta's stuffed-mouth scene is very memorable and Dan's death scene is also very bizarre.

The idea is kind of hocky, Freddy being to weak to attack Alice, so he attacks her unborn child. The return o Freddy's mother is kind of lame as well. The good acting is gone and the scare factor is non-existant. The one good thing though is the gore factor. There are some good \\"original\\" death scenes which kind of make the movie worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Children of the Krueger and vomit in the aisles","review":"Un entertaining and just disgusting fifth is really hard to watch and even harder to enjoy.

In this installment Alice (from Nightmare 4) is back and is now pregnant. But now Freddy is now trying to come resseurect himself through her child.Now that you know the basic plot let's get to why this movie is so horrible. First and foremost the acting is terrible, now normally this wouldn't bother me too much but even Robert Englund fails to entertain. Freddy isn't even clever anymore. That and the killings are worse than usual too. Most of them just became too over the top and stupid. Stay away from the installment at any cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time, or money","review":"This 5TH time around, (Yes fifth), Freddy is at the same thing he's been at for the last 4 films.

The only good thing about the movie (beside the wonderful Freddy) is that we get even more background info on how Freddy was born, his terrible upbringing and his mother.However, the film lost its punch with me although the special effects are innovative, some of the actors are good, but the material didn't mean anything. Ultimately the film grossed only $22,000,000 at the box office, but New line Cinema still decided it made enough money for their to be yet even another sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nightmare on Elm St., part 5..","review":"part 5.

The best part is that it is an \\"idea\\" writing book rather than an exercise book. There is no stopping to jot down notes or pages with writing exercises. Ueland gets into ideas and the psychology of why we do and don't write certain things. It got my brain churning, and I found myself become less inhibited with a project I was trying to get to the next level on.

After the first chapter, I began reading the book faster and faster because I got tired of reading the refrain \\"You are unique, you need confidence\\" etc. Her editor didn't catch an important missing word and the passages included for demonstration are in the same font as Ueland's, so often it is cloudy whether the paragraph is a continuation of the quote or Ueland's words. I am happy for those who were inspired by Ueland's suggestions. The ideas were valid, just overstated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spititually motivational","review":"I found this book very encouraging. As a budding writer working on a manuscript, it is easy to be discouraged if rejection slips suddenly land on the door-mat.

I did not send it back because I only paid something like $ 15.00 ."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Unquestionable Masterpiece","review":"Polanski's CHINATOWN easily makes my Top 5. A complex, mysterious, and brooding movie, it is impeccably flimed in-period and is really the penultimate of film noir. Each character is an odd mixture of ambiguous qualities: reprehensible, charismatic, trite, mysterious, empathic, craven. John Huston plays what is easily one of the most compelling and evil roles ever put on film. Faye Dunaway is magnetic as both the remote ice queen of wealth and the vulnerable beauty whom Nicholson's PI is understandably drawn to. An absolutely marvelous film, it will leave you feeling emotionally wrought by its end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please Don't Read Plot Synopsis on This Page!","review":"Great movie, and I'm glad I didn't read the plot synopsis on this page, or it would have spoiled the entire movie for me. Amazon.com, please delete it! It's a major spoiler and totally inappropriate."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real film noir gem","review":"This film sums up what film noir is all about. Style and form takes your eye and misleads you into thinking you know what's going on. Nicholson's Gittes character is fantastic - sure he plays the tough hard boiled PI but when it boils down to it - he is caught in a game far far greater than he can understand and the reality of the stakes involved only dawn on him at the very end. John Huston gives a lesson in how to be evil - that is you never show it on the surface. And Polanski's direction is as good as anyone in the history of cinema - his composition, his attention to detail and knowledge of how each character would play out the story.this is what great cinema is all about"},{"rating":"2","title":"What can I say","review":"What can I say about this movie. I love the way it slowly takes shape, actually taking time to develop characters and use the supporting actors. They just don't make movies like this anymore. Layers of stories interwoven. Also, the chemistry between Mr. Gittes and Noah Cross is awesome (especially given Jack's real life interest in John Huston's daughter). To those who didn't like the ending, what did you want to see? The whole point was that J.J. was way over his head and evil would eventually triumph with Mr. Gittes rendered powerless. The story moved slowly and then picked up steam, necessitating a quick ending. The movie was over and then you had to start to figure out what just actually happened. 5 stars must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chinatown RULES!!","review":"Chinatown, Godfather 1 & 2, and Network are not only the best movies of the 1970s...I think they're the best of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't Get Any Better Then This","review":"This is one movie that time will never age. One of the few movies you can watch over and over and enjoy it as much the lastime as the 1st. Maybe even more because you know what scenes to focus on. Memorable scenes: Nicholson tells a joke to his co-workers while a female and her attorney are standing behind him which he doesn't notice. The Barber shop scene. My favorite is when he goes to the Mayor's office for the 2nd time and is waiting in the reception room fidgeting which is driving the receptionist up the wall. That scene is so well acted out you feel the tension. I believe this movie was Nicholson's finest hour and certainly one of the best movies ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"A noir tribute that supercedes all the others","review":"One of the best movies ever made. Roman Polanski pays tribute to the era of Dashiell Hammett by making an homage to film noir which is the finest, most excellently editted and filmed noir ever produced. No good guys, no happy ending, just ambiguity and unfinished business. Jack Nicholson has never been better. If you want to see other excellent film noirs which inspired this masterpiece, check out: The Maltese Falcoln, Double Indemnity, The Big Sleep, Kiss Me Deadly and many others. If you're even partially interested, buy it. You won't be disapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"How did i miss this classic for so long?","review":"I just now got around to seeing this great flick. I had passed it over many times before i guess because of the misleading title and cover but after deciding to give it a watch im glad a did. This movie is one of Jack's best and truly withstands the test of time. I wouldnt change a single thing about it except maybe the ending. Not that the ending was bad but i felt it was a little rushed. The rest of the movie had GREAT pacing and then it kinda ends. If you havent seen this one yet DONT wait any longer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ten stars. The movie that redefined the term, film noir","review":"Bad boy Roman Polanski filmed this gorgeous movie with Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway set in Los Angeles during the 30s - it's about water rights for southern California, which is all about money, money, money. One gets the feeling while watching this film that it's patterned on maybe a Raymond Chandler/Sam Spade book. It's all about incest, infidelity, politics, treachery, lying, secrets - and no one who has seen it is likely to forget the scene in which Polanski himself appears for a brief and memorable sleazy cameo performance as a slimy scumball in cinema's best tradition.Watch it again. It heralded a new wave of really well done crime films from Hollywood."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last Great Noir Film","review":"If it wasnt for Noah Cross, the San Fernando Valley would be farming areas versus what it is today, a large metropolitan area of L.A. \\"you can bring L.A. to the water\\" he says to Jake Gittes, and that is the centerpiece of \\"Chinatown\\" starring Jack Nicholson and directed by Roman Polanski. Probably the last great film noir movie in my opinion, its also a faboulous mystery and detective story. The film takes place in 1930s L.A. where water is a premium and a drought is taken its toll on the city. Private-eye J.J. Gittes, a matrimonial gumshoe is hired by the wife of the head of water and power to see if he is having an affair. All is not how it seems and Gittes is thrown into one big political mess filled with lies, scandal, a murder and incest. This film is a timely classic that will leave you wanting to see it over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie - so-so DVD","review":"The picture and sound are decent, but this disc lacks the extras that might make it great. Chinatown's legendary screenplay by Robert Towne was brought to life by director Roman Polanski and producer Robert Evans, all of them feuding famously. The script went through several different drafts, with radically different endings. It would be nice to have the screenplays included and Towne or Polanski (or even Jack Nicholson) talk about all the behind-the-scenes harangues. The mild interviews we do get are worthless. But that's just me wishing out loud. If MGM's DVD production people where here they'd tell me: \\"Forget it John, it's 'Chinatown.'\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Superlatives everywhere and well deserved","review":"More proof that one of the golden ages of American cinema was in the '70's.I personally don't subscribe to this point of view with the same conviction as other cinephiles, but it's hard to argue when films as good as Chinatown were made with regularity.Incredible script, great camera work, great direction. All the leads are great, all the supporting actors are great, and all of the bit parts are done well - what more is there to say? The film is virtually flawless in every way.If you love movies, this is a must-have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget it, Jake! It's Chinatown!","review":"The final last words off a legendary film. Before self-bannishment, Roman Polanski developed this classic who done it. Jack Nicholson continued to give one great performance after another during the early 70's with this one setting the stage for an Academy Award the next year. Another great performance was John Huston as the sinister father. This is one movie I could continue to watch over and over and over. It's great filmaking!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the great films of the 70s","review":"Chinatown is a superb film noir and one of the landmark films of the 1970s. The script by Robert Towne (winner of the Oscar for best original screenplay for 1974) is justly famous as perhaps the best screenplay ever written in Hollywood. This is not only a superior detective story but one of the most incisive studies of the morality of the American ruling class ever committed to film. Truly, Roman Polanski's best film with great performances by Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunaway (both Oscar nominated) and John Huston in a memorable turn as the face of evil.If you have lived in Los Angeles, you will not want to miss this film as it details the machinations that brought water, and the Valley, to the city of angels. Hell -- if you have lived anywhere in the world you will not want to miss this film. A masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chinatown","review":"I saw CHINATOWN when it was first released, and to this day it is a film that comes to mind whenever I talk to other film buffs.

It is slooooow. Jack Nicholson plays Jack Nicholson. Every scene is long and drawn out often with no dialogue to keep it interesting. Half an hour could have been shaved off this with no real loss. I mean do we really have to watch him climbing over a chainlink fence for 5 minutes. No! But the biggest beef I have is with the direction. The filming of the ending scene which everyone always says is so great is all jumbly and amateur looking.I never really got to form an attachment to any of the main characters, they seemed more like modern actors self-consciously trying to embody certain film noir types.If you really want film noir go to the true source-- forties and fifties films like Panic in the Streets, the Asphalt Jungle, An Ace in the Hole or Laura.The only true heir to the film noir mantle in modern cinema is \\"The Usual Suspects.\\" (Damn I wish Bryan Singer would make another movie like that one, but I digress)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Didn't Get It","review":"After hearing about how great this movie was, I finally purchased it for my wife. This has got to be the most over-rated movie of all times. A totally perdictable story-line, and a complete waste of the talents of Faye Dunaway. And to add insult to injury, the ending was horribly depressing. What can I say about Jack! Well, he was just the same old Jack as always. I'm not that hard to please, but I hated this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"Good acting all right, but a horribly implausible ending. One of the most overrated movies I've ever seen. Don't see this movie unless you like being depressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally disappointing!","review":"When I was reading one of the reviews for 'The Usual Suspects', there was a mention of 'Chinatown' and how it was such a great movie. That made me rent this movie and honestly, there have been very few other movies that have been so disappointing!It is laughable that this is being compared to 'The Usual Suspects' (which is at least million times better!). This is a pathetic movie, the ending tries to surprise you and it does, because it is so stupid!Jack Nicholson does a good job, but even his acting cannot hide the fact that this movie stinks. Some comments say that this one is the best Film Noir till date, and I have one word for such reviews: Baloney!Bottom line: Don't see it, see 'The Usual Suspects' again (and again and again and again....)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chinatown","review":"An Oldie but one of my favorites.

Save your money and buy the Pianist if you want a Polanski movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"(s)Noir..","review":"I have to be in the minority and say this movie just didn't really hold my attention. The pace was excruciatingly slow. Jack Nicholson, perhaps because I have seen him in so many other movies, seem to be acting...like Jack Nicholson. The plotline, as mentioned by other posters, switches mid-stream from Water and Power, to the daughter-father dynamic. I enjoy hard-boiled characters, but this film just felt flat. All around. The cinematography was great though, but, like another critique said, it gave the film the uncertain time-period feel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy It- the Blu Ray","review":"Great movie, lousy depiction. Too many deep reds, too much color infused in the film , far from the original....The interior scenes are too dark. This is frankly a travesty. Don't buy it. The same goes for the most recent non Blu Ray DVD release, same problems....Shameful...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be in scope","review":"Chinatown is one of the absolute best films of the 1970s, a neo-noir that is as dark and thrilling as they get. But according to the description, this edition is being released in the aspect ratio of 1.85:1. It was released in Panavision, which has a ratio of 2.40:1. This means that the sides of the image will be cropped out of the picture on both sides, reducing the image by about 25%. Sort of an anti-restoration.I wouldn't recommend buying this edition until the aspect ratio is restored to its original size."},{"rating":"2","title":"What On Earth Is This Movie All About?","review":"This would have to be one o the most convoluted and confusing films I have ever watched.

One guy in this film remarks \\"bad for grass\\". I say 'bad to watch!!!\\" Overrated, overhyped and over produced and I only give it 5 stars because I like Ms. Faye Dunaway."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for me","review":"I hated this movie.

After 3 seperate viewings, I tried to find some redeeming qualities about this movie.. but alas, none I could find.For film noir, I think D.O.A., either original or remake, does a much better job of showing desperate people doing desperate things. This movie plods along with a very contrived plot and almost completely flat acting by two greats... Faye Dunaway and Jack Nicholson. I think that may be deliberate, but doesn't do much here.Sorry for those who rave about it, but I really tried."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay.","review":"A mostly entertaining movie, but nothing to get too excited about. Other films do it far better, without the colossal pretensions that this one has. The idea is to subvert all of the classic noir conventions. Fine. Unfortunately, having subverted them, the filmmakers have nowhere to go, except right where any ordinary noir film would go. So it up-ends everything, but to no real purpose. Nice costumes, nice cinematography. Mood mood mood oozing out of every frame. For a real slice of classic Hollywood Noir, get The Maltese Falcon, or Murder My Sweet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Chinatown DVD","review":"I ordered the original movie, Chinatown as pictured on the right but received the wrong version (Chinatown, Special Collector's Edition). I didn't realize this until after I opened it when my wife brought it to my attention. The Special Collector's Edition is the one with some bad reviews in reference to the scenes being to dark!

PICK it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Movies of All Time","review":"It's a mystery, wrapped in an enigmatic love story, riddled with corruption. For a third of a century, Chinatown has ALWAYS been on my list of top five movies of all time, often at the top. According to producer Robert Evans, he offered Robert Towne $175K to write a screenplay for the Great Gatsby. Towne demurred, but asked for $25K to write Chinatown. It's his best script, and elicited Jack Nicholson's finest performance.DVD has remastered DD 5.1 audio, plus 25th anniversary interviews with producer Robert Evans, director Roman Polanski, & writer Robert Towne.Richard Bakalyan plays but a minor role as Detective Loach, hardly more significant (certainly less memorable) than the cameo by director Roman Polanski, as the knife wielding midget."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good period piece detective story","review":"Chinatown is a great story that moves along at a fairy good pace but does stall in parts. The real reason for seeing this film is Polanskis masterpiece direction of noir 30s LA and Jack Nicholsons wise-ass and wonderfully mouthy P.I.The story is pretty complexed and you will have to stay awake for a lot of it or else it will pass you by because there are lots of plot twists and turns. I had to go back a few scenes now and again to figure out what was going on. Overall it is great entertainment and the dialogue is pretty snappy and on que. You will like and although I would love to give this film full marks it is prolonged in parts and these scenes do break the momentum of the movie.Good stuff all the same.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb entertainment","review":"\\"Chinatown\\" is a classic detective flick in which Jack Nicholson flaunts his formidable acting talent. The storyline of this film is convoluted and murky, but the atmospherics and the acting are all first-rate. The early 20th Century California setting gives this film a wonderful ambiance that I have always found to be irresistible. No one should miss this one.The story is basically about the corruption of money and politics involved in California water politics of the early 20th Century. Huge fortunes are at stake depending on where the limited water resources of Southern California are to be sent. Nicholson, a private detective, is inadvertently swept into this maelstrom, because the amounts of money involved are worth killing for.This is an engrossing detective flick that no movie aficionado should pass up.

I have something in the neighborhood of 200 DVDs and none have ever had this issue. My DVD player is not defective, is new and a recognized brand so there just must be something wrong with the way these DVD's were made. They seem quite old from 1999 or so. I've heard of other older discs having issues like this such as the first version of \\"The Deer Hunter\\" so perhaps it's time this movie is rereleased so I can actually watch it.

Always look up things after you watch them, especially something as controversial as this.The one thing I liked about this film is that it makes people think. Maybe instead of listening to mainstream media, people would start thinking twice about it and accepting all ideas, rather than just saying someone is crazy. People are going to believe what they believe, just accept it. This is America, we have freedom to believe what we want, and for others to try and make someone stop believing, they are not patriotic or American.I wouldn't really recommend this film to anyone, I would first recommend a more questioning film rather than one that \\"tells you like it is\\" such as this."},{"rating":"1","title":"A boat-load of hoey designed to profit from a tragedy","review":"The saddest part of this video is that there are positive reviews.

It's realistic. It's also written in a fluid internal style, ranging from character to character, and centering on one woman's longings. It's colored by sadness and memory but brilliantly intense about the present. It's a passionate, lyrical book. And for those who can recognize this, it plays off amazingly against James Joyce's mammoth Ulysses, answering that mammoth mythic masterpiece with a woman's point of view, a woman's feelings, a woman's truth.

Not surprisingly, due to the lack of cinematic experience by much of the cast, most of the performances are amateurish and difficult to watch. The story also makes the fatal error of taking it's supremely sympathetic characters and turning them into extremely unsympathetic ones by the films end.It is, however, a very disturbing film to watch, in an almost voyeuristic sense.

Don't get me wrong--it's a very interesting movie. But scary? No way! Yes, the use of actual \\"freaks\\" in the movie was fascinating, but it surely didn't make us run for the OFF switch on our DVD player. Considering the reviews, the movie was actually quite tame. Really tame. I am frankly shocked it was allegedly banned anywhere at any time. Weren't circus sideshows more prevelant in the 1930's than now? So what's the big deal? I agree that the DVD commentary was excellent, but this was NOT a scary movie. A good film, unique (that's for sure), and overall enjoyable to watch. But I don't see it as a landmark horror flick.

It's disgusting but one can't quite will oneself to stop looking. The writing is the worst--second place ain't close.

To me, the Stones were clearly out of their environment as they tried to be blues guys.

Don't forget, the recording is from 30+ years ago, and it's not professionally filmed. It was probably shot on the usual in-house video system.

Instead it is merely a satisfactory superstar blues jam. I would rather they edited it down to 20 minutes because as soon as a STINKING drunk and OBNOXIOUS Lefty Dizz walks onstage, ALL momentum stops and all the good vibes are killed instantly. His presence on this disc is a blot that cannot be overcome. The few songs with Mick and Muddy, Keef and Woody are fun, not spectacular..its a loose blues jam...and Buddy Guy steals the show despite his seriously out of tune guitar.

I thought it was an execllent introduction for a new user - one book can't be all things to all people. But the installation guide was great for someone who has never touched a Linux install before. I'll agree with one of the above reviewers... it could stand to be a little more in-depth with core Linux daemons like apache and sendmail. I did think the section on Samba was outstanding, but was a little confused when it came the entire section on networking and BIND. A little less on programming with TCL and Python, and a little more on the common tasks the administrator takes on every day.Still, I think it's a great primer, and it was certainly enough that I got a box up and running without too much of a headache."},{"rating":"2","title":"Debian GNU/Linux 2.1 Unleashed","review":"I was more or less forced into learning Linux for my job.

I beg to differ! Just reading a few pages made my eyes glaze over. No way could I stay awake and read an entire \\"tour\\" of 20+ pages. Way too many tangents within the \\"tours\\". Should have pulled those out in a sidebar. Great idea for a book, but poorly executed IMHO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major gaps, info biased","review":"This book is most helpful regarding the Old City's Christian Quarter. The other \\"tours\\" outside the Old City walls are interesting from an Israeli/Jewish perspective since they have such a bias. The author repeatedly points out how slummy and garbage-strewn certain areas were before the Jewish immigrants tidied things up. I found that annoying. On my most recent visit, I was most interested in learning more about the Mughabi Quarter formerly located in front of the Western Wall. This author mentions that Morroccans once lived there but neglects to explain that Israel bulldozed the entire neighborhood just days after the Six-Day War. That's a grave omission."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music","review":"This album is great. The music is enjoyable and just enough off of mainstream to be great.

That song is GREAT, but the real gem is Burn a Blackmore/Coverdale song that cooks. Six plus minutes of Eric's great voice, Richie's screaming guitar, Pat's pounding groove and, of course, Billy's thumping bass. I must admit that when I first heard the band without Paul Gilbert, I was a little ticked off. Richie's no Paul, but Richie is Richie. Give him a chance and he'll grow on you quick. I'd say about 3 minutes into Burn."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's like I was there, but in book form!","review":"I actually purchased the book before seeing the series, noting the name Michael Palin on the cover, and remembering his adventures around the world in 80 days. The fact that I did not see the show somehow made the book more enjoyable to read. Palin has a very descriptive, yet easy-to-follow writing style, which helped me vividly imagine the exotic locales & various personalities. Of course, the photos by Basil Pao helped a lot. All in all, great work, so much so that it doesn't feel like a TV companion, but a travelogue that can stand strongly on its own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Palin is inspirational","review":"This travel documentary is exceptional, showcasing great landscapes andvarious cultures with an element of uncertainty. But what makes itinspirational is Michael Palin with his spirit of adventure, great senseof humor and ability to connect with local people.Palin's journey shows us how people across different ethnicities andcultures have one thing in common - the 30 degree longitude (as hetravels along this route from North Pole to South Pole). It gives us asense of how in spite of our differences in race, religion and culturewe still share the same planet.We can learn the political, social and economic situations unfolding inthose countries during early nineties. The world has changed a lot sincePalin's journey but his adventures will always be relevant regardless oftime.This vicarious experience inspires me to embark on a real adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"great trip","review":"the trip from north to south poles was enjoyable and informative with a touch of suspense. well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amusing, somewhat educational, but could be cropped down","review":"Some fascinating cultural studies in this travel video, but it tends to be overly-long, and frequently gets bogged down in inane sequences such as Palin kicking back endless shots of illegal vodka in Russia, etc. The FULL frontal nudity at the mud bath could also have been clipped, as well as the nude men at the sauna. I don't know if Palin was aiming at Pythonesque humor with this, but it didn't work for me.Something like 'Hemingways Travels' was far for fascinating, clean, and better edited. This one needed editing badly."},{"rating":"2","title":"An unique Travelogue","review":"An unique journey from the North Pole to the South. Along the 30 degree East line of the longitude. Palin recorded all his exciting encounters and experiences in this remarkable travelogue.Provided great entertainment for arm-chair travellers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable!","review":"I must disagree with the previous reviewers! OK, there are often strange elements in today's staging of operas. Opera audiences have to live some curious and often annoying conceptions of stage directors. But this production isn't bad! The singers are really world class, and they both sing and act well. Apart form the scene featuring cowboys and indians, I think that the production is coherent and well staged, not least the set design. Picture and sound is beyond praise, as is the playing of the Vienna State Opera Orchestra under the direction of Zubin Metha. To give this disc only one star is a depreciation. My wife and I enjoyed it a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"How badly to treat an opera","review":"I am sure Verdi turned over in his grave when he saw how badly his opera was presented.Having cowboys and Indians mixed up on the set was plainly disgusting. There were other parts that I did not like. They replaced the ballet with cowboys and indians."},{"rating":"1","title":"try another version","review":"This was my first viewing of La Forza and I will try again with another version. As the first reviewer says, attempts to add color - ie cowboys - when the setting presumably involves Spaniards and Incas - fall flat. In fact this production involves a mishmash of historical references that just complicate an already complicated (not complex) opera. Paradoxically, most of the singing is of the old-fashioed 'park and bark' variety! I'll try another production before I write the opera off completely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for young readers","review":"This series, Galaxy of Fear, used to be my favorite series. It is great for new Star Wars readers around 10 years old. It is nice because it does not confuse you with complicated Star Wars terms and yet has a very good plots. It is not all that long only about 100 and some pages, another reason it is good for young readers. I would finsh them in 3 to 5 days. I would never be able to put these books down. It is one of the few Star Wars books that does not use the main characters Luke, Leia, Han, Chewie, ETC. It also does not require you to read the seris in order (though I recommend it). The author does a great job explaining the history you need to know. I would not recommend this book for vetran Star Wars novel readers. If you are a new reader to the Star Wars galaxy I would begin with this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was Exciting!","review":"The book was really exciting . I had lots of fun reading this book . I read it pretty quick . The book is about two children, brother and sister, they land in a planet called D'vouran . The people from D'vouran are nice , but then people started to disappear and if you want to know the rest read the book ."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great adventure to read over and over","review":"It may not be quite as Star Wars-y as most books, but this is still an excellent adventure. It is very thrilling and suspenseful and has some cool characters. Imagine a worlds-better version of Goosebumps in the Star Wars universe and that's only a part of what this is all about. It isn't scary, but I don't think it is really trying to be. Definitely on the freaky side, though. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my favorites","review":"i really love this series, i cant believe people are so hateful sometimes on reviews. i think hamilton does a wonderful job creating a rich and wonderful world full of interesting and creative creatures and lives. i would highly recommend to anyone who loves mystery intrigue and horror all roled into one, oh and with a side of sex, that never hurt anyone. lol"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the first three in the series","review":"I just recently (July 2004) 'discovered' the Anita Blake series, and I love these books !! I have ZOOMED through reading the first three of the eleven books, and this one, Circus of the Damned, is the best of the first three in my opinion. Lots of action, plot twists and surprises, Anita very nearly dying more than once, a new 'boyfriend' for Anita. I HIGHLY recommend this book, even as a stand-alone read, without having read the first two. Five Stars !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"must have","review":"This series has been awesome. Laurell K Hamilton is a very talented writer! I love this entire series. Sad to see it end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing story, frustrating writing style","review":"I am really getting into the Anita Blake stories, and I found Circus of the Damned by Laurell K. Hamilton to be an incredible book. The story seemed to continue on in the standard that I'm beginning to expect from the series.There was very little that I could find at fault with the story. Some of the writing was a little too descriptive for my taste. (I'm probably one of those rare people who doesn't like everything to be completely spelled out for me.) There were also times when it seemed like there were lines added for the purpose of filler.The plot moved along quite well. The bad guys were fairly easy to distinguish from the beginning, but Ms. Hamilton did a good job in building the story around them. The book was definitely enthralling enough to keep me interested in reading more of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the first 3 books","review":"So far, I am liking the Anita Blake series - it's a good place holder as I'm awaiting subsequent books on other similar series.

Yeah, Yeah, most people say go for the nice guy, but I say give me some more of that Jean-Claude!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I was very happy that this was such a step up from #2 LC. I was worried. It was much more interesting and exciting. My only complaint is Anita's toughness is almost rediculous. At least a little passion would be better than none.

The characters are great and the premise (the supernatural just being a part of the real world) was really interesting. I am born raised and still in St. Louis so that added to my enjoyment. I do think Hamilton extends out the sexual scenes to almost boredom, but the rest of the books are wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad.","review":"I've been trying not to judge this series to harshly, although I have not really liked anything in the first 3 books. The universe created by Hamilton is interesting. Voodoo is real, vampires have night clubs, zombies can be brought from the grave etc. etc.These books, although well imagined, feel like they've been written by a melodramatic, emo, 13 year old girl. Flipping through some of the later books (16? I don't know I really just grabbed one off the library shelf) it seems that our little emo chick starts to get into some crazy stuff. The series seems to spiral into nothing but porn.If you must, give it a try. If it were me, I would stick to Anne Rice for vampires and Jane Austen for interesting women.Twilight was better. seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites...","review":"Of all the Anita Blake novels; I find this one to be one of the best...and also one of the most important to read. The action scenes are amongst the best Laurell K. Hamilton has ever written and the story was well thought out and delivered. Also in this story are many plotlines that are continued throughout other books, so it's fairly important to read this book if you're to understand the series...a good read...and an even better series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"I am absolutely hooked on the Anita Blake series. All of these books are an excellent read!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"These are getting addictive","review":"I am religiously reading these in order, and each one is progressively harder to put down. Obviously one has to suspend a lot of disbelief - Anita beats a lot of baddies who are bigger than her - but Ms Hamilton writes will enough to persuade you to do this. These are great stories of the supernatural and magic, which move at a fast pace - none of your languid Anne Rice-style eroticism here. But then, this is what makes them entertaining. The other thing that lifts this series above the ordinary is the characters, which are well-drawn, and appealing. It's nice to read stories populated by people with feelings. I am looking forward to seeing how Anita's new relationship is handled."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best entertainment in days","review":"My wife has been pushing and pushing to get me to read one of these books.Heh. I'm pretty impressed. New readers to the series won't find this to be too bad of a starting off point. Everything is pretty nicely explained, and the action is fast and grisly.There's plenty of violence and lust to go around. Anita is portrayed pretty vividly, and it's clear that she makes some pretty tough choices as she goes along. She's got a great narration voice.The ending is a little pat, and it doesn't really explain why Anita puts up with Bert, her boss, but otherwise, this is a pretty fun book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hamilton Does it Again!","review":"Laurell K. Hamilton again conquers the world of vampires and shapeshifters with cutting wit and outstanding action.Anita Blake is back, and better than ever. I think this is one of the best books in the entire series--and I love the whole series.Jean-Claude is enough to make you drool and we get to meet a new love interest in Richard.This is Hamilton at her best. A must for any vampire fanatic and I am convinced that Anita is a cult favorite with ever growing popularity."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a humorously seductive novel!","review":"I have to say that I really enjoyed this book. The writing style at times leaves much to be desired. However, the humor and the originality in the story far outweighs the writing. I found myself laughing out loud in many places. Anita Blake is a character whom is brave and funny. The book is filled with humor, yet there is something seductive about the vampire Jean-Claude being in love with Anita. This is great light reading, and it sent me scrambling for more of Laurell K. Hamiltons stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"sexy were-wolfs, and two vampires . . . choices choices","review":"Poor girl she's got tree guys after her. Unfortunatly these aren't normal guys.

Jean Claude is extreamly sexy, but he's also a master vampire who wants Anita to be his human servant, and Alejandro wants her for his servant whether she agrees her or not. This book is a great read with fun charachters, exciting action, and funny diologu"},{"rating":"2","title":"You Can't Read Just One","review":"As I compulsively read one more Anita Blake story, I tried to analyze what makes them so fascinating? Is it having a heroine who's not afraid to talk back (even when it's to a master vampire)? Is it her ability to think and act quickly to survive the most frightening circumstances? Imagine yourself floundering though a totally dark cave with an ancient lamia (snake/woman combo) and three vampires after you.The gore in the second book repelled me, but this time the descriptions of mayhem seemed more focused on the action and didn't wallow quite as much in blood (or maybe I'm just getting used to it).Whatever... Laurell Hamilton sure has fashioned a world that grabs the reader. Each book adds another layer of monsters and their powers to keep the reader (and heroine) jumping."},{"rating":"1","title":"how bad can you get?","review":"Of the first three Anita Blake's novels this is surely the worst.This hit me as totally unexpected and I am very disappointed.The problem lies in the plot, misconstructed, discontinuous, a heap of unrelated events thrown together with little sense, not to mention a mass of inconsistencies spread throughout the pages. Inconsistencies in characters descriptions and details are to be found in all the first four books but here we have mistakes such as Anita driving her car which was wrecked the night before and is again the day after. Hard to swallow.In such a context that some ideas are really good and some characters very interesting matters very little."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anita Again","review":"Hamilton has once again done an excelent job balancing character development with action and of course a plot (always a good idea for a work of fiction)...This was the first Anita Blake book I read after picking it randomly off the shelves of my local [book store], and now I've been eating up her books like chocolate. I think my favorite part of Anita is the way I can relate to her so well insofar as personality and physique are concerned.Definitely worth the money and the wait to buy her books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"exiting and entertaining!","review":"usually, when I try to find a vampire book to read, I end up finding some of the most off-beat and boring books around .(and I wish I could have returned every last one I bought, too.)

This book is a must-read, and I implore anyone who likes books at all to read this.It is chock full of exiting and mysterious characters ,not to mention a story line to die for.This is the fantasy novel to end all others .To tell the truth, all of Laurell K. Hamilton's books are fit for blockbuster movies.I even wrote a letter to her suggesting it. I hope she gets movie rights for all of them.

George, Ph.D. (lngeorge@adelphia.net), a professor of political science, July 24, 2004,Powerful and Provocative Reading for Christians and Non-Christians AlikeAnthony Bartlett has accomplished quite a feat: he has managed to say something new and profound about Christianity, and has done so with such deep erudition and in such a humanely compelling voice that even non-theists may well find themselves seduced by his argument, as I was. No issue could be more important for those affected by the power of monotheism in the world today -- and that, for better or worse, includes just about everyone -- than the question of violence and atonement. Bartlett's thesis is radical and provocative, and his book will stimulate much reflection and, literally, soul-searching on the part of Christian and non-Christian readers alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perils of Female SOE Agents","review":"Perils of Female SOE Agents\\"Death Be Not Proud\\" by Elizabeth Nicholas is a painful account of the fate of seven Special Operations Executive (SOE) female agents purportedly executed after being compromised by a penetration of the SOE's F-Section (French) Prosper network. The is a very interesting look into special warfare and one of the first books on women operating in the SOE in WWII."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts off good but.....","review":"The book starts off in a concise manner and the author takes great care to make sure that the reader understands the basic concepts of LM2. However, the deeper that you get into the book the lessons start to fall apart. For example the \\"remote rollover\\" section does not work as scripted in the lesson. I also noticed in some of the other lessons (ie. CH 14. The Artist section) that although the lesson works, when you try it the code does not come out clean. The author does a good job with explaining basic animation principles but a terrible job with explaining the scripting. So if you understand scripting but can't get the animation aspects down then this might be a good book. Otherwise look around for something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full of practical, usable business advice for aspiring comics","review":"There's plenty of useful \\"insider\\" information on the business end of stand-up comedy.

Nicely done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Information","review":"This is an excellent book if you are thinking about trying Stand Up comedy or if you are already doing Open Mics.It gives you great insight into the Comedy business and helps you make a decision as to whether you want to take it further than open mics and really try and make money doing Stand Up.While no book can provide you with talent,this one will provide you most everything else to get into Stand Up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not offer much","review":"This book deals exclusively with the business side of stand-up. It tells you what you need and what is important but only gives simple suggestions on how to achieve it. Also there is advice from comedieans at the end but none of the comedieans are headliners or big. Overall, this book is not for stand-up tips but basically a listing of what is needed to succeed in the business."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY cool book if you want to learn how to be a stand up comic!","review":"I'm taking his one-day workshop so I bought the book to prepare for it-the book is very cool, down-to-earth, tells it like it is.

The VHS/Beta version of this film that was released in 1982 was much better than this DVD in both content and image quality. The transfer of this DVD looks like it was done from 2nd generation VHS tape (probably in EP ot LP mode). Seriously, I have Beta tape of AoH that I dubbed in 1983 from a Sony SL5800 to a Sony SL5400 in SP mode. Twenty years later, that tape still has much better image quality than the DVD. In addition, the DVD is heavily edited. I'm not sure why since it still carries an R rating. Only people who seriously collect Ms. Chambers work should even consider looking at this DVD. It certainly isn't worth a $3.00 rental fee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Mule!","review":"These are the warmest and most comfortable shoe I have ever worn.

The only thing that might be the tinniest issue is the strings... they are cute and all but not functional. If you are buying these shoes...DO NOT UNTIE THE BOW!!! You can never get it back the same and it keeps coming untied... I know it is tempting, but just don't do it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great explanation of many openings.","review":"I purchased this book on a recommendation from a stronger player. I had already purchased NCO and found that I did not \\"understand\\" the ideas behind the chess openings. Reuben Fine explains many openings (although some currently popular openings are not covered as much). He goes into great detail about certain openings, such as the Indian Defenses such as the King's Indian, Queen's Indian, and Nimzo Indian Defenses. His diagrams with pawn structures are very helpful in understanding these openings. I use this book to understand the opening ideas while I use NCO and my database to get more current information on chess theory. It's a great combination.My only criticism is that it is not current, but at my level and below (USCF ~1700), it is sufficient (especially in combination with Nunn's Chess Openings) for my needs in understanding the opening phase of the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's better books out there..","review":"It's not that this book is bad - it's just that it's not very good either. Originally written in the 1940's, it has been updated by the author, and is now in third edition. The biggest problem is that there are still many lines which are analyzed in-depth which you simply won't see - and that's not good if you're new to openings. Also, as mentioned in a previous review, the Author discounts some lines, which have undergone a resurgence in recent time, and *are* now used.Having said that, the book has been updated for algebraic notation, and is laid out in a reasonably clear and logical manner.All in all, there are better books out there, Gabor Kallai's Basic Chess Openings, and More Basic Chess Openings are excellent references, and cover all modern openings in detail. They were also written in 1997, which means they cover the sort of lines you will see at club and tournament levels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated ... and wrong on some particulars.","review":"The fact that this book is one of the most recommended chess books around is an inexplicable mystery. The book's approach to the openings is best summed up as simple minded. A particular peeve of mine ... Fine's explanations of the Reti opening are pure guano."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Classic To Know, Feel Smug About, But Not Esp. Useful","review":"This is one of those \\"classic\\" books that, having read, allows you to feel superior to those barbarians who haven't been so enlightened. The truth though is that Fine isn't the only one with the \\"ideas behing the chess openings\\" - contemporary writers, with equal access to these ideas AND current variations have written equally good books. Actually, the layout of variations within Fine's book make it of little use if you're a casual tournament player looking for some info on a specific opening. Really, this is a bookshelf book. You know: a classic work, in its day, not all that useful now. Just like Ptolemy, or Copernicus, or Newton wrote classic works, Fine's relevance is mainly historical. Try Kallai, or Basman, or Reuben, or even Nunn's Chess Openings, for better practical help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really not up-to-date","review":"This book is a classic probably because the author is a classic too and also because there maybe isn't any other book that presents all the opening systems in chess.But, I must admit that the basic knowledge on the systems is very small and the variations are too old. Working with ECO (Encyclopedia of Chess Opening) I came to consider this book misleading. Is there any other book explaining the basic of all the openings?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many things wrong with this book","review":"This book is over rated. The problems are that the book doesn't have that most telling of the ideas like it says (I am still left wondering want is the idea behind many moves) and what it covers is not up to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book is useful for you.","review":"This book will be useful for you.How?Well,it will teach you basic[see the word]way to play openings.It will teach you how to make plans.You will play base on the pawn structures.There are some errors[notes and positions] in the book but that don't hurt you.I am looking forward if anyone have make a web-page to correct these errors.You could have the book together with 'The art of middle game'.After reading the book,try to learn specific openings.I gave 4 stars because there are some parts of the book that out-dated.And not all the openings are viewed .Buy the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that delivers exactly what it promises","review":"Have you ever wonder why a certain grand master played something you just couldn't understand? Well this book makes everything clear. Whith very simple language it explains what are boths sides objectives in each of the most usual opennings, so the moves become more clear. You won't become an expert in any of the opennings shown, but you'll know what to do when someone plays something confusing. There are a few typos, but nothing that can't be figured out. A must have for anybody who's just starting to build an openning repertoire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clearly not a great choice for beginners","review":"I learned to play chess over 37 years ago but didn't play much after college. I recently started studying it when friends at work got me back into the game. I'm sure I'm only in the 800s if was to get a rating.A friend loaned me this book and other than the 10 principles in the first chapter it immediately loses a beginner. The errors identified in the other reviews are a big clue that this is not a great work. I had a terrible time trying to follow several of the games on a board and so I gave up.For a beginner, I have found, \\"Discovering Chess Openings\\" by John Emms to be very good book. At least I understand what the author is saying and he starts at a level I can grasp and builds from there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent first step in developing your opening repertoire.","review":"The author reviews all of the major games and many of the obscure and exotic openings.Objectivity is not the order of the day here; he discounts some successful lines and completely writes-off others, but the novice chess player looking to develop an opening repertoire should check this one out."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good, but not enough info","review":"To me, this book was a good first step in opening theory. However, it needs to be updated, and has MANY errors (typos, not analytical). What always bothered me was that it only went into the \\"main lines\\" of openings for the most part, and in some instances avoided some of the riskier yet popular variations. I still highly reccommend it.I just bought Standard Chess Openings, by Schiller. I like it even more, as it has analysis of landmark games for all of the openings listed. I might choose that as the next step after Fine's book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thailand Village Life in the 1900s","review":"This book is really interesting.It illustrates life in Thailand then.People live in attap houses and their main source of food is rice.Buffaloes were one of the animals they depended on for farming.Dawan is a girl who is 14 years old,and Kwai,her brother is 13 years old.At that time,there was gender discrimination and boys were more important than girls.Mostly boys were allowed to study.Dawan got to study because Kwai insisted so after he started school shortly.This book is very touching and I think all of you should read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Video","review":"This turned out to be just a horrible video. It is not all what is represented on the box or the description as given on Amazon.

Decking the Halls could have been featured in our gardening column, but is recommended here for its historical and social reflection, crossing different cultures in its analysis of plant meaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"A haunting presentation of a haunting novella","review":"I first read Carson McCullers's hauntingly sad novella in 1984 and the story stuck with me for many years. Completely unaware that it had ever been filmed, I discovered this film by chance in a video store and was totally stunned by its veracity to the novella as well as the superb performances by Redgrave and Carradine. That such an essentially American (well, Southern, I suppose) story should have been filmed by a British director (and what a debut for the wonderful Simon Callow), and with a British leading lady, is odd. Yet it is compelling viewing, as the lives of these very sad and desperate people unfold before your eyes. The climactic boxing match is possibly one of the most painful things I have ever watched, from any point of view. You saw \\"Raging Bull\\"? Forget it! If you love the prose of McCullers you cannot but love this superb visualisation of one of her great works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality filmaking","review":"I really enjoyed this video! I disagree strongly with the reviewer who said \\"nothing worked\\" in it. The acting was superb, and the filming was beautiful and haunting. Many images from the film have stuck with me - watching it was like visiting another world. My only complaint is that I didn't completely understand the ending; it felt a bit unfinished. But it is well-made and a very thought provoking movie. I recommend it to anyone who likes films that are a bit unusual and are driven more by character than by fast action."},{"rating":"2","title":"Odd movie - but a favorite!","review":"This movie gets poor reviews from critics but has great cinematography, symbolism and a quirky plot.

We have to turn the tv off for several minutes and as of tonight it is starting to lose the channel while on one straight channel. Very frustrating. Of course since it's been six months since our purchase we have had to contact the manufacturer direct.

The photography is very nice, and it captures parts of England (i.e., England's quaint and beautiful villages) which are often overlooked in other books. The format and size is nice.

I want you to understand that this comment is coming from someone who owns Starflyer59's Gold record on 3 formats (tape,CD,and vinyl). If you like any of the old stuff that was disgustingly compared to The Smashing Pumpkins, then you'll probably dig this release. For the folks who thought that Silver and Gold albums were \\"noise\\", here's some advice: Relax, toss aside your misgivings about anything that isn't Coldplay or Radiohead, drop your head... that's right, look down... c'mon just do it, look at your shoes, now sway... no no, sway side to side, there ya go, now you're shoegazing.

The album has a few good moments but is not even in the same class as other efforts such as Silver, Gold, Americana, le Vainqueur and, my favorite, Everybody Makes Mistakes. I don't think that Jason's going back to the old sound anytime soon, so it's best to get over it. In the meantime, if you want that same \\"classic\\" SF59 sound, I have found an alternative. Check out an album called 'Futura Black' by a band called Guitaro, who are out of Canada. It's got male/female vocals, classic SF59 guitars and power chords galore. And, if you want a great SF59 album, pick out their latest one, 'Talking Voice vs. Singing Voice'... which is a triumphant return to form."},{"rating":"1","title":"True disappointment. A complete change from \\"Old\\"","review":"It seems like anything you read about Starflyer59 goes to great length to tell you about how all of the fans of the early work were distraught when the Starflyer59 sound changed with \\"The Fashion Focus\\". They basically went from loud, noisy, crap to a much more mature sound. Why everyone thinks it is cool to say that they were into the early stuff, I will never understand. Anyway, now I know how they felt when the sound changed. If you liked \\"Leave here a stranger\\" or \\"Old\\", I highly doubt you will enjoy this album. In my opinion, it is unlisenable. I only pray that Jason will someday again release more good music and quit with the pseudo-hard rock dreck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Songs about murdering children???","review":"I'm completely horrified by the song on this cd \\"As I walked out one holiday\\".

Disappointingly, I've found this album really grates on me after a couple of songs. Peggy's vocal style in particular becomes mighty annoying to listen to over the length of the album, as her delivery can best be described as a neo-hillbilly twang. I may end up combining the best half-dozen songs from this album with some other folk albums to generate a listenable \\"best-of\\" set, but I'd find it unthinkable to listen to this entire set in one sitting. Only devoted fans of the genre or the duo should invest in this set; more casual fans of folk should direct their dollars to any of Pete's fine albums such as the Carnegie Hall classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little too \\"folksy\\" for us.","review":"We don't care for this CD. We love Pete Seeger and Raffi, but this collection is one high-pitched, twangy song after another...like something you'd hear on a hillbilly's front porch. Frankly, we barely got through the first of the two CDs.

It's really valuable as a highlighter's index only - for that you're better off downloading the free stuff from Cramsession.com! The review questions are far too basic. When I did the review for 70-217 (Active Directory administration), I got all the ones in this book right, but only scored about 60% on the questions found in the readiness review from MS Press.

This movie takes an educated look at religious parables and possible scientific causes, which I find fascinating. Most of all, however, this movie tells a timely metaphor about the struggle between the pure will of God versus the misguided, fanatical will of man. The world itself struggles to embrace the concept of a higher power *in addition to* science, without destroying each other in the name of any popular, polarizing religion.I've seen many horror and sci-fi films, and didn't find this one to be annoying or cheesy at all, as other reviews suggested. I thought all of the characters were believable and I really enjoyed the entire movie. The \\"Special Features\\" section of the DVD includes a documentary on possible scientific explanations of the biblical plagues, which was also well produced and thought-provoking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Granted, I'm not that big of a fan of horror movies, I do like the occasional movie that will make you jump. This movie just wasn't that suspenseful or scary. Like 99% of the horror movies out there, this was very predictable and cliched."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Good","review":"Wow, one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. Predictable, and boring. This movie is five as short as the original Ten Commandmants but seems fives longer. Waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense Horror","review":"Hilary is brilliant as a disputer of the occult much like Houdini was in real life. Her latest assignment takes her to a small southern town where the people want the carnage to stop. Solution: kill the little swamp girl who is the spawn of the devil. Graphically amazing. The story plays out, at times a little weak, but with a vengeance. A horror fans delight. 4 out of 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better...","review":"Swank is such a talented actress, and her costar Idris Elba is equally talented. But their talent is wasted in this film. The script is pretty standard stuff, though the ending did have a decent twist. (however, if you pay attention you will catch on well before the climax). The scenery is beautiful, marred only by the plagues infesting this small town.AnnaSophia Robb, who play little Loren McConnell, is a lovely child, with very captivating eyes, but again she is wasted here.The movie isn't bad, but it falls prey to cliche's of this genre'. And that is another problem...it doesn't really fit into a specific mold. It isn't horror, not really suspense, not quite mystery....so it had the potential to be great, but it was one cliche after another.Too bad, because this isn't a type of movie we see often, and it was full of talented actors, but if you have a slow, rainy two hours you could certainly do worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abysmal and predictable","review":"I suppose that if you're looking for cliches, predictable effects, and a pseudo-religious thrill, you could do worse. Stephen Hopkins (Predator 2, Executive Decision, and other pieces of dreck) is just right for this sort of thing. He, like Joel Schumacher, don't seem to care anything about originality or innovation, which rears its ugly head scene after scene in this flick.

First there seems to be an evil young girl, played by AnnaSophia Robb, who is causing Biblical plagues in a small Louisiana parish. Then it appears that she is an angel and that everyone else in the town is worshipping Satan. She finally destroys them all--or God does; it's hard to say for sure. Then she implies to her rescuer, played by Hilary Swank, that the baby Swank is carrying is evil and the spawn of Satan...and that they both have to take care of the little devil. Huh?This movie just couldn't make up its mind. Is it supposed to be a story of faith or devil worship or what? You tell me.Swank and Robb have both done far better work than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda torn","review":"As a Christian myself an movie that mentions God or uses the Bible in any way I don't feel too comfy about, because more than likely they'll put doubts into peoples minds.....Was the \\"Science of the 7 plagues on the DVD extra really necessary?\\" Science and the Bible go together like peanut butter and cheese, you can eat it...but why?I love Hilary Swank, love the effects...confused about the message of the film.

That's the god of the bible, and I appreciate the accuracy of the depiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my, a lightly perspiring Swank!","review":"The main problem with The Reaping is that it's entirely derivative: the basic premise is one that has been covered many times before. The film certainly looks good: you can't fault the production from a visual point of view, but what Hollywood fails to realise time and time again is that effects alone do not a movie make. The CGI is very good, with some particularly convincing digital locusts, but it's all too \`in your face' and along with the tired plot line and cardboard characters, the film never engages the viewer and therefore fails to scare or shock. The overblown ending is especially unsubtle and unconvincing.

At that point, it steers off into an insanely unrealistic, stupid plot that is less a scary thriller and more a big laughable blooper reel. Except that it isnt a blooper reel, it's actually part of the movie and is taking itself seriously (unfortunately for the view). It was nice to see AnnaSophia Robb (Because of Winn-Dixie, Bridge to Terabithia) in a movie role again - that girl has an incredibly bright cinematic future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty well done","review":"Hilary Swank does a great job per usual, although the movie is pretty predictable.

Hillary Swank plays Katherine Winter who is an investigative scholar regarding paranormal events. She uncovers fraud and fake miracles. However, there are 10 biblical plagues that seem to occur in a very short period of time. The actors and special effects make The Reaping a movie that is worth seeing. There is a 20-minute stretch of non action that the director should have cut from the final version. On the bright side, Hilary Swank gives another talented performance.Plus, the ending is spectacular. I rate this movie with 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"a silly mix of \\"B\\" horror movie twists","review":"I gotta admit, the idea seems good. An Oscar winning actress like Hillary Swank in a horror film about the 10 biblical plagues in a small town. What kills it isnt the acting, its the strung together plot line which comes from just about every \\"B\\" horror film you have seen. There are no big shocks, no big statement about good or evil just a poor script.When you get to the twist at the end and the credits roll you will say toyourself \\"oh, please.....is that it\\"??!!! Even for horror lovers of the genre, this one is hard to admire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave up after half an hour","review":"The movie soundtrack is very noisy and disturbing. It remains quiet and then every few minutes it will just get loud. It has too many flashbacks flash forwards and dream sequences to keep track of.

Of course there was nothing terribly original. The plot involved biblical plagues, a child believed to be responsible for the strange happenings being reported, strange deaths and a disbeliever. I, on the other hand, looked at it from the perspective of \\"How would I react following a situation that rocked my spiritual beliefs to it's very foundation\\"? \\"How would I view God or my spirituality following a tragedy that rocked me to my core\\"? Or \\"How much can a person take before they break\\"?While the story revolves a Louisiana State University scientist who heads to the bayou to investigate reported biblical plagues.

All this experiences whitch Jane had had in her live are written in this book very honest. I think that the writer of this book is a person who knows and understand the problems of people who have a special live.

Jane is a wonderful woman with strong character and a inquiring mind.

Jane is a heroine we can all relate to.. she's plain, mousey, and she's had a difficult life, but she also has an underlying fire. She meets her match in Rochester, a gruff man with many secrets.

Jane Eyre is in a class by inself and has everything you could want in a novel: mystery, intrigue, romance, action, and endless, strong, intelligent drama. Jane Eyre captures your heart. You root for her happeness and truely believe she deserves true love. Revolutionary and richly imagined, Jane Eyre is at least a century ahead of its time; an ultimately triuphant work of genius.

I had to read it for my college English Lit class.","review":"Through out my many years of being a student there have been good and bad books that had to be read for class. Jane Eyre in no way is one of those bad books. I had to read Bronte's novel for my college English Lit class and at first thought it might not be that interesting seeing as it was written over 200 years ago. The story of Jane Eyre pulled me in and found myself thoroughly interested in what happened to her. I now know why Jane Eyre is such a classic novel and is still being read today. The character of Jane Eyre is very strong, however she keeps most of who she is to herself due to her class in society. She becomes a sort of female detective and finally discovers where she is meant to me in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it as much as I did in high school!","review":"I remember Jane Eyre as one of my favorite books in my Junior Year College-prep English class.

I am going to be a senior in high school next year, and I just finished this book for my summer assignments for AP Literature. I literally took a victory lap around my house upon completion. I HATED this book. It was boring and rather pointless. No one cares about the romantic struggles of a fake character. This is basically the chick flick of books. I honestly believe this is the worst book I've ever read. I encourage everyone with a Y chromosome to stay as far away from this book as possible.By the way, this is Rebecca's son, which explains my disgust for this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great books are illusions","review":"While cultural pundits try to convince you that some literature is better than other literature, the truth is that all art is relative to individial tastes. Thus, it doesn't make any sense to think that a novel like this one is really any better than say, Michael Crichton or Stephen King. Aesthetic standards can't be grounded.Thus, don't listen to anyone who tries to distinguish between \\"serious\\" works of literature like this one and allegedly \\"lesser\\" novels. The distinction is entirely illusory, because no novels are \\"better\\" than any others, and the concept of a \\"great novel\\" is an intellectual hoax."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meaningless","review":"Perhaps this book requires a re-read, but I found this novel to be full of meaningless drivel. The characters to me were uninspiring, there was not enough real heartache that you felt. The characters were simply underdeveloped.

Nothing to be learned from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I havnt even read it, and I know it's bad","review":"I have to read this for my summer assignment, its due in 3 days, but Im not gonna read it...why? it looks dry as hell...so my advice? dont read it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible reading","review":"This has to be one of the most rediculous books I have ever decided to read.

The language was so hard to understand and comprehend. I had a dictionary next to me looking up words every two minutes. The characters were extremely boring and the ending had no point to it! Everybody in my high school hated this book. We complained to the teachers that this book was so bad. It was a 200 page book that is supposedly a classic!I do not understand why high schools make people read these types of books. Nobody wants to read the book because it is not interesting to a teenager. Yeah, maybe it's a classic, but give us something interesting to read! The book is written in like old English, so I feel that when I'm done reading I have an accent when I speak! So basically if you have to ready this book, I'm so sorry because it is the worst book I have ever read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jane Eyre","review":"I am 63 and KNOW when I was in high school was instructed to read this book.

I have read it several times in mylife time and continue to enjoy it"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Addictive Read","review":"I have just finished reading this book in school (I'm in year 10, and im glad Ive read it now before it was too late; all adults who have read this always say they wish they had done when they were a teenager). As it's so long, the class only had to read half of it, but I felt compelled to read the rest at home as I really felt for the character, and I felt like I'd just die if I didn't find out what happens to her! That's what defines any good book: only if the reader is made to feel for the characters can they be interested enough to take in the issues raised in the novel. I usually find that novels that are fun to read, about characters that readers warm to, are generally superficial, whereas novels involving two-dimensional characters contain relevent and worthwhile morals and issues for us to dwell on. Thats what defines Jane Eyre as a classic; it has the best of both worlds."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enduring & endearing classic","review":"JANE EYRE is one of my favorite Victorian novels. The feistiness and lovableness of Jane has never faded for me, even after several readings. My favorite passages from the text are those when Jane leaves Rochester and ends up at Marsh End; and when she is \\"called\\" by Rochester from afar and flees to return to him. Charlotte Bronte's writing of these passages is raw with emotion and unforgettable. If you have not yet taken the time to read this outstanding piece of Victorian fiction, do so now. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, It's an all time classic for all ages!!","review":"I really enjoyed reading this novel, especially they way Charlotte Bronte captivates you with her vivid descrptions. She makes you feel like you are right there next to her experiencing everything she was experiencing. I also loved the whole romance part of it. How Jane never knew her love for Mr. Rochester was so strong until she left him. But then she came to her senses and went back to look for him. She still loved him as much as she did before, even when he was half blind, poor, and only had one hand. That's what you call true love. I love how Jane is such a courageous women to handle so many tribulations in her life. She never gave up and kept on living her life. I think Jane Eyre is an American Heroine for all young women."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book Ever!!!!!!","review":"I loved the book it was romantic exciting and you never knew what was going to happen.

She's not georgous, not excellent at any one thing, yet she gets her man. i found the characterization to be masterful, by the middle of the book you could tell what jane would do, yet the book wasn't as predictable as some other classic writers. (ahhem Charles ahhemmm Dickens ahheeemmm Ernest aaahheem Hemingway aaahhheeemmm)sorry, i just had to clear my throught there. this is definately a book for girls. i'm not sexist, but i find that if i can relate to a character in the book than i will find it entertaining. i would not reccomend this for any guys. but definately the best book i have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"My English teacher is a sadist!!!","review":"I have to read this book for English and I can't stand it. I struggle through about twenty pages at a time, and then drop the book in boredom. I think it is interesting that all the girls in my class have absolutely no problem with it. My judgement is not entirely fair because I despise romance novels, but unless you want a book where there is only one exciting scene, and a short one at that, avoid this book!!! If you are assigned this book, however, don't panic...there are always \\"Cliff's Notes\\" :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"It was GREAT!!","review":"I had to read this book for a school assignment, and I actually ended up liking it. I couldn't put the book down when I first thought that the two might fall in love. I wanted so badly for him to ask her to marry him. I was heartbroken when I found out the truth about Mr. Rochester.

I had read it translated in Russian when I was about 14 or 15 years old. I loved the dark suspense and romance story. For a few years already I tried to introduce this book to my daughter with no success. Until she came across this illustrated version with the font that someone else complained here about. :) Funny, but \\"gothic-like\\" illustrations in Tim Burton style and wiggly font attracted my 15 years old child. I am very greatful that classic book had been re-introduced in a way that she could relate to it.The language is not simple. I found a good solution for my daughter. I uploaded Kindle version of the book for her. She uses it to search for words' definitions. Kindle version also allows to highlight words and find them throughout the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling and thoughtful","review":"It's a great piece of work, and a joy to read. I read it once as a student in high school, and I must say, it's better to read as an adult.

Consider me hooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I read Wuthering Heights a number of years ago and never was very interested in it. I didnt think to explore the other Bronte sisters' works till now - and this book is incredible! The way Jane's emotions are described, her moral struggles, her strength, and the depth of her love, is just moving. I finished this book in two days. The language is beautiful, character development rich, and scenes dont move too slow. Anyone who's been prematurely judged in life or has loved to the point of heartbreak will see themselves in Jane. Amazing. (Oh,and I loved reading it on the kindle - no more wondering what those good old 19th century words mean because the definitions are right at your fingertips!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"good classic book cheap.","review":"First and formost this is a good classic that should be in every bookshelf.

She quickly became my favorite author, mainly due to the spirit I felt coming through her writing. She seems to be a true Christian, free from a religious mind-set, and with hopeful views of humanity. I think she is very intelligent, and a little ahead of her time. I love her language and the flow of her writing. The book is romantic but a bit dark, which was a bit refreshing actually. (Although nowhere near as dark as her sister's Wuthering Heights). Read it, it is great, and don't stop at just this book. Shirley is by far my favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing chapter 25","review":"While I love this book and have reread it many times, I had to give it a low rating because the ebook is missing chapter 25.

Jane is such a wonderful person and a great role model.

I loved this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"INCREDIBLY MOVING LOVE STORY but terrible footnotes","review":"This book is so luscious. The characters are well-defined and complex. They are realistic and not perfect whatsoever. This haunting book describes the love between a governess and her brooding and at times, playful, employer. It's so well-written and intricate.

The section on St John is like a mini novel within the book. Bronte has in depth character development and uses each to the fullest. I regret the editors of the original submission deleted all reference to her prowess as a La Crosse player while at the Institution. That would have made her physical strength more understandable. One of my favorites. Also bought copies for two granddaughters for Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough Times","review":"This is a really interesting book if you are interested in sad, mystery, and love books. I like this book a lot. It shows that everyone wants to do something, and nothing can block your creative side.

I was a bit skeptical at first, but turned out to be pleasantly surprised by the fact that this novel does an excellent job of evoking a sense of passion and longing in the characters. While it does have the Dickens-esque feel of sometimes seeming to drag on much longer than necessary, in the end everything comes together in a satisfying way.While it's not the type of book to keep you up at night wondering what will happen next, it also isn't one to make you wonder why you are continuing at all. The story itself is always moving and keeping you entertained.Would definitely recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"So very boring I very went into a coma.

However when it is forced down the throats of unwilling English students, Bronte's ultra-quixotic plot, and seemingly incessant need to detail the most superficial minutia only add to the painful legnth of the novel.By page 400, I had become so tired of Jane's apathetic nature, I was indifferent to the outcome, so long as it came swiftly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jane ..you are brave","review":"Jane was such a brave woman throughout her misfortunes .She began as a womanly child, professing to ignore her troubles and trying to love life for its worth .She deserved LOVE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flawed moral","review":"Despite the fact that this is a classic (or considered to be a classic) and, of course, very well written, I can't understand why someone would cherish Jane Eyre's character.I don't want to give away the story for those that didn't read it. All I say is that there was an Anti-Semitic comment by Jane Eyre in the middle of the book that turned me down. I started to doubt Jane's moral and could not recover from that ignorant statement. I finished the book just to know how that story would end. I don't have any admiration for the character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"Charlotte Brontes classic novel has ignited a love of literature, although I admit I first read it for a school assesment 6 months ago, the next 4 times was out of love for every word in the book!!! Being a romantic the Jane-Mr Rochester saga was the main page turner, but also the intrege of Grace Poole and her secret as well as the way we see Jane grow in mind, heart and soul. As a buildingsromand it shines, it was one of the first modern (if you can call it that!) novels to use such a technique. Truly beautiful. I reccomend it to all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A timeless masterpiece","review":"This book's main plot, Jane's growing love for her student's caretaker, seems almost fluffy. But as the heart of the story unfolds, it plays as an example of the \\"classes\\" of her time, and how Mr. Rochester, her love, treated her with equality. The truly talented writer, through actions and descriptions, depicted in this book a simple and plain girl's mistreatment from her aunt and cousins in her childhood and how her past affected her future. There is no such thing as a \\"plain Jane\\". I highly recommend reading this book because it will leave you thinking about it months after it is read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This s a very good book, but I advise you to not read it unless you are a very good reader with lots of patience.-Susanna, age11"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wrenching, Beautiful Story","review":"This book is a classic for a reason. It is still studied in schools across the world for a reason. Because it's a true work of genius. I cannot say anything about it which hasn't been said already. I just wish when kids read it for the first time, they would truly grasp how very ahead of their time Jane Eyre (and Charlotte Bronte) were. The romantic in me was just spellbound by the intensity of Rochester and Jane's love for one another. A thought that repeatedly crossed my mind was \\"Has anyone ever loved anybody the way Rochester loves Jane?\\" If you read it as a teen, go back and read it with adult eyes. I found I appreciated it in a whole new way. I cannot recommend it highly enough and would heartily give it 10 stars if I could. I am off to find the movie version now..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Timeless Classic","review":"It was my first time reading this classic and truly loved this book. The first quarter of the book was a little slow to get into. Afterwards, I could not put the book down. Jane and Mr. Rochester's love story is one of the best from the classics. The climax and the final reveal are certainly worth the hundreds of pages. We can learn from Jane's journey from an orphan girl to an independent woman even today in the 21st century. Definitely not a Cinderella story but that's probably what makes it so great to read. Highly recommended to all readers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There has never been, and will never be, a worse book","review":"Endless, pointless description. DESCRIPTION, DESCRIPTION, DESCRIPTION!!! The entire book is written in stupid metaphors. The few places where there is actually any dialogue bore the reader to tears.

Sure, words that are 900 letters long were common then, but simple is better. Plot??? whats that? Bronte BEGINS to develop this mythical creature around page 300 of 460. Shes pathetically longwinded, taking over 400 pages to say what i couldve written in 1. This book is an utter waste of time; it lacks even the simplest aspects of a good book: Characters you can relate to(yeah right), PLOT!!, and making the authors point. Now that Ive finished burning my copy, i have to give her the fact that the ending was at least decent...compared to the rest of this pathetic thing. That is, only if you like this kind of thing, which i dont, as you can see.

I had to say this is the only book which I really don't appreciate. I don't see the idea of feminism, maybe in the beginning. Bronte did attempt to, but failed to carry through. So, it ends up looking like hypocrisy to me. And, I see a very weak Jane, contrary to my tutors' sayings. 1 star is for politeness, and because it's the book which always has the easiest questions.

There are plenty of other versions of this classic to choose - they're probably all easier to read than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is awsome!!","review":"I read this book thinking it would be lame because its so old. I read it in less than three days. I LOVED this book. The only thing is that upset me was she is my opposite. Her actions would have been way different if i was her. The ending is ok and I wish it was different. I love mr. r he sounds like a pretty good looking man if you ask me. So if I were u read it you\`ll love it. Thats why I gave it five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice edition of this classic","review":"This is a nice edition of Jane Eyre. One reason I bought it was because the cover resembles Joan Fontaine, my favorite actress to portray Jane. It has some helpful introductory material, if you are teaching this novel in an English class.One thing that's different about this is it divides the book into volumes, which my previous copy didn't do.I think this book will be very useful as I teach the novel this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original, but boring.","review":"Do you like drama, excitement, action, and adventure? If so, do not read this book! Jane Eyre is a little English girl who is forced to live with her relatives that hate her. At the age of eight, she is forced to move to an orphan school where she has no friends and is continually abused. The book slowly drags through her life at school until she graduates. After spending eight years at school she becomes a governess for a little French brat out in the country. While living at the manor and tutoring the girl, Jane falls in love with the master of the manor. Mr. Rochester is an older man who has traveled all over the world searching for happiness. The rest of the book spends time explaining the controversy between their personalities and how they deal with each other's love. I give this book points for originality, but it needs a more gripping storyline. Only read this book if you need more reading material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Janet Eyre?","review":"I have a first gen Kindle, and when I bought this book, I loved it. At first at least. About halfway through the book, it would use Janet instead of Jane- but not all the time. It might say Jane at the beginning of the page, but half-way down, I see Janet. Why is that??Also, it puts quotations where they are not needed.Overall, I loved this book, despite the minor glitches. I've always wanted to read Bronte, and now I have thanks to the Kindle!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless classic","review":"A beautiful story that is written with such care and grace. A true classic, do not hesitate to read this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tragic, beautiful, and romantic, a classic!","review":"I love this book! It's one of my all-time favorites. It resonated so well with me when I first read it as a teenager. How to be true to yourself, independent, and make the best of your life no matter the circumstances. And of course, the romance between Mr. Rochester and Jane was so beautiful. I wanted someone to love me like that one day!I love how she was able to stand up for herself to Mrs. Reed her cruel aunt, the evil Mr. Brocklehurst, her self-righteous and controlling cousin St. John, and even her beloved Mr. Rochester when he would have her go against her moral fiber.It was wonderful to learn more about Charlotte and her life and how much shows up in her novel. It made this reread even better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful little book","review":"I bought this for a friend, and she and I both loved it. It is small but very pretty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Imaginative and creative","review":"Bronte was so descriptive that I had no problems picturing what she described. I loved the complexities of the relationships. I never knew what was going to happen next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jane Eyre","review":"An old classic that I had largely forgotten.

I never tire of reading this wonderfully written novel of love, vengeance & romance.

Have read it 5 times, and will again soon. Bronte's writing is accessible to everyone, yet still maintains un \\"je ne sais quoi\\" not found in modern books."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my absolute favorite books","review":"Jane Eyre was orphaned into the care of her cruel Aunt Reed as a baby. After years of being emotionally and physically abused by her aunt and cousins she was finally allowed to go to school. However going to school didn't improve her standard of living much. Jane began to feel that there was something else out there for her so she took a job as governess at Thornfield Hall. Everything was going well until she fell in love with her employer, Mr. Rochester.Jane Eyre is one of my absolute favorite books. I just really love all the characters and the dramatic plot twists. A lot of people who read this book just think it's a romance novel. While it is true that Romance plays a large part, the book is much more than just your run of the mill romance. People who are able to get the \`just a romance novel' idea out of their heads will see that the book is more about a woman trying to find a better life against great odds."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites!","review":"I'm a junior in highschool, and already read it at least 4 times. the majority of this book is gloomy, and one would expect a sad ending (like Wuthering Heights) yet the ending never fails to make me cry! It is just so touching that this woman, who has gone through so much pain and heartache, finally gets her true love after standing up to temptation. I LOVE this story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fiery Fiesty Woman","review":"Another priceless impassioned Bronte novel, Jane Eyre is the story of a whispy governess and her attachment to her arrogant handsome employer. A great fiction filled with actions and subplots, a telltale story about a meak woman with a fiery soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finest of all of English Literature","review":"Still worthy all these years, it's not hard to understand why Jane Eyre has always been known and credited towards being one of the finest novels in English literature. It's not hard to see that nearly all the contemporary romances out there now have taken after this novel's sweaping ways and twisted crude plots. A classic love story, a classic novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Girl's growth from trauma","review":"Though a classic novel, this is interesting.I like Jane's life. Though she is short, she is tough and has strong spirit. I have learned something to live from this novel and her.I want to recommend for students, especially girls under high school, to read this because all girls will grow while being strong, positive, and optimistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charlotte Bronte Unsurpassed","review":"It's easy to see why this novel is regarded as one of the greatest of all time. If you love classic English literature, Charlotte Bronte is unsurpassed in her command of the language. She delves into the depths of feelings of her characters which must have been especially gripping to her audience in the mid-19th century and indeed today. Well read by Juliet Mills."},{"rating":"2","title":"A window on Jane","review":"Amazon always has the best for the best value! Jane Eyre was written so long ago but reading it on my kindle is so much fun! I love reading it in bed with my Kindle light."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"Jane Eyre is a beautiful love story. That may sound like too simple a description for some, nevertheless, it is appropriate. If you want to read a truly classic novel that will leave you with a light heart and a smile, this is the book for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing and soothing.","review":"Aa profound story of service dedication,.determination( or stub- borness) and love written in beautiful and descriptive prose.A delightful. Challenge to my French vocabulary skills..,"},{"rating":"2","title":"No actually 4.9 stars, why because of the ending :(","review":"What can I say about Jane Eyre..mm.. well it's very clear that it is amazing! 4.9 stars well I know I should have given it 5 stars but the ending was truly a bummer! I really did not like um...what happened to a certain hall at the end and a certain guy..well I don't want to give it away. But it was truly a bummer. All I can say is that if it were a fairy-tale ending I would have given it 5 stars, but hey I guess that a book is not always interesting when it ends that way right all of you JE fans. But truly a 100% bummer all of you starters..so prepare to face a 100% bummer. Hey I can't still get over the ending. But trust me it is a very 100% good book, sad, romantic most of all :), and the ending is quite shocking, and a bummer, but not alls well that ends well, but it still ended well. For the most part ;)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartbreaking, Yet Warm","review":"I love how Jane is a character that I could relate to. Even though her circumstances are unique, as are everyone's, she's a regular human being with regular emotions and reactions, just like the rest of us. There's a little mystery and plenty of heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfection","review":"This was the first book that I read on my Kindle and it was the only choice that I could have made.Perfection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating","review":"I truly enjoyed this version of Jane Eyre, it\`s one I will consider a great love story. It\` s one story you will want to read again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A heroine for the ages","review":"I read \\"Jane Eyre\\", against my wishes, when I was a junior in high school and found it stuffy and dry, much like other books from the Victorian period. However, when I read it again as a sophomore in college my opinion change. I saw \\"Jane Eyre\\" as a heroine who fought her way from the bottom of society in order to make something out of herself.What I liked about the title character was that she was smart and even more importantly she was strong-willed. Somehow, Charlotte Bronte created a female heroine who had real character at a time when most women were used solely as ornaments and child-bearing machines."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest novel of the 1840s","review":"Alright, joint greatest with Wuthering Heights. This novel for all its faults (journalistic style, over reliance on coincidence, a certain Byronic vulgarity to Rochester) simply transcends other English fiction of its time. Charlotte Bronte magics Jane Eyre into existence, the reader inhabits her consciousness. The book's first readers had never read anything like it: you can see why. It is has been continuously in print for over one hundred and fifty years and is a classic in the truest sense of the term. Fie on those who gave it one star!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Positively gripping!","review":"What a wonderful book! I just finished reading Jane Eyre for the first time, and I already know that it will be a book I return to often! I absolutely loved Bronte's writing style...it's a book that grabs your attention from the very first page and holds you there 'til the very end! Not a dull page in the book! I was in awe by the time I reached the last page....what an ending! As they say, \\"Be still my heart\\". If you are a fan of Victorian romances, I *definitely* recommend this book to you! Take my word for it, you will be returning to these enchanting pages again and again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Jane Eyre but the Footnotes Ruined It","review":"Don't get me wrong, Jane Eyre is one of my favorite books. However, this version of Jane Eyre has millions of footnotes so you are forced to constantly flip back and forth to see if the footnotes are saying anything useful.When the character Adele is speaking paragraphs of French, they don't bother translating it for you but they will gleefully tell you what's going to happen one-hundred pages later in the book.Reading this version of Jane Eyre is like watching a movie with an over-enthusiatic friend who keeps talking through the whole movie and telling you what's going to happen. If you're going to read Jane Eyre, I would reccomend different version"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's worth the time","review":"I'm almost 13, and my mother and I just finished reading this last night (we were up until midnight...couldn't put it down.) It was a really wonderful book, although there was a slow spot or two. Jane is heroic and good, but not sappy. I loved her witty conversations. You can't say you've read the classics until you've read Jane Eyre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Classic","review":"I enjoyed the book and would recommend it. It seemed to be based on historical events. It definitely held my interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRONTE'S BEST","review":"THIS BOOK HAS BEEN MADE INTO SO MANY MOVIES, BUT THE READ IS WAY BETTER THAN ANY MOVIE.THIS STORY IS ABOUT ABOUT TRUE LOVE AND THE ABILITY TO FORGIVE.

I did not expect it to capture my interest as much as it did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my favorites","review":"It was good over all but then Jane Eyre is one of my all time favorite books. Because it is a movie some parts of the book that I love were left out. Always read the book before a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"with audio +++","review":"So glad I chose to read this classic again.

CliffsNotes didn't do it, me, or my grade any justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites!","review":"I have several copies of this novel & it's one of my favorites of all time. I will read & re-read always."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jane Eyre","review":"It has been many years since I first read it. It is a bit old fashioned, which adds to its charm."},{"rating":"2","title":"YAY!","review":"This book was SO wonderful! I was unsure about it at first because just the size of it intimidated me, but it had so many good values in it, and such a wonderful plot that just drew you in from the beginning. I would reccomend this book to anyone! I happen to be a big fan of romance, and this definately satisfied me romantically. The relationship that forms in this book is beautiful, and something I shall strive for in my own life."},{"rating":"2","title":"surprisingly enjoyable..","review":"I had steered clear from Jane Eyre because I had imagined it was some frivilous Victorian-era romance novel, suitable only to junior high school girls. Well I'm glad I invested the time to prove that was wrong!Jane Eyre is, ultimately, a story of human values and the serious choices in life we all must make from time to time. While not an especially plausible story, it is moving and thought-provoking. I certainly think it would make for required reading for all teenagers; it delivers an excellent message (IMHO) contrary to what seems an obsession of young(er) people of money, good-looks, and \\"independence at all costs\\".As a slight demerit, Jane Eyre isn't the best written novel. Some of the characterizations are weak, and the novel lacks the powerful prose of the works from George Eliott. And the story is a bit wobbly in the beginning. But put all this aside and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jane Eyre is a fascinating role model","review":"Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre is a heroine that possesses independence, intelligence, and inner beauty. This is a fascinating novel that goes beyond the ordinary, trite, misconceptions of \\"love.\\" Jane Eyre's experiences prevail upon the reader so strongly, that one feels as if one has learned a great deal upon finishing this novel. It is also much better written than most modern-day novels we see today. If you enjoy other novels from Emily Bronte or Jane Austen, you will no doubt enjoy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sure it's dated, but it's enjoyable if you let it be","review":"I read this in order to compare it with JENNA STARBORN, and there's no doubt but that this is the true classic with its Gothic overtones and its portrayal of a strong and independent woman in times not supportive of such strength and independence in women.Many will have difficulty with this book, because it's rich in detail and rich in mood. Today's readers may need patience and understanding to enjoy this. If one relaxes and accepts the book as a portrait of the thinking of the era in which it was written, one can relate it with today's society.Basically, this is the story of a woman guided by her inner values. As such, it's not really a book for guys. On the other hand, it tells of a style of life far from that led by today's high school girls, and therefore takes careful reading.It's classic, and if accepted as a Gothic romance that reveals the thinking and attitudes of the time when written, it's a timeless story that speaks to all."},{"rating":"1","title":"These Tapes Don't Work","review":"Beware when you buy this tape. It employs a technology that is not easily usable. You need a balance dial on your tape player. None of my recently-bought players have this dial. Check your equipment before buying this item or you will find it to be junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sappy Romance!!!!","review":"I'm sorry but this was the biggest waste of paper I have ever seen in my life. It is a stupid excuse for a romance novel and I found the long and detailed descriptions of nothing, utterly boring. It is a set text for our school but even our English class couldn't bear to read the whole thing so we skimmed chapter by chapter, gave up and watched the film (which I might add didn't resembled the book at all). I am quite well educated, have a good understanding of the english language and apprieciate good books, but I was appalled at this ridiculous fairy story and I believe it should be taken off schools set text lists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Age does not a classic make- truly a boring book.","review":"I truly cannot understand why anyone would be awed by Jane Eyre. Charlotte Bronte has trouble explaining the setting of the scenes, for one. Normally, the average reader can comprehend what the setting is like just by reading a few well-written lines. But Bronte bores the reader by over-explaining the setting, as if we needed to know every single detail. Unfortunately, it is this lengthy prose that makes the story itself hard to read. Secondly, the characters are bland, which makes the difficulty even greater. Maybe with livelier characters this novel would be easier to read. Unfortunately, this novel is required reading in certain parts of the nation. This bland, boring novel is not the way to spark reading with young adults."},{"rating":"1","title":"It discourages people from reading for the rest of life!","review":"I was forced to read this book for summer reading. No ways around it. Upon reading the back page summary, I knew that it would be a grueling torture test in which only the strong willed would surive to the last page. Trudging page by terribe, agonizing page, I read the book over a period of one horrific month. Needless to say, this book ruined the previous exitement I had about reading. This is terrible. Some \\"classics\\" should not be given to males, as goes for females. Obviously a romance novel should not be given to a male and ask him to enjoy it, as such a brutal police killers book should not be given to a female and expect her to geniunely enjoy it. This book has left a deep scar on my ability to love liturature for the rest of my life and will not be easily healed."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHERE IS THE \\"0\\" RATING?","review":"Do you like incredibly pointless books that serve more as lullibies than useful stories? Are you a completely uptight, butched feminist? If you answered \\"yes\\" to either of the above questions, Jane Eyre is right down your alley. This is required school reading simply because of the weakness of all other female writers! Bronte is nothing more than a token."},{"rating":"1","title":"Charlotte Bronte is too loquacious","review":"Jane Eyre is a perfect example of someone with too many things to say. What could be said in two pages is instead said in five to ten. The book's length could be cut in half at least. All the extra language creates a boring atmosphere that puts me to sleep. If someone has a point they want to get across, they should just spit it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Boring ,Boring!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"THERE IS REALLLY ACTUALLY TWO WORDS THAT I THINK SUMS UP Jane Eyre boring and senseless!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Visit With the Past","review":"Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte was our book club selection for this month. It is a book I had not read since I was in high school.

I thought I was going to receive the paperback form of the book and have the correct page numbers that corresponded with the teacher's copy of the book. Not only was this the hardback version (which wasn't the problem), but the top edge of the cover of the book looked like it had been chewed on and the page numbers didn't match up. No where in the description did I see that the book was going to be hardback and in such poor condition. The same thing also happened to my friend who also ordered it from Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe it's just me, but...","review":"I found the beginning of this book interesting enough, but in my opinion it just went down from there. Unlike the other people who have reviewed this book, I believe that Jane Eyre could have been reduced to half its size. The plot was good, but it was a struggle to finally finish the book. I know, many who have read this might hate me, but I just found the it rather uninteresting. Or maybe I just can't appreciate good books, either one. I wouldn't recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent reading of Jane Eyre","review":"Susan Ericksen does an excellent job of narrating this audiobook. Her reading voice is pleasant and natural-sounding and she conveys just the right amount of emotion. She also manages to vary the tone of her voice just enough that can differentiate between characters but not so much that she sounds foolish.The only drawback to this audio book is that it is recorded on two tracks. That means you have to listen to each tape twice, setting it either to the full right or full left speaker of your stereo. Although this does cut back on the number of tapes, I didn't like having all the sound come from one side of my car."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book worth the read","review":"Charlotte Bronte was a remarkable writer.

Her parents died at a very young age and she was taken into the home of her uncle. After his death, her life gets really tough living with her aunt and cousins (who don't really care for her). This book is about how she made the best of what she is given in life and how she matures and grows. It's a story of love and strength. I thought it was interesting how this book has a little bit of a dark side. I liked that, I felt that it gave the book more depth and made it more interesting to read. I wasn't expecting it, but enjoyed how it added to the story.

The story of three sisters\\" and took a \\"time out\\" from the biography to re-read all of Jane Eyre. I loved it as much as I ever have but this time I knew what parts were autobiographical and where the basic concept for the story came from. Interestingly, I had always thought the part between the time she leaves Thornfield and returns was rather less vivid than the rest. Turns out most contemporary reviewers thought so as well. Still, knowing that the marriage proposal from St. John Rivers has a basis in Charlotte Bronte's life made it more interesting this time around. I highly recommend both books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite","review":"This is my favorite book of all time and i am so glad that kindle offers it as a free ebook."},{"rating":"2","title":"A perfect book for any romantic soul....","review":"This book, is without a doubt, simply wonderful. At every turn of the page, you will be fully enveloped into the life of Jane Eyre, a magical yet ordinary girl whose courage and creative spirit will inspire even the most realistic of hearts. Her life and times, told with brilliant eloquence by Charlotte Bronte, will captivate the heart and mind and the end will have you cheering and crying by turns. True love, deception, greed, and bravery are but a few of the themes of this great novel. I can recommend it to anyone competely without reservation! A must-read!

For a specific review on \\"Should I get this version on my Kindle?\\" here you go.Table of contents that I saw (not interactive if there is one), but it's not necessary here, this is a story that you just keep clicking \\"next page\\" and pick up where you set down. Minimal (if any) errors and well set up. Next chapter always starts at the top of a page which makes it always a good place to stop.Kindle vs. Hardcopy -- one nice thing is that there are a lot of words considered either purely poetical or old or middle English, so no longer or not commonly used and if you move your cursor to the word on the kindle, it will automatically define it. Always useful, but especially where there are many such words.Well worth the buck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A true classic. This Kindle edition leaves some things to be desired.","review":"What can I say about this work that has not already been said in the many reviews that came before? It is truly one of the greats of English literature, and re-reading it as an adult is a pleasure that reaps even more rewards than when I read it as a girl.My only warning is for those who are reading it in the Kindle edition. The good points are that it is nicely formatted and almost free of spelling errors. The negatives are that it has no Table of Contents, linked or otherwise; and although it claims to be illustrated, no illustrations were included in the version I read.For pure reading pleasure, this novel has few equals. For formatting, you might be able to find better."},{"rating":"2","title":"read it over and over","review":"brave jane, my favorite of the first person heroines. not a beauty - thank god, isnt that a relief! - but plain and puny and with an indomitable spirit. she chooses morality, in a line which i cant forget: \\"and there i plant my foot.\\" For rules are not made for when times are easy, or to be discarded when they are inconvenient, but are there as a lifesaver for when emotions and life are in disarray."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I started this book and found the beginning of it a little dull and I put it down but a friend of mine encouraged me to try again to get through and I read the whole book in less than 3 days. It was one of the best books I ever read in my entire life. Any woman, 8th grader, or over will thoroughly enjoy this romantic (tearjerking, not just a few, but many) and passionate story of a woman's hard life and wonderful romance. You will be astonished at what secret Mr. Rochester is holding in his attic."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most overrated book of all time","review":"I've never understood why everyone lavishes so much praise on this book. It is the most overrated book ever.One of the most fundamental things a book has to do is hold the reader's interest, and in this aspect, Jane Eyre fails. To be fair, it is utterly gripping throughout the first ten chapters. After that, the quality of the book falls off sharply. The rapid pace becomes boring repition of having to go through thirty pages of nothing to get to a page or two where something actually happens, then another 30 pages of nothing.It's kind of a shame really, for a book that started out as well as this one to crash and burn the way it does. But it happens, and what we are left with is a dreadfully boring book that continues to have praise heaped on it for reasons I will probably never fathom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I'm too young to 'get it.' All I know is I hated it.","review":"If you sent JANE EYRE to a publisher today, the response would be, in fancy wording, \\"Um, sorry, this is too long and too weird. Boring. Sorry, please try again.\\" I'm 13, so perhaps I'm too young to grasp it, but I enjoyed other books which are supposed to be similar, such as Pride and Prejudice.In the 13-year-old vernacular, here's what was going through my mind:Ew! Why the heck would she marry that weird, bad-tempered, hairy scary man? If I found out that my fiance had kept his insane first wife in the attic and not told me, I'd file for divorce! He's bossy, unreasonable and mean. Why'd he pretend to wanna marry Miss Ingram? I guess the scandalousness of a governess falling in love with her employer is supposed to keep you interested, but really, it's dead boring. It's an okay story, but written so dully that it's ruined. Why wasn't Jane suspicous?"},{"rating":"2","title":"True Romance","review":"I had to read this for a class and expected to have to force myself through it. Surprise! It was really enjoyable and I breezed through the finish weeks before my classmates. I don't know much about contemporary romance novels but having read a couple Austen novels for previous classes, I can say I prefer Bronte and look forward to trying some of the other novels from the Bronte sisters. I like the 'ugly ducklings in love' storyline between Jane and Rochester and it kept me intrigued but I was even more pleased with Bronte's accessible prose. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic read and decorative as well","review":"These little books are awesome. I love the classics, but collect these for the decorative aspect as well.

I came back to the novel again in more recent years, and I have enjoyed it more and more with each read. Having heard it as a book on tape while on bedrest brought the story to life even more and made the mysterious Bertha and the dark and moody Mr. Rochester that much more intense. This is so much more than a romantic tale between an unfortunate governess and her brooding employer; it is truly the story of a young woman coming into her own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reality Jane","review":"We were forced to read Jane Eyre in high school. My teacher was so derisive of Jane and the choices she made that I was turned off.I reread this in my 20's and OMG, what I missed! This book is the Victorian equivalent of a Jerry Springer episode.Jane goes through hell and high water, and like most humans makes a couple of bad choices and mistakes but I kid you not, if someone was telling me this story now, I would have thought they got it off Oprah, Springer, or Dr. Phil.If you can get past the old fashioned language and Jane's habit of taking the long way around explaining things, you'll love this book. Jane is a friend to keep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzz....","review":"I suppose it was an ok book... It probably had a good moral and all that stuff, but there was about 150 pages of excess crap that I, personally, didn't care about! It was just a teeny bit to long.....!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Story Great-Edition poor","review":"This review has to do with this edition for Kindle. There is no table of contents and no search ability. You cannot jump by chapter using the usual button either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book isn't a good choice for young readers.","review":"Jane Eyre may be enjoyed by older adults (with a bigger vocabulary, I should add), but I had to read this sophomore year and absolutely hated it. This book is very hard to read, and I wouldn't recommend it to any young readers who doesn't have a teacher to help explain. Although it may be a classic, it is one tough book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I LOVE classic romance, but not this!","review":"I enjoy classic Victorian era romance , and this by far is the worst book I have ever read. I know that Jane's character was suppose to be \\"Plain Jane\\", but I in no way found her endearing. Instead of feeling sorry for all her misfortunes and lack of love, I found myself detesting her character. The plot drags on forever, when really it could be told better in five minutes. It could be romantic, except that the plot is so boring and outlandish, that it overshadows that element. And the supernatural elements of the novel literally made me laugh out loud. I could go on about why I hate this novel, but I don't want to ruin the story for others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watching tomatoes rot is more interesting than Jane Eyre.","review":"While sloshing through the almost unreadable text of the verbose Charlotte Bronte, one can imagine why she was never married. Don't get us wrong, it's not that we don't understand the underlying themes and the higher level concepts; they just contain absolutely no relevance whatsoever. The plot, dare we call it that, winds slowly through the 400+ pages of this so-called classic. If you must read it for school-don't. You'd be better off guessing on the test than being utterly confused and bored to tears."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete bore","review":"This book should not be placed in the same class with other \\"classic\\" authors who deserve their place. This book is a bore, the main character is a whiny cry-baby and the book goes nowhere for a long time. Jane has a very thick skull and all the obvious things fly over her head. This book should not be a classic, and I do not understand why it is one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"I have always loved Jane Eyre. I read it about 10 times when I was in high school.

If you are a FEMALE, give it a try. The only reason schools asign this is because a woman wrote it. Email me your comments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildless drivel with sickening, neverending irony.","review":"Irony, in small doses, isn't too bad. In fact, it is sometimes enjoyable. But this book takes irony to the next level. If Dickens' Tale of Two Cities was ironic, then it's met it's match. Mrs. DeFarge also being Little Girl with Bad Past is nothing compared to this. Honestly, what are the chances of stuff like this REALLY happening? The guy you want to marry just happens to have a crazy lady harbored upstairs, who happens to be his wife? The people who save you from starvation and death just so happen to be the nearest and dearest relations you have? Give me a break. Every new twist and turn of the 'unexpected' plot made me sick. Now, if it just so happened that Mr. Rochester was Jane's father, and his wife was her sister...Now that might have sparked a little more interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Bother","review":"Alright, this book was god awful. The begining dragged on about how poor and oppressed Jane was it was so cliched that i could've guessed what was going to happen next. Most all of the characters were two demensional and the plot was basic. This was more of a character development novel then a plot based novel. I'm not sexist in the least but this is truely a women's novel. The style was sappy and drawn out, and it was to much of a love story. I'm not trying to be macho but gentlemen don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is long and boring","review":"Jane Erye is a girl who is adopted by a wealthy and mean step-mother. Soon after the book begins she is sent to a boarding school where most of the teachrs and head masters are mean and she isn't taken care of very well. Once she graduates she is hired as a tutor to a wealthy land owner with much to hide. This book reminds of many other stories I have read. The only difference is Jane Erye is much longer and much more boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"How is the average review so high????","review":"Based on the fact that the average review is 4.5 stars, I'm going to assume that most of the reviewers have been women. That said, I think I'll offer a different perspective than the rest of the reviewers. That perspective is that this book is one of the most boring, bland, lifetime-ish wastes of paper known to (wo)man. To give an example of what I mean, it takes 3 CHAPTERS to lead up to the failed wedding! The author goes into great detail describing every little minute insignificant meaningless thing that happens (such as a chapter for her to say she didn't want Rochester's gifts)-and it takes her 20 frickin pages to say that she's leaving a guy. Somehow, this got to be considered a literary classic about feminine empowerment. Just don't complain about guys liking stuff like Die Hard and football games and not being in touch with their feminine side after having to read [stuff] like this in English class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't read it if you don't have to.","review":"I had to read this when I was a Junior in high school. It was the worst book I have ever read. It was long and boring. The aurthor took about 3 sentences to explain something that could have been done in one sentence.

Good luck and find the clif notes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great classic","review":"I know that I read this book many years ago in English classes but I am enjoying it so much more - still haven't finished and am looking forward to the next chapter."},{"rating":"2","title":"really 4.5 stars","review":"4.5 stars on this one! This is almost a 5 star book for me - the only reason it's not, is because it's so long.I know it's a classic and all that, but it's just SO descriptive...I ::heart:: the Jane Eyre character and Mr. Rochester as well. It blows my mind that the horrible school/orphanageJane gets sent to is based on the boarding school Charlotte Bronte went to as a child. Oh, and that evil aunt wasjust awful, unbelievably horrible to her, so sad.I just loved the love story in this... such an awesome classic and I ::had:: to read it after reading \\"The Eyre Affair\\"(Thursday Next series) from Jasper Ffordes - it was so fun to understand that book better after knowing this story.And, yay to kindle for giving us classics for free, gotta love that! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book.","review":"I cannot say what has not been said by earlier reviewers here. My only contribution is that this character is perhaps one of the early examples of a feminist, a working woman (think Eleanor Roosevelt) despite Jane's eventual wealth. Her choices, her voice, her thoughts were well ahead of her time and context. I was really impressed with this story. The writing, shockingly, has held up through the many that have passed since this book was first published."},{"rating":"2","title":"great classic love story","review":"I enjoyed this book. It is entertaining and at times very suspenseful. Just an all around good classic love story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality!","review":"I bought this book as a gift for my girlfriend and she loved it! I also bought her Wurhering Heights from this same series. The detail on the cover is beautiful and really well-made. They include a little ribbon bookmark that is a fantastic touch and really helps give these books an old-timey feeling!

From her early home life at Gateshead to her schooling at Lowood School then her stint as the Governess at Thornfield Manor the author breaks your heart, makes you feel such compassion and leads you down a journey of life's trials and tribulation.Her want of love and acceptance is a theme that plays out throughout the book.It is a timeless story with themes that center around Morals, Religion, Social Class and relationships between men and women.Charlotte Bronte gives us a beautiful story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yay Jane","review":"I've watched the movie(s) over and over but have never read the book until now.I knew what was going to happen, and still I couldn't put it down.I will be reading it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disliking a classic novel","review":"Ladies and gentlemen, readers of all ages, I express my sheer condolences if I offend anyone from what I am about to write: The novel Jane Eyre, I thought, was boring to the extent that I would often drift asleep while reading it. Although I am not use to a story that does not go straight to the conflict, I believe this story was on going. There is some excellent imagery, and metaphorical aspects in the story, but only that can not save this narrative. If you are a person that loves a romantic setting with certain twists every now and then, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a book for the average male!","review":"While there are wonderful characters and a somewhat clever plot, this book gets very boring! The main thrill of the novel is just a written account of most girls' dream of becoming the wife of a man to whom they are truly in love (OK, so Jane had some hardships along the way too...;-)). Of course, Jane is very independent and has no exceptionally good looks, so the story may be considered an inspiration to the female culture's wish of being respected for what is inside...? I found it an inspiration to go to bed a little sooner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Getting Into!","review":"I downloaded this book for my thirteen-year-old daughter to read. When she first picked it up to read, she had some difficultly with the language and the writting style. Because of this she put it down and went and read something else. Later, she came back to this book and tried it again. While the first chapter did give her problems, she continued reading and as the story progressed she became enthralled with the story. In the end, she loved the book and has suggested that I read it as well, which is something that I plan to do, when I'm done my reading list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Capture of the heart","review":"This is one of my top books to read. I enjoy the subtle language and the meanings they express. This is a simple story woven to be complex. Just the way life is.

This book is about being alive and enjoying life no matter your station."},{"rating":"2","title":"A TRUE PAGE TURNING CLASSIC","review":"Humbled Jane Eyre(pronounced air) is turned out of her aunt's house after being accused of throwing a gobblet at her master's 16yr old son, then sent to a boarding school for girls.

It contains everything from the gothic house to the scary madwoman in the attic. It is everything from a suspense novel to a romance to an autobiography. The reader instantly likes Jane and empathy remains with her throughout the novel. you feel that it imperative that Jane eventually marries Rochester according to the reader and I found myself willing her not to be swept away by St. John Rivers. You see life through Jane's eyes from the cruelty of Aunt Reed, to the death of Helen Burns to the joy at meeting Rochester again. A timeless and claasic book that will last forever in reader's hearts."},{"rating":"2","title":"absolute favorite novel!","review":"I can't exactly remember how many times I have read this novel, but every time I do, I fall in love all over again. From the mysterious noise coming from the upstairs room of Thornfield Hall to the growing love between Jane and her employer, Mr. Rochester. Jane Eyre is an enchanting story of a young girl orphaned at a young age and living with 3 horrible little children and their mother. Jane is treated like a outsider and a burden by the eldest son. When Jane is old enough to leave that life behind, and start over,she becomes a governess at Thornfield Hall. Each night Jane hears a strange noise that frightens her, and spends most of the novel uncovering a secret that could affect her relationship with Rochester in a way she could never imagine."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite stories","review":"I love Charlotte Bronte's \\"Jane Eyre\\".

Since she is somewhat hard of hearing, we usually put on the subtitles. Aside from the visual problems, which have already been discussed, the subtitles are clearly the work of a Chinese non-English speaker and clearly unedited. Aside from some hilarious mistakes (including some rather stong language unrelated to the actual words), by the second DVD, the subtitles had devolved into a language all their own.I confess I failed to see the magic in this movie, but a better version might have helped. Avoid it until their is a better version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Raintree county","review":"I sent another review for this product earlyer saying the the quality was not very good and that it jumps at least three times thoughout the film.

Her Susannah is sexy, fragile and tormented. Montgomery Clift as her husband was miscast. Monty seems to be half asleep in his role and is too old to be playing a wide eyed lad. Eva Marie Saint as his righteous ex girlfriend who spends her life hovering around him has a thankless job playing an annoying woman. In fact a lot of Raintree is annoying. I kept waiting for John Shawnessy to grow up, tell off his small minded family and to take his wife and child away somewhere to start over. The battlefield scenes are great. The scenes with Elizabeth before she goes mad are gorgeous but the whole film seems off somehow. While watching it I kept thinking that this movie, with a beter script, casting and director could have been great."},{"rating":"2","title":"RAINTREE COUNTY","review":"A TRUE CLASSIC FILM....ELIZABETH TAYLOR NEVER MORE BEAUTIFUL....A BIT POLITICALLY INCORRECT THESE DAYS, BUT HISTORY IS HISTORY....CAN'T BE REWRITTEN.

The only DVDs of which I am aware are some bootleg copies from Asia of the shortened/edited version.Also, the author, Ross Lockridge, Jr., had been dead for nine years at the time of the film's release ... so he would not have been able to comment on the finished version of this movie (as an earlier reviewer had suggested).:0)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Raintree County - Elizabeth Taylor & Montgomery Cliff","review":"A terrific movie made on a grand scale revolving around a young southern woman (Elizabeth Taylor) with old secrets to hide & her relationship with a northern gentleman (Montgomery Cliff).

It is very long but I think, compelling, and very educational about the Civil War. Even though it is fiction, as far as the war goes, the writing about it is based in fact.Trying to make a movie from this book just seems impossible. To do it, liberties were taken and the story changed in some major ways, including how it all ends. There are few movies that can do justice to a great book, so the movie was pretty good considering the enormity of the undertaking, but it did not do as good a job as was done with Gone With the Wind. That movie is my all-time favorite movie. However, this movie is quite good and the actors are perfectly cast, so I would definitely like to own it for that reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a total shame","review":"I have seen this movie many times over the years, and would normally have rated it 5 stars.Being an avid old movie collector, I have looked so forward to having a copy of my own.Well eventually we in South Africa were offered a copy which had to be imported from U.S.A.Excitedly I ordered it.Well of course the movie itself is wonderful and does rate 5 stars. It reflects the complexities of the old south and the civil war admirably. Elizabeth Taylor is incredible as \\"Susan\\" the tormented heroin who has fears of negro blood in her ancestry. The cinemtography is sweeping and spectaculer - but Oh My - thats where it ends.The copy I received (imported from U.S.A.) has sub-titles that cannot be turned off.

If this isn't enough to dissuade you from buying this worthless piece of garbage, then check this out: the movie has been formatted to 1.85.1 instead of the 2.35.1 so you don't even get the entire picture.

It does much to explain why \\"Old Europe\\" and the US are regarded with so much suspicion in the Middle East. It should make us aware of the dangers of colonialism and exploitation in the Middle East. It points out that the costs of maintaining a colonial regime far outweigh the benefits.I would suggest reading this book along with Noam Chomsky's \\"Hegemony or Survival.\\" The two books make it clear that we are on a disastrous course in the Middle East and in much of the rest of the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like this stuff- read it","review":"For me, this was a hard book to read without context. When I first grabbed it 7 years ago, I put it down after 50 pages. When I picked it up last month after having read more on the history of the region, I could not put it down. For anyone with an interest in Middle Eastern History, the book is fascinating and has some truly \\"truth is stranger than fiction\\" nuggets. The events surrounding Turkey's entry into the first world war, the story (myth) of T.E. Laurance, and the Dardenelles fiasco all translate into great stories and when viewed in detail serve to reiterate the idea that history is a chain of blunders rather than any kind of coherent conspiracy.The author's clear anti-British bias, not undeserved mind you, does detract a little but only because such tales stand best on their own without sarcasm. One thing that was missing, which I like to see in a book like this, is a better indication of the author's credentials or motivations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding, but difficult read","review":"This book expanded my understanding of regional politics throughout the Arab and larger Muslim world, but it WAS a difficult read. I had to power through it (especially the first half) because I did not have an existing framework of knowledge on which to hang new facts and concepts. Instead, I built as I read the book. The skeleton that I built through this book has been instrumental in future readings on the region, adding meat and muscle to my body of knowledge. I highly recommend this book. My only warning is not that it is a hard read; my warning is that, if you struggle with the content, keep reading. It is worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Understand what is going on over there","review":"This book goes a long way in explaining the difficult situation we have now in the middle east.

It is really detailed and it took me a few weeks to get through it but it is worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"overly long","review":"This book had a lot of great and interesting bits of info. At points it was extremely engaging. But these interesting bits are drowned in scores of pages filled with minutia, painful detail of small events. and although these details are very important to the bigger picture, this big picture is hard to see among these details. At times these details coalesce nicely into a coherent thought. And at other times they seem to wander off and drain your attention. For me (and I do at times have a short attention span) there weren't enough big picture portions of the book, or portions that pull details together. I feel like a lot of those small details that comprise the book made me miss some of the details that matter. But overall, good and informative work of the topic."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book simply blew me away","review":"This book simply blew me away.

Fromkin helps to explain in detail the great maneuvering and the politics that resulted in the downfall of the last great Islamic empire, and the breaking up of its territories, the effects of which can be seen to this day: The israeli-palestinian conflict, and the rise of the now corrupt house of saud which led to 9/11 to name a few.

This book provides a broad overview of the diplomatic and bureaucratic struggles that produced the settlement, from the British point of view. Unfortunately, it is poorly written, poorly edited, oddly footnoted, and generally disappointing. It almost appears to have been written in bits and pieces that were later stitched together, with little effort made to eliminate redundancy or streamline the writing. A more rigorous editing would have shortened it considerably with no loss of impact. However, the breadth of its coverage, and the importance of the topic, may make it a useful starting point for those interested in this area."},{"rating":"2","title":"History of the Middle East Made Interesting","review":"Responsible citizens of the West today cannot afford to ignore the history of the Middle East. As other reviewers here have commented, this book alone will not serve to enlighten you on all that is going on in the Middle East today. However it is a good start, and it illustrates what has worked and what has not worked in the past when the West has dealings with Middle Eastern cultures and countries. It is not an area of the world that can simply be ignored.David Fromkin did the world a favor in writing this book and makes the History of the Middle East come alive. He is thoroughly readable. This is a history book that is hard to put down once you have started. It also does much to chronicle events and battles of WWI that are not readily available in most books concerning that war, yet have perhaps had longer lasting impact on the history following."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good, solid book","review":"A Peace to End All Peace is enthralling in its reading and fascinating in scope, but a little bit of reflection after reading it brings to light some flaws. First, the history is somewhat lacking. I came to reading with a good deal of knowledge about it already, but someone without that prior knowledge might be lost. This is to some degree a reflection of Fromkin's scope, 7 or so years over a wide geographic area. Second, this book just wasn't satisfying.

However, there is not one piece that correctly goes into place.

The remaining pieces (excluding the oval and rectangle) should fit in any direction, however they are only cut to fit one way. For instance, the square (4 right angles) should fit in any direction, but it only fits one way. We are highly disappointed in this company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good in theory","review":"My 13 month old son loves this, but I unfortunately have to echo the comments that it's poorly made. The saw dust went away after a bit, and I can live with the fact that the pieces can sometimes be difficult to put in, but the biggest problem is that my son is chewing the paper off the top of the pieces. It's kind of shocking actually, that they would manufacture a product that could be chewed away so easily when the product is geared toward children that are likely to put things in their mouths! I'll probably end up throwing it out shortly, but I'm hoping to find a replacement from a different company before I do.

This fit the bill, and has been a wonderful toy that my kids seem to enjoy more and more. I like that each of the pieces will only fit in its own space - a simple idea, but a flaw I have found with many puzzles on the market. The pieces are hefty and durable, and the knobs are easy for my kids to handle. My kids are still in the habit of chewing on toys occasionally, and I've noticed just a little bit of peeling of the color on the pieces - if your child really gnaws on his/her toys still, this may not be the right toy yet. My kids have learned the basic concept of a puzzle from this toy, and they get so excited every time they get a shape in the right hole.

And when faced with a decision to purchase a competitor, there is no contest. Until now.I am really disappointed with the Jumbo Knob Puzzle Geometric Shapes. Our daughter is repeatedly frustrated with this puzzle because although the shapes are typically symmetrical, these puzzle pieces/spots are not. As a result she second guesses her correct choices, gets frustrated, unhappy and confused. This puzzle is poorly designed. The spots for each shape should have been symmetrical, just as each of these shapes actually are in real life. I agree with the other posts, a circle should never be \\"upside down\\".Unfortunately, this puzzle is going into the trash, instead of being used and enjoyed like it ought to be.

The book doesn't make judgments, and also includes information on different medical interventions available, including epidurals and other drugs, as well as a section on C-section deliveries. Based on the information in this excellent book, I chose to take a HypnoBirthing class, because I felt that it best suited my needs.

For me, not as good as a professional, but it keeps me pain-free (more or less) until I can get on the table of my therapist.The one downside to this product is the size.

Told him I saw this one for $35, he said to try it out.It takes a little getting used to, and a lot of trial and error to use it correctly, the instructions are just a bunch of pictures of someone using it don't worry the learning curve isn't steep, but when you find the good spots... it is great! The \\"S\\" curves are a little tight for bigger people, I'm 6'2\\" 275lbs and it just fits me. And I ruined a good suitcase stuffing it in on a trip. I see they have a portable one which may go on my wish-list.So what are waiting for, buy it already!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great way to quickly relieve muscle tension","review":"I bought this as a gift for my wife but I end up using it a lot, too. It takes some reading of their material to fully understand how to use it - or, more accurately, where to use it. But once you get that basic understanding, you'll find that you can easily and quickly relieve muscle tension and soreness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Safer than backknobber","review":"I bought both the backknobber and this unit. I use the backknobber at work, because it can break down into smaller size and looks clean. However, the backknobber will come apart if you press really hard for deep tissue action (it unlatches itself and shoots 1-half across the room).This is where this unit will accel and you don't have to worry about blowing it up. Another thing I like about this unit is the more aggressive cone-point on one end, oppsed to a ball-point.-1 star: This thing is UGLY omg, it looks like a sex toy and I do not want to be seen in public with it. I know 100% that other dudes will be ripping on my way more than the normal looking backknobber."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"I have been dealing with a bad shoulder for years & this allows me to perform trigger point release of the muscles that are hard to reach. I can't believe I waited soo long to break down a purchase this device. Its now something I use on a daily basis for my muscle aches, pains & tightness. Its a great way to get relief when you cant afford accupuncture or a massage!! Inexpensive life saver!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tension relief","review":"I am really happy with the purchase. It's a great way on applying pin point pressure with the strength and accuracy that only you and your body feel is right. I think it's a nice tool to have along with stretching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as a real massage but does the trick!","review":"I brought this little guy (actually, it is quite large) with me when I went on vacation to Montana. It was an 8 hour drive and by the time we got there I had developed a pain in my left shoulder blade. I couldn't even pick up my kid. I got out my trigger point manual and went to work on several trigger points with my Body Back Buddy. Within 20 minutes my pain was barely noticeable. The next day it was gone.Since then I've used this on many occasions to work on the adhesions around my shoulder blades and mid-back. Sometimes I think it would be better if there were little removable rubber pads on the ends of the knobs as sometimes it can be a bit painful. But all-in-all, it works just fine. I'm considering getting the smaller version so I can use it while at my desk at work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really works","review":"I couldn't imagine how this would help get rid of trigger points on my back but decided to give it a try. It is much, much, much better than any electric device. It actually reduces or gets rid of painful knots. I can easily reach them and apply as much or as little pressure as I want. My physical therapist recommended not only manipulating a knot with it but also applying it with a lot of pressure against a trigger point for 15 seconds. The latter technique seems to get rid of the trigger points even faster."},{"rating":"2","title":"unbelievable","review":"would never in a million years have guessed that this little thing was capable of so much. whoever invented it is a goddamn genius. It's fantastic...especially if you get knotted up easily in your back - this thing will make you cry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for knot release","review":"I like it, I use it as a more advanced way to work on these knots by myself besides using tennis balls on the ground. You can use a lot of pressure on them and it seems to work great.

Maybe I was not using it properly, but it did not relieve pain made it worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Your own massage therapist!","review":"I read reviews all the time yet rarely leave one. This product is worth writing about. My back always hurts. I do my best to avoid thinking about it, but it's true, the pain is constant. I bought the Back Buddy on the recommendation of a massage therapist. It is an incredibly useful and flexible design that allows me to find all of the sore points on my body (not just my back) and apply acupressure to those points. It hurts so good! The relief I'm getting is obvious. I truly recommend this product if you have muscle soreness and can't afford that weekly trip to the massage therapist. It costs less than a single visit for a massage or chiropractic adjustment . . . if you're on the fence, don't give it another thought and just buy it - you'll be very happy you did. This product is a winner. FYI: It stores really easily. I hang mine up in the closet with my clothes. It takes up a tiny amount of space and is always there when I need it. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended!","review":"I love using my back buddy! You can use it on your back, neck, or legs. Instructions really aren't necessary, once you get the hand of figuring out how to hold it. Just put the little nodules whereever it hurts & massage. It really has cut down on my back pain a whole lot!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Goofy looking, but cheaper than my LMT!","review":"My friends all laugh when I show them this thing. I ask them to guess what it is and I get things like 'a yard ornament?', or 'um...a sex toy?'. When I tell them what it actually does, they are dubious for sure. At least until I show them how it works. It really does work (at least for me). I think the hardest part is learning how to hold it. But one you get that down (it comes with a little book to show you how), it like having a LMT at my disposal. I was going twice a months, at $140 a pop (my co-pay was $15). Not anymore!The only complaint (and what holds back 5-stars) is there are a few spots where the plastic molding seam creates a sharp edge. It can make those areas unusable. I can sand them down, but that should have been done before shipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"BBB hits all points","review":"The Body Back Buddy is perfect for me. The different knobs provide some great relief to my trigger points especially in my lumbar and shoulder areas. It is a little big to fit in a traveling bag but thats not really a big issue.

This cane helps some!It's not a miracle device that made all my pain go away, but it certainly helps and has made it feel better. At least I know when it gets really bad, and I don't have someone around, that I can use the cane to help relax the muscles in my back and make it feel better.Looks a little strange... and when I received it at my work's shipping address, I got some funny comments about its appearance from my co-workers. lol....Anyway, I recommend it! Will it cure all pains? No. Will it help? Yes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Like Thera Cane Better!","review":"I use a Thera Cane at work alot. I work in a dental offcie and so my back is full of knots :(.What I don't like about the back buddy is it's handle.It's square. It's uncomfortable to use. I should of returned it and got a back buddy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it","review":"My wife bought me this for father's day. I tried it out several times in all different spots through out the day and evening and to me the whole thing seems useless. It didn't feel particularly good or help in any way, I had to put some strength into it where my physiatrist says I need to keep my shoulders and neck relaxed. It's a case of 'its the thought that counts' here but I'd never recommend this to anyone. Instead, marry someone who is willing to give you massages on a regular basis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Body back device","review":"It did not meet my needs as I had thought it would. I'm sure for others it would do fine, but not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most Useless Product I Have Ever Ordered","review":"I can't even begin to tell you how useless this product is. It feel like it was made by a child. It doesn't release tension but rather only causes it. I have read the \\"manual\\" which is actually a 4 page book with crappy pictures and I have also read different methods on the internet. In the end, I wish I had never purchased this trash. It pretty much hangs as a prop in my closet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Body Back Buddy","review":"This is a great tool for those with frozen shoulder problems as I have. I was surprised though to find that one of the protruding handles was broken off when it arrived. I have not contacted the seller about this because it still works fine for my needs. I did not want to interrupt my use of this product to ship it back and wait for a new replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Trigger Point Pain","review":"I have knots in my neck, upper back and scapula area that I just can't get rid off and bought this after reading an article about trigger points...muscles that have been in spasm so long they form knots. I've been diagnosed with myofascial pain syndrome and use this every evening or morning after taking a hot bath and it helps to relive the pain temporarily. I have just begun medical treatment and I need other care to deal with the knots, but the Back Buddy has been a great adjunct."},{"rating":"2","title":"LMT Loves This","review":"I wish I could work on myself as a massage therapist but its just not possible.

The different textured knobs really help with specific point work.This was worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Self Massage Tool","review":"Body Back Buddy Classic is amazing!!! I have tried them all! This is way better than any electronic massager you can buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond Excellence","review":"100/100 for the sore points in your upper back, I also love using it for my thighs as well. Not as effective as manual pressure for some areas like your arms and your neck maybe; but still, using this doesn't make your hands tired and need a second message after you massage your body."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great...sometimes","review":"This allows you to access and massage away trigger points (painful knots within muscles) virtually anyplace in your body). That being said, it can be difficult to find the painful trigger point, and often difficult to massage away the pain depending on the trigger point location. For example, anywhere on the thigh can be easy but near the middle of the back around the lower edge of the scapula can be difficult to find and figure out how to massage.The Body Back Buddy allows the application of massage pressure, and leverage virtually anyplace once you learn how for that location.There are books on trigger point massage that would be a very useful supplement to the rather paltry users manual that comes with Body Back Buddy."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"I love the back buddy. I have shoulder, hip, neck and low back pain issues almost everyday due to laborious job for 10 yrs now. This tool is very handy, I use it a few times a week at minimum. Can be used in the hot tub too. Very affordable for what money I save by not needing to rush to the chiropractor or for massage, helps my body last longer between doc. visits. I would definitely recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"MoBo","review":"I bought the Body Back Buddy after seeing a friend's. In August I woke up to my left hand \\"frozen\\". I was unable to move it for a few minutes and even after that it was stiff. I decided to see a chiropracter. After about 10 visits where she did pressure points my hand was better. Unable to afford regular visits, I was looking for something to help me that I could use myself. The Body Back Buddy is it. I find that if I use it once or twice a day, my fingers loosen up. It is amazing. Who would know that the muscles in my neck and shoulders control my hands and fingers. I will keep using this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great design","review":"I have back pain, shoulder pain, neck pain. I used to go for massage 1-2 times a week. Most of the time, the massage therapist could not go deep enough into the \\"sweet\\" spot. Now, I use this product every day and I can pin point the specific area and press as hard as I want. It is a great design. I study the meridian points and this product has the ability to do 2-3 pressure points at one time. It surely does help blood circulation and the knots on my back are getting smaller. The only limitation of this product is it \\"gives\\" a little when I press really hard (Sorry, I like deep tissue massage). Overall it is a great product, I spend more time with it than with my husband!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this thing rocks!","review":"I'm not a flexible person and this makes self massage possible for me.

So know it's more \\"athlete\\" than \\"spa\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got the knot out!","review":"My husband had a knot/spasm in his back that would NOT go away for weeks, even after physical therapy and muscle relaxers. Out of desperation, he found this product online and decided to give it a try.

This is well worth the $25 or so it cost!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissappointed","review":"Well it started off well.

So off to spend $$ on something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Informative, Highly Recommended","review":"Dr. Canter's book is the best book I have read on the subject of criminal profiling. Unlike most other books on the topic, like the ones written by former FBI profilers, Dr. Canter lucidly explains how to construct a profile of serial rapists and killers. This book is also an introduction to Investigative Psychology, a field of study developed by Dr. Canter et. al. Worth reading for anyone interested in serial murder and criminal profiling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"This was a really boring book.

Specifically, a novel a few years ago called Fake Liar Cheat by Tod Goldberg handled the subject of unwitting fame in a funny, dark way that this novel does not yet quite approach. The sense is that the author likes the scene and aches for the acceptance herself. No one wants to read a book that seems counterintuitive to the author's true goals. The book does serve as a decent beach read but fails to strike new ground. If you want the primers, get Fake Liar Cheat, or Day of the Locust or even Why Sammy Ran."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this movie","review":"I can't stop watching this movie..

Meet the Robinsons has none of the bells and whistles of other high-budget (CG) movies, and yet it still manages to be entertaining throughout the whole movie, unlike a certain CG movie with a green monster as the lead.Lewis and co. are fun and lovable.

But people from the future have different plans for his invention, and Louis is taken into the future where he meets a family full of odd quirks. The style and art are very reminiscent of Jimmy Neutron, glossy, fun and entertaining.The adventure to fix matters turns out to be quick-paced with lots of thrilling visuals, wrapping up too soon. The story has its heart in the right place, and it's an enjoyable ride. The Danny Elfman score is sticky in its sweetness. The theme ties in nicely with a quote from creative visionary, Disney.

This was somewhat disappointing, but the movie is still worth a purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite as good as other recent animated features","review":"In recent years there have certainly been a lot of good animated movies that appeal to both kids and adults: Robots, Flushed Away, Ice Age, Shrek and The Incredibles to name a few. Others just didn't cut it, such as Happy Feet or Surf's Up. Meet the Robinsons falls somewhere in between the good and the bad. I just don't think it has enough to keep the kids interested for the whole movie. One reviewer complained about the simplistic plot. I thought it got a little complicated at the end for younger kids. There is some funny stuff here, but not as funny as many of the other good animated features. The animation quality seemed a bit poor at a couple of places too. The plot seemed like a cross between Robots and Back to the Future. The movie was NOT a disappointment, but I had expected a little better from the Disney/Pixar people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite kid movie of all time!","review":"Until I saw this movie, Cars and Toy Story 2 were my favorite kid movies.

Since we rented it a few weeks ago, I've watched this movie about 15 times already, start to finish. I'm a huge movie person, and not usually big on kid movies, and I LOVE this movie. It's fun, has a great message, and I just love the ending. Sure, it's sappy but it gets me every time - yes, I'm a weeper and I literally weep every single time I watch the ending. I'm a 34 year old adult who only recently started watching kid movies b/c of our own child and this is one of the best I've seen, actually for me - a mom, THE best.

With films like \\"Open Season\\" and \\"Flushed Away\\" becoming increasingly popular, it's hard to find a good, plot and character driven family film- without the dirty, gross-out humor and innuendo which plagues so many movies today.The plot is simple, and starts off reminding me *loosely* of the movie Annie. The movie continues on rather fast, and some parts were predictable (Maybe because I was thinking about all of the \\"What if's\\".I saw this with a friend of mine (She's 14 I'm 16) and we both adored it.Although- during part with \\"Doris\\" I could just *hear* the Sephiroth theme music playing in the background (as could she).A very endearing movie, great characters, plot, and animation to boot!

Whatever the producers were aiming at, I didn't get it, and I doubt my adopted 4 or 6 year old daughters would either. They would get the early scene about the main character's despair over ever being adopted, then they would have quickly lost interest in the confusing dialog that follows for the next 45 minutes and simply have been left with a very negative message about adoption.If I could give this a zero, I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"serious adoption issues","review":"The main character can't get adopted, even though he is smart, he's too old.

This has happened on two copies of the DVD we've purchased. Are other people experiencing this?

I get a little annoyed at the part where the main character meets a future family that has many bizarre quirks. You can tell it's supposed to be silly, but it's rather annoying to guys. There's a moment that could be scary for kids, where this future family turns into mind-controlled zombies in a dark and polluted industrial world of the future.

I had somehow missed this little gem of of a duel role for Bette Davis. Well worth watching as the technology was just arriving back in the 1960's and this thriller of movie is well acted, black and black,great sets, just has something to it that few can create this days.Just sit back and enjoy two Bette's for the price of one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Margaret, this is Edith. I know EVERYTHING.\\"","review":"...and thus begins the murderous switcheroo fun in DEAD RINGER, my very favorite Bette Davis movie. When people imitate Davis today -- with the overarching mannerisms, punctuated by cigarette smoke and that emphatic, raspy voice -- it's the Bette Davis who sashays through DEAD RINGER. A first-rate cast and a few William Castle-like \\"shocker\\" moments (not terribly shocking, really) make this twist-filled psychological thriller a delectable romp not to be missed. Three cheers for Warner Home Video for bringing DEAD RINGER, in widescreen, to DVD!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A somewhat overlooked camp classic","review":"I hesitate to use the term 'camp' for fear that it makes it sound like this is a bad movie. It's not; it definitely holds your attention. Davis's performance, though at times going a little over the top, is basically convincing. Interesting that Davis here repeats her stint of playing dual roles (twins) just as she did in A Stolen Life, and repeats the process of conveniently assuming the place of a dead twin (just like in A Stolen Life), this time with new moral ambiguity. I've seen this one two or three times since my youth and always enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Dead Ringer\\"","review":"I love Betty Davis and this movie was terrific with her playing twin sisters. I saw this movie years ago and this was the first time I was able to get it on dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"2ND TIME'S A CHARM!!!!!!","review":"This movie is the second time that Bette Davis plays twin sisters who are at odds with one another, due to the one twin's greedy appetite and distorted sense of entitlement to acquire EVERYTHING and ANYONE she wants, despite the feelings of others.The first time out, this movie was titled, \\"A Stolen Life\\"; that version is mild. On this go-round, the title \\"Dead Ringer\\" has more than an ominous meaning; it is a tale that proves that anger and revenge never yield anything good... It is a must see movie, and will have you biting your fingernails figuring out how this story will turn out! And seeing Bette Davis portray two separate individuals was excellently done. The side by sides of the twin sisters is well crafted; considering all of the special effects technology that is available today. Also, Karl Malden plays a gentleman like no other in this movie! This second time around is worth every minute of viewing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great fun","review":"While this is an older Bette Davis, she still has what it takes to heat up the screen. If you are like me and tend to think she looks \\"scary\\" as she ages, then you will find her perfect for this role as a murderess double crossing twin sister."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just bad","review":"This film is bad. I love me some Bette Davis and even her bad movies are good, but this one just crosses the line. For her to think she would ever get away with it is beyond ridiculous, a miscast Karl Malden over-acts atrociously and the ending lands with a resounding and very predictable thud. Just not a very good film.

He was as gay in 1945 as he is here, lo those many years later. He's certainly not the sort of lothario/protagonist that could ever set any woman's wheels in motion.Davis, after \\"Baby Jane\\" and \\"Hush, Hush\\" looks, deservedly so, exhausted. Like she doesn't even want to be a part of this mess, though she gives it her best shot. She's a mess, he's a mess, everyones a mess mess. But here they are, throwing the mess in our faces and, as far as Davis is concerned, down our throat.For Davis, it's not a bad turn. She's okay. She rises above the decidely Grade B material with aplomb. Her twin sister act, while not convincing, is enjoyable to watch.But an exhausted Bette Davis has a tendency to exhaust the viewer. Toss in Peter Lawford and it bcomes a defintion of \\"yawn\\". He can't act and she's trying her best, at this stage of the game. TWICE!!!!!!!!!!!! She's twins, you know.Silly fare, but for Davis fans, well, it's Davis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bette at her most tacky","review":"This movie is only worth watching if you are a die-hard Bette Davis fan, otherwise, forget it. This is also Bette at the end of her amazing career, a sort of last gasp before age and a string of mediocre movies forced her into semi-retirement. This is her last decent film, though it drags in long stretches and the plot is silly, contrived and stupid. Peter Lawford gives a thoroughly forgetable performance as her boyfriend. Karl Malden is good, but his character is pathetically stupid. Wake up, Karl, your girlfriend is a murderer!If you love Bette Davis, you'll watch her recite the phone book.

The book also tries to teach the statistics to a degree, which one can see as an annoyance (just teach me R!) or helpful if you are shaky on your stats. The book also lists a fair number of references to other books on S-plus and R to help point you in the direction towards achieving a higher level of adeptness and other references to learn more about the topics covered in the book.The book also has exercises at the end of each chapter to get you into R and using the system. The answers to the exercises are not in the book, but are available in pdf format on the books corresponding website."},{"rating":"2","title":"limited review...","review":"I found this book to be quite useful for learning R, and for pointing out the pitfalls for new users. It's especially good to know that there is a website associated with the book that will allow you to download the code used in the book.There are several good free R resources out there, but in the end I think you get what you pay for. In this case it was nice to have a hard-bound reference with an index and appendix that I could highlight and dog-ear.I mostly used it as a book for learning R, and not as a stats book. I did notice that there were many good examples of common statistical applications, such as t-stat tests, residual plotting, and the like. In other words, I feel like I got my money's worth by just using a few chapters and the appendix."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have bought \\"The R Book\\" Instead....","review":"I got this book over Crawley's (The R Book) since the Amazon reviews said that this one was more organized than Crawley's.. however, even if that is true (maybe.. but Crawley's organization does not bother me), this book does not have half of what \\"The R Book\\" has, and their GLM chapter is a poor explanation of the function.I highly recommend purchasing Crawley's book over this one. This one is not horrible, but was not sufficient for me. Lucky for me I have online access to Crawley's book for free, which has saved me in some spots, along w/ the online R-help websites and list serves.This book definitely doesn't hurt to have though, but if you are looking to only buy one book, I would not rely solely on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Statistics Course Materials","review":"I purchased Data Analysis and Graphics Using R for an introductory course in applied statistics for the Biologcal Sciences.

In many ways, the film is faithful to the original storyline from A Night at the Opera (1935), and yet so different. You got your stanbard Harpo's Everything-stuffed0into-my-coat gag, fast-talking hustlers, and while it lacks the beloved exaggerated moustache and eyebrows, the wit is all there, updated for a new era.

Instead he examines the paradoxes and everyday experiences of life and claims that Christianity better explains life than alternate worldviews. His ideas are more a collections of life's observations rather than a carefully crafted polemic. Chesterton does have a flair for language and uses many analogies to illustrate his points. If you are looking for a book to quote there are many good quotable points in this book.

In 2012 I am discovering pure unpopularity as a reflection of the vile nature of consensus. An individual writer like Chesterton can do amazing things with Christianity.

I think one reason is that I love a great book, and while I don't have a ton of time to read on my own anymore, as a father, full-time philosophy teacher and husband, I seem to spend it re-reading great works. This is most certainly one of them. Even if you are not religious, it is a great read. Now with the Kindle version, I can easily track my favorite quotes and highlights. I have seen no wit like Chesterton. He is accessible to all mature readers. I absolutely adore his humor and charm as a writer.

More disturbing still was the underlying racism and elitism woven throughout the fabric of this so-called testimonal on faith.

As brilliant of a man Mr. Chesterton was, his lines of thought are sometimes difficult to trace. Throughout the book I found myself repeatedly asking, \\"Now what was he talking about...how did we arrive here...where is he going with this;\\" the overall journey is a wild ride. A rather large percentage of his references and illustrations are far too localized and restricted to GK's time and town - even though his lessons are timeless. I felt myself wishing I was reading his newspaper and conversing with his contemporaries in their cafes. This is evidenced by the amount of footnotes strung throughout in an attempt to clue in the reader. Overall, this book is a treasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could be the next king of New York","review":"This is his first solo album and nearly every songs are already classics and the others are good songs.This is a must have in your cd collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mild addiction - beware","review":"I take these with a multivitamin.

The clearest magnification is in the direct center and the viewing area inside the eyepiece is fairly small. People with vision difficulties may have problems using this tool as getting the correct balance between distance from the tool and distance from the object is a bit cumbersome.I would recommend this tool to film photographers and anyone else who needs to occasionally use a loupe, but for hobby work (model makers, etc) or professional use (watchmakers, electronics repair) I would suggest looking for a better tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"A balanced, academic view on the history of buddhist thought","review":"A balanced and unbiased history of the evolution of buddhist thought.

The Ginger movies would never be made today - these Politically Correct times would never allow it - but this, the last and most expensive of the three, concentrates more on the plot than the gleeful sleazery of the first two films, making it less of a successful Ginger film and more of a failed spy movie.

By the time of this project, he had already established himself as the kingpin of the funk/soul family.

This shows James Brown at a 360 degree perspective. You will see sides to his songwriting that you may not see on any of his other recordings.

I did find the lack of vocabulary to be off setting, as it felt that there was a lot of repetition and redundancy of actions and descriptive terms (pebbles, that's all I'm saying). I loved the characterization of each character, but would have been thrilled to have some more input on Willy's end, as he was a big factor for other.... factors. Otherwise, I did really like this novel and would recommend it to hopeless romantics that enjoy pursuing odd loves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corny cliche","review":"I sure don't understand the 32 five star ratings that prompted me to purchase this book.

Repainted in oils, there are small discrepancies between the original deck and the golden rider that any searcher should be able to see. What is most intriguing about this deck is the way the images change-- at least for me. However, like the Rider-Waite Deck, it relies heavily on Christianity symbols and interpretations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insulting","review":"I purchased a deck of these cards based somewhat on the reviews here, and also because I am a professional reader and enjoy collecting various renderings of the Rider deck. Basically, I am appalled at the artwork. The paintings seem unprofessional in the extreme, as though painted by an untalented child. For example, the facial expression of The Fool is grotesque to say the least; the lady depicted in The Star seems to have a huge black eye; and the rendering of the IX of Pentacles lady seems quite cartoonish. These pictures are gross from beginning to end. In my opinion they are an affront to the tradition of the Rider deck. I am aghast that U.S. Games should publish them at all. The only reason I gave the deck two stars instead of one is because of the physical quality of the cards. They seem to be of an extremely high quality, thereby making it quite easy to handle and shuffle them. The pictures, however, are so repulsive that I will be handling and shuffling them no more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A CLASSIC, \\"MUST-HAVE\\" for ANYONE who loves great music.....PERIOD!","review":"Of all the Wes Montgomery's albums, I would have to say that this one was his best (although I have them all, and love them all).

I was expecting much more in the way of \\"Full House\\" by Wes... true jazz guitar, lots of original tunes, etc. This album is OK, but it is cheesy.. .. strings, overly orchestral arrangements, etc. If it's a childhood favorite that's one thing but don't go in expecting great jazz.

I mean if you're going to sell out, you have to sell out to SOMEONE. If everyone recognized it for what it is, there wouldn't be an filthy lucre in it and no point to it.I disagree with one of the reviewers that anything that evokes the sixties in any way is necessarily good (and just because you happened to grow up in the sixties, as did I, doesn't make the sixties inherently wonderful). Hucksterism was as annoying then as it is now, in the naughts. I laughed the first time I heard the title track, but the joke wasn't funny the second time. I don't really think it's a matter of live and let live, each to his own, there's no accounting for taste, etc. No, I think Muzak (and this IS Muzak--with a different brand name) much more insidious, much more oppressive.

(I don't really mind, it is nice to see him enthusiastic about something other than a video game.) The book might be considered a 'Mineralogy 101' and has been a very good textbook to introduce the science to my budding mineralogist. Not really having the same interest, I wouldn't be able to tell you if the book would be a good reference for someone already familiar with mineralogy. The things my nephew likes best is it filled in gaps of his knowledge of crystalline structures & how they form & how the formations affect what you do with them (faceting).

Unfortunately, I was rather disappointed.The book begins with a fairly weak introduction to Objective-C and Cocoa, and then launches into telling you what lines to pound in to Project Builder and what buttons to click in Interface Builder in order to compile programs that Apple has written. While these \\"tutorials\\" provide no real room for guided independent development, they do have some worth for learning good Cocoa development procedures and for getting in to the habit of writing Cocoa code.All in all, Learning Cocoa didn't advance my knowledge very far, and I don't see myself counting on it as a reference at any point in the future. I'd stay away from this one unless you're a Cocoa book collector or something odd like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new here...","review":"Basically a rehash of the documentation that is available on the OS X Developer CD and Apple's web site. Frankly, I think it's shameful that Apple is, on the one hand, chastising developers for not embracing X, while, on the other, failing to document the X development environment. Learning Cocoa covers just the basics while leaving the most intriguing and potentially useful aspects of the environment unexplained. That shouldn't be a surprise, I suppose, since the most popular phrase in the current collection of developer documentation is \\"Description forthcoming.\\" Sheesh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written rehash of publicly available materials","review":"Learning Cocoa is a a poorly ogranized rehash of materials that are freely offered by Apple Computer's website.

I see there's a second edition of this book due in September 2002 - hopefully this'll either pep up the existing content, or add something more (published paper documentation for the Cocoa frameworks is non-existent, probably because some of the on-line documentation I've looked at still has big gaping holes in it - and people wonder why Carbonized apps outnumber those that use Cocoa...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor construction & minimal content","review":"This is the only computer book I have ever purchased whose pages began to fall out within hours of its arrival.

I folded them inside the bag. There is also a waist strap that is too much of a pain. I folded it up and stuck the excess into side pockets (you don't even notice it).. you know, I might as well cut them off.It has 3 main pockets.

The flaws are minor: 1) The zipper of the pen-holder compartment has a habit of coming apart, so don't put anything you don't want to lose in there.

Belleville truly takes you on a trip into the past and on into the present. His humor and his way with words will not disappoint you. This is one of those books you will share with friends and take off of the shelf frequently. How did Belleville know to write a book just for me?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of history in a little book","review":"For those of us who love the St. Johns, this is a wonderful trip, downriver, back in time, and into the unique terrain and history of wilderness Florida. I had the good fortune to meet Belleville at a reading, and the better fortune to meet him through this excellent book. Belleville is a writer with an eye to detail, be it historical, scientific, or in the observation of human nature. His sense of humor is apt, and he clearly loves the subject. My great hope is that this book will bring the right kind of visitor to this beautiful place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, excellent price","review":"This book is as promised and I am so pleased to have it. Thank you very much for a smooth transaction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfort on Car trips","review":"While not a revolutionary idea, the shape and design of this product are marvelous for those with lumbar support needs. My acunpuncturist provided me with my Huggar. The packaging also says it is helpful for those with upper back pain, esp between the shoulder blades - when used at home, supine for a 15 minute stretch session. I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"T.K. and Mike: Deer Hunting","review":"My husband is an avid deer hunter and loves to watch a variety of deer hunting dvds; the humorous as well as the serious.

Judy stars as Esther Blodget, a wannabe star who is traveling with her band until she meets up with Norman Maine, James Mason. They don't exactly fall in love at first sight, but he ends up growing on her. Then, one tragedyafter another happens to them until one of them dosen't make it out alive. A brilliant film that everyone should see. Features magnificent songs like, \\"The man that got away\\". Enjoy!!!6 ACADEMY AWARD NOMINATIONS:[1954] BEST ACTRESS-JUDY GARLANDBEST ACTOR-JAMES MASONBEST ART DIRECTION/SET DECORATION[COLOR]BEST SCORE FROM A MUSICAL PICTUREBEST COSTUME DESIGN [COLOR]BEST SONG \\"THE MAN THAT GOT AWAY\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie made me believe in Conspriacy Theories!","review":"This was a great film! Truly one of the greatest and it was chopped to pieces and whole scenes were conveniently \\"lost\\". Might this have been to control and put Judy Garland in her place. The answer has to be yes. Her performance was so brilliant (a real shock to people who think she only sang) and the film such a masterpiece that the money people were afraid to let her have a success. Garland so obviously deserved to win the oscar but did not (the excellent Loretta Young did) and the studio and money people had so many excuses to bury the film and it's potential. So now that it is finally arriving on DVD we finally get a chance to see more of what should have been."},{"rating":"2","title":"I quote: \\"One of Hollywood's supreme triumphs.\\"","review":"After its 1954 premier, the film was shortened for its wider release. In 1983, it was restored to near its original running time. It remains one of more iconic stories of Hollywood with all its heartache and fame intact. The film itself is \\"one of Hollywood's supreme triumphs\\" and the new transfer is breathtaking on Blu-ray.Judy Garland is a band-singer guided to the pinnacle of success by a former star (James Mason) who is an alcoholic. George Cukor's stylish direction is strangely exhilarating even as the story moves to its inexorable and tragic end"},{"rating":"2","title":"Judy At Her Best","review":"Anyone with a love for Judy Garland must own ASIB. It is Judy finest performance. She takes her talent to new levels with her costar, James Mason. She tears your heart out with every lyric. The film is completely heartbreaking with just enough of a conclusion to make you feel like Esther/Vicki will be the person she once was. Kudos to Warner Bros. for allowing Judy and Sid to make such a brilliant piece of work. Anyone who is a fan of classic movies, musicals or Judy Garland is lacking the biggest part of their collection if they are lacking this."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Star is Born Fails to Capture Audience's Sympathy","review":"A Star Is Born is a disturbing film for all the wrong reasons. By failing to get the audience to sympathize with a movie star's tragic downfall, the film displays a schizophrenic quality. There is almost a breakdown in the relationship between the audience and what happens on screen. This is in no part due to the performances by the lead actors; it's the nature of the material itself. Perhaps if we were to see the James Mason character as a likeable star before failure and booze drain away his ambition and reason for living, the audience would understand what the Garland character sees in him and we could sympathize with both characters. Instead, we see Garland's character despairing over a not very likeable washed-up drunk and we're left feeling as empty as the film itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most Annoying!","review":"I found this DVD release of A STAR IS BORN impossible to watch. The all-too-frequent use of stills over a sound track was extremely annoying. I praise the attempt to recreate Cukor's original concept...but I do not praise the results. I would much rather have seen two versions on the DVD, one with the poor stills-and-dialogue recreation of what was hacked out, and one that's at least watchable. I have to confess that I didn't make it through the entire movie. I couldn't! It was too annoying. I think they should have waited until somebody somewhere can locate missing footage. (However, it's still better than the Streisand/Kristofferson abortion!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why watch this when you can watch the '37 version?","review":"I generally dislike remakes and this was no exception. I felt that any seriousness the story had was scattered abroad like dandelion fuzz at the hand of the continual musical breeze. I would not care to ever watch this again.My two stars go entirely to James Mason, who did a very good job here in amongst the melodious maelstrom. I though the scene when he proposed to Esther was quite clever, and probably the only thing really memorable about this poor excuse of a remake. Judy Garland was simply too old for the part and lacked the fresh youthful enthusiasm of Janet Gaynor in the '37 version, which you should see by all means rather than this one, because it is far superior in all ways."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quit all the singing!","review":"I got this at the library, because we wanted to see how it compared to the 1937 version with Fredric March. Well, we didn't think much of this movie. First of all, there was too much singing. I don't mind singing in some movies if it is good ( as in The Sound of Music, Elvis' King Creole and Jailhouse Rock, etc.), but I do not care for Judy Garland's singing. Secondly, I felt Judy was too old for the part. I think she would have been much better in her younger days when she was fresh and beautiful. Thirdly, I didn't see much chemistry between Judy and James Mason. I still feel the 1937 version is best; while I like James Mason (and he is the reason I give this film 2 stars), I felt Fredric March was much better in the Norman Maine role. I was a bit bored throught the viewing and was glad when it was over and it is a film I will never watch again."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Dud!","review":"This is without a doubt both Judy Garlands and James Mason's worst movies!What a shame becasue they are truly both truly talented but this one just wasn't up to par with their talents!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A true classic","review":"Yes, it's overlong and dated but not particularly campy. It is Judy and James Mason at their finest and a still-potent critique of the Hollywood star system. If you've never seen it, it's a must. I tried to find it to rent or buy around Oscar time this year, but no store in my area had it. It would be terrible if this film, which underwent a lengthy and historic restoration in the 1980's, went out of print or became impossible to find in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Judy's Best!","review":"If half of this film hadn't been left on the editing room floor in 1954, it would have been recognized for the last 50 years for what it was (and is): one of the greatest movies of all time!(As a sidenote, I loath Babs for, among other things, making her own version of \\"A Star is Born\\". Her vain overacting stands in stark contrast to Judy Garland's genuine and inspired performance.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A STAR TOOO FAR!","review":"LOVE this film and was truly excited that deleted scenes were included to improve the richness of it from it's original release.this was not an impovment.these added scenes only extended the time making a classic almost boring...and musical number meaningless.this aside garland is at her best as well mason,who also gives a very fine and sensitive performance not always mentioned as garland is a hard act to follow.go ahead and get it the second disc has history not always found in delux editions."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Star\\" is shining on DVD","review":"The much awaited DVD release of \\"A Star is Born\\" is finally here. The release was delayed several months, and those of us who tryly love this film hoped that the delay meant that a complete print of the uncut original roadshow film had somehow been located. We have been grateful with the reconstruction, although stills had to be used where footage was not available. Someone must have this footage, as the film was in general release when the cuts were made.Even so, it is so great to see it in DVD and in widescreen. Warners treatment of their musicals is usually pretty shabby, and it took them a LONG time to release \\"Star\\" on DVD and widescreen. it seems that every other movie in their catalog was released EXCEPT \\"Star\\". The ghost of Jack Warner in action? He hated the film and Judy and Sid Luft as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"Judy in one of her best performances. If you are a fan of Judy Garland, this in a must see. I have seen it several times but wanted it for my movie library. James Mason does a terrific job in his role."},{"rating":"1","title":"A rip off is born","review":"Ok suckered in. This is one of the great movies of our time and this is a nice new fresh print, but no better or worse than the last DVD print of the film. Deluxe what? Special why? Very very little here that was not on the previous DVD release, just a few different angles and yet another couple of dress versions of \\"Man that Got Away\\". Totally unnecessary if you have the original DVD version. I believe there is complete versions of the film floating about,will we ever see them?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay but not great!","review":"I like Judy Garland as both an actress and a singer but this was definitely not one of her best movies, Judy did do a good job with her performance and James Mason did do a good job with his portrayal of the alcoholic husband but the movie in general was uneven and flawed despite their talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"This is a great book to get started with that gives you a full overview of Axapta, including installation, the essential business functionality, administration and development. Good set of appendixes for reference. If you are experienced in you area you should be able to figure out whatever you need once you have read the book. Even experienced users will benefit from reading the chapters they don't normally work with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Axapta Book","review":"It is nice to see some books on Axapta finally coming out. This is a solid book with alot of information on Axapta. I would classify this book as a detailed overview of Axapta directed mostly at system administrators, developers and Axapta consultants. It is a great starting point if you are new to Axapta.Although the authors in the intro state end users can use this book most of the material is going to be a little deep for them. The chapters on end user functionality are okay but limited. But alot of ground is covered in a relatively concise manner. Good job. I didn't give it 5 stars because I would have liked to seem more information on application class and table structures of Axapta."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I spent weeks agonizing through the product documentation and various web sites and it didn't get me anywhere near where this book got me in days. I wish the book had been published a little earlier, and hope to see some books now exploring the different topics covered in the book in detail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just an overview","review":"Well, any dax related book is welcomed since we don't have many.It's not that the books is bad for its purpose, but like the other negative reviewers say, it's just a general overview book that is not enough to scrape the surface of it and that is the truth. Someone should come up with sceries of books that concentrate on a module at a time.So, if you are expecting too much and in a situation of doing dirty practical hands-on stuffs...working with MorphX and X++ through the maze of classes, data dics, forms, etc, you shouldn't expect too much from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book - get a copy today.","review":"This is an excellent book. It is comprehensive and well written. This book should be read by anyone who is either considering purchasing Dynamics AX or has recently purchased the product. All new users will learn a great deal of information from this book. In fact, all good resellers of Dynamics AX should include a copy of this book at no charge with a sales quote to a potential customer. If I had this book two years ago, I could have saved my company several thousands of dollars in consulting fees alone. This book is an excellent \`jump start' to gain overall Axapta knowledge, and is a great value for the money.

You can get a CD called Axapta Multi-Media LXCD-MM00-D000000 10/3 from your local Axapta provider that tells the same story. This book is so basic and has no meat to it.

I do not understand why people are spending their times to write a second help menu."},{"rating":"1","title":"incredibly horrible","review":"I go to a Catholic high school and am in the tenth grade. I must say that this book fails utterly in what it is striving to do, to give teenagers an interesting base for their faith in Jesus. I think that it would be so much better if we just studied straight out of the bible. Right now I am studying for a midterm in Religion based on this text book. It is so disillusioning what people do with Chrisianity. They focus so much on the religion part that they forget the true meaning of faith in Christ. I have read the whole bible through a number of times, in addition to devouring any book I can get my hands on. This is not good material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Interesting","review":"This book strives to make a young person interested in their faith. However it is completely saturated with higher criticism. It does not strengthen a persons faith but rather it brings doubts. Infact throughout the entire book they seem to remind you that our faith is based on nothing but a book, a book that may be fatally flawed.Of course if you like that stuff this is the book for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Planting seeds of doubt","review":"I bought this because my son's Catholic religion teacher is still using it suplementally, and I wanted to check it out. I question whether the author is really Catholic. It is texts such as this that lead students away from truth. I would recommend the Didache series developed by Scott Hahn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Concerned Parent","review":"This book is based on a very flawed Christology that denies the divinity of Jesus. It brings doubt, not faith. It has been found by the American bishops to not be in conformity with the Catechism of the Catholic Church. I am appalled that there are Catholic high schools who are still using this text."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Pictures or table of contents","review":"This edition is very incomplete. I should have done more research and found a better publisher. There is no picture or table of contents, just jumps right into the stories without intro or explanation. I wouldn't mind that if there were at least a table of contents to direct my use of the book. I also haven't started reading the stories to my kids just yet, but the idea is that this is a collection of classics, so I am eager to dive in soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"My biggest problem with this book is there is no table of contents. Every time I look for a particular story, I have to look through the entire volume, which contains maybe forty fairy tales, maybe more. I just can't fathom how any publisher would have thought this incomplete volume would be a good idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nostalgic","review":"Did our mothers really read these stories to us?? I was so surprised when I started reading these stories aloud to my husband. I thought it would be fun to reminisce since I did my very first book report on one of the stories in this book. But when I read the stories, one after the other, I was shocked to see the violence in each one. I guess the memory filters out the bad stuff, or else my mother gave her own rendition of the endings. It was fun, though, to go back to the old stories and read the classics. But don't delude yourself about the \\"good old days.\\" They were just as violent as they are today! And that goes for cartoons as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been a lot better...","review":"I love Pandora Peaks as a person, and I can't get enough of her body, but this movie left me disappointed. I know that this is an artistic project for her...whatever, but you get plenty of repeat footage, and sometimes you end up with better views of the camera crew than you do Pandora herself. I liked the discussions with her, and the one redeeming thing about this film was that Pandora seems like a really nice, down-to-earth lady. If I was to add anything to this show it would be better continuity...and more material of her in the swimming-pool. Pandora should fire her director and get someone else for any new projects in the future.In conclusion, if I wasn't already a Pandora fan I'd be extremely saddened. I'd recommend Playboy's Voluptuous Vixens II in lieu of this for anyone who wants to see better footage of Pandora."},{"rating":"2","title":"OH MAN IS PANDORA HOT!!!!!!","review":"Not only does Pandora have a nice set of monster melons, but she also has a real nice big ...!!! Sometimes you see these giant breasted types have ... but no body or no face leaving you with just an ugly bag with big .... But in this video, you will witness the HOT and SIZZLING Pandora Peaks. You will experience outrageous stunts mostly topless, in bikinis, or totally naked. My only complaint is i personally can do without the annoying dialogue, the euro-trash/disco music, and the semi-boring photo shoots. It would be fun and successful i think to see Pandora in a video that concentrates only on her being TOTALLY naked in public. Overall, great video, very well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great introduction to palm useage","review":"I'm brand new to the world of palm computing and I found the page-by-page/hands-on tips very user friendly. The title is a bit of a misnomer -- it takes longer than ten minutes to make much sense of the palm platform, but *several* ten minute sessions expanded my use of my new IIIx. Dividing the book by lessons makes orientation easy and makes it simple to return to the book as a reference; the index seems skimpy, however. \\"Teach Yourself\\" is a greater benefit than the owner's book which accompanied the palm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very simple book - reads as like an instruction manual","review":"The book's title is \\"Palm Pilot in 10 Minutes\\" and this is true. The book focuses on the basics.It is good for what it is, an intro to the Palm Pilot.Good book to have around for beginners who are not technically inclined.I literally read the book in 10 minutes and then gave it to a colleague.The book does not go into applied implementations for corporate sales teams and or executive staff. (No coverage on Notes, Exchange, Goldmine, Outlook, ...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what it says on the box","review":"Used these wall stickers to decorate for a superhero birthday party - they looked great! Very sticky but did not leave a residue when we took them down and moved them into the birthday boy's bedroom. Unfortunately, while they went on our textured walls great, a lot of the appliques don't *stay* on, and slowly peel off over time. However, this is not at all a deficiency of the product! Our walls are heavily textured, so I was surprised they stuck at all and stayed in place for as long as they did. In my son's room, some of them haven't moved at all in months, so if your walls are smooth or only slightly textured, these should work just fine.The range of sizes is pretty big - some of the decals are only about 2\\" in diameter, while others are 14\\" X 16\\". We used two sets of Superman decals, this and a slightly different set, and between the two got good coverage in a standard 13' X 13' room."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD BUT UNIFICATION WAS BETTER","review":"Unification was a landmark album, hard to beat for anyone, even the creators themselves. Dark Assault has some great #'s like 'Seek and Destroy' and 'Solar Winds', the chorus section on 'Made of Metal' will make you want to pull over - guaranteed. However the opening track 'Never Say Die' does not measure upto 'Coming Home' in Unification. Opening tracks define the album so right there it fades somewhat but picks up on the next 2 tracks and trk 7. The tempo is not maintained as tightly as Unification. Iron Savior does the best covers having done Priest's 'Desert Plains' superbly and Sab's 'Neon Knight' - just awesome, the last song is a Priest cover 'Delivering the Goods'. Great stuff but could have been done better since the talent is in place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old, Same old....","review":"This is the 4th Iron Savior album that I have and it will be that last. Iron Savior started out with a couple of strong albums but then the cracks started to appear.Dark Assault is just like each of their preceeding discs. The band has not progressed at all. The music is well done technically, but cold and uninviting.The greatest flaw; however, is the drum-work (Thomen Stauch). The same beat over and over and over--this wouldn't be so bad except that it crosses over into their earlier albums making each album sound largely identical. It's so bad that after a couple of listens, it's difficult to not believe that Iron Savior is using a drum-machineExtremely poor drum-work seems to be a staple of many recent power metal bands, and Iron Savior, sadly, is no exception. Maybe they should hire Sir K Luttinen (The Black League) for an example of how to make the skins sound like an additional instrument instead of just the mindless banging put out by Stauch."},{"rating":"1","title":"I liked Iron Savior, but this....","review":"Iron Savior started with a great concept, building a story through their music across 3 CDs... but now the story is now long dead. I hoped that they would have started with a new one for this CD, but they're just dragging it on and on and on... This CD has some pretty amazing gutar work, but its just not enough to save the CD from its almost annoying lyrics and killed off concept.If Iron Savior rises again with a new story, I will be the first in line to buy it, but this CD, you can do without."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful View of the Settling of Cape Cod","review":"This is a wonderful version of the settling of Cape Cod. The story begins before the boats arrive in the New World and follows a family's struggle through the present time. The history is interwoven with his fictional town. I read this after I visited Cape Cod for the first time and loaned my copy to a friend from the area. It didn't find its way home and I bought another copy. Highly recommended. The flashback chapters which are worked into the story may be confusing, but stick with it, this is a great book.

His book is arranged in such a way that you learn a different Greek word each day of the year. Don't feel like you have to wait for January to start. Start today like I did. Each page has the date printed at the top. His descriptions are easy to understand and give practical ways to apply God's Word to daily life.

If you are looking for a good historical romance, you can't go wrong reading one of Ms. Harrington's. She developes each character in such a way that you feel like they are your friends at the end of each book. Who hasn't dreamt of a handsome cowboy riding up & stealing your heart?

That woman is a real piece if work!Bounty hunter Zach is an orphan from New York City who got the short end of the stick in his adoption from the orphan train. He hunts our heroine down for Ethan in order to get his ranch back. It's convoluted, but still realistic. Ethan has his sticky paws in a lot of different deals.It's a nicely developed love story with the requsite love scenes well written. It has quite a few twists and turns to keep it interesting.

The writing style is very terse and choppy, and the boys have no personalities. The jerkiness, the lack of explanations, and the lack of any character development at all, make reading this book a bizarre experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"does the trick","review":"My 11 month granddaughter wears this in the heat and it has protected her well.

I was using it for about an hour for a game after I bought it, then the next day I went to use it and when playing a game it was pulling to the right constantly, so I had to recalibrate it. On the calibration screen in windows, you can see the little calibration cursor vibrating almost and on another calibration screen it literally jumps around. It never returns to 'center' when you move it, it's always off-center, even after calibration.There is definately something wrong with the analog DPAD they use in this Gravis Eliminator gamepad - go buy something else instead and STAY AWAY from this gamepad. This is the same problem a lot of other people are complaining about it, and they haven't fixed it (and probably wont).

The drivers messed with my mouse on Windows XP. The plug n play drivers coming from Windows XP are much much better but they can't save this rediculously worthless game pad.If you want something in analog that is close to a PS2, think about getting an AXIS pad....granted it has its share of problems too but its a much better less sensitive game controller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst gamepad controller I ever bought","review":"The position of the analog controls are awkward and the buttons are all different than any other controller of it's type.

This is a \\"real world\\" entrepreneur's story, unlike so much of the bloated theory you see in other books out there. I've bought thousands of 'theory' books over the years, so when I spot something like this, it's a real treat.

The hard-to-understand explanations provide little insight into the topic areas covered.One has a sense that the author rushed to print just to be the first with a Java 2 title, by adding a few Java 2 items to a Java 1.1 text. Some chapters use Applets (Java 1.1), others Japplets (Java 2). Much of the Java 2 material is just filler--listings of the class definitions.

Overly red blood that splatters and sprays, villains with manically waggling eyebrows, ho hum.It's a horrible script. The dialogue is an opportunity for characters to talk--it doesn't move to story along. The characters talk like they want to say something cool rather than just say something. The actors come off as unsure of their physical movement--unintentionally awkward and clunky. They're not (all) bad actors, it just looks like they've had poor direction.

I only was able to go through about a little over a half, mostly because I was required to read it. Generally, the book is about a middle eastern girl living in a Harem and surrounded by the conflicting Western Power, the French Army. Lots of battles with tradition and western cultures, and primarily about the rift between men and women. So you're in for a subtle yet quite obvious gender conflict, which was in my opinion awfully sexist (I know it's from the view of a woman but that doesn't take away from the fact that she explicitly tries to write as if she were a child again with \\"innocence\\" yet fails because of her mature agenda). The author, Mernissi, spends about 10-15 pages per chapter driveling on about the most useless facts or coincidences. Just when you think she's reaching her point and finally bear fruit, it's the start of a new chapter and another take on a topic or segment of her life that is completely irrelevant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Delusions of a would-be feminist","review":"once again, mernissi has used the literary forum to vent her personal venom against her faith.

But an account of life in a \\"haram\\" is sure to sell.

I'll bet the percentage is very high. I hate stories that try to push a religious (or any other) agenda; i.e., stories with a \\"message.\\" The first writer who discovers the meaning of life will be qualified to write a message novel. Until then, I wish all others would desist.Aside from that, the writing is coy and pretentious--a sort of snob's \\"Rebecca,\\" though the house, the characters and the plot in DuMaurier's novel were much more interesting. Waugh should have stuck to humor and should not have tried to create great literature, which this definitely is not; what a bore he became in his old age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Temporary Beauty","review":"Waugh's technique as a noncomic prose stylist can be summarized as follows: adopt an unhappy view of the world and describe it with strange nouns. Fine as this book undoubtedly is, that does not make for timeless writing. What you have in Brideshead Revisited is an advanced lexicon made to seem grave and thoughtful by the unreasonably harsh view its characters take of luxury. I am not here to denounce the rich and I'm sympathetic to the kind of love described in this book. I think, however, that I was bored by the 450th word for flower turned out by the end of Book One. This seems quibbling but God must be in the details, and I think the incompleteness sensed by other reviewers on this site is a result of Waugh's preference for unusual words over unusual meaning."},{"rating":"1","title":"tired","review":"The reader, a deservedly acclaimed actor, who was made famous by playing Charles Ryder on T.V. made the recording sound flat.

If Kindle books are to be acceptable to serious readers, full disclosure is a must.Moreover, Amazon is accepting for distribution \\"Kindle\\" versions of books that are so shabbily scanned that the errors interrupt the reading flow.

Speaking of bad copies, last night, i saw the DVD of the new movie version of Brideshead; and it'a a very poor copy of the original movie with Jeremy Irons et al.

To call the remake crap is to give it too much credit!Brideshead Revisited (25th Anniversary Collector's Edition)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Language and an Intriguing Story","review":"Although Brideshead Revisted starts out a little dry, this novel's beautiful language and syntax will definitely keep the book in your hands. The story is about a young man, Charles Ryder, and his relationships with the Flyte family. Sebastian Flyte, the younger brother, is Charles' best friend throughout his college days. Sebastian has a whole family full of characters that challenge Charles to re-evaluate his opinions on everything from religion to relationships. I don't think my words can do justice, though, to the words of Evelyn Waugh, his writing is masterful, and I believe you will thoroughly enjoy reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brideshead Abridged","review":"Anyone considering a purchase of this product should know that it is very heavily abridged. It's difficult to give a realistic assessment of how much has been lost, but to me it sounds as though about half of Waugh's writing has been cut out. Most of the dialogue is there, but the narratives have been omitted. Whole characters, such as Hooper and Charles Ryder's father, have been truncated, leaving the book really an empty shell.I was really disappointed by this product: Nowhere on the CD itself does it say \\"Abridged,\\" nor is it obvious in the product description. I guess I just have to assume that if it does not say \\"Complete and Unabridged,\\" it's been mutilated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brideshead Revisited","review":"A great American classic well worth re-reading.

However this book is so tedious, that I have to say that I'm sorry I bought it, and I no idea why it is so highly rated. I didn't see the tv series, so that must have been better. Even 12 years of post high school education doesn't help me enjoy this, and although the writing is somewhat colorful and descriptive, it doesn't make me care about any of these people. A story about an alcoholic, lots of description, where not much happens for many, many pages, a very slow soap opera; Thankfully it's not too long."},{"rating":"1","title":"SCARED TO DEATH","review":"Apple in AlabamaI was going to buy this edition because I love the book,and the origional series with Anthony Andrews & Jeremy Irons. Now, I think maybe I'll skip it if the format sucks. Thanks 4 the heads up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book","review":"I ran across this book by accident following Wikipedia links, since I've never seen the TV series. It's a lush delight, with a slice-of-frozen-time writing style reminiscent of Tolstoy's Anna Karenina, except this book gives a 1923-1944 look into the life of a Catholic English aristocratic family to whom the protagonist attaches himself. Evelyn Waugh wrote the book during six months spent living on soybeans after a parachute accident, so said he had a \\"kind of gluttony..for the splendours of the recent past.\\"Since Waugh was a convert to Catholicism, he attempts to subtly proselytize his readers, which is slightly annoying since the characters end up renouncing their illicit romances to pursue lives of celibacy. Still, excellent look into a luxurious lifestyle only now afforded by the most ultra-rich."},{"rating":"2","title":"A vivid look into a world gone by, but despicable characters","review":"I listened to the audio of this book after having seen the PBS mini-series years ago and I was amazed to find that the principal characters, by my standards, were dispicable. Charles Ryder, in particular, sent me off when he returned from the jungle and described his relationship with his wife and children (one of whom he had never met and whom he showed no interest in meeting). Through these eyes, I re-viewed Julia and her father and found them both contemptible. Although the era was full of elegance and physical beauty, it is not hard to understand its decline in the hands of such morally bankrupt characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my type of reading","review":"I did not need to get far into this book to realize this was definitely NOT my reading genre.

Just the weight of another key against the button is enough to have the light shining."},{"rating":"2","title":"JavaScript Objects","review":"Very good book. If your just looking for a JavaScript reference or a source for scripts, this is not the book. The authors take a serious approach to client-side applications using JavaScript and object-oriented code.Others have complained about the examples being too academic but I found them very appropriate for the kinds of things I'd do such as using regular expressions for form validation, binding of html elements to objects, etc., using tree and stack data structures for document parsing... Even if you already use these techniques I found it an effective way to teach the language."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent intro to object orientation in Javascript","review":"A book on Javascript objects would seem a challenge, especially when it presumes no prior Javascript knowledge. To do that while also providing meaningful info to interest those experienced in objects, but perhaps new to JS, would be a feat indeed. I feel the authors met both challenges.Where most Javascript books focus more on the use of JS to manipulate web documents, this book gives serious consideration to Javascript as a programming language--and it's strengths as an object-oriented one--first, and as a tool for extending HTML and web pages second. It's an interesting approach, and one that for the most part works.It's a dense book. While 60 pages of a Javascript Dummies book would go by in about an hour, expect to spend a few hours or more reaching the same point here.How much one learns will certainly depend on your background, but I can speak as someone with both mild JS and object knowledge that I learned an awful lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The main point that the authors attempt to make is that JavaScript can be a powerful and flexible object-oriented programming language. This book is better suited for the classroom than for real-world web development. Out of its 450+ pages, a single 30-page chapter deals with JavaScript in the browser.Since I have several years of C/C++ experience, I bought this book primarily for the object reference table in the appendix. As I began writing real JavaScript applications, however, it became clear that this book was more of a hinderance than a help -- that even the object reference was a watered down version of the Netscape documentation. For instance, the book makes no distinction between read/write and read-only properties. The programmer is left guessing whether his program is failing or the property is not writable.I found that \\"JavaScript - The Definitive Guide\\" by O'Reilly & Associates (ISBN 1-56592-392-8) covers browser objects much more thoroughy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basic and thorough","review":"This is a very complete overview of networking in general.

Unless this advertisement is changed to clearly indicate it is a price per ounce, I can only assume it is an intentional misleading.

The examples employed in the explanations are awfully rushed in (as the case of the Flying Pig in explanation about interface). This book appears that it has been written by rushed contributors. It lacks in consistency and has lots of spelling errors. The listings are so short and split across the text that I can hardly have picture of the overall text/discussion.

A quick glance indicates that this book covers just about every topic needed to write \\"industrial strength\\" Java application. Unfortunately, the content does not back it up.The AWT chapters (AWT Basics and Advanced AWT) both deal with basic AWT topics. The cover page claims that the book covers Java 1.1, but the examples here all use the 1.0 event model. The chapters \\"Interfacing C/C++ and Java\\" and \\"JDBC\\" contain very little content (but the LARGE fonts used help them to stretch for many pages).In general, the book tries to cover too much. Each of these chapters could (and usually do) take an entire book to cover. That would be okay if this book provided a solid introduction to each topic, but in most places it fails to do even that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leadership Starts From Within","review":"Of the many \\"management\\" books I have read, Ms. Segil is the first to clearly articulate an approach that is critical in today's business environment--look at the behavior and motivation of the leader first.

So many of his code snippets start with \\"void main()\\" that it drove me crazy! He gets it right, sometimes, with \\"int main (void)\\", but he is very inconsistent. The most egregious error, in my opinion, was an example he used to try to explain classes. He tries to use a \\"class (name)\\" example as a base class for tax forms!!! What is that? That is clearly not an \\"is-a\\" relationship, a term he conspicuously leaves out. The code throughout is not ANSI standard C++, and really needs to be cleaned up.

If you can't take the obvious from Carlos, you're simply offended. Such black and white humor is (refreshingly) harsh; nevertheless, you'll thank Carlos for ripping out your funny bone and breaking in half while talking smack about \\"stupid\\" people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"The DVD title tells it like it is, and so does Carlos. Nobody and no subject is off limits; if lack of common sense is displayed, Carlos is there to point it out quite bluntly.But I guess the dork who posted the \\"user image\\" of the broken DVD is one of those easily offended. I can't figure out if that is a tantrum or he's just not capable of taking care of a disc. Either way I'm thinking, \\"dee-dee-dee\\".Anyway, if you're tired of the stupidity that seems to be running rampant with the human race these days, listen to Carlos.

He steals from unknown comics that cant defend themselves and he gets away with it. Joe Rogan is a great person for going after him and trying to bring him down.

If Carlos wants to shock me, he should try telling a funny joke.

I lost interest after the first couple of pages but forced myself to finish it. The author simplifies Taoist thought to the point that it is in line with any philosophy or religion. If you follow the golden rule and listen to your instincts, congratulations, you’re a Taoist. He makes his points by insulting every character from Winnie the Pooh, except for the great Pooh of course, and almost every profession. He needed to spend more time explaining the principles of Taoism and less time trying to explain what it is not. It is not a good introduction to Taoist thought, it just made me want to find a book that is. That is not to mention the bad writing style and confusing analogies. Interesting topic with potential but in the hands of a bad writer it turned to crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have for all!","review":"This book is the perfect book to introduce anyone to eastern philosophy; particularly Taoism.

I heard the stories about the little dumb bear & his friends, but they made me feeling irritated. Then i found this book, and since I've been reading a lot bout eastern religions and philosophies, I thought that maybe Taoism would be what I was searching for. This book introduced me to Tao in a very joyful kind of way, and it gave me a better opinion of Winnie too: his not really dumb at all, he's just happy, and that's what Taoism is all about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Idealistic fluff","review":"I found the book to be very entertaining at the start, but it got old and it isn't even a very big book. Muddled thinking leads to muddled conclusions. For example: Hoff praises the simple mindedness of Pooh and uses an illustration of someone who is rational and purposeful getting into a car wreck because he is that way, when my experience has been that simpleminded Pooh-type people cause most car wrecks. I wouln't buy it. Check it out from your library first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Snide","review":"The concept is nifty, but, alas, in the implementation, this book seems only able to exalt the Tao by denigrating other paths of wisdom.

While I learned some of what I was searching for - the focus on nature and simplicity - there was a recurring tone of negativity that bothered me to the point that I couldn't enjoy the book. What troubled me is this: Hoff repeatedly illustrates the virtues of his chosen philosophy/religion by denigrating other religions.I'm not much of a fan of \\"organized religion\\", so the thought of criticizing other religions doesn't upset me per se: it's just that I find no place for it in a book like this.

I will also go so far as to say that the book amuses from time to time. Where the book falls short in my opinion is the narrator's tone.Mr. Hoff's contrasts between Taoist and Judeo-Christian approaches to life invariably give the air of self-satisfaction one so often finds in Western converts to Eastern religion. It is this pall of smug (apologies to Trey Parker and Matt Stone) that makes the book progressively more annoying as the pages turn.I'd give it 3 or 4 stars for accuracy and explanation, were it not for the tone."},{"rating":"1","title":"The wisdom of Pooh","review":"Benjamin Hoff creatively explains the principles of Taoism through Winnie-the-Pooh and his friends Eeyore, Piglet, Rabbit, Owl, and Christopher.

It can happen in the East without our help.This is a cute book and could have been a fun read if I didn't understand philosophical Daoism.Let me say that I'm glad that folks love Winnie and company. I do too. I think the characters are great but Daoism doesn't describe them or their lot.The problem with oversimplification is that it ignores and perhaps disparages, deeper values to be realized.Modern Western process philosophy has been coming around to the value of Daoism's ontology and metaphysics for years now, and to reduce these values to Winnie the Pooh is not helpful.I apologize if this offends anybody but just as we tend to make God and/or Jesus sound too much like Santa Claus, the referents are so much more than our fundamentalist beliefs of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Idealistic","review":"The Tao of Pooh brought out many emotions from me. Most of them were argumentative and the rest were indifferent. What made me mad was that the author was too idealistic. He mentions something like we should just let things happen and they will get done. Well in my American society, things don't just happen by them selves and things don't just fall into place. It takes a lot of work to make things work and more work to make things work right. In addition, this book is very one sided. It would have been more effective if Benjamin Hoff found some way to relate Poohs Tao way of life to that of another animated character that follows, Confucianism, and/or Buddhism.Targeted Readers: People interested in philosophy, Tao way of thinking, people against and for an idealistic society."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fish out of water","review":"Please, please buy 'The Way of Zen' by Allan Watts and 'The House at Pooh Corner' by A.A. Milne, rather than this book. Hoff does great injustice to both Zen and Pooh in this trivialization of the artless and the sublime. Only the kind of people who think a five-star haut cuisine meal is a rip-off because you could get more at McDonald's for the same money could possible think this a good book. Zen is not explicable (see Watts' book) and Milne (re: Pooh) is inimitible. These observations are doubly true in the case of someone, like Hoff, who has a severely restricted vocabulary, no facility with the language and a complete lack of respect for his subject matter. Please, please DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bitter and Vacuous","review":"Apparently, Taoism is about lazy, bitter Westerners superficially embracing Eastern mysticism in order to boost their own egos - and then cashing in on a beloved childhood icon to make a quick buck.Hoff does a reasonable job of using actual quotations from Pooh to illustrate various simple points, but his depiction of Taoism ends up being a collection of empty mantras that have no relationship to real life, where people frequently have both aspirations and problems. Do you want to work towards a career where you can make a difference for people? Hoff's answer is \\"don't strive - just be\\". Upset about global inequality and mass starvation? \\"Cottlestone Pie\\".Hoff blatantly misreads Pooh to tell us that knowledge and science bring nothing but trouble - as he puts it, discovering things only leads to more questions, so what's the point? He even rants against jogging and tennis. Better to remain ignorant and immobile - although complaining bitterly seems to be an acceptable activity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unpleasantly Surprised","review":"While I'll concede that this book gives a nifty introduction to the tenets of Taoism by means of the extended Pooh analogy, the manner in which the author achieves this is downright dogmatic. You can't read a full page without him openly denouncing other belief systems, and his overly contemptuous attitude towards intellectualism is alarming. He portrays anybody who values the beauty of complexity or academics as a close-minded, arrogant bookworm, and grossly misrepresents the followers of various religions/faiths. Hoff definitely borders on the fanatical here, using far-reaching comparisons to make his offensive points, many of which don't even align with the true characteristics of Taoism. Jumping to conclusions and articulating uneducated descriptions regarding many aspects of contemporary culture and scholarship, I'm certain that Hoff has Lao Tzu turning over in his grave at his downright hateful quasi-environmentalist commentary. Don't waste your time with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I actually thought this was going to be a good book, but came away feeling depressed at how pitiful an attempt this was to describe an eastern philosophy. No doubt, the book has sold purely on its hook of having the famous little bear, Pooh, on it's cover. Nevertheless, the only handful of passages that made the whole endeavor worthwhile in this little waste of time came from other passages taken out of REAL books such as Tae Te Ching. Otherwise, the author here is one of those hippie types who, by his own admission, likes to lay about on the floor. Must be nice while the rest of us go to work to earn money to buy cute little books with Winnie the Pooh on the cover.Whatever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piglet an Pooh","review":"The author of this book mentions early that it would be very hard to combine the teachings of the Tao with Winnie the Pooh. He said that his colleges said it was crazy and too dificult. Well, it was. Winnie the Pooh plays no role in this book besides mentioning several times how much honey he likes. So the author continues to explain the signifance of Tao and in between injects a pooh who is looking for honey or has some irrelevant conversation with Piglet. In conclusion, if you want to find out about Taoism, don't read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patronising","review":"The one message I got from this book was, basically, \\"anyone can be a taoist if they're stupid\\", a message which would grate on the nerves of many intelligent people studying Taoism - and any other philosophical/religous movements. The author seems to take pride in stating - through the character of Pooh - \\"I am not very clever, ergo I'm a lot closer to the uncarved block than you are\\". Spare us! There's a difference between \\"not being interested in knowledge\\" and \\"being stupid\\". This book appears not to know the difference.For someone who knows nothing of Taoism, there may be some interesting thoughts in here, but I fear it may leave them with the impression that the only prerequisite for being a taoist is being fick."},{"rating":"2","title":"good stuff","review":"great book.

He was the greatest then (and now), and, thanks to this book, I now know why. This book is not only a wonderful intro to Taoism, it is also a confirmation of what every child hopes for and secretly knows. Because in the western world, Pooh is more well known than the Tao and he is known to the child within us, he is the perfect prophet.Bravo...this book captures all the awards...it is profound yet so simple that even a child can see the truth in it.A Must Read for People who have or want to have a soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"The way of Pooh","review":"So far I have only read \\"The Tao of Pooh\\" and I liked it.

On the other hand, if you're searching for a fun little flick to keep you entertained, you might consider North Avenue Irregulars.The movie tells the story of 5 ladies (or 6, depending on your perspective) that join with the town's new Presbyterian minister to save the locals from a large gambling ring. Each of the would-be heroes has some flaw that keeps them one step behind the criminals.The dialogue is entertaining, with many funny remarks, and the personalities of the characters are well-played.

I emailed and phone D-Link's tech support line and got responses that did nothing to help in any way.

The first amazing thing, is that it seems to lose your connection all the time. This seems to be because of some problem D-link has with \\"Authentication\\". If you want yours to work, turn off authentication. Once you have it running reliably, it is amazingly fast. I run on a cable modem and get about 1.1 megabytes per second on a wired connection normally, and yet I have exceeded that with my AirPlusXtremeG (about 1.15). My point is that it works like a wired connection without the hassle of wires, but with the added hassle of needing to set it up EXACTLY right.

If you are considering using this format, I recommend using another card. Or, you can use the built in Windows XP drivers (after upgrading using Windows Update) and bypass the Dlink utility altogether. This works, but you loose the ability to use the Turbo mode on the card.Dlink support is slow and it appears that it takes them many months to fix bugs in their drivers.

He put his existing card back in and loaded fine. I returned mine. Second one, junk condition from D-Link considering mine was mint having never been used in a working mode! It gave me a different error altogether. I had a co-worker try it on his laptop with WIN98, but it didn't work there either, we tried various drivers. I then got a laptop with WIN2000 and it couldn't load it either. Returned this one 2 days ago. Hopefully my next one will work?

That is, disabling the \\"utility\\" and using windows to configure the wireless network. After that, despite getting the card to work, I was disappointed with range, speed, and reliability of the signal. I use Win XP Pro, and maybe the software problems are specific to this version. Anyway, the other card I have (TrendNet) works much better, even with D-Link's own router. And just as the last drop, the indicator lights are far too big, and keep blinking all the time, what is enerving and distracting. Ah!

I use the PPPoE support, DHCP server, WPA encryption, DNS and MAC based filtering, and the integrated IP firewall. All this is controlled through a relatively decent web interface.The problem that I and MANY others have had is with the stability of the device. It has a number of nasty habits; like dropping the WAN connection then being unable to reconnect, stalling immediately after it receives a DHCP lease request, or spontaneously rebooting.

If I was across the same room as the router, I would get two bars of signal if I was lucky. Recently, we moved the desktop to another room. That caused no signal reception from 10 feet with one wall in between.At work there is a Linksys with a booster antenna. I get max signal at my desk surrounded by a ton of other electronic equipment, steel, and concrete. So I thought maybe I just need an antenna. I bought the DLink antenna. Now from 10 feet I'm back to the two bars of signal, with many dropouts.Recently I've noticed the dropped connections with my desktop. That's a new thing that wasn't happening before.I would strongly recommend getting something else..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work with Nortel VPN","review":"I have a wired D-Link router that works great with my company's Nortel VPN.

Use both if u want really secure control.Well, I don't want to bother with encryption and I don't want other ppl using my router. Can't do that with this router. I wish I had known this b4 I bought the DI-624.The indicator light interface in the front is very primitive. They are small, and blinking means normal.

THey've worked around 20% of the time, and the amount of agony they have put me through is extreme. The laptop card was the worst, but the router is almost as bad. Bad software, difficult to use, and one problem after another.One of the multitude of times I talked to tech support, the technician actually told me I should have bought from a different company! First time I've ever heard that. Sadly, I give up. I'm now going to take his advice. My only question is whether I repeatedly hit the dlink with a hammer and throw it away (which would be extremely catharctic), or donate it to someone to make their life miserable.I will never buy another dlink product.

Annoying.","review":"This is a great router if you don't plan on ever doing any serious usenet downloads or p2p file sharing.The massive traffic generated by either of these applications makes the router think it's being pinged to death. Instead of filtering out the requests or doing something else, the router reboots itself! How great is that. Several firmwares later and the problem remains.As of the 2.42 firmware, this router is vulnerable to the 'targa3' exploit, a test of which results in a reboot. Many other routers are not vulnerable to targa3, but this one is.I'd advise against the DI-624. Its been nothing but trouble."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Router with Good Reliability","review":"I bought this a while back and have found it to be a good cornerstone of my network.

They stay connected to the internet for a while - sometimes a day, sometimes only 10 minutes at a time - and then spontaneously reboot, causing loss of internet connection for ~10 seconds, a re-connect with my ISP, which results in a new IP address.I have filed a Better Business Bureau report against D-Link, and I have spent months, actually months, trying to get a product exchange for a different model router.I would avoid this router.I have had great success with D-Link routers in the past.

I have personal experience with 2 of this model and they are both defective in different ways. One drops network connections (on the wired switch portion even... how hard is it to get a wired switch right?) on a fairly regular basis for no explicable reason only to reconnect a fraction of a second later. The other has a wireless radio that works for about an hour or two then stops working and the router needs to be reset in order to get it working again (for another hour or two).This is literally the worst networking device I have ever used, and that goes back to the old days of 10base2.

It would be at least as reliable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy to fail","review":"Yes, this wireless router is easy to install and makes a nice combo with DWL-G650 card, and it looks perfect for a small home wireless network. It has only one slight problem: it keeps losing my internet connection (and please note the modem it works with is a D-Link too I expected the combo to work flawlessly). The router will start fine and then lose connection after an hour or so. Now, ease of use is great, but isn't the main job of a router to keep you connected?

I figured I could locate them at opposite ends of the house for good and, hopefully, overlapping coverage. Not so.Firstly, these devices will eventually drop the wifi connection and need to be restarted on a weekly basis if not more often. Secondly, they have TERRIBLE range. Using a variety of computers, I succeeded in getting no more than 30 foot range. I located the routers as high as possible and away from sources of interference, use only 5.8GHz cordless phones, and experimented with different channels. They simply don't perform well.Their customer support is absolutely the WORST I have ever experienced, and I deal with a lot of electronics for home and for work.After 16 months, the first of them has now completely failed.

My MacBook Pro gets a full signal anywhere in the house, and most of my yard which is over an acre. I downgraded it to four stars for the lack of comprehensive instructions, but their tech support was both courteous and very helpful.

Tech support said the router was bad, so I returned it, with the same results. Then they said they wouldn't answer networking questions (that was Microsoft's problem).

It is shorter than the others (notably so) and with far less to say. The family falls into such a decline in this story as to lack believability. Mahfouz's treatment of one of his characters -- Aisha -- the youngest daughter of the family and considered very beautiful -- is unbelievably harsh. Happily for us, it is nearly impossible for a real life person to have a life as tragic as Aisha's. Her tragedy makes absolutely no sense and ruins the book for me, making me wonder whether Mahfouz might be some sort of mysogynist. No one else has a really great life to contrast either.

Next the clipper comes with a sliding thumb-operated switch that allows you adjust the combs to the proper cutting height however in my case it just moved on its own while cutting hair. Lastly the cut hair became clogged at the bottom of the clipper comb and that made it difficult to cut.

They should really consider discontinueing this model because it is hurting their image. I would not even attempt to use my warranty because it's not defected parts. It's a total LEMON. It would be nice if they will let me exchange it for a different model or full refund. I would even pay the difference.I do not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with Conair","review":"The adjustable slider combs are horrible and I found the Conair where you had several combs to choose from worked better for me. I cannot get it to cut the hair on my husband who likes it very short, it would not even take any hair off. All it did was waste money and electricity to charge the battery. I thought this was the best brand out there, but Conair beats them by a mile. I think I will take it back and get a refund and go buy a Conair with the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This was the worst hair clipper I have ever used. It didn't cut hair at all, but just combed through it. The blades worked intermittantly, seemed to work about 1% of the time I was attempting to give the haircut, however it was mostly like combing through the hair without cutting anything. It sounded like the blades were turning off and on, whether plugged in or charged. I think this was a defective unit, I returned it for a refund but seller would not return delivery and return shipping which amounted to almost as much as the unit itself. Ultimately, I was dispppointed not only in the product but the service as well, and am not sure I will order from Amazon again."},{"rating":"1","title":"broke shortly after the first few uses","review":"I gave this item as a gift.

I'm not certain how that much this could have affected it's performance, however, it's cutting performance is abysmal.We've allowed this to charge fully several times, and even with the unit plugged into the wall during use, this trimmer strains to keep up. It takes several passes to cut what took our last trimmer one. Our last was a Norelco plug-in only model. That thing was a champ, & lasted us 8 happy years.

I really wanted these clippers to be a good replacement, but the quality is abysmal. They may look decent in the picture, but they are very cheap plastic, extremely weak motor (even when plugged in), these just don't work very well on hair, they get constantly bogged down/loaded up even when plugged in, & they also get clogged, for some reason they won't release the hair, it just piles up in the blade... perhaps as a cheap beard trimmer they might suffice, but I didn't find them acceptable at any price, so I had to send them back. I am surprised Wahl is willing to put it's name on these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of ...Crap (a more civilized word)","review":"First impression: Poorly built. Cheap plastic. Combs are not sturdy; bends easily. Wahl really messed up on this one.First (and Last) use: very painful experience. my hair keeps on getting caught in the blades and it ripped off several hair. The motor stalled ALL the time. I had to turn it off and on to keep using. After cutting the hair on the back of my head, the machine just simply refused to cut any more. Blades did not cut the hair on the side of the head of on the top. Also the adjustable combs seem to move out of place when you have a lot of hair."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Piece of Crap","review":"Bought this at Canadian Tire.

It lacks sources, there are neither footnotes nor a bibliography at the end so one can only guess where does he get his info from. This is particularly troubling when one finds bold assertions such as when the author states that there was no hunger among the Aztecs and the Incas before Columbus (Chapter 7). The second major problems is that there's no serious effort at an in-depth analysis of what food represents in human society, the writer consistently prefers to tell amusing stories rather than engage in serious scientific enquiry.

There is a whiff of \\"I was a genius and helped create Tim Buckley\\" sprinkled throughout the book. Frankly, Mr. Underwood was a very hit-or-miss guitarist. Sometimes good, sometimes great(mostly in a live setting) and sometimes horrible. As to his \\"inventing\\" certain guitar techniques, I think his ego may have got the best of him. I will give him this though; Tim Buckley is one of music's most fascinating \\"shoulda-beens\\". Some of the music that he wrote stands up with any of his 60's contemporaries and a large chunk of it is better.

If that isn't bad enough the recordings they are using have talking on them! You hear the musicians do some ... little skits about police and firemen. Obviously the individuals who created this collection didn't give the slightest effort to making it even a functionally entertaining experience.

Not much of a plot and the characters, although likeable, are strictly cardboard (some of them seem to a have strayed out of a Charles Dickens novel).It seems as if a quarter of the book is a diversion into the lifestyle of peregrine falcons. More about falcons than I ever wanted to know. In any case if you want to read about falcons, try the short story \\"Hook\\" (can't remember the author); it's better.As I was reading, I felt a odd sense of familiarity. Finally I caught on that the \\"The Painted Tent\\" reminds me of many of the scores of \\"juvenile\\" or \\"young adult\\" books I devoured in my early teens -- teenage protagonist, plodding mediocore plot, simplified characters, educational asides (the falcons), morality lessons, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"made in china :(","review":"i bought these in bulk for a animal rescue donation drive to add to my care package but am returning them IMMEDIATELY after i saw they are produced in China. i didn't realize it at the time or i would have never bought them.

As the other reviewer mentions, the works are given a strong performance, all the orchestral color and drama are brought out to a nice effect. I don't have any to compare with except a London Lp of Ansermet conducting the Stravinsky piece. There actually are'nt that many versions of it out there. The Firebird is more popular. If you like Stravinsky's Ballet pieces, this is one to try. Also of note is the engineering by Brad Sayles, this disc sounds excellent, it has the right perspective for my preference.....not so close that the hall ambience is lost, and not so far away that everything gets muddled, it's just right.

The author prefaces his book by stating that he has three narrative threads--the clinical commentary, his memories, and his present day--but the pacing and weaving of the three threads is average at best.

It feels almost cruel to write a negative review because the author is admirably open and sincere, and his suffering is profound. But he seems to suffer from untreated depression as well as from Alzheimers. His unremitting anger and despair make his experiences (and ours as readers) even sadder than they need to be. I kept wishing he would take the energy he was using to write the book and put it into being more open with his family, or finding a therapist or a hospice-type program that would provide him and his family with ongoing support.

However, I find his endless harping on his mental condition and just how black everything is to take away from the other excellent material in the book - quotes from various other sources about the disease and its ramifications.He implies that this is the worst disease anyone could ever get. I think of Parkinson's (and Michael J. Fox), being paralyzed (and Christopher Reeve), muscular dystrophy and MS - and how all of those worsen over time. I also think about acceptance and taking action as the two people mentioned above have done. The action I see this author taking is to constantly dwell on his own decline.

I heard about Ender's Shadow a month or two ago and have recently finished the series. I have read all of the Ender and Shadow series and will continue to do so as long as they keep being written.If you are not familiar with OSC, he is also the author/playright of the Abyss! Ender's Game is planned to be made into a movie by WB and the producer of a Perfect Storm.This book is about Ender's life off-planet after having saved the world.

Facing the daunting task of wrapping up all the loose ends of the story in a neat package, OSC does not achieve the level of suspense and drama that he does earlier in the series.Also, much of the story is very theoretical, and less convincing overall than the others.But despite its flaws, this book must be read by anyone who knows Ender, for we must know what happens. The ending of the novel is really quite nice, even touching, if we know and love the characters.And come on, if you've read the first three novels, it's hard not to love these characters, for they are some of the more intriguing and endearing characters in the genre of sci-fi.

Obviously, most of us have caught up to the fact that Card was determined to \\"right\\" the capsized-ship of morality. Card was successful in this book, but his success came at the expense of our fave character Ender. I don't agree that Ender's childhood decisions based on self-preservation were selfish signs of cowardice. The constant chatter between the piggy trees and buggers was sorta irritating at the end.

So how can there be \\"dozens of FTL starships in operation\\"???!!!!!! Ender has vowed never to go OUTSIDE again. That leaves the duplicates of Peter and Val. So how is it that suddenly dozens of FTL starships are in use????? What is Orson Scott Card thinking? Has he forgotten what he wrote in Xenocide?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Book that should not have been written","review":"It's sad to see the Ender saga fizzle away in ever-increasing complexities and meta-physics which are not substitutes for new concepts and plot directions. Sometimes when you have painted yourself into a corner it's better to jump out a window and forget the little bit that is left to tidy up. I feel that it is at least two books (\\"Children\\" and \\"Shadow\\") past the point that this series should have been left to stand on its undoubted early merit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five Stars","review":"This is definitely one of my favorite books from the Ender Saga.

Children of the Mind has renewed my faith and ended a sci-fi series which has secured its place at the level of Asimov's Foundation series. One can almost excuse the poorly thought out ending of Xenocide with this well thought out and executed ending of the Ender series.My only complaints are Ender's small part and anti-climatic exit in a saga that placed him so highly and it's inability to seperate the unrealistic, mystic aspect brought on in Xenocide with the genuine Sci-Fi magic that made the first two novels in the series classics of the genre.However, if you read Ender's Game and are wondering whether to continue through the series, the answer is a definite yes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent conclusion to the Ender Saga.","review":"I'm just sorry that it's over. Card has created a wonderful world full of equally wonderful and unforgettable characters"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good book, but not a great book","review":"I want to preface this by saying that Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead are two of the best novels that I have ever read. Unfortunately, Children of the Mind, while a good book, did not live up to my expectations. It does have some moments of brilliance, but there are not quite as many of them as in OSC's previous works. Part of the problem is that much less time is spent with Ender, and Ender is the central reason that most of us became such fanatics. It is still a must read if you have read the other three, if for no other reason than to gain some sense of closure (although as others have pointed out, there is at least one story line that is left open). Go ahead and get it, but don't get your hopes up too high"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT mind??","review":"OK, I got over the fact that Ender had a cameo and then died. But I couldn't get over the lack of good hard science (like Speaker for the Dead's explanation of how piggies reproduced). What in the world is an aiua, anyway? Novinha had undergone a sorry change from the intriguing, pivotal character she used to be, and the new characters introduced were more blah than the Brady Bunch. Grace Drinker (couldn't find a better last name?) and her husband who laughs all the time were ludicrous. If there really was a Jane, she'd be rolling over in her ansible network"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is not hard to put down","review":"I'm a big fan of Card's and think his Ender series is great, but Childred of the Mind just isn't very interesting. It's rambling and lack just about everything that's good in the other books in the series. The other books in the series are well told, full of imagery and interesting ideas and twists, and one develops empathy with his characters. His editors should have reminded Card of what makes him a good writer. Perhaps Card is starting to write above mortals like me, or perhaps he's getting a bit weird on us. I'd suggest skipping this book and trying something else he's written"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worse books I've ever read","review":"Characters - Who cares? Plot - What plot? Science - No, not really. This is by far one of Card's weakest books, I guess he just felt he had to finish the series and Ender.

It could easily be cut in half with the loss of absolutely nothing. It is verbose in the basest sense. The dialogue is repetitive in the sense of ideas. Why take one sentence when you can drone on for a whole chapter? Card seems unable to simply be satisfied in making his point, or illustrating an idea. He just repeats the same ideas, the same concepts and the same one dimensional character personalities over, and over and over again. The conflicts are contrived and the solutions simplistic and predictable. Arrrggghh! It took me over two weeks to wade through this book because it bored me so much!It is as if Card merged the WORST of Camus, Dostoevsky and Asmiov-- Unending descriptions of introspective character musings by simpletons obsessing about themselves in a futuristic setting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored to death. Just like Ender.","review":"Ender's Game is a great book. Speaker for the Dead is a good book with some great new concepts. Xenocide and CotM are truly awful with CotM being so bad it is painful to read. And it sets up the reader for yet another sequel. Oh. Please. No.In CotM, Ender just withers on the vine. In the end, he literally bores himself to death. He must have been reading this book.Ender's Game readers will want to read the entire \\"quartet\\". Do so if you must, but be aware that life is short and you will never get these hours back. Do yourself a favor, pretend Xenocide and CotM do not exist and read the Shadow series if you need more in the Ender world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Card's best","review":"I read the whole series, and I must say that the middle section of the progression lacks something.

Card in his last book of the Ender \\"quartet\\" just reies to juggle to many themes and eventually just loses himself and ends up with a heaped up plot. The book is left wide open open the issue of the new species, the descoladores, who made the virus. Though this is the last of the ENDER books, Card should write ONE last novel to tie up all the lose ends like the issue of Jane, Peter & wang-mu, Starways Congress's response to hearing the descolada netralized, and they should be alerted about the descoladores! The next book should mainly be about the descoladores. THERE SHOULD BE A NEXT BOOK TO CLOSE THE HOLES."},{"rating":"1","title":"An irritating slog","review":"Like most ever other reviewer here, I read the entire Ender's series up through this book. While Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead are outstanding books (five star worthy), Xenocide and Children of the Mind are simply irritating. I despised all the characters, who were so self-centered and so completely flawed you have no connection to them to care whether they die or live, and can't conceive they could succeed at anything. Page after page of characters contemplating their relationships with the other characters makes for a very boring read, and I found myself skimming much of the book. *spoiler* Without Ender, who essentially withdrawls from the narrative to have a relationship with his angry-at-the-world wife, there are simply no sympathetic or interesting characters that you really care about.

Now, only a few weeks have past and not only have our heroes discovered a new race of alien species, but Jane--now a goddess-- has figured out that she was never really going to die anyway because she has the power to take over someone's body.

Perhaps he should have ignored them. The story is disjointed and impossible to follow and lacks any of the suspense and excitement that Card created in the earlier Ender novels. Nor does the reader come to care about the characters, previously a Card strength (both in the Ender books and his other work). Perhaps this is because Jane is the focus of the story, and Card has failed to construct a complex being out of an annoying computer program, relying instead on the technological marvel of her self-awareness to carry him through. It doesn't. Overall, a complete and total UGH.

The only reason I finished it was because I am a fan of the series and I have never put a book down halfway through. Card repeats himself to the point that it feels like he is beating you over the head with a hammer with his \\"philosophical\\" ramblings. I would estimate that 80% of this book is dialogue about characters' feelings that reads like one person's inner monologue. It is mind numbing and I seriously became agitated at points because I knew I should just cut my losses and quit reading. If you are a fan of the series and just have to know what happens next I would just do yourself a favor and read some cliff notes or read a summary on wikipedia.

I don't mind having no action in a book (otherwise how else could I love Foundation so much?), but Children was a book that NEEDED to have action in it. Unfortunately it didn't really. Too much philosophical babble that I had to re-read to get it. Slightly reminiscent of Card's later Shadow series with the sheer amount of internal monologue. Too much about Jane, not enough about the pequeninos and barely anything about Ender, which annoyed me. To my shock Ender's death did not really impact me in any way, beyond--\\"Huh? Wait...Ender is dead?\\", so little was his role in the book. He probably talked for only about twelve pages altogether.EDIT: From now on I am never giving a book that I halfway like two stars again because each time, I receive the urge to change my rating to three stars.

What we got was more \\"magic\\" solutions to problems faced by whining, self-absorbed characters. (Yes, I'm aware that technology distinguishable from magic is insufficiently advanced, but there were too many rabbits pulled from the same hat to generate a coherent, much less enjoyable, story.)

And pointless verbal sparring and pedantry.The stuff about the aiuas was interesting at first, but it doesn't seem to make any sense. Why can't young Valentine hold herself together? She has her own self inhabiting her body, no matter the forced ruminations about the topic. This should have been an obvious flaw from the outset.

If one person could define the meaning of life, it would be Card.

He calls a phone sex line one evening and is then hounded by the man running the service. This takes place the same time he meets a woman who likes him despite his oddities.The sad thing is I think there is probably a sweet, poignant love story in this film but it's buried in a morass of pointless scenes and a discordant soundtrack that is sometimes so loud it nearly drowns out the dialog. There is no reason shown why Emily Watson would fall in love with Sandler. It's really just one strange scene after another that in the end is dull and left me wishing I'd rented another movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"Adam Sandler does a good job of playing a deeply repressed individual who is prone to bouts of violence and crying jags. Unfortunately, this is not funny. The voluptuous Emily Watson portrays a seemingly nice and normal woman who is inexplicably attracted to this pathetically pathetic individual.

Good luck if you buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely terrible....","review":"The ridiculous art of \\"black comedy\\" is noticed within this movie. Yes, Adam Sandler can act, that is the only positive attribute of this motion picture. Comedy can have many sides, but the side seen here is dumbing to the mind and soul as Sandler's character finds himself in ludicrous sitations and making idiotic statements to back himself up. NOT a good buy, find another comedy so as not to waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Advanced Region Locking","review":"This DVD is one of very few that has RCE (Region Code Enhanced). It's an advanced form of region locking. It WILL NOT work on multi-region DVD's.From Wiki:Also known as just \\"RCE\\" or \\"REA\\",[4] this was a retroactive attempt to prevent the playing of one region's discs in another region, even if the disc was played in a region free player. The scheme was deployed on only a handful of discs. The disc contained the main program material region coded as region 1. But it also contained a short video loop of a map of the world showing the regions, which was coded as region 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The intention was that when the disc was played in a non-region 1 player, the player would default to playing the material for its native region. This played the aforementioned video loop of a map, which was impossible to escape from, as the user controls were disabled."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Adam Sandler, Hate THIS movie, but to each his own","review":"My title pretty much sums it up, & yes I read the reviews.

Its hero, Barry Egan, has a frustrating, anxiety filled life. But the movie never becomes too uncomfortable. Writer/Director Paul Thomas Anderson mixes drama and comedy well. His use of music and surreal colours help give the film a dream-like quality.The acting is excellent all across the board. Sandler is excellent and Emily Watson turns in another great understated performance. Luis Guzman and Phillip Seymour-Hoffman both turn in their usual strong performances.Punch Drunk Love is a trying, yet satisfying film.The DVD looks excellent, as does the packaging. The extras are good, making this dvd well worth its modest price."},{"rating":"1","title":"a totally senseless contrite ridiculous waste-of-time","review":"yeah, i have to lower down my wits to appreciate the shallow depth of this film, so pretentiously trying to be very philosophically deep. a portrayal of modern day ulysisism, loneliness, emptyness, void, loss, stress...blahblahblah, whatever you like to throw into this senseless film, and you have to say you understand it, appreciate it, deeply moved, wow, so meaningful, so....well, maybe i got no wits or totally clueless, but this movie obviously lost me. like attending a party, all the people around talking deep, but you just can't understand what they are talking about, and what's the purpose of trying to talk shallow thoughts with a philosophic attitude. you just keep nodding your head to show that you are totally agree to what they are saying, but deep down you just know they are all but crap. there is actually no weapons of mass destruction, but who gives the...., what've done is already done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another P.T. Anderson Masterpiece","review":"How daring was it for Sandler to take this role? VERY! Many of his so-called fans that I know hated this movie. I think it's Sandler's best starring role since his days on SNL. Sandler plays Barry. All Barry wants out of life is a taste of what success and happiness truly are. He's constantly ragged on by his seven, that's right, seven sisters about finding Ms. Right. When Ms. Right comes along, much trouble follows and soon he finds himself way over his head when all he wanted was a simple life. As I've mentioned, many \\"die-hard\\" Sandler fans will find this film hard to swallow. For fans of P.T. Anderson, get ready for another great film that involves the usual dysfunctional family stigmas that seem to seamlessly flow throughout another masterfully told story. Short and very sweet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"Sure, it's deep, imagery is wild, amusing at times. But it just isn't entertaining, and unless you like \\"weird\\" movies that really have no rhyme or reason (those are most independent film fans) this just isn't very entertaining. A movie most will forget the next day, and NO I don't care for the average Hollywood movie fodder either. It's reality, but we watch movies to escape reality - they warned me at the movie store, and after seeing it, and understanding it - I just didn't enjoy it. It's one I'm glad I didn't spend $... to see in a theater. As you'll see by the reviews, you'll either really dig it, or hate it. I thought it was just weird."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time.","review":"I think this movie deserves two stars because some of the cinematography is wonderful and because the soundtrack is great and effective. Unfortunately, the movie lacks in character motivation, script, and plot in general. This fits in with so many so-called art films I've seen that seem to be little more than average stories with a few superficial character quirks thrown in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Either You Love It Or You Hate It","review":"I hated this movie. When we were done with it, my friend and I were both like, \\"What did we just watch?\\" PT Anderson dropped the ball on this one - he tried to be too arty with the minutes of nothing but colour splotches on the screen and he didn't pull it off. It made for a disjointed movie, with a weak script. The acting was fine, but Sandler and company really didn't have a lot to work with as far as a script was concerned, and the whole thing just comes off as pretentious and mired in its own self-importance. In all, this movie was a total drag to sit through and it's a definite low-point in Anderson's otherwise magnificent canon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arty pretensions do not make art...","review":"This film is a pretentious mess. It is full of obscure arty little distractions that make no sense and get no explanation as to their relevance to the plot. Adam Sandler is his usual terrible self; he's not funny in comedies, nor is he convincing in a 'drama', if that's what you can call this. Even the pace, the feel, and the warmth of the film changes abruptly from scene to scene as though the director couldn't make up his mind what kind of film he was making. What he ended up making is one of the worst films I've ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT SANDLER AT ALL!!","review":"I waited forever for this to come out on dvd because I was over seas when it came out and missed it. I really didn't miss anything. I LOVE Sandler and own all his movies, I bought this as soon as it came out today and was so disappointed I couldn't believe it. If you like you're typical sandler flicks like I do, don't waste your money on this one, he did not write, produce or have anyhting to do with it other than acting in it. All in all It SUX!! SOrry to ever say that about a Sandler flick but this is just lame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disappointment","review":"This movie was a major disappointment coming from Paul Thomas Anderson. I loved Boogie Nights and Magnolia but this movie was really bad. I saw it at the theater with 5 other people and we all left scratching our heads and wanting our money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish there was a \\"0 Stars\\" Button","review":"Wow....what a waste of Adam Sandler's considerable talent. As a diehard Sandler fan, I can safely say that when I saw this 'film' I decided it was time to stab my eyes out with a rusty fork. Fortunately, someone nearby took pity on me and turned the DVD player off, sparing me my sanity and my eyesight. Poor Sandler. This must have been a hard blow; while he did great with what he was given for a script, the movie itself packed no PUNCH, blew chunks like a DRUNK, and I would LOVE to ask whoever's idea that was, \\"Just what in the hell were you thinking?! How am I supposed to get that two wasted hours of my life back?!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Punch Drunk Love","review":"Are you people nuts? This movie was bloody mediocre at best, and P.T. Anderson is the most overrated filmmaker alive. He fancies himself an incredibly deep artiste, but Thomas Hardy he ain't; Magnolia, for the most part, had the depth of an afternoon soap opera and Punch Drunk Love is even worse. Granted, the guy has some visual flair, but he really needs to go the Martin Scorsese route and get other people to write his scripts for him. Punch Drunk Love is just further proof of how narratively and intellectually deficient his writing is. Some good ideas are wasted in a rambling collage of cinematic non sequitirs, and the harmonium representing Sandler's character at last finding inner harmony(harmonium, harmony, get it?) has to be the most trite metaphor I've seen in a long time. P.T. Anderson, and Wes Anderson for that matter, need to learn that shallow quirkiness does not a great film make."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"If you love Adam Sandler movies, you should not watch this. This is not the typical Sandler movie geared towards the lowest common denominator. I can't stand Adam Sandler, but this is one of my favorite movies. Dark, twisted, and odd, but romantic, and charming. The scene with the crow bar is my favorite scene in any movie. It shows the depth someone would go through for love and the strength it gives them without being cheesey. Fantastic and different, need I say more?"},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my favorite films of all-time.","review":"The backlash this film has received will ALWAYS baffle me. Paul Thomas Anderson has created one the most intricately woven love stories of all-time. Sandler's character Barry Egan has us hooked within moments because of his amazing commitment to the role, and the character's eccentric nature. This film is a testament to love, and proves that absolutely anyone in the world can experience the feeling.simply one of the most underrated films in history."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was the worst movie ever!!!!!!","review":"I am usually a very positive person, and I love Adam Sandler, so I was excited to see \\"Punch Drunk Love\\". The best part of the movie was the credits because I was finally able to tell myself that the pain and torture I had endured for the last 90 min was finally over. Everything about this movie [was bad], and there were at least 20 or 30 events in the movie that had absolutely nothing to do with the film. This is a perfect example of why we need to get the drugs out of hollywood because anybody who approved the script was obviously high on something more then life. By all means rent this movie, or buy it of you would like to take a nice nap, but I would much rather see a KPBS special where the cast of the Power Rangers, Barney, and telletubbies get together to talk about crossing the street. I only gave this movie 1 star because there was no lower rating. had I been able to take away stars that other people gave, I would have done so."},{"rating":"1","title":"no case","review":"I was under the impression that the movie would have a case due to the picture of the case.

It's a sad state of affairs when a worthless movie like this is produced. I watched it twice just in case I missed something. I didn't. Loaned it to a friend who couldn't stay awake for it. My son, an Adam Sandler fan, thought it grueling to watch. I don't understand these other reviews. I suppose it's either a love it or hate it type of movie. Frankly, I don't think Adam Sandler is that powerful an actor that he can afford to make a movie like this that alienates so many viewers. He owes me my [$$$] rental fee back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed","review":"This was supposed to be a two-disc special edition, but somehow I only ended up with one disc inside the box.

WRONG!!!! I am a strong beleiver that actors should play different roles in their careers, but in this case, it looks like Adam Sandler's thought process was merely to say \\"I always do comedies, this is different, so yes I will do it.\\"!!It's one of those movies that you wait, and you wait, because you beleive there HAS to be something that will eventually make sense, and then it ends, and you are right where you started, NOWHERE!!To conclude, don't rent it, loss of money, and more importantly, loss of time!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero stars if I could!","review":"Wow, this was actually worse than Lost In Translation!

This was one movie in which fleshing out the background of the characters, and espcially that of Adam Sandler's character would have helped A LOT. Instead I was left feeling the characters weren't developed nearly enough. The actors were also part of the problem, I do not think they pulled their roles off very well. The relasionships in this film could have been interesting, even emotionally touching, but instead most of the characters were merely boring or outright annoying. The plot is rather predictable, which is more tolerable in a film that is action based, but this film was not. This film could also have benefited a lot from some more interesting scenery, and a better soundtrack. Despite the few dramatic scenes in this movie, it was overall very very dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"mind numbing","review":"This movie is one of those that at the end you say \\"I wish I had that 2 hours of my life back.\\" This is by far one of Adam Sandlers worse movies to date. The dialog is pointless and takes you nowhere fast. Do yourself a favor and watch something redeeming like Legend of 1900 or Tortilla Soup. You'll feel much better about yourself and your 2 hours will have been well spent. Go back to SNL Adam that is were you belong."},{"rating":"1","title":"One word: Awful","review":"If you are a fan of Vanilla Sky starring Tom Cruise then Punch Drunk Love is for you! These two movies should be thrown into a vault and never spoke of again. Adam Sandler is a great actor, but this movie makes him to be the worst.

However, this was his worst movie by far. He has been type-cast into a raging maniac in one too many films. I mean really... what was the plot to this film?Adam Sandler destroys the men's bathroom - for no reason. He breaks things in his sisters house - for no reason. He is basically an anti social misfit. Yet, he owns his own business, maintains his temper with his employees, has a fudge pudding fetish and wears the same outfit for the entire movie.Why Punch Drunk Love? This movie should have been called \\"Sugar makes me Crazy!\\"If this was suppose to be a break through performance for Adam Sandler... this film failed miserably. He needs an opportunity to act and display his overall talent (Remember Saturday Night Live). Not just a character that resorts to violence in EVERY film.Adam if your reading this.

We left the theater wondering what happened in the first scene. There was no title sequence, the movie just *started*. One second we're watching a trailer for J.Lo's new movie, the next second, Adam Sandler is sitting at a desk, talking to someone on the phone. It's just... bizarre. From funky camera angles, to blurry colors that swirl through the middle of scenes, to music that is so loud you can't hear the dialogue, to dialogue that consists of hate and meanness.... It just beats you up one side and down the other.Not worth it. Not funny.

However, I was completely blown away by how refreshingly awkward it was, how sweetly the romance of Barry and Lena was drawn.Adam Sandler gives the best performance of his career as a man who has spent his whole life running away from love. Emily Watson is simply adorable as the mysterious woman who comes into his life and shows him the ups and downs of a relationship. As always, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Luis Guzman are great fun to watch, even in smaller roles.Anderson deserves a Best Original Screenplay Oscar for writing this simple, strange, and sweet concoction. It is one of the year's best films."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Punch-Drunk Love","review":"If any of you reviewers gave this movie a less than perfect score. Read this next line...

Many of you only saw this because Adam Sandler was in it - \\"Hey look! Another Adam Sandler movie! Maybe he'll do some more slapstick unintelligible comedy that only appeals to idiots like us! Hoowee!\\" Paul Thomas Anderson is one of the greatest directors in Hollywood today. This is not a movie for the untelligent. Sadly, that means very few will see it, let alone like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hold on to your seat!","review":"I have not seen a better movie depicting what it's like to be inside the mind of a clinically depressed person. Barry Egan (played by Adam Sandler) is restless, strung out, neurotic, desperate, and numb. And you are along for the ride on his emotional roller coaster. This beautiful, feeling film is NOT for jocks looking for a funny Adam Sandler movie. Furthermore, the background score is so on key with his emotions, that your nerves will be shot by the end of the movie. Emily Watson is wonderfully passionate and unusual, and Adam Sandler can no longer be viewed as strictly a comedian. Highly recommended for someone looking for a quirky, neurotic, quasi love story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money/time!","review":"The only good thing about my experience with this movie is I didn't pay movie theater price to see it.

The complexities of the life of a man with various mental disorders do not interest me (when presented without any particular purpose or meaning). The love story between Sandler and his love-interest did not catch my interest either.I feel that this film has no binding point of interest. I'd pass on it if I were you."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Attempt to Make the Simple, Complex","review":"As a fan of highly stylized and unique films, I was looking forward to seeing Punch-Drunk Love. I must admit I was extremely disappointed. After watching it again - and watching all the \\"extras\\" on the DVD, I have concluded the film makers KNEW they had a very basic and boring story, and the only way to make it more interesting was to thow in other things like the strange artwork and unexplained elements in the film like the piano.Adding all of these \\"artsy\\" elements might make people think the film was much more than it was - a very basic story. Unfortunately - it doesn't work.To its benefit, the film is very interesting visually, and the music works well throughout."},{"rating":"1","title":"punch drunk stupid...","review":"I have to say, I'm a huge Adam Sandler fan, which is why I rented this movie. BIG MISTAKE. Not only was it his worst movie, but it was just TERRIBLE for any movie. The plot was not well developped... you didnt know where the characters were going, and seeing Sandler's character and his interactions, just made me feel uncomfortable watching it (sortof how seeing really nervous people makes you feel nervous yourself). Certainly don't buy it, and don't even waste $3 at the movie store renting it.

He should use those miles to fly to Micheal Jackson's Neverland, 'cause maybe he could just be gay with Micheal Jackson. One part that taints the movie, is when this retarded character is in some house, and they play some [stinky]song that goes \\"he needs me, he needs me...\\". C'mon! That music is OUTDATED! Play some '90's music for that scene or something more current. I actually like Adam Sandler 'cause he's funny, but Punch-Drunk Love was a big mistake.

The film was not only dark and disturbing, but the soundtrack was erratic, irritating, and a failed attempt at being artistic. This film is a tragedy; a complete insult to socially inept people. The only positive in this situation, is that Adam Sandler was able to emerge from this film with his career still intact. Please reconsider purchasing (or even simply viewing) this film. If you still feel the need to purchase a new DVD (I myself am an avid film collector), I suggest Old School (starring Luke Wilson, Vince Vaughn, and Will Ferrell). Now THAT is a fine film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless","review":"Plain and simple - this movie was one of Sandlers worst! There was no real plot - it was jumpy - horrible script. I was really disappointed and I do not recommend anyone to waste their money to even rent it let alone buy it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS MOVIE!!!","review":"When I went to the store to rent this flim, the name Adam Sandler caught my eye. I thought \\"Wow! This is an Adam Sandler movie, so it's gotta be just histarical!\\" I was so increadibly wrong. This movie turned out to be a dark, stupid and pointless story of a small time business man.When I look at the other great Adam Sandler movies, I think of good movies like Billy Madison, or Happy Gilmore. Adam Sandler ought to be really angry at him self for being in such an awful movie.Word to the wise:DO NOT UNDER ANY CONDITIONS WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS HORRIBLE MOVIE!!! THIS IS BY FAR THE DUMBEST PLOT LINE EVER!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I only ask... what in the hell is this?","review":"From what I'd heard this was supposed to be a comedy... I found nothing comical about it... it started out fine but the constant drumming sounds and the horrid plot were enough to drive anyone to insanity. By the end of the film myself and another I was watching it with were about ready to break the TV, it seemed to just grind our nerves with the constant drumming over and over again.The plotine is horrible, it got to the end and it's like \\"WHAT?!\\" THis is just terrible... if you have a high bloodpressure, do NOT watch this film, it WILL give you a higher one believe me.Worst Adam Sandler film ever, it made me almost think twice about seeing Anger Management a few days ago. Sandler is great, but this is a waste of money, time and will definately cause some unwanted stress.

There were a few things I thought were funny, but mostly the entire movie just felt drab and lifeless. Adam Sandler gave an excellent performance; really, all the performances were very good, but that doesn't help to breathe any life into this off-the-wall nod to mentally unstable people who still manage to lead fairly normal lives. I'm not even entirely happy that I watched it, I'm kind of vaguely wishing for my hour and a half back, and I don't do that very often. I guess this kind of movie just isn't my thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Movie","review":"Adam Sandler has found his legs and it is about time. As Barry Egan, a dominated ready to bust loose introvert, he finds life and love apart from his foggy world of pudding promotions, toy piano's and toilet plungers.Barry searching for love as quietly as he can phones a sex line only to be drawn into life through their fraud and his growing love for Lena (Emily Watson). The movie turns and surprises. It is a joy to watch.This is an exceptional movie and an Oscar worthy performance by Sandler."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Oddest Movie in Many Years","review":"I went to see this one with three of my friends and we all agreed that it was very unsettling to watch, but we all enjoyed it very much. It's just that kind of movie. Its certainly an original. And everyone agreed Adam Sandler's performance is the best thing about it -I would even say Oscar-caliber. I'm giving it five stars here simply for its uniqueness. (And I would suggest to the cheeches who thought it was \\"the worst picture I ever saw\\" to go spend thier time and bucks on pablum like \\"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\\" or \\"White Oleander\\".)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet, feel-good movie","review":"When this appeared in cinemas I ignored it, simply because it starred Adam Sandler, so I thought it was another mindless slapstick comedy. (I did like \\"The Wedding Singer\\" though). Subsequently I discovered that it is a romantic-drama, and, as I discovered while watching the DVD, a very good one. A major detour for Adam Sandler, as he plays a serious character, and does so admirably. He plays a weird socially-awkward guy whose life seems sad and meaningless until he meets a woman with similar weirdnesses to his.There is someone for everyone. The notion is not original, but this exploration of it certainly is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Punch Drunk Love","review":"This movie is one of my favorites because you walk away from it with the largest smile on your face, yet if you were to explain it to someone, they'd ask why on earth you're smiling. I know that sounds cryptic, but if you enjoy human emotion and it's fickle nature, then go see this movie. Watch it without knowing anything about the movie. Don't expect any one thing and you will be happily surprised that this movie has everything.If you want something to be glaringly funny, telling you when to laugh and when to smile, please don't see this movie. You have to think for yourself and not let a director's set-up tell you when a funny part is coming up. In short, this is one of the greatest, most awkwardly beautiful love stories I've ever seen. It's everything that life encompasses: fear, love, anger, unfair bullies and redemption, anxiousness, and eccentricities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie ever","review":"After 15mins of watching this abortion.

Only a collection of unrelated scenes of fights and craziness, in addition to loud annoying meaningless sound effects. I did not get the point neither did the people who left the theater early -- they were a lot. I regretted I didn't leave and kept hoping that there will be a point at the end. Adam Sandler was fine as an actor, but if he kept playing this kind of weak stories, he would go down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"I just saw \\"Punch Drunk Love.\\" It is awful. It is stupid. It is not funny. None of the characters are endearing. Emily Watson is miscast.

In short, it is a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Punch-Drunk Love","review":"What a complete and total waste of 95 minutes of my life, not including the money I spent purchasing this DVD. I have always been an Adam Sandler fan, but there was not one scene worth watching in this movie. And for everyone to say how great it is, doesn't have a clue what a great movie should be.

Adam Sandler kept me watching, only because of him","review":"So I am watching this movie and thinking the direction is pretty weird, but I am sure some of you indie lovers, love this weird stuff. I am more of a blockbuster movie type of gal although I feel that I do know how to appreciate a good indie.This movie does not qualify on my list of good indies, maybe worst indies would be more like it.The movie is so slow, the story is so-so and the end makes you feel like you wasted your freaking time.Adam Sandler is great as always, I love him and thatw as the only reason why I rented this picture. He didn't cut it enough to make this a god movie.Bottom line: If you like his other films, don't rent this just because of that reason. This is totally something different.

I hated that and didn't like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two hours of my life I cannot get back","review":"I went with a friend to see this movie and we were not at all impressed with it.

There was no beginning, middle and end to this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two words...hated it. (no snap, no twist)","review":"I was so very excited about this movie. I was thrilled to see Sandler doing a movie that doesn't involve a sport and/or a stupid accent. Like all comedians, in him dwells a darker side that \\"drove\\" him to being the funny guy. I absolutely love Adam Sandler's work and \\"Magnolia\\" and \\"Boogie Nights\\" were great movies. So, this film had potential. Like Crystal Pepsi and The New Monkees, some things look better on paper. Better luck next time Adam. Maybe you could write a script for \\"The Longest Pee, the Movie\\".

I also had been impressed with some of Sandler's more serious roles, such as in Spanglish and his wonderful straight man performance in Anger Management. Unfortunately, this film just didn't do it for me. It was dull, dull, dull. I had no sympathy at all for Sandler's character. None of the other characters held much interest for me, either. I love Seymour Phillip Hoffman and Emily Watson, but they were wasted in this annoying film. while I admire Anderson's films, I don't always like the characters in them.

It has some good laughs, but considering the talent of Conway and Korman, it really should havebeen a lot better.In They Went That-A-Way & That-A-Way Tim Conway and Chuck McCann are a couple of bumbling cops that are sent by the governor intoa prison farm to find out where an old man hide his loot from a robbery.

The premise is nearly impossible to describe, but suffice it to say that you've never seen one quite like this before.

Every single vampires film I ever saw, the vampires ALWAYS dies by sun light.Anyway this is a very poor vampire film. I hate the plot story, it's just crap.If you want to see good vampires movies try FRIGHT NIGHT - LOST BOYS - BLADE - FROM DUSK TILL DAWN - INTERVIEW WITH A VAMPIRE. They are the best so cheak them out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Genre of Vampire Film","review":"This is a remarkable movie, & has come a long way from the Dracula movies of the 50's & 60's. Although this film will not be for everyone, it is powerfully archetypal & will become a cult classic. Vampires with their own society, with their own unique personalities-- they really do \\" bleed \\" into a homosapien world. Adrian Paul does a good job & Bai Ling is magnificent. The photography is other-worldly in a familiar, unsettling sort of way. The sets are decadent, but also possess a timeless quality. The political overtones are fascinating as well. Only the vampire terrorists are violent, etc. This is a truly fine movie & deserves more than one viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most boring vampire movie ever made","review":"This is even worse than the original Nosferatu, a silent film. The story is not fully written, it can't seem to decide if it is a vampire story, or a distopian science fiction story. The setting is never explained, or even noticed by the actors. They dress for the 1940's with dashes of the 1990's thrown in. They behave as if it were just after WWII, so why does it seem that half the story setting was stolen from George Orwell's 1984? That there are vampires is just a coincidence. The story would have worked better without them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad. I feel I got my money's worth!","review":"(...)Definitely a film for fans of vampire films, noir detective dramas, and Adrian Paul.My complaint is that the near future resembles the fifties too much-- a director's choice, I know, to emphasize the resemblance to Nazis, but I felt it was a bit heavy handed.(...)See this film, even if you don't care to own it."},{"rating":"2","title":"would have been better if the wire work was ggod","review":"this is more like a 3 and a half stars rating.what brought this movie down for me was the sloppy hong kong wire work.the people who was doing it seemed like they never did it before.it looked so awful it was just corny.wich brought this otherwise decent flick down.the mood and scenematogrphy was good,so was the story.but the attempts at the john woo style action failed in most scenes.some looked good but for the most part they failed horribly with the action.if they had suceeded in the action part this would have been the best strait to video movie i had ever seen.but if they make a sequel they should learn from their mistakes"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and clever","review":"A friend recommended this CD and I will always be grateful.

I installed it on my boat myself with a minimum of tools. It keeps both batteries charged and ready to go all the time, and doesn't ever boil out the battery water (although I recommend checking battery water level every couple of weeks). The lights are a nice indicator of charge activity, so you know when and how much they each are being charged. Usually only when I have just come in and plugged in to shore power I will see the red lights for a very short while before they turn to blue and then to green. If the red or blue lights stayed on a lot I would be checking batteries... I would highly recommend this charger to anyone who has a boat or rv with two (separate) batteries and wants them to be ready at a moments notice..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect introduction to Nikki's Poetic Art","review":"I was introduced to Nikki Giovanni on Bill Moyers Journal and found her such a delightful, interesting and insightful woman I had to get to know her better. This recording is a wonderful introduction to her art, her thought and her personality; and it is a gift to have the poems read by the poet. In addition to reading many of her poems, Nikki also offers many fascinating and occassionally extensive background remarks about particular poems, reflecting on events and people of the Civil Rights Movement and upon life, as only a poet of her stature can. I highly recommend this recording to anyone who already knows Nikki from her published poetry or to anyone who wants to meet a beautiful soul, full of wisdom, wit, and a heart for truth and justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong edition","review":"Although the picture is of the correct edition, the wrong edition was sent.

She learned from her father and took over upon his death. This is a daring concept for the time and most people felt a woman was not capable of carrying on her father's tradition of training exceptional racehorses. Conflict comes from an arranged engagement to a man that wants her land and horses as much as her. A bet is made that will affect her life.I would recommend this book to anyone that enjoys historical romance novels. This one is just different enough that you do not feel you are reading a formula."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story To Read In An Afternoon","review":"I got this book because I love historical romance novels.

Not enough content."},{"rating":"1","title":"did i seriously watch this whole thing?","review":"just got finished watching this movie on HBO and am still not sure what i just witnessed. this is quite possibly the worst movie i have ever seen. the way the movie jumped around was if the director was trying to re-invent the pulp fiction plot twist, but only ends up confusing viewers. 1hour & 50minutes wasted, better spent on something else. anything but this horrible movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tries to hard...","review":"This movie tries too hard to be negative, empty, and depressing. The movie tried to shock its viewers, but it came across as freshman-year college film class \\"dark.\\" I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Horrible Movie!","review":"Ok, so just like the rest of you I saw that trailer for this movie and thought \\"Oh, sexy, fun, Now! I need to see that!\\" Thank God I missed this movie's ten seconds in the theater because I saved 5 bucks since I only had to rent this mess. So, what is wrong with the movie. Where to begin. The Direction of the film feels like a cocky NYU film student trying to show off his effects skills. The Acting is bad all around. The Story goes nowhere. None of the characters are relatable or in anyway nice. The Trailer for the movie tries to appeal to the younger audience by showing drugs, sex and James Vanderbeek half naked. If he was naked in the movie I don't remember, if he kissed a boy it was only in that boys DREAMS, because the gay character in this film is pathetic and stereotypical. He spends the whole film chasing after straight guys who beat him up, yeah there is a message to send to the youth of America! Skip this one and watch Cruel Intentions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"People who are looking for a feel good story are not going to get it in this film. And that is exactly what makes it great -- because life is seldom this way. The characters are not likable and there are no happy endings. The story is told masterfully, and I envy the talent of the screenwriter/director.I just finished watching the movie, got a drink of water, and watched it again to make sure I didn't miss a thing. Brilliant. Bravo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I had expected !","review":"I had seen some really good reviews for this film and the previews were intriging. The characters are under developed; the cinemaphotography was the best thing about the movie. There were some scenes that reflected the title, but overall it was meaning less dribble. I thought it to be one of the 10 worst films of this last year. I thought that it had great potential, but someone missed the boat all together in prepping the book for film. A BIG disappointment. Rent this; but do not bother with the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rather entertaining","review":"Look, it's a social satire. If one hasn't lived the life or simply lived around it then one just won't get it beyond the superficial. La de da la de da da.Therefore if one enjoys good acting coupled with a certain edge then this is the film. Though remember, this isn't exactly cookie cutter material even with the editing. It's a cool story coupled with a cool movie. Far better than the movie American Psycho where the director simply didn't get it...and it showed."},{"rating":"1","title":"When kids from the \\"WB\\" go bad.","review":"Wow. What a waste of time. Since there wasn't much of a plot, I'll assume the point of the movie was to glamorize sex, drugs, and suicide. Don't get me wrong, I can enjoy all those things when they're done well, but this was just trying too hard to be \\"hard\\". Jessica Beil as a coke [addict]? James Van-der-Beek as the psycho thrill-seeking drug dealer? Oh my, what will their parents think? This was a big laugh as much as anything. Being unintentionally funny, and having a good soundtrack were the only good points to this. The sad part is knowing that some 16 year old is going to watch this and think it's cool. I mean the sex and drugs are one thing, but there were two suicide scenes because people couldn't \\"hook-up\\" with their crushes. Even if the shock-value was the thing this was going for, it was just done wrong. If you want that type of film, rent \\"Kids\\". It's alot more realistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star is too many","review":"This is one of the most odious, offensive, repellent movies I have ever seen. One reviewer urges you to look behind the shallow, hedonistic characters and find truth and beauty. Don't bother trying; there is only a void. I watched this movie with other young viewers in ultra-open-minded San Francisco, and the feeling throughout the theater was palpable. It was like enduring root canal surgery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother...it's not worthy","review":"This movie only succeeds in an effort to depict the most mundane, cynical and nihilistic view of life. If you want to feel offended, shocked and ultimately bored by all the emptyness and lack of sense from this movie...go ahead, watch it...just don't say you were not warned. Really, there are truly better movies thant this...even the silly ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie of All Time","review":"There are not enough bad things I can say about this movie. It was a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly horrible","review":"This is one of the nastiest things I've sat through for a long time. I kept waiting for some hint of wit or wisdom to emerge but it simply cloaks its vacuousness with some pretentious flashback trickery. Every character in it is repellent and despaired, sex-obsessed and self-absorbed; the violence and abuse is graphic and it has nothing to say about human nature beyond what we know happens to people who have lost touch with all decent values. I'm told that it is satirical but it's too witless to be trenchant or mordant in its observations and as for comedy - I'm afraid I could not laugh at its glorification of decadence. People who live like this live neither long nor happily but this film attempts more to legitimise and normalise their casual misery than to satirise it. Real \\"vomit of despair\\" - avoid it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Visual Storytelling","review":"Yes there are tons of random hookups, rampant drug abuse, and homosexuality, but I don't think anyone could argue Ellis is \\"promoting\\" or \\"glamorizing\\" them (any more than \\"Boogie Nights\\" promotes being a porn actor.) I never read the book, but imagine it must be more of the same(?) I see traces of the biting social criticism of R.W. Fassbinder all over this work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop trying to be so deep and accept this for what it is","review":"This is a highly watchable movie. I mean this movie can be categorized however you please and you can roll your eyes and try to discredit it by throwing it into genre's....Stop. Just watch the movie and enjoy it for what it is. A wild and crazy portrait of college life and romance. I noticed all the cliches as well but I am not smug enough to chastize this movie because of them. If you liked Cruel Intentions you will like this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for everybody - For the openminded only","review":"Ian Somerhalder (Paul Denton) is reason enough to watch the movie. Not many women are as pretty as this young man. Sorry ladies. Tis true.The movie is definitely not for everybody...don't go in with preconceived notions of what the film is about or you will be disappointed BIG time. And, if you are not a mature and open minded individual don't waste your time...I understand the negativity that surrounds the film but I loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"About as satisfying as limp asparagus","review":"I was sadly disappointed in this latest attempt to depict the \\"meaning of the meaningless of it all.\\" This film was chock a block full of lukewarm acting, semi-weak writing with fancy camera tricks to make up for Van Der Beek's leering (his attempt at angst?)and the lackluster character development. Jessica Biel was almost convincing as the sad little promiscuous girl looking for love and affection through sex, but who cares, since that character is totally overdone? Shannyn Sossamon, as gorgeous as she is, cannot save this trite exercise in banality. There is an uncomfortable scene in which she is vomited on while losing her virginity, but it seemed gratuitous. The best scene is when one of the kids (can't recall the name) makes an excellent scene in a restaurant."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting tale of relationships","review":"This was adapted from the book of the same title - don't expect the film to be quite as true to the book as it could have been. This is good that it shows how people have different ideas or expectations for relationships - one character like another character but the feelings aren't recipricated and so on."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\" I always knew it would be like this\\"","review":"There is always something you take from a movie , bad or good. I certainly don't know what to think of this one and I have watched it twice. You can either be completely turned on by it or turned off. College brats , that are oVer Sexed, Over exposed, and Over dosed. I think it tries to hard to be like PULP FICTION and that is where it fails, it had complete potiental adapated by the novel. WHat stuck with me was the campus stud, who went to a european vacation and went all out on drugs , and sex, when he gets back on one pivotal scene the girl who lusts after him knocks on his dorm door, much to his surprise does not remember her, but look closely on the door when he closes it on one of those erasermarks bulletins, it says, \\"BE CAREFUL, CAME BACK POSITIVE.\\" Deep, Real and Scary that is something any human being can overlook and be affected. EITHER WAY RENT BEFORE U BUY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird, conceited 2 hours of time","review":"I picked up this movie because it had Ian Somerhalder in it. Mistake. This movie is weird, brash, conceited, and thinks it is far better then it has any hope of being. I didn't know it was based off a book until I got on here, but I sincerely hope the book is better because the movie is terrible. And the ending was retarded. Pass this one up, even if you like Ian."},{"rating":"2","title":"About the BLU-RAY release.","review":"I dont understand the release date of April. I bought my copy of the UNRATED bluray at Best Buy last week for 9.99 along with Out of Sight for 15.00. The picture is better than the DVD release not great but ok. Still very grainy in parts. Plus its in widescreen unlike the dvd that was only released full with a crappy stereo sound. This at least is in SURROUND SOUND. All the extras from the DVD have been cycled over from the dvd. Good for the upgrade! Its interesting how much was missed from the full screen disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pretty Good Adaption of the Book","review":"While The Rules of Attraction is definitely not for everyone, I loved it and I'm sure that plenty of other people will love it too. Straying only slightly from the Bret Easton Ellis novel, the movie was able to capture the same feel as the book. I also enjoyed the great acting, creative cinematography, and excellent music. People looking for the usual romantic comedy film should probably steer clear of this one but if you're looking for something a little darker and edgy then you should definitely check it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Torture","review":"Wow. This was a terrible terrible movie. I dont even know where to begin. I guess I'll start off by saying that I gave this movie one star because it had great camera work. Other than that it really didnt have much going for it. First of all, there was no plot. none. I just kept watching it wondering where the hell the movie was going. Most of the characters were flat and undeveloped. It was extremely lengthy for a movie that went no where. I think the best part of the movie was when the credits started rolling. The only movie worse than this was Bjork's \\"dancer in the dark\\" and that is pretty bad my friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"Yes, I found myself saying \\"What?\\" throughout this entire movie. Perhaps I'm not as film-savvy as some of you others, but I really thought this movie was ridiculous. There were waaaay too many effects, and basically no plot line other than following (then backtracking, then following again) the incredibly nonsensical lives of entirely too many characters. You've got your drug addicts, your not-quite-straight-but-trying-to-hide-its, your blatantly bisexuals, your \\"virgins\\", your tramps, your womanizers....Basically, your bored rich kids. I think that this was a none too successful attempt for some of the actors to shed their \\"goody goody\\" images. Imagine watching James Van der Beek masturbating and selling drugs, and Jessica Biel running around in her underwear enjoying sexual escapades with the entire football team. If that's your thing, go for it. Otherwise, try American Psycho--at least it has a plot and some pretty good twists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite Possibly the Dumbest Movie I've Ever Seen","review":"Words cannot adequately describe what a pile of fertilizer this \\"movie\\" is. The dopey plot is pointless, the bland actors are forgettable, the idiotic characters are reprehensible--oh, why waste the space. Avoid this junk! Pray that Hollywood stops squandering precious celluloid on Brett Easton Ellis' pretentious typewriting banging!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting and empty-headed!","review":"The rules of attraction is the most boring film I have ever seen. I almost walked out of the theatre when i saw this film. God, it is terrible, crummy acting from the whole cast, what the heck is Faye Dunaway doing in this movie? Did she run out of money or something? James Van Der Beek and Jessica Biel are the worst actors in the world, yuck! Everyone is pucking on eachother, sick picture of people who have STD's, foul sex scenes, and even a disturbing scene of a girl committing suicide in her bathtub by slicing her wrists. What was i thinking seeing this junk, i must have been lacking brain cells that day. Don't waste you time and money with this bulls#&@!."},{"rating":"1","title":"YiKeS!","review":"This movie is trying very hard to be a Pulp Fiction for a younger crowd, and you can tell. It mostly fails and the resulting film is an almost unwatchable nightmare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easily the worst movie I have ever seen!","review":"You know most times I dont listen when people tell me a movie was horrible b/c I know I have different tastes, but I shoulda listened this time. The actors in the film who usely produce such great films and tv shows, severely dropped the ball here. The storyline was poorly developed and so were the characters which made the end of the movie to me be like \\"So what, who cares.\\" Honestly if you wanna see a well acted and rebelious story, dont watch this film, its not even worth quenching your curiosity, PLEASE BELIEVE ME WHEN I SAY THIS! Well lets change that if you are on an acid trip or something the movie might be interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"girl you nasty","review":"this movie is empty. it made me feel gross. i wonder who this movie was marketed to... people who think they like good movies but actually don't? someone had fun in the editing room making things backwards and freeze-frame which doesn't work if there's no purpose. i hate movies where the narration is too dumb to take and this is one of them. if you like weird, random movies i recommend seeing some of the better ones (requiem for a dream, being john malkovich, eternal sunshine of the spotless mind or punch drunk love). this film does earn one star because jessica biel is cool and we're getting married this summer."},{"rating":"1","title":"PURE TRASH","review":"This is now the worst film I have ever seen. That place was previously held by the 1976 film called \\"Lipstick\\".It is full of undeveloped characters and a flimsy boring plot. The Director/Screenwriter makes a pathetic attempt to make this film cool through over the top scenes. He is probably bitter from years of not getting credit from his work with Quentin Tarantino and uses brutality or anything sensational or disgusting to get attention which is a cheap way to do it. Sorry, but Quentin has the ability to pull it off. Mr. Avary does not."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Genuine Achievement","review":"I don't usually review movies (...) but felt I had to take a moment to praise Rules of Attraction for really capturing the lives of children of privilege. Somehow, utilizing mostly satire, this film captures the pain and longing beneath the trappings of wealth. A straightforward, empathetic approach wouldn't have worked -- these aren't the most charming people. By distancing us from their pain, Avary actually allows us to see it more clearly.The film collapses under its own weight at the end. Anyway it's less a real narrative than a freeform look at sexual confusion and mores at the end of a wretched century. Beautiful and brave performances from start to finish, especially Ian Somerholder's as a pampered, narcissistic gay student with a very wrong crush."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect, only thing I miss is his brother","review":"This is one of those movies I would descripe as a classic cult movie. Filming, directing, music, story... Everything is perfect.There will always be someone that can't appreciate excellent films such as this one. My advice to them is : Go home and watch the piano and the crying game... The scene where a girl cuts here wrist is beatiful and terrible at the same time. Isn't the purpose of watching movies to free some emotions?? Well it is exactly what this film does. I will buy this dvd the second it is released, and I advice you to do the same!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"Banal, I know there must be people who will think that watching people masturbate, shoot coke up their nose, commit suicide and use the toilet on camera is worty of 5 stars. If you do then this is for you.The chatacters try to be so damn tough and real that they end up being unbelievable. Rent it if you must, but procede with caution."},{"rating":"2","title":"teen rebellion","review":"Interesting take on teen rebellion including reaction to misguided teens who think that just because they feel something for another, that other should reciprocate the feeling. Leads to stalking and being a complete fool."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Bret Ellis Lovers","review":"As a huge fan of Bret Ellis' novels, I was especially pleased with this theatrical interpretation. For those who love American Psycho and appreciate movies that hold true to Ellis' work, this is a must-see to be sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's not Rock & Roll","review":"If this movie didn't attempt to be something more than a flick for teen-age boys, I might not have taken several moments to sit back and think about it. However, since the makers of Rules attempted at a contrived philosophy throughout the movie, I feel the need to let anyone curious about this moive know the truth. This movie is painfuly stupid. The characters are weak and petty, the acting is one dimensional, and the script was a patchwork of several good movies, which gave Rules of Attraction a perverse Frankenstein make-up.If you're into mindless sex and nudity which is attempted to be passed as \\"DEEP\\", then rent this. The only emotion this movie will stir in anyone who isn't a teen boy is depression over the fact that you actually sat down and watched this. And god forbid if you actually paid for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Casting","review":"It's not often that you get to see a film in which everyone is mis-cast, but Rules of Attraction is one of those moments. Sean and Lauren are the worst choices in this one, with Van Der Beak stretching to distance himself from his squeaky clean past, and Lauren just seeming much more weird and aloof than she was in the novel. And don't even get me started on that hatchet job haircut. Biel and the girl who played Lauren should have flip-flopped roles as the Lauren in the novel seemed more akin to her. Paul and Victor are just annoying, the portrayal of the drug dealer is way too overboard, and Fred Savage as the junkie playing the clarinet-I mean c'mon! Scenes added on, like the hotel room dance to George Michael's \\"Faith,\\" show director Roger Avery's overindulgence. And all those super close-ups....UGGGGGH!!!! Just terrible souless film-making. If I were Bret Easton Ellis I'd be pissed at this hatchet job of a film based on a far superior novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Genuine Achievement","review":"I don't usually review movies on Amazon but felt I had to take a moment to praise Rules of Attraction for really capturing the lives of children of privilege. Somehow, utilizing mostly satire, this film captures the pain and longing beneath the trappings of wealth. A straightforward, empathetic approach wouldn't have worked -- these aren't the most charming people. By distancing us from their pain, Avary actually allows us to see it more clearly.The film collapses under its own weight at the end. Anyway it's less a real narrative than a freeform look at sexual confusion and mores at the end of a wretched century. Beautiful and brave performances from start to finish, especially Ian Somerholder's as a pampered, narcissistic gay student with a very wrong crush."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved the Book, Hated the movie","review":"Read and loved the book, decided to give the movie a shot despite the pop teen cast. Horrible. The movie is a hatchet job. The director tried to modernize a book that was written for a time when fast sex, drugs and unmerited self-righteousness what the norm (the early 80's, pre-aids scare). The movie is extremely loosely based on the book, and lost much of its essence. Suggestion: read the book, forget the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this movie","review":"The Rules of Attraction is one of the most clever movies I have seen in a long time. It has a very interesting and amusing plot. And it's funny; I found myself laughing out loud repeatedly throughout the movie.The basic theme of the movie is love. Well...love and drugs.Direction is great. In my opinion it's better than Kill Bill 1 or 2. I strongly recommend this movie to everyone. It's a great laugh and wonderful movie. A must see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unpleasent, and Pointless. Directing intersting though.","review":"This is a movie in the tradition of American Beauty, Doomsday Generation and those other flicks that trys so hard to become art that they end up losing the main point. Its not fun to watch. Imagine watching pathetic students that have no direction, lead their lives in to utter disaster because their fantasy idea of love ones don't come true. What is the point of making such a depressing and uninspiring movie? On the plus side the directing was interesting to watch, with the backwards theme like Memento, and it had some interesting visuals/angles as well. This is why I gave the movie two stars instead of one. If you like movies like American Beauty, or Doomsday Generation this might appeal to you, but stay far away if you hated those movies like I do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Umm...I don't Get it","review":"If you looked up bad movie in the dictionary, than you just might stumble upon this one in one of the examples. This movie absoulutely disguted me beyond words. When the characters weren't trying to get laid or doing drugs, the camera was tweaking out, moving back and forth, backwards and forwards. I literally had to sit down afterwards and figure out the plot line, and when it came right down to it, there was none to found. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes to see nasty images, and college kids ruining their lives, which I hope is no one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rules of Making Me Vomit","review":"Awful, terrible, dusgusting. It takes a LOT to offend me, and I found this movie offensive. I loved seeing Dawson in a gay love scene, though. I felt terribly sorry for Lauren (Shannyn Sossamon), but hated the rest of the characters. The movie really has no plot - it's just a bunch of shock-value scenes and special effects throughout. Parents, don't be fooled by the all-star teenage-crush cast - this is not a movie for the teen set by any means."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Hair Color","review":"I have tried many different hair colors, and I find this to be the best. I would estimate that I have about 15% gray hair and this covers it beautifully. I get great color with little brassy-ness. It lasts a good 4-6 weeks. When a few gray hairs show again, I treat the roots with my natural color and a 20 developer for 35 minutes, comb through the rest of my hair and wait 10 minutes, then wash out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Reader's Refuge","review":"My son brought this book home from the school library and while he enjoyed it, I was completely hooked. As I kid I loved books that gave me places to wander around and get lost in--The Mixed-up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankwiler comes to mind. This museum is much smaller, but gives readers a glimpse into what running a museum is like, and the magical atmosphere that can be created amid all the bits and pieces of the past. In this case, the \\"magic\\" is more than atmospheric, and the characters are an eclectic mix. After the book went back to the library, I ordered a copy for myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting story-- one of my childhood favorites","review":"I read this book over and over again starting at age 10 when I first discovered it. There was something magical and intriguing about the story of a girl who comes across a ghost in a museum, and then learns about her past (so different from today) over the course of several meetings. There is a mysterious quality to the book, and always the feeling that something this magical might happen to any child at the right time in the right place. This is one of the stories I most strongly remember falling in love with as a child-- some 30 years later, it still sticks with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A timeless mind opener...","review":"I first read this book when I was about 12 or 13 years old. I found it to be a beautiful and mysterious book with just enough strangeness to make me want to read it again and again. Well when I got older I found a used copy and decided I didn't want to be without it because it impacted me like few books had, and as a kid I read alot! It will give you an imagination if you don't have one, and if you do have one, it'll fire it up all the more. I love it. I still pull it out and read it on occassion, usually in one sitting. The 'person' who gave it a one star rating is probably used to Ren & Stimpy..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing 3 long chapters from the end of the book","review":"I know that this book is by no means meant to be a good reprint of the book. However, given the price of the book, I find it unacceptable that this book is missing a significant chunk of the book. Although there are disclaimers about the quality of the print, i just want to point out that about 1 out of 12 pages is blurred almost illegibly and the text only occupies about 40% of each page. If anyone is considering purchasing this book for class, you should look up the google ebook which is free, complete and free of blurred print. Or just purchase a version from a better publisher."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's cheap and tasty & easy to fix.","review":"For a side dish or entree that only costs about a dollar, pretty tasty, especially if you add your own chicken meat to it. Cooks very easily and quickly too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rice product you will enjoy","review":"I was surprised, I did not expect this product to be so good. We love it. I like to always have some on hand. I also like to use it as a starter, and add other ingredients to it. You won't be dissapointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick and Tasty","review":"I buy this from Amazon by the case for those last-minute meals that need a quick, easy side dish. Everyone in the family likes it---even those who aren't crazy about rice. It's a very nice blend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Gracious!","review":"This is really good, easy to make and easy to add additional ingredients. Since I always have Chicken or Shrimp Fried Rice I knew plain fried rice wouldn't cut it. So the skillet Chicken Fried Rice Recipe on the package came in very handy. Leftover chicken, a dash of soy sauce and a drained can of bean sprouts made everyone happy except the dog...no leftovers.Well leftovers are classed up with this Asian Sides with less sodium than before."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book gives me a weird feeling","review":"When I was five, this book was in a bookshelf upstairs in the hallway of a nursing home.

Although its really different from her previous CDs, i think the transition of style was really well done here. This album is distinctively more pop, but at the same time its not cheesy like a lot of pop is. Her voice is just as good as ever, and the instrumentals are tight~ I'm glad i bought this =)"},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"I loved Nelly with her album \\"Whoa Nelly\\". What happened here? It's like she got more immature as she grew older and had a kid. These are definatly not mom like songs, more like slutty teenager songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"what does it mean?","review":"Most of the tracks are catchy, but the songs (especially All Good Things) are nonsense. Either it's going over my head or they mean nothing at all to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"So, so bad!!","review":"Was forced to give this one at least one star, (Amazon won't let you give less). Awful album. Embarrassingly bad lyrics. Don't torture yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Timbaland Project","review":"Timbo's future-shock sound that he's been cranking out since 1997 is still here, this time applied to formerly folk-rock-esque Nelly Furtado. It's enough of a shame that Timbo applied the same trick he's been pulling to Nelly, and that she's allowed herself to transform into some kind of disco queen (worst makeover since Jewel), but the fact that \\"Do It\\" is stolen from a Finnish independent techno artist Tempest without credit seals the deal. Catchy, but nonetheless played out before it was ever released."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's more to life than sex, Nelly","review":"I love the music, but I'm sick of listening to pop music about sex. That's all artists sing about as if this is all life is about. Weak lyrics is a sign of a weak and insecure artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your $$","review":"This is the worst CD I've heard in a long time.The music (if you can call it that) is extremely repetitive. Program a drum machine and repeat the same three chords for the entire song. Quite a formula. Must be nice to have a major label behind you.Nelly has a nice voice though. I'd advise her to dump her band and her song writer(s)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I was really looking forward to this cd after hearing \\"promiscuous girl\\" and \\"te busque\\" but was thoroughly disappointed.

This cd packs the heat, Nelly intoxicates us with soulful jams making us sweat till we come running back for more. I love \\"Maneater\\", \\"Promiscuous\\" \\"Afraid\\" and \\"Say It Right\\". Those are my songs. I also like \\"Glow\\", 'No Hay Igual\\", \\"Do It\\" and \\"All Good Things\\". I wish she would have included \\"Undercover\\" on this cd.

I still think Nelly could of sounded better if she had less music around her. I continue to love your voice, Nelly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Okay","review":"I bought this album because I loved the first single \\"Promiscuous\\" so much. The rest of the album is unfortunately quite blah. There don't seem to be any other standout tracks other than \\"Promiscuous\\". I like that she went in a different direction from her first two albums, but it just doesn't click and most of the tracks are mediocre at best. I'd recommend just downloading one or two songs on I-Tunes and avoid wasting money on the entire album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Poor Ms. Furtado can't seem to come close to her \\"Whoa, Nelly\\" CD.

I didnt blame Nelly, because I knew it was probably some fat Republican guy in a suit who had pressured her into taking the never fail \\"sex sells\\" approach.When you actully listen to the music, it is a great album. I have always loved anything Timbaland has done, he really needs to make a comeback in the music scene. And even though the record company who put out this album only seems to release the songs that have potential to be sexy or a club hit, there are some great songs on here.My fav's are \\"Wait for you\\", \\"afraid\\", \\"glow\\" \\"maneater\\", \\"no hay igual\\", actully this whole album is good check it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible horrible horrible","review":"I love nelly furtado, honestly i do, but somewhere along her journey to making this album something very drastic happened. she missed her way, the album is as unforthcoming as possible. it sucks big time!!!, i bought it and now im giving it away. no words can truly describe how bad this album is. please save ur money and buy something more useful..."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointing","review":"The cd cover of mine came broke.

It took me a bit to like her latest single, \\"Promiscuous\\". But the more and more I listen to it, I started to like Nelly's new direction and couldn't wait for the new album. I bought it the first day it was made available.After listening her album, I found out that \\"Promiscuous\\" is not representative of the rest of the album. Also equally disappointing is that her Portuguese roots are gone - she instead opted to sing in Spanish (is this the record company's doing?)None of the songs have the magic of \\"I'm like a bird.\\" and her focus has shifted from Pop music of her earlier two albums to Hip-Hop.If you are a big fan of Hip-hop music, I would say buy this album - you'll probably enjoy it. However, if you were a big fan of Nelly Furtado's earlier work, save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nelly Sells Out","review":"What once was a promising young singer downplaying her beauty while focusing on a unique music style has now turned into the latest artist to sell out for bigger sales. Whether it was Nelly's choice or her record label disappointed with sales of her second CD \\"Folklore\\", \\"Loose\\" is an obvious attempt to restart her career by signing on with producers and stars that can get her music on the radio. The songs on \\"Loose\\" could just as easily be sung by J-Lo, Janet Jackson or any other generic voice lost in the beat. And Nelly makes sure her beauty is in obvious view for all to see. Lots of fans raving about this CD admit they never bought her prior CDs. For those of us that did, \\"Loose\\" is a major disappointment and sell-out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dis(Loose)appointment","review":"Very disappointing CD, after two excellent and unique previous two albums. Let's hope that after the \\"Loose\\" fiasco Nelly will dump her current shallow co-producers and return to her original style and won't compromise again her artistic creativity to produce another boring mass market set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment of the Year","review":"I recently saw a cell phone commercial and thought that the music playing was the Black Eyed Peas. To my horror, I looked up and saw Nelly Furtado's name on the screen.Her first two albums are absolutely amazing, so I know it isn't a matter of lack of talent. I can only blame The Recording Industry (tm) for this atrocity.If you didn't like Whoa Nelly! and Folklore, but love the Black Eyed Peas (as sadly, the majority of the brainwashed masses do) then buy this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"I love nelly furtardo.

If you like one song you will love them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall good, definitely grows on you as you listen to it more","review":"First time I heard the album, I really only cared for two of the songs, Promiscuous and Te Busque. I realized that it had a good beat throughout and was worth listening to agan before discounting it completely. The more I listened to it, the more it has grown on me and I listen to it quite a bit. I'm still not that fond of the song Maneater but I think its because its a very rough edged song, which I admire her for taking a risk on. It is definitely an album that shows that Nelly Furtado is willing to accept the influences around her to write and sing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable, but not Whoa, Nelly!","review":"Nelly Furtado has a great voice and wonderful rhythm! I really like this album, but Whoa, Nelly! is still my favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly addictive!","review":"I'm really impressed with this new cd from Nelly Furtado. I've known her music since she came out, and it was pleasant enough, but didn't interest me enough to pick up a cd. That is until LOOSE. At first I skoffed at the idea of her adopting a more R&B/hip hop sound, but it works. Timbaland produced much of the album, and is featured on the track \\"Promiscuous\\", which is very memorable. So is \\"Maneater\\", another great track. In fact, most of the songs here will make you want to dance. Even the songs she doesn't sing in English, \\"No Hay Igual\\" and \\"Te Busque\\" are very enjoyable. There are some great club tracks like \\"Glow\\", \\"Do it\\". Overall very impressed...definately the party album of 2006 so far!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Garbage","review":"This CD is a great example of what happens when good musicians meet record companies with tanking sales: they want mass appeal rather than quality. Nelly's first 2 CD's had a smooth sound to them - Folklore was definitely above average for a modern-day artist. Her first album sounded exceptional as well - it was music that had some thought behind it. When I read that Folklore was a disappointment as far as sales went, I knew we were in trouble - boy was I right! This CD has terrible lyrics, too much synthesizer, and too many pop beats - it sounds like all the other garbage floating around since 2000. I'm very disappointed and saddened to see a modern-day artist that had so much potential sell out. I can only hope that perhaps she will make an independent album with what she wants to produce, and not what some skill-less producer thinks will sound good on a dance floor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly produced crudites","review":"Crudites - you know, those slivers of vegetable that you dunk into various dips? They're great finger food, they're appetisers to keep you occupied until the meal arrives.This album is full of crudites - stuff that is in some way entertaining to listen to, but it all left me wondering when the *real* music was going to arrive. I can understand how people like this stuff - crudites can be very tasty (sweet, sweet carrots, beautifully crunchy cauliflower), but not very filling.\\"Promiscuous\\" really sets the tone for the album for me - an attempt to appeal to popular taste without any thought for moral or artistic integrity."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like her other stuff, CAUTION, this is nothing like it.","review":"I noticed that neither here nor at CD universe could I listen to samples of this CD. I'm pretty sure it's because it's SOOOOOO different. I managed to hear good samples at Barnes and Knobles and I could tell immediately I hated this CD. Too bad for me. Her first CDs were so unique, wonderfully melodic catchy songs, so refreshing. All I can imagine is her record company wanted to see something much different, thinking maybe sales would climb. I have no idea. But the artist on those first two CD's is nowhere to be found here. Not that this is bad. I have no idea. It's certainly nothing I care for though. Be cautious, that's all I'm saying. This is probably not what you think it is if you are a fan from her previous work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tight!","review":"Nelly Furtado's collaboration with Timbaland and Danja has really paid off - her third studio album has something for anybody who's into Pop, Latin, Dance, R&B; and Hip Hop, with three hot singles right off the bat in \\"Promiscuous\\", \\"Maneater\\" and \\"No Hay Igual\\".Spiced up by guest appearances by Attitude and Latin super-hottie Juanes, this album is packed with guaranteed hits and potential singles including the three above, plus \\"Afraid\\", \\"Glow\\", \\"Te Busque\\", \\"Say It Right\\", \\"Do It\\", \\"Wait For You\\" (great intro), and the beautiful ballads \\"In God's Hands\\" and \\"All Good Things (Come to an End)\\", which is one of the best songs on the album.At almost an hour long, Nelly really delivers the goods with this album, both as a singer and songwriter. For three more songs, check out the Japanese version, also sold on Amazon.Amanda Richards, June 20, 2006"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nelly Furtado reinvents herself, and excels at it (41/2 stars)","review":"When I heard the song \\"Promiscuous\\" on the radio, I couldn't believe it was Nelly Furtado. As someone who owns and loves \\"Whoa, Nelly\\", I couln't imagine she will go in the direction she is right now. I am not surprised though, since I heard the excellent remix to \\"Get your freak on\\". I have to say I love this album. It's very upbeat; there are only three slow songs. If I didn't give it five stars, its because I really don't like \\"Glow\\", \\"Showtime\\" and \\"Do it\\". If you like dance music, buy this cd. \\"Maneater\\", \\"Afraid\\", \\"Te busque\\", \\"No hay igual\\", \\"Wait for you\\" and \\"All good things\\" are excellent songs. I specially love \\"All good things\\"; the chorus is extremely beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sing like a tart, make money","review":"Once upon a time in the not-so-distant past, there lived a young woman named Nelly Furtado who was earnest and tried to make honest music. She had success with one album, but the public soon lost interest. The young woman had a choice. She could maintain her integrity, continue to make honest music and make only a small amount of money. She could sell out, act like the other pop tarts and sing about sex to inane beats. She decided to sing like a tart. She had a big hit singing about sex. She lost her soul, but sold a lot of records that made a lot of money. The moral of this story is that it pays to be immoral. The moral of this story is that pop music is painfully boring and uses sex to make up for an absence of talent. Whoops. I thought that this was going to have a fairy tale kind of ending, something you might want to read to your kids at night. Sorry about that. Really sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nelly's New Album","review":"Nelly's new album is not bad. This is my first purchase buying one of her albums.

Those songs are a great tribute to her culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nelly lost her way with this one","review":"I did not even bother buying this album after I heard Promiscuous on the radio. While it's a great album to dance to, and other songs on it, like Maneater and Say It Right, are infectious, this album was a disappointment to me. I was so excited when I heard that Nelly's third album was coming out, but what a let down when it finally was released! It sounds just like the garbage every other female pop vocalist is putting out. I own and love BOTH of Nelly's previous CDs because they are ORIGINAL, quirky and down-to-earth. I feel like with this third album we're seeing a trumped up, glossed over version of Nelly: so fake and completely without personality. I sincerely hope that when she puts out her fourth album she returns to her roots and stops trying to win a popularity contest. By doing so she has lost all originality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Very Good","review":"Lol this album her the best album.

If you are looking for a upbeat pop CD this would be a good choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, it ain't \\"tight\\"","review":"WARNING: The album version of \\"Maneater\\" meanders and stalls-out after less than 3 minutes (at what I would consider the song's climax), descending into over a minute and a half of nearly a cappella vocals, instrumental breakdowns, and ad-libs by Timbaland; the track concludes with several seconds of studio dialog. \\"Loose\\" is another frustrating example of an album that does not include the same version of the song heard on the radio or in the video.LOOSE consists of 13 songs, two of which are versions of \\"Te Busque\\". Most of the songs are produced by Timbaland. Booklet does not include lyrics.The album is listen-able, and while the percussion-based \\"No Hay Igual\\" is interesting, other than the poorly edited \\"Maneater\\" and the over-played \\"Promiscuous\\", there are no stand-out tracks."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"After the near brilliance of FOLKLORE, LOOSE comes as a shocking disappointment.There is no unifying theme or style to LOOSE (which is most probably the inspiration for its title).

But then I started hearing the same distortion on other copies and have found out that was the way it was \\"intentionally\\" recorded. Sorry, but to me that just ruined the song and left me wanting to hear the song the way it was really being performed in the studio before they botched it up in the mixing console. I am glad I found out this information before I bought the CD (which I almost did, but would have taken it back). It is sad to me that this is considered a good thing to do to this song and others. I guess this will be the only CD of her's that I will not be purchasing."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},O={class:"card-container"},B=["disabled"],N={key:0},M={key:1};function H(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",O,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(a(),b(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",M,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",N,"See more"))],8,B)):p("",!0)])}const W=d(x,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-b52d35b4"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/20.md","filePath":"drive/20.md"}'),R={name:"drive/20.md"},P=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{L as __pageData,P as default};
