UGLY UGLY UGLY UGLYIt isn't easy but I have found other brands with similar slips ons which have a much better fit, more arch and inner heel support, and much nicer styling.... especially those with the bungee lace ups which give enough to snug up to your foot with or without socks.

Close The Door is a slower rendition of it's original conterpart and is missing the feel of it. The remixes are weak, they sound \\"textbook-ish\\". They do not strike me as \\"inspired\\" or \\"creative\\" but rather thrown together because remixing is the big thing now. I am afraid if they had been of the original recordings, they would have not done them justice.If you want Teddy in all his 70's and early 80's glory, you owe it to yourself to pick up the re-issues of his original albums re-issued on Right Stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Teddy","review":"I bought this CD with anticipation of hearing all of those dynamic silky powerful Teddy songs, but I don't knwo what the hell this was.

If you have fibromyalgia, you are crazy not to treat it as described in this wonderful and amazing book, written by a doctor who has devoted his entire professional life to this disease. He knows what he is talking about! I know, because I bought the book in September. It's now 3 months later and I'm practically pain-free and have more energy than when I was a kid! Dr. St. Amand has saved my life with his incredible insight, and I will forever be grateful to him for that. You must buy this book if you have fibromyalgia or know anyone else who does. I guarantee you will regard it as one of the most important books you will ever read and own, second only to the Bible."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an important book","review":"In this day of miracles being advertised (I used to be in advertising!) it's too easy to reject approaches as being hard or taking too much work while we waste money on hype. I'm a diabetic and I know what I'm talking about. I took vitamins, more vitamins, pills, etc. until I realized one day, if I wanted to get well I had to find a good resource and use it. My wife has fibromyalgia, and this was the book for her. We both learned so much and laughed and cried as we read about the disease. After that, we got serious about the protocol this book lays out in a clear step by step fashion. We are both healthy now, and looking foward to so many wonderful days in our future. Just do it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grateful for this book","review":"Last year at this time, I was going downhill fast. I have had fibromyalgia all my life but didn't have a name for it. My immediate family also had this, as I learned, inherited disease. Most of my family are deceased and I wish with all my heart they could have known there was a name for what was wrong with them. As I turned the pages, I kept saying yes, yes, yes. I started first with the hypoglycemic/low carbohydrate diet. There was a noticeable improvement in how I felt within 48 hours. After two months on the diet, I began taking guaifenesin. It has been nearly a year now. I have a long way to go, but I know I am on my way. I am a caregiver and I work full-time. The exacerbation of my symptoms last year would have curtailed at least the caregiving responsibilities. Because of the guaifenesin protocol, I have been able to carry on. I highly recommend the book and the protocol to all those people who are suffering the pain, fatigue and other symptoms of fibromyalgia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would be great if it worked","review":"My wife bought this book some years ago when she was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia. Since we both have medical backgrounds, we were intrigued at the protocol and the science offered by the author. We tried it and it didn't work at all for my wife. Then we started cutting out all of the foods that supposedly \\"interfered\\" with the protocol, and still no luck at all.It amazes me that there are so many positive reviews on Amazon, because of dozens of people I've known who tried this, it didn't work for any of them. All the same, if this really helps some people then great for them - I certainly want information to be available to everyone.I'd strongly suggest for those with Fibromyalgia (and who are willing to think \\"outside the box\\") the excellent book by Jacob Teitelbaum, \\"From Fatigued to Fantastic.\\" His book is excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Changed My Life!","review":"Suffering from FMS for almost 4 years, I decided I needed more of an update on what is new with FMS information.

I was so sick, miserable, considered withdrawing from Grad School...until I read this book and recognized I had ALL of the symptoms of hypoglycemia. I kept blaming my sickness on the FMS flaring up. Four weeks later, on the diet he recommended, I feel I have my life back! I feel so much better and hope to be completely healed from the hypoglycemia soon! I feel like a new person! Next, I will tackle the treatment he recommended to cure FMS. And I have lost 14 pounds which is really nice!! Thank you, thank you Dr. St. Armand for this important book.

The sad part is, the treatment is still not part of the 'accepted' protocol....(most doctors will just tell you to get some rest, lose some weight, reduce stress, and that it's all in your head).

It's easy to use, can reach crevasses and corners easily, offers ample grip and the quality seems sturdy enough to resist any mishandling. There is however, one shortcoming that I see after using it for the first few times. The red cotton strands often leave behind small lint pieces on my vehicle which seems to defeat the purpose of ridding dust or other small and loose debris. It's not a big deal since the lint will usually come off with a blow of air. I suspect this is due to the nature of the new cotton material and will solve itself with a quick wash (just like how when you sometimes buy a new t-shirt, there are small loose strands of of threads).Overall, it's a good product and I'd recommended it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish","review":"Had one before with black handle.

I thought that the auther was a little \\"preachy\\" about how horses shouldn't be ridden but not enough was covered on how they SHOULD be ridden. I would have preffered more coverage on what the benefits (cause and effect) of figures and specific exercises ridden correctly would create in the horse's body. Not exaclty what I was looking for but not time waisted in reading it either. It was an easy quick read. I did highlight two quotes that I loved. Read below:\\"The aids should be a passport to biomechanical efficiency.\\"\\"Yet, like a gradual crescendo and decrescendo, the work should begin and end with loosening: otherwise the notes might be in place but they won't make any music.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, even for an all-in-one","review":"Generally, I don't trust the concept of an all-in-one product. My experience in the past is that they tend to not be good at any one of the included functions. That experience is different with the OfficeJet R60. Paper handling is very good. It handles copy paper, inkjet paper, heavy stock, envelopes, and photo paper with no troubles. Color copies look great, from photos to magazine pages. B&W copying is surprisingly quick. Printing is as good as any inkjet printer I've used. I didn't plan on using the scanning function until I noticed that my FAX software had a \\"fax and scan\\" feature. I fed a page into the document feeder on the R60 and it \\"scaned and faxed\\" just fine. The R80 might be a better deal as it includes a built in FAX (if you need more FAX services than PC software), but other than that this is a really good product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jack of all trades, master of none","review":"I have the Office Jet Pro 1150C--similar to the R60. Greedily feasts on inkjet cartridges, which are not cheap. Has paper jams and simply can't be trusted to make more than one copy at a time. Extremely picky about the paper used. I think it wants you to use the expensive HP papers, which are unaffordable in any quantity. After about 4 months of trying to make this machine pay off, I gave up on it. Now it just sits there...saving me lots of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Using Feng Shui","review":"This little book is an excellent introduction to Feng Shui. It is absolutely packed with practical, easy-to-follow instructions.

Broderick Crawford, Buddy Ebsen, and Robert Wagner all confirm their tertiary status in the Hollywood pantheon. The plot is inept and incredible, staggering through bunches of flashbacks. The minor miracle (Rich and arrogant southern playboy/landowner comes of age and learns to love the common man) is insufficiently believable. The battle action is sporadic.HOWEVER, the DVD presentation is fine. Super-saturated colors come through perfectly, and the definition is great! The DVD quality is the sole reason I give the film 2 stars rather than 1.May I recommend films such as Patton, Tora Tora Tora, or the Longest Day for fine World War II action!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't buy this...","review":"I haven't and won't be buying this or the companion book (Anderson). It's nice to have all the stories together agreed but not if they are scrambled about in the wrong order. As I've heard from other people on this site, the pages are thin and cheapy and illustrations are few. It's plain to me that this woman is just ripping off the Grimm's name. Not doing justice to the stories at all. Until a definitive Grimm's book becomes available pick up a classic copy from ebay or a second hand bookstore..I just bought one for 10 dollars..published in 1945. It's in excellent condition too. It only has 55 stories but all the favourites are there and the drawings are great! You get a much more \\"old world\\" feeling when reading the stories when it's an old copy too..the smell of old paper..it just makes it more special."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great addition","review":"First of all this book is gorgeous. It looks so bad ass sitting on my book shelf. As for the content of the book, well they are fairy tales that most of us grew up with. A lot of them end abruptly, others seem to have no point, and others are just classics. It's a fine collection and worthy to read to kids as bed time stories. They will spark their imaginations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for what it is","review":"My experience was this book was bad, but that was my fault for not reading the other reviews before buying it. If you know what you're buying, it's a good book (which is why I'm giving it four stars).I bought this to read with my children. Don't do that unless your kids are teenagers at least. The original stories aren't meant for small children. At a minimum the kids get bored; at the worst, they'll be terrified.I didn't care for the quality of the book myself; it looks like it was layed out by somebody that normally designs dictionaries or phone books. But you might like dense copy and inconsistent illustrations."},{"rating":"2","title":"nostalgic stories from our childhood","review":"I love this book, and am very happy with it. It came fast, was in good condition, and had 210 fairy tales that i read in the first few days, and am rereading now.The only reason it got 4 outta 5 stars is because, which really, is my fault, i bought this thinking it was the \\"real\\" fairy tales. Which, it Kinda is, kinda isn't. It's not so much watered down as it is moistened, if that makes sense.After reading it, i realized that Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm's names are not on the cover anywhere. That is because, it is told the way that the \\"new author\\" wanted. Which is fine, i still love it. But I will now be getting a copy that i originally looked for.If you want fairy tales that you will like, and some that are fine to read to your children, this is a fine mix of both. The stories are still intact, so you don't lose any of the magic. It is worth buying and keeping in your home. Who doesn't like fairy tales? nobody, and this is a great starter book to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Formatting","review":"This kindle book was badly formatted, with words appearing cut off (see below).Example of formatting:\\"he said a blessing over her.

It is hard to find all of the stories in one book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Reading for any Age!","review":"The Brothers' Grimm wrote beautiful fairy tales, and they can be enjoyed by all ages. I think I enjoyed them most when I read them to my own children, but I have read them again since, and enjoyed them again. I read this collective edition in order to get all of them at one go, so to speak. The Brothers' Grimm were not writers by profession. They were scientific philologists, but decided to make up a collection of folktales. They spent thirteen years gathering the tales from various sources, and then put them down in writing in order to preserve them. Everyone knows these tales, but to name a few - The Frog Prince, Rumplestiltskin, Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty. These tales have endured and been loved for many years, and Disney has made some very memorable animated movies out of quite a few of them. Read them for your enjoyment, and to recapture a little of your lost youth."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money: poor translations/newsprint-like book","review":"You don't need to trust me--you can look inside the book and get a load of the first translation of the \\"Frog King\\" which is unreadable.

After reading some of the reviews, I was a little apprehensive. All in all, for the price, it's a good book. HOWEVER, the stories are more summaries of the stories than the actual full-length stories. If you're buying this book thinking you're going to be getting 8+ pages per story, you're wrong. Most stories average 2-3 pages in length and are VERY quick reads.It's a good book to keep you entertained. It is an adults' fairy tale book though due to the graphic (and original) nature of the tales."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I wish I'd read these reviews before I purchased this book.

I use this book in a unit I teach on Fairy Tales. We read a story and then watch the pretty Disney version. We then compare and contrast the differences and similarities.They are often shocked and sometimes thrilled - especially the boys who thought fairy tales were for girls - at the darker aspects of the original versions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Had to have it!","review":"Archetypical composition that is autobiographical beyond words is Botero.

We love it........Our neighbors have even commented on how nice it smells outside at night.We enjoy it very much and plan to make good use out of it. It is very relaxing. We both recommend this product highly. We've had this product for over a month now and have made countless fires in it. There has been no peeling of paint or warping of any kind.

It is not just like Cheerios, of course, but it has a pleasant taste of its own with just the right amount of sweetness added to make it flavorful. It doesn't get soggy immediately like some gluten-free cereals, nor does it have that familiar \\"cardboard\\" texture those of us with celiac know all too well. This product seems to have avoided the usual gluten-free problems, and I give the makers credit for that.I think it could have a little more cinnamon taste to it -- of course, I can always just add some myself -- and the price is still high compared to similar gluten-free cereals, regardless of where you buy it, but I think it's definitely worth trying if you're on a gluten-free diet and need something palatable.

I bought one of these and it DOES NOT work well. Sure, if you compare it to an \\"incandescent bulb,\\" which too many other reviewers suspisciously do, it is marginally better. But if you compare it to a full size black light fluorescent tube, this CF version is sorely lacking. This bulb, used with or without a shade, does not make white, like your teeth or on your clothes, glow brightly. It only marginally makes bright colors pop. The black light effects are not obvious; you have to really look for them. If you think you're going to use these at a party and everyone freaks out, forget it. I think the problem is the bulb is too bright.

The bulb is very dim; hardly enough to light up 1 foot around the exterior lamp. It gives off a neat purple glow but is not effective.

Works just as you hope it would. One thing to keep in mind though, this is a small black light, equiv to about a 60 watt bulb. By itself, it will obviously not perform as powerfully as a 100-200 watt fixture. But that's not what we want here. With this bulb, you can now do black light on a whim, where ever there is a socket.

It is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"This so-called documentary is a hodge-podge of frequently repeated film clips and excerpts from grade B Hollywood mono-color Roman-spectacle movies interspersed with inane comments by revisionist historians. Also included for your enlighgtenment is an attack on conservatives as wealthy oppressors and a measure of Christian bashing. Don't waste your money on this mess - I wasted mine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial and Simply Wrong","review":"If this were a book rather than a video then I would say there is a mistake on almost every page. The author's understanding of what he/she writes about is superficial in many areas, and often what is said is simply wrong. If you already have a good foundation in the history of Rome then this might be a two star video since parts of it may be entertaining or otherwise interesting. However, this is a very misleading way to start an understanding of Roman history. The author seems either to be incompetent, or perhaps is consciously unconcerned with the facts in order to twist Roman history to fit into some political statement the author wants to make. Either way this is not a very insightful, accurate work."},{"rating":"2","title":"no romulus and remus","review":"i came upon a magazine called history today it was an article about an archaeologist named simon leaphead who said the story of romulus and remus may have historical basis in a tale of two brothers named osto and mosto who lived in the year 6000 .B.C. this article was published two years before the documentry iam reviewing was released the filmakers could have interviewed mr.leaphead in a part of the documentry about romes origins but they didn\`t they just talked about the empire like everyone else does they could have at least talked about THE ROMAN REPUBLIC\`S HISTORY. am i right"},{"rating":"1","title":"touring Paris","review":"Obsolutely awful!!!I purchased it to view in my French class; what a waste!!!

The volumes are somewhat chronological, with significant overlap and repetition of key concepts. If you choose to watch them straight through, as I did, the repetition will become annoying. However, if you watch them one a day, or better still one every other day, the repetition is welcome. If you buy it, I strongly suggest you to not watch it straight through. I would have given it 5 *s, but the format prevents me from doing so.Notes: The \\"Christian bashing\\", mentioned by another reviewer, is not uncalled for, and I would suggest that he/she read some of the historical accounts. Some written by Christians. Lets face facts, Christianity is and has been completely intolarnant of other beliefs. Moreover, the documentary is quite complementary to Christianity. The timeline in the DVD version is very useful, as the volumes are not entirely chronological."},{"rating":"2","title":"ROME: Power and Glory","review":"Very comprehensive overview of the history of the Roman Empire; at times segments seemed to repetitive. Good overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive Overview","review":"Obviously no documentary can cover each and every aspect of a civilization that lastest as long as Rome, but it has chosen areas to cover that will give you the sense of the times, the events and the people. Peter Coyote is a good narrator, adding his talent to the material being offered. There is a fine line up of professionals that add their opinions and comments to the topics being discussed that add a dimension to the program. The program covers the time of the Etruscans, before Rome was even a city, to the ultimate fall of this empire. The recreations are entertaining and informative. You will learn a lot about Rome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Includes some gems","review":"This DVD includes some very rare cartoons.

Although well written and somewhat interesting, it didn't really hold my attention. There was not enough information about her regular life and then not enough personal stuff about being a woman among men for 2+ months on this grueling journey. I never got to really know the people with her. Plus I found the back and forth of the journey (to be expected) very confusing in this particular version of a climb up Everest. There are much better books out there, but sadly very few about women."},{"rating":"1","title":"ummmmm.......","review":"This book is pretty bad, and it's really really wierd.

Of course, who likes stories like that???? I liked the middle fairly well, but at the end, I didn't like it at all!!!!! The only reason I finished it was because I had to do a report on it for school. I told my teacher that the book was bad, and other kids did too. We got her to read it, and that decided her.

Surely one of the most techically accomplished and visually stunning videos ever made. Michel Gondry is a genius in music video making. I expect in years to come people will look back at this video and still wonder about how exactly it was made.

Videos.","review":"The music videos of Daft Punk's music are quiet enjoyable.

The music is great, the quality is great, the commentary is excellent, a decent interface, and the plethora of information provided with it is incredible. So why four stars instead of five? I felt that some of the included material was unneccesary such as all of the documentaries with on set sound, and I felt that the \\"direct your own video\\" on rollin and scratching was a bit corny and awkward in its interface."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than expected","review":"I love Daft Punk, this DVD is simply 5 music videos...that is it.

Yes!The text is a little different to recently written books, but I still found the story line to be as interesting as the first time.It is a version of the legend of the Wandering Jew (Cartaphilus)... the man who was said to have doubted Jesus, (not Thomas) on his journey to the cross. He was told 'that he would tarry until Jesus' return'.This is the story from that day until about the late 1920's, when the book was written.Cartaphilus, meets up with some famous people throughout history, and a description of the changing years. Also the personal side, his sadness and loneliness of having to outlive the loves in his life.Interesting, and thought provoking.

This book makes WAY too many references, and often unnecessarily because the author depends on them. Almost every other paragraph is about a reference to another book, and actual information (NOT references) is extremely hard to come by.Most of this book is pretty much a giant collection of summaries of OTHER books, with extremely limited analysis as to its significance. If you are not familiar with at least half of the references (to books and to people you probably never heard of), this is a nightmare to read. In summary, painful to read, dry, and plain horrible.If I had the money, I would buy every single copy of this book and burn it so that people don't have to go through the horrors of reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"$38.00????

After a couple months of email exchanges and notices that shipment had taken place I ended up with no book. Seller was not customer-friendly or cooperative.

Red Mills, however, has incredibly high quality products, and I confess that when I'm in a rush, or know little about the quality of the food choices before me, I tend toward this brand. I'm picky about the nutritive value of foods, and the way they are grown and processed, and this has been a safe place to go for that.Making a soup with this particular mix is as easy as falling off a log! If you're nervous and don't have a recipe, just cheat the first time out of the gate by tossing in onion soup mix/your favorite homemade broth and some veggies. You also can't go wrong with chunks of ham and some ham broth or bouillon.

However, this mix conveniently puts the 13 beans together and offers recipes on the back suggesting how to prepare it. The mix doesn't come with spices - it is beans only - so you will have to come up with everything else yourself.This is a good product if you are cooking for a crowd, or if you really, really love beans. One bag makes a large pot of soup. But if you are cooking for a smaller crowd, you might find yourself getting tired of bean soup pretty quickly.I liked the soup the first time I made it.

The tone is chatty, peppered with jokes and anecdotes to ease you through difficult subjects. The ideas and various points really stay with you, following you as you move back out into the world after reading it. Her analysis of various Biblical figures is interesting and novel, and opens up the area further.I personally found this book incredibly useful in beginning to approach all of the complicated emotions that are aroused by infertility.

He analyzes the principal influences that formed Origen as a Christian, his emergence as a mature theologian, and his controversial legacy. The translation is fresh and clear. Moreover, the book includes some writings by Origen that have not been available previously. This is an exciting book that I'd recommend to anyone -- scholar or not -- who wishes to explore the thought of one of the greatest and most influential Christian thinkers before Augustine.Cynthia B.

Its huge hard drive is still large even by today's standards.The user interface was easy to get used to; however, I never became accustomed to an IPOD so it might be different for those who are. The first problem I encountered with this product was skipping in play, but that happened rarely, once every hundred songs or so.Last year, also, the player started acting funny, but when I updated the firmware it began working fine. My player, now four years old, is still going strong and is a purchase that I haven't regretted making."},{"rating":"2","title":"More for less!","review":"My wife asked for an iPod for a gift. I asked, 'Oh, an MP3 player?.' And, she replied, 'No, I want an iPod.' Far be it for me to contradict my beloved so I bought the iPod, which she truly appreciates. After spending a couple of weeks converting our modest CD collection into MP3s, I decided to buy a MP3 player for myself. I did the requisite research and also asked our adolescent son (who knows *all*, at least that what he likes to think). He advised a Zen Creative. It not only accepts WMAs but has a built-in FM radio and voice recorder. Better yet, it was only half the price of my wife's iPod. In a word, I bought both an iPod and Creative Zen and I prefer the latter because it has more features and is half the price of its competitor. But, if you see my wife, don't let on I'm gloating!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"I purchased the Zen Photo as my first mp3 player. I have had it for 2 months and really enjoy it. I looked at the different mp3 players available and read several different reviews and chose this one. I have had no problems so far. I really enjoy the large storage space. The touch pad was annoyingly sensitive at first but once I learned to slide my finger along it rather than tap, it worked great. The price was another reason I chose this player.There are a lot of great aspects to this player and it is definately worth the money. You can use the player as a removable disk to transport basically any type of file. The player allows the user to designate a certain amount of the space for this.I would say buy it and enjoy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it!","review":"It works pretty well until it crashes. I bought this because I heard good things about it, as well as the fact that I hate iTunes.

It's headphones are so comfortable I can sleep with them in...and when they don't come out in the night i don't wake up with sore ears. I've had no problems with it and it's many USEFULL features make it quite nice to use. The vertical touchpad is easy to use and it's wide music support allows for great flexibility. Why should you buy this over say an iPod? Simple. Creative Lab's design and construction are so durable that when my friend dropped his ZEN in his pool after drying it out all he had to replace was the hardrive which was significantly cheaper than buying a new one. Also storage space. True a basic iPod can hold 30 gigs while this zen only holds 20, but since Zens are compatible with WMA formating (half the space of an MP3) it can hold twice as many songs if you use WMA formatting, which is readily available to everyone with Windows Media Player."},{"rating":"1","title":"wish I wouldn't have bought it.","review":"This MP3 player worked awesome for several months! then, about a week after the warrenty ended, it wouldn't work. there about 4-5 screens it goes onto regularly on the boot process, but mine goes to the second, freezes for about 3 minutes, then goen to a malfunction page. there are choices to erase all of the memory, reload the firmware, reboot, and something else.

The second day I had it, after downloading 35 cds, it would not turn on. I finally had to stick a pin in the reset hole and then the screen was filled with unrecognizable characters. I ended up having to download the firmware on a ONE DAY OLD machine. I figured it was \\"User Error\\" even though I did nothing wrong. Today, a full two weeks since I bought the &*^!! thing, it won't turn on again.

Unfortunately, navigation is horrible. The touch pad design causes constant false selections, sometimes interrupting (and basically deleting from the playlist) the music you are already playing. I can't imagine a test panel NOT complaining about this abysmal design. I guess Creative just did not listen. Then, to boot, the unit crashed after 10 days of owning it. My computer no longer recognizes it, and the screen is black. I am currently in the process of returning it.

The information was several years out of date, the text was loaded with typos and misinformation, and the layout of the individual sections was confusing. Too much time was spent on small out-of-the-way villages for my tastes, and too little time on the major sights, such as Machu Picchu, Lima, and Nazca. We were very disappointed in the restaurant reviews, and three of the ones we tried to go to had either closed or had never been there in the first place, according to locals. Finally, we didn't get as strong a sense of the country as we wanted, so the book was an all-out loser from our point of view.

While the book has a lot of information regarding locations of sites, locations of hotels, and locations of restaurants, it doesn't tell you much about those places. Many of the hotels had clearly never been visited by the writers. All of the restaurants we went to that were listed in this book were tourist traps with food that was mediocre at best. Just because it lists every hotel does not mean that it's a good guide. I recommend 'Let's Go' instead.

Buffalo Wagons was the first published novel by Mr. Kelton, a story of the buffalo hunters and the near extermination of the buffalo for their hides. The 1870's was the time this occurred along the Arkansas, the Republican, and the Cimarron rivers of Kansas, and Oklahoma and North Texas often invading into Indian Territory. And no one will go into Comanche territory except Gage Jamesom. Read about his adventures as he rides through Dodge City, encountering Comanches along the way to this final hunt.

The difficulty, for me, at any rate, is that it doesn't really come to a proper conclusion, though Heaven knows there are climactic events a-plenty toward the end. But the comedic tone falls victim to A Message. When authors choose to deliver A Message to their readers, it bodes ill; when they can be seen to be almost screechingly yanking on the brake lever to pause their story in mid-run to get to The Message, worse yet.All in all, this is a book certainly worth reading, and I recommend it; but its failure to sustain its original tone makes it a bit disappointing.

They erase poorly, leaving visible letters and a thick coating of chalk on the board. Paper towels work very well on my blackboard made of black porcelain over steel. The erasers were a waste of money.What attracted me to this eraser was the wooden handle.

It leaves behind an image of what you have written/drawn on the board and the chalk seems to fall more on the ground than it does stick in the brush.

The plot seemed mildly interesting, but the characters are so one-dimensional and shallow that I didn't care one bit about anything that happened to them. They were all boring, poorly-created cliches. The writing in this book was also terrible. Holden's prose in Four Corners of Night was some of the best I've seen in years, so he's obviously learned a lot about his craft, but this novel reads like a high school kid's attempt at writing a \\"cool\\" book.

Notice there is no \\"Christian perspective.\\" Anthropology is not about judging other cultures, and it is certainly not about changing them. This book should not be called \\"Cultural Anthropology.\\" What it suggests is nothing like anthropology.

If the author understood anything about the discipline, he would know that it is about relativism and respect for differences, not about trying to use cultural concepts to invade and indoctrinate other societies.

Things get weird as Andy's dead fiancee starts appearing to him and everyone else and soon it becomes clear as the cult invites him into their inner sanctum, that God is pissed and everything falls to Andy making a decision.Despite competent direction and good acting all around, this just drags on, makes no sense in many places, and has a ridiculous sappy ending that will make just about anyone cringe.

Collectible? By whom? For what?The directions for using the watch, on the other hand, are unbelievably obscure. First of all, the document covers about a dozen watch models, identified only by the configuration of the buttons and shape of the watchface. Second of all, following the directions VERY carefully did not activate the desired operations. Extraordinarily obscure!!! Trial and error FINALLY yielded results, but it wasn't easy. Man, how hard can it be to figure out how to set the time on a watch with only 4 buttons? But believe me, it was!!!!

In order for her to have ordered the book version, she would have had to scroll down the page and click on paperback. As it was a used copy, she was not offered the opportunity to return. Unfortunately, we then had to purchase a book version in the stores. When I tried to go on and order the book, the same thing happened to me. This is, I feel, a problem, as you search under \\"books\\", for a taped version to be the first thing that comes up. Just my opinion. We will look more carefully in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, it was good in seventh grade","review":"i ordered Beowulf because i remembered it being hugely entertainting when my seventh grade history teacher read parts of it to us on rainy days.....Maybe there are two Beowulfs and Grendels in the fictional world because i found none of the suspense, colorful descriptions or fascinating characters that got me through those rainy days in history class. i didn't even finish the book; it has been one of the biggest literary let-downs ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"I never realized...","review":"I have tried to read Beowulf a few times in a few different translations. Since 11th grade (I won't say how long ago that was), I had been looking for someone to give it the oomph that my English teacher had in reading it to us and helping us to understand it. Mr. Heaney has done just that.I'm not a scholar of the poem, so I don't know how closely it resembles the original, but I can tell you that I understood it and enjoyed it more than I have in years. To ... a tired old quote \\"If you read only one translation of Beowulf this year, this is it!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Translation","review":"Wonderful translation. I've read other versions and none are as clear and poetic as Heaney's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning about Heaney's recording of Beowulf","review":"I do like Heaney's translation of Beowulf, though I still prefer Talbot Donaldson's. But this review is to warn potential buyers of the misleading advertising for the recorded version. Although it claims to be unabridged, it actually omits quite a few lines and even some sizable chunks. For example, he has entirely skipped the very important confrontation between Beowful and Unferth. I don't like abridged versions of anything because I'd rather decide for myself what is most important, but I find it especially troubling when an abridged version is advertised as unabridged. What he does read he reads well, making it a useful tool in the classroom. But with so much missing it would be a poor substitute for the written text. I give it one star, not for its poor quality, but for the deceitful packaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Poem, Great Translation","review":"This is a great read for multiple interest groups. For those who are interested in historical translations and/or Anglo-Saxon culture, it is a very good and ageless poem with a good story and plenty of action. Which brings me to the next interest group, those who like a lot of action and a fair share of violence and warring, because Beowulf has plenty of that as well. This translation is also very good, I'd reccommend it to sophisticated and action seeking readers alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"You must give this a chance!","review":"I had picked this up previously in a different translation, and I wallowed through the turgid prose like many before me.

The modern translation, the substance (needless to say), and the reading all are great. My rating of 1 star is attributable solely to the abysmal decision to put this work on two audio CDs with no internal track divisions.Audio CDs, such as this, are generally listened to in the automobile. If, like me, you have an older CD player in the car (or if you happen to switch cars, like my children do in their commute to and from school), you have no easy way to get back to where the story stopped if your drive is shorter than the CD.The formatting decisions serve to make this CD nearly worthless--even though I have a forty-minute drive.Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great translation of an interesting story","review":"_Beowulf_ is a fairly simple story, but still an interesting read. The battle scenes are exciting, especially the fight with the dragon in the end. Even as Beowulf conquers his enemies, there's a dark sense of foreboding throughout, which makes for a very somber tone. In between action sequences, _Beowulf_ has much to say about honorable conduct and the Warrior's Code--enough where I wonder if the story wasn't intended to be instructional. As far as the classics go, it's a pretty quick read (about 100 pages of text--you can read it in one or two sittings).When dealing with older works like this, your reading experience can be a dream or a nighmare depending the quality of the translation. Seamus Heaney makes this work clear and accessible to everyone. Also, he includes a pretty good introduction dealing with the history of _Beowulf_, as well as some things to look out for while reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth the price.","review":"This is really a very nicely done, accessible translation, perfect for not only scholars and students but those without much background in the area of pre-literate English culture. Very nicely translated too--not at all awkward or stilted as so many translations are!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heaneywulf!","review":"I love Beowulf and now that Heaney's translation of this great epic is out, I am overjoyed. Seamus Heaney is an extraordinary poet; he has unusual word choices and his Irish background is wonderful fodder for Old English. I have read other translations of Beowulf before but they are always a little flowery, stiff or dated. It is hard to translate the Old English guttural tones but Heaney uses consonants freely and you can almost hear Grendel's footsteps stalking the men in the mead hall! Thank you Mr heaney!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great translation of a so-so story","review":"As a great fan of the Iliad, the Odyssey, the Aeneid, etc, I had great hopes for Beowulf, which I had never had a chance to read in school. I have to say that the ancients had a much better grasp of suspense, character development and denouement than did the Anglo-Saxons, but despite this Beowulf is a very interesting read. Furthermore, the translation seems to be wonderful. Though I can't speak to its accuracy, it is very evocative of the spirit of the time, and yet is very readable to a modern audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Equally good for reading aloud to children","review":"Tonight my kids and I curled in the backyard by the firepit with blankets and a flashlight so I could read to them this glorious translation of Beowulf. Since I had never read a direct translation before, I thought this might be too sophisticated for them but they like listening to me read so we gave it a shot.Wow! We read for nearly an hour and blew through a third of the book (helps that you only have to read the right hand page since the left is in Old English). We stopped just as darkness had fallen and Grendel was preparing to attack Heorot. The older four children were thoroughly enchanted and even the little ones paid attention. For reference, the kids are ages 12,11,9,7,5, and 3. Kind of makes you wonder why bother with those loathsome children's books when the kids are so enthralled with this! Heaney's translation is a marvel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Translation","review":"This is the only version of Beowulf I have read, so I can't compare it to other versions, but I thought it was an excellent version of the story. It was very easy to read. It flows nicely like a novel, I practically read the whole thing in one sitting. I have read elsewhere that it may not be as literal as other translations, but it wasn't a pain to get through like some literal translations I've seen of other works. I highly recommend this to anyone, especially people who have tried to read it before but were put off by hard to read literal translations."},{"rating":"2","title":"The epic Beowulf","review":"My first introduction to Beowulf was nearly 11 years ago as a high school student. Now, after reading Seamus Heaney's recent transalation, I remember why I enjoyed this epic so much. I would wholeheartedly recommend this translation (and more generally Beowulf) to all ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's nice poetry, but it's not Beowulf!","review":"Heaney's \\"translation\\" is really an adaptation of the original Anglo-Saxon poem. Heaney stylistic choices and vocabulary are, often truly bizarre and bear no relationship at all to the Old English. What is most ironic is that the hardback version that I have offers the original Old English version in one column and Heaney's bastardization in the other--yet, if you will read the preface, you'll find that Heaney cannot even read Old English! I know that what is here appears to be \\"readable,\\" but it's so inaccurate as to be useless. For a much cheaper, and much more authentic translation, try the Burton Raffel version. If you're willing to spend a bit more, try \\"A Readable Beowulf\\" by Greenfield--a noted scholar. The Greenfield version is quite simply the most accurate and elegant translation available, but it is a bit pricy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio CD is ABRIDGED","review":"I'm posting this review as a warning to buyers that although Amazon is presently listing the audio CD as UNABRIDGED, it's actually marked \\"Unabridged Selections\\" by the publisher in what is obviously an exercise in marketing double talk.The audio CD version omits many lines and even some sizable chunks of the original work. The only word for that is \\"Abridged\\" and the publishers should be ashamed of themselves for calling it anything other than \\"Abridged\\".Amazon should update the listing accordingly. I'm giving the edition a 1 star rating simply to call attention to the deceitful packaging. I have no other complaint aside from that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled...","review":"If you read this new translation of Beowulf sparks you to pick it up like I did, read this first. Beowulf is still confusing and still boring, no matter how good the translation is. Come on, IT'S BEOWULF!!! It'll take a lot more to make this exciting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beowulf review","review":"I would not recommend Beowulf to anyone who is looking for an interesting book. The story line is too historic, and it is hard for people these days to find a way to connect with Beowulf, the main character. As someone who does not enjoy stories based around epic heroes, Beowulf was extremely boring for me. He kills this; he slaughters that; he defeats this; he overpowers that. The story is so predictable that it isn't even worth reading. Maybe older readers will like it better, but in my opinion, it should not be considered a \\"classic.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"You know that part in \\"Annie Hall\\" when Woodie Allen tells Diane Keaton to not take any classes that include \\"Beowulf\\" on the syllabus?Well, he's right. Beowulf, outstanding historic relic that it may be, is incredibly boring. Has anyone ever sat down and read Beowulf for fun? If so, that poor chap must either have given up on page 3, or must have strange literary appetites indeed. This is basically an old legend, which can be related faithfully to you in, oh, maybe a three page little tale, but instead is blown up into what seems to be an endless poem. All I can say it, avoid this like the plague!"},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"If you only read one book this year that: lacks substance, doesnt require any real thinking, lacks adequate description, has a ridiculously overpowered and infinitely benevolent hero, is written in a boring fashion, and is a 6th century equivalent to The Power Rangers......... makes it this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you can't sleep, read this book","review":"This book, I swear to God, put me to sleep in the middle of the afternoon.

Who knows, maybe it's just me."},{"rating":"1","title":"peeeeeeuw!","review":"who's kidding who here? a simple translation attracting this much bravado? it's a joke - wake up! there's a very bad smell from this version and you all know it - don't waste your money or your time. get real and get to a library!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Waste of Time!","review":"I consider myself a literarily open minded person. But this book I found to be the ultimate cure for insomnia. The English used then is very different from today's. It's not that I didn't understand it, because I did. But this novel carries no real plot, the entire dialogue throughout is robotic and monotone, and the descriptions are either overly simplistic or too \\"Hemmingway\\"...on and on and on....Yes I suppose some would argue that this novel carries much culture and tradition with it, but give me a break! Jazz up the translation a bit and use language that REAL people can understand!!!!! Or don't waste your time!!!! Unless you suffer from an extreme case of insomnia, suicidal depression, or sheer boredom, don't come anywhere near this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Translations Elsewhere","review":"I'll be brief. This is an awkward translation, brought about I believe because the translator tried to be more cryptic than necessary, more brutal than desirable, and more enigmatic than the story already is. For those wanting a more accessible, readable Beowulf, I heartily recommend Kevin Crossley-Holland's wonderful translation and introductory notes, published by Phoebe Phillips Editions (London). Crossley-Holland's book also has the advantages of being a well-crafted book, expansively bringing to life the poetry of a legend from the classics of the medieval world. Finally, while I cannot endorse Seamus Heaney's translation, at least his efforts revive an interest in this anonymous medieval work, which deserves much wider readership, and although not included among the \\"great books of western civilization\\" canon, seems indespensible to understanding that tradition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy Kindle Edition","review":"I have the physical book edition of this wonderful work, and wanted to have it also with me on Kindle. However, without any indication at all, the Kindle edition is abridged. It is only the modern English translation and does NOT include the Anglo-Saxon text.Amazon nis selling you half a book on Kindle, not the entire book. This is very deceptive and one wonders how many other Kindle books have been butchered by Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exquisite","review":"Beowulf: What is not to love about this story. Monsters! Heros! Water Journeys! Treasure! Faithful friends! I love love love Seamus Heaney's Beowulf: A New Verse Translation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear translation, roomy edition","review":"The hardcover edition gives ample margin space for notes, a classy layout (the title and page number run along the bottom margin, ghosted enough to write over, in a bold, simple font), and parallel texts of the Old English and Heaney's translation. Heaney's English is unadorned; he preserves the half-measure of the original, where each line is composed of two half-lines. Heaney achieves this without obscuring the meanings or creating a choppy tone. At times the translation may seem too plain and straightforward, but it serves as an excellent translation for students and readers wishing to add Beowulf to their canon. Grove City College currently uses this translation in its British Literature class."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Excellent","review":"Like most, I was forced to read a version of this book for school. The genealogy and the mechanics of the language were the primary emphasis; therefore, I never got much out of the story. This new translation is remarkable. Most of the unwieldy dialogue has been simplified, without changing the imagery or majesty of the original work. I cannot imagine a better translation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"Seamus Heaney's translation is positively brilliant. Not only is his translation accurate, it has the rhythm. I can read a bit of Old English and I couldn't believe how beautifully and skillfully he translated the poem. Of course, Seamus Heaney is a poetic genius!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE book to read this year","review":"Heaney breathes new life into the oldest story in the English language. From the opening \\"So\\" through the end of Beowulf and his people, the story grabbed me and wouldn't let go. In Heaney's translation, Beowulf lives again, exhibiting all the characteristics we still pine for in our leaders, rightly or wrongly."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent translation","review":"Beowulf is an old Anglo-Saxon poem composed late in the first millennium. It is the story of Beowulf, a war-leader (and later king) of the Geats, a people who competed for dominance with the Swedes. In this story, Beowulf overcomes fearsome monsters and magic, through his own strength, and the assistance of his followers. If you are interested in the ancient Germans, then this story will provide you with a unique view into the German way of thinking.Seamus Heaney's translation is easy to read and brings the story into a form comfortable for the modern reader. As an added bonus, the author includes a side-by-side copy of the story in the original Old English, for those who are interested in that language.This is an excellent translation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beowulf","review":"This translation made this ancient epic easy to read and understandable. Mr. Heaney did an excellent job of translating the old English into a tale that can be enjoyed."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Beowulf book","review":"There are a few books and movies about Beowulf, most from interpreting a saga, or poem. However, this one to me is so real and good, it is as if i was there with Beowulf. If you are a Beowulf fan, then you have to get this book. The author's ability to capture you is amazing, well worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"What language was he translating from?","review":"I was really looking forward to listening to this, and found myself very disappointed. Anglo-Saxon is a language of concrete nouns, active verbs, things happening and things being shown. Instead we have Heaney using such extremely trite phrases as, \\"Without further ado.\\" Can you see Beowulf doing something without further ado? Of course not; Beowulf just does. Then there was the use of the phrase, \\"Desperate affair,\\" to describe Beowulf's fight with Grendel. Desperate affair? This does not sound like the way to describe the process of tearing off a Neanderthaloid monster's arm with your bare hands.Heaney's reading voice is frankly not very impressive, and coupled with the translation, made for a disappointing experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"A less than heroic translation","review":"I originally read Beowulf in an English class in 1975, and while I forget the name of the translator, I remember the magic of the language as much as the magic of the story. In the current translation, I found myself often bored and often impatient with what seemed to me to be Heaney's ostentatious and clumsy attempts to revive the sound of Anglo-Saxon poetry. It probably didn't help that he includes the original on facing pages, and while I don't know Anglo-Saxon, I at least know how to pronounce it, so the magic of the original sound was there for comparison. In any case, expecting a revival of the magic, instead I had to drag myself from page to page. Heaney is a fine poet in his own right, but in my opinion he doesn't have the sound of Beowulf right at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece Rediscovered","review":"I hadn't read Beowulf since college, and while I remembered the epic to be a magnificent piece of art, I had forgotten (or maybe just discovered through Heaney's translation) how beautiful it really is. The translation is superbly written--the alliteration is exquisite. I enjoyed the foreword almost as much as the poem itself! For more fun, or if you're studying Old English, compare the translation (on the right) with the original (on the left)--Great read no matter what your gender or age!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful translation but bad Kindle version","review":"I have the hard cover version of Heaney's \\"Beowolf\\" and the Kindle version. In the hard cover, the pages on the left have the original Old English text and the pages on the right have their translation into English. It is wonderful to be able to look at the original, to try and pronounce it, and then to read it in modern English.The Kindle version gives you the modern English translation only. The Old English is entirely absent. Thus you are getting only half the book if you buy the Kindle version and you are not able to do a side-by-side text comparison as you go.If you would like to read Seamus Heaney's amazing translation, and you'll be glad you did, then don't buy it on Kindle. Get the hard cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it","review":"This translation is not as literal as some other translations, but it is easier than some for a modern reader to understand, and trying to follow the original Old English printed on the other side of the page is intriguing. This is a good translation for those, like myself, who are reading Beowulf for the first time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This book was fantastic! This a must read for everyone, being that it is part of Western Literature! It can be a little hard to read, but it is very rewarding!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best translation","review":"That's about all I've got for now.

A must read for any fan of the saga, and a great way to introduce yourself to the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely LOVED having this read aloud by the translator, Seamus Heaney!","review":"It really felt like being taken back in time. And having it read aloud by the translator, with the pauses and emphasis on words/syllables just as he had intended, was superb. This type of literature was originally read aloud, and so the audio CD is the perfect way to enjoy Beowulf![This review is for the audio CD of Beowulf translated and narrated by Seamus Heaney.

The same event is explained at least three times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exquisite Story and a Wonderful Translation!","review":"Beowulf is a wonderful epic story, but if you've read a poor translation you won't appreciate that fact. Mr. Heaney has created a terrific translation that reads smoothly and coherently. As a result of reading this version, I developed a new appreciation for the story on account of being able to understand nuances that I had missed before. Beowulf's journey from his struggle with Grendel to his final battle with the Dragon can be viewed as a metaphor for almost any life, and this translation allows the reader to appreciate what the story says about how life should be lived and about how one should approach death. The fact that the book is split with the original text on the left and the translation on the right, illustrates how much our language has changed in a thousand years. I enjoyed the diversion of trying to interpret the orignal text on my own."},{"rating":"1","title":"KINDLE EDITION: Not Complete!

He seems to simply make up his own translation, even when a literal reading would have been equally intelligible and poetic, while preserving the original sense of the poem. The shame in this is that Heaney's work is becoming the \\"definitive edition,\\" even in schools. There are obviously much better translations for scholars. For the casual reader, I suggest Liuzza's excellent work:Beowulf (Broadview Literary Texts) (Broadview Literary Texts Series)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beowulf should be heard, not seen","review":"I have been laboriously teaching myself Anglo-Saxon in order to read the \\"real\\" Beowulf. I also have a tape of parts of Beowulf read aloud in Anglo-Saxon. It was with some trepidation that I ordered the CDS. Heaney has kept much of the masculine sound of Beowulf -- the alliteration, the beats, the broken measures. I am happy.One criticism: there are no \\"tracks\\" so that if you begin listening in the car as I did, when you start to drive home, you're back at the beginning. I would have liked a way to return to the approximate place where I left off listening.If you're still struggling with Anglo-Saxon, this is a great way to experience the sounds of Beowulf."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Servicable Translation","review":"There are many things to like in Heaney's Beowulf, not least the format of the book itself - the original text and Heaney's translation are printed on facing pages. Heaney's translation is mostly accurate, clear and readable, except for a few \\"Irishisms\\" that may baffle the American reader.Oddly enough, since Heaney is himself a major poet, I find this translation a bit lacking in poetry, a bit - dare I say it - flat. Heaney keeps the sense and muscular line of the original, but - and here is where I think he goes wrong - he forces the alliteration. In the original, alliteration stirs the blood and slaps you in the face. In translation, Heaney's alliteration is too often weak, and - a far worse sin - too often lowers his diction to the level of the commonplace.Poetry is, of course, impossible to translate. Heaney has made, if not the best, at least a creditable effort, of an impossible job. As such, he deserves our respect and our thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Old Eglish Text!","review":"This Kindle edition only contains the modern English translation.

His mother was bitter on love until Casey, the boy's special friend through the Healing Hearts program, won her heart. It was a quick, light read. I loved the part when the boy wrote a letter to God and asked his mom to address the envelope for him because she knew everything. He just knew God was in heaven, but didn't know the street address.

Granted that incarcerated men have little else to do but engage in every conceivable form of carnal daliance, but the extravegence of the sexual circus detailed herein stretches the bounds of credulity.

Her worldbuilding is believable and suspense building masterful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly disappointing","review":"I generally enjoy Cherryh's books, because they are tightly plotted and well-written, but Hammerfall was a disappointment. The plot reverberates with echoes of Dune and other desert-based SF -- down to the chapter-introducing passages of wisdom and the raging sandstorms. The nanotechnology twist is a good one, but it's never fully realized and the only character with any depth is Marak Trin Tain, the main character. The to-ing and fro-ing in the desert is repetitive and predictable. If I want classic Cherryh, I'll re-read Cyteen. If I want classic desert SF, I'll re-read Dune."},{"rating":"1","title":"tedious","review":"I've enjoyed several of her other books but this was just tedious. I liked some of the characters but the plot was largely predictable. The few surprises were surprises only because they were illogical. Much space is given to dense descriptions of irrelevant incidents.If you want to read a great Cherryh novel about a long abandoned colony world with a gripping plot skip this and read Cloud's Rider (or Rider at the Gate, I forget which comes first)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Cherryh is a master story teller, excelling at character development. I had never been disappointed and spent many a sleepless night reading her books.Until Hammerfall. What a disappointment. While reading this book I had the impression that she used her leftover notes from the Faded Sun trilogy, stirred a bit, came up with the psyche war motiv and threw it in at the very end to justify the trek. It's still good reading for those who want to learn survival skills for the desert."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twice as good at half the length.","review":"I couldn't believe it. They crossed the same desert 3 times and the author didn't even skip forward over the odd week or two. It was like reading about the solution of a \\"Towers of Hanoi\\" puzzle. The author put a lot of imagination and creativity into this story but needs a good editor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cherryh is back!","review":"Marak has suffered with visions all his life & when he staggers into his destiny on the other side of his world, he must face the strangers in the towers he has seen in his visions & face one more mission - to muster warring villagers, priests, the young & the old to follow him on an epic trek before the hammer of their foe falls from the sky above.What can I possibly say about C. J. Cherryh that hasn't already been said by deeper minds than mine? Her imagination & creativity weaves into whole cloth worlds that are truly believable.Marak is a being that when shown his destiny reaches out & grabs it with both hands & refuses to let go. I like that in any character of fiction & with that grip firmly in place, takes with him those around him including an entire world.I'm so glad that Cherryh has once again found herself back on the hard science fiction side of this genre. I suggest you not only search out HAMMERFALL but also her far-ranging THE GENE WARS series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cherryh at her plodding best","review":"Cherryh's books are known for their brilliance, suspense and magic moments, all of which are lacking in this very well written plodding story that takes the hero there and back and there and back again... and nano technology has been written up for, oh, 20 years, with more terrifying consequences than this book explores. I was surprised at the lack of detail at the end of the book and had to read it twice to make sure I didn't actually just put the story down unfinished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and Depressing","review":"In the latter part of the book, Marak wakens and has trouble remembering which passage through the desert he is on. That aptly sums up the plight of the reader. I forced myself to finish, because I kept thinking something would actually HAPPEN. The happenings in the book, however, given the context of endless desert travel, seemed contrived: dust storms (of course - what else can happen in the desert?); childbirth; Tain's potshot; running out of water/food; desert predators; they all seemed inserted just because something needed to happen. Compare, for example, to The Key to Rebecca, where the trek across the desert was brutal, but it was only a lead-in to the story, not the story itself. I also found the book depressing. The \\"victory\\" at the end was not an uplifting triumph, it was a non-event, framed by an apparent huge loss of life (although we never find out how many perished). I did find the hermaphroditic tower of the cover art interesting, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment","review":"Cherryh is my favorite author. I have read almost all of her books, some several times. I was looking forward to reading this book and saving it with the others. In my opinion, the book is boring with none of her usual tension or interpersonal relationships.

He has a gripping life story, told in true story teller fashion, and I could hardly put it down. His writing instruction was gripping, as well, and I have started reading some of the authors from his reading list.I'm rarely moved enough by a book I read to post a comment, but this book was worth a minute of my time.Mr. King, I am happy you survived your appointment with the driver of the Dodge van."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating Reading, But More Biographical than Instructional","review":"I don't know what I expected to get when I picked up this book, but it was both better and worse than I expected it to be. Getting the history and background on Stephen King was certainly interesting and entertaining. Whether it pertains to writing is up for debate. Still, well worth reading.The advice given was practical and down to earth, if fairly general. If you're looking for a \\"how-to\\" book, this isn't it.

King has proven time and time again, year after year, novel after novel, that he's one of the best at his craft. And in _On Writing_ he shares what he's learned over the years. King's writing and teaching style is so fluid and natural I was drawn into this book as if it were one of his novels. Whether you're a novice writer just delving into the world of fiction writing or an experienced novelist, there's something to be learned from someone who's travelled the road. I read the book through once but have gone back to it time and time again since then. It's a book every writer should have on his/her bookshelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teacher","review":"King is the unequivocal master in the of storytelling and writing. 'On Writing' is part biography, part handbook for aspiring writers. It explores the pains and heartaches often endured to perfect one's art, and the healing quality of the writing process. Take it from a man who knows, and has a boundless passion and love for writing. 'On Writing' is a poignant look into the mind and life of one of the best loved, and most widely read, authors around today coupled with solid advice for any writer, published or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawed but helpful","review":"Is the book perfect? Of course not. Stephen King writes best-sellers, not masterpieces. But if you are an aspiring writer and you haven't invested ten bucks and a day or two of reading to a writing memoir from one of the most successful authors of the past 35 years, then you should ask yourself if it you're really serious about becoming an author. Even if you take only one piece of knowledge from the book, it is a worthwhile investment.King didn't ramble on a lot about the same stuff that you read in every writing book; this is a memoir of King's writing life, not a \\"how-to\\" guide. That said, it does contain a lot of useful information and is great to read when you need motivated to stop making plans and excuses and to just sit down and put pen to paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr. King: Always an Inspiration!","review":"The master of suspense provides his readers an insightful perspective on the writing aspects of which he feels are most important. In \\"On Writing\\", King allows readers into his world from his childhood, to his struggling days as a hard-working writer and educator, to his post-publication adulthood. He shares those most personal times in his life when he felt his greatest desires to succeed, as well as when he felt his life was most threatened.Along with the inspiring look into the writer's life, King also shares his advice on what he considers to be important for aspiring writers to realize. He discusses his thoughts on the use of adverbs, the conversation between writer and reader, and his own, personal editing process.Get a in-depth look at what makes this best-selling author love writing, as well as a peak into his first drafting of \\"1408\\" (now a major motion picture)."},{"rating":"2","title":"King's Best Non-Fiction","review":"King has shown his great work, and how to put together your own work. He talks about his early life, and his high school. Then, he goes on to great metaphores. He talks about his first book \\"Carrie\\" and how he made his first dollar. This is a great book for anyone interested on writing a fiction story. I would highly reccoment using this book, as a tool to start off. King shows his knowledge in the subject, and it has shown. He is a best selling author that can put any other memoir to shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Change Is Good","review":"Stephen King has made a remarkable and substantial change with this book, and through the book he has proved that his writing abilities are not limited to his stereotypical horror/fiction genre. On Writing explores King's childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood as a writer. Not only does the book give background information, it provides tips on submitting manuscripts to magazines and the importance of finding an agent.The book also discusses how King's accident in 1999 affected his health and writing.King provides the reader with examples of prose and examples of how he edits prose to keep it concise yet informing. The book is a quick read and well worth your time if you aspire to become a [better] writer. King's genius is undisputable, but this book is testimony that his genius is not limited."},{"rating":"2","title":"Succinct and to the point!","review":"Stephen King reveals the soul behind the man in this clearly written, pithy autobiographical effort to give the reader valuable tips on writing. There is no pretense, just solid morsels of the author's own way of thinking about writing. Many of them are treasures that deserve to be mentally stowed away and put into practice when aspiring (or long-time)writers take up the pen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Reading for Aspiring Writers","review":"To say the least writing is an emotional career whether you write fiction or non-fiction. There's so much perspiration, so many blank pages and so much anxiety all intertwined with a little inspiration. When a fellow author insisted I read this book in the midst of one of my writers blocks, I was caught off guard. Stephen King--the horror guy--has a book on writing? Yes he does and compelling reading it is. Once you get past all the F-words in the midst of his candor about his life and the craft of writing, you will be very glad you read it. Aside from a fascinating autobiography of a multi-million selling author, ON WRITING is an inspiring how-to manual navigating serious writers right back on the road to a finished manuscript. Take a break from your writers block and read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Master shares his secrets.....","review":"Stephen King, a true master of his art, expounds at length on various topics related to writing--particularly fiction, seeing as that's what he knows. He begins with a pseudo-memoir, focusing on events that shaped him into the writer he became. From there he talks about the various \\"tools\\" a writer must be able to use, and how to go about honing these tools. Much of what he says here is great (Rule one: Read a lot, and write a lot), while some of what he says seems to be more individual to him and his style/methodology than universal. For example, he says outlining your story in advance is a crutch that will stifle your writing. That may very likely be true of the stories he writes, but I don't think that every writer should take this advice. (Which isn't to advocate being a slave to your outline--you CAN change the thing....) But then, what do I know. He's the one who's published....."},{"rating":"2","title":"From a Writer and a Fan!","review":"Stephen King's new non-fiction book, On Writing, is the most concise, helpful, specific and entertaining book I have ever read towards actually becoming a published writer.

Diane Klein, Author of IN THE NAME OF HELP"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply amazing","review":"I have never read a single Stephen King novel. I am not a writer (nor an aspiring one). I bought this book for my husband, but picked it up one night just to glance through it. I ended up reading the entire book. I laughed and cried through a book that was, I thought, going to be rather like a textbook. Mr. King even made me feel that I should write - just for the appreciation of it - just for myself. I now have utter respect for this incredible author. Anyone who speaks so lovingly of another human being (in this case his wife) and is as gifted in his craft as he is, demands our respect. This was such an inspiring book. Mr. King - I will being reading your novels now. I am ashamed I have not done so yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring memoir and writing manual","review":"...To write well you must read a lot. How many would be novelists/playwrights/screenwriters rarely read/go to the theater/go to the movies? Looking at the reading list in the back of King's book, it seems impossible that he writes as much as he does.There are better books covering the nuts and bolts...But not any of them are as moving as King's memoir."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Master","review":"I am not a Stephen King fan, not because he is not good at his craft, he is, but because I don't read the type of things he writes. That said, I have to say that this book was one of the top two most useful books on writing I have read, and I've read plenty. His direct, down-to-earth style gets right to the heart of the matter, and his generous and candid sharing of his personal experiences results in a rich account of what writing is to him and what it can be to others. I like that he issues no ultimatums but still puts forth his thoughts with strength and authority. It is just a wonderfully direct and wise conglomerations of advice and counsel. I felt his sense of sharing. He didn't have to write this book. He could have written another of his big hit crazy wonderful off-the-wall stories, but he shared himself instead. Thanks you, Stephen. You have made me a better writer, and you entertained me in the process."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great writing guide","review":"This is an exceptional book on the craft of writing. Stephen King guides you on the road he traveled to become a great writer.

Fairly easy read. Recommend it to all Stephen King fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shows that anyone can get published.","review":"I'm not really a big fan King's. I think when he really wants to he can create something magnificient (like Green Mile, Shawshank Redemption, or Hearts in Atlantis). But most of his story's I find ridiculous. His technical prose, however, is outstanding, which is why I picked this up. It's very inspiring to know that at the lowest point of his life is when he first published Carrie, his first novel. It makes me think that it's not impossible to finish a novel while working and going to school. Just focus and get into that writing zone. The law of inertia states that an object in motion tends to stay in motion. Get in motion and stay there."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Incredible Visit with King!","review":"This book is terrific! If you're a fan of King's, you'll be fascinated by his stories of his life and its effect on his writing. If you are a writer, or want to be, BUY THIS BOOK. It's like taking a private class with a master writer. Incredible! I'm a published writer and felt like I learned many useful tricks and tools. This book made me want to go back and read all of King's books with a fresh eye for language and writing style. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stuff","review":"I literally read this in a day. I don't know how anyone could write about writing in such an engrossing way, but Steven King has done it! The first part of the book is autobiography, serving to show that it's tough to break into the writing business, but it's possible. The second part of the book is dedicated to talking about writing itself, dealing with various pet peeves that King has and some things he's learned along the way.This book inspired me to write. That's a lot more than I can say for other books of this kind that I've read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Door shut. Door open.","review":"A very good book.As most have already said, it's a combination of autobiography _and_ book on writing. I really enjoyed the autobiography, it's compact, fast paced and tremendously entertaining. King remembers a few moments of his life in several small 'snapshots', as he puts it, which make for great reading and great insight into King, the writer.The book on writing is not quite as good. Most of what King has to say is common sense. It's always interesting, though, to hear his voice, and he writes it in a way that encourages the reader, whether or not he or she intends to ever write, to actually sit down and do it. You get to know, also, in the end, what happened to King right before, during, and after his terrible accident a few months back.Fans will definitely read (and appreciate) this book no matter what any reviewer says, but non-fans and even King's detractors, I believe, would like _On Writing_."},{"rating":"2","title":"on writing","review":"I not received this book.

However, I bought this book because am always looking for resources on writing, and this book received good reviews. In the beginning, Stephen King shares how he was drawn to writing, his methodology for writing, and simply tips about what works for him and what has worked for his students. The second part of the book is about a near-death experience that he had and how writing was one of the keys to his recovery. I found it to be a valuable and inspirational book, as it encourages anyone with a passion to write to do so, and explains how writing should be integral to a writers life."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is good.....","review":"....but the marriage is magnificent - \\"I know it's none of my business, but....\\" Read this book and discover the gift of love and devotion as it exists in the real world.

The first half of the book is spent almost exclusively in an autobiographical tale about King's younger life, up until his first published book, Carrie. The second half is all English teacher - he breaks down the what, why and how's of being an author. Don't think for a second that one part is more interesting or helpful than the other - they fit together very well and you really get to understand how a top selling author thinks. Highly recommended. I bought a copy, loaned it out and never got it back...so I bought a second copy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as it gets!","review":"King's new book is an outstanding writing manual, although King himself will be the first to say it's not a \\"manual\\" at all. It's like driving across the country with the best writer in the univerwe and having a bull session about his life and writing. Two great things: one, King not only shows you examples of bad writing, he tells you WHY it's bad. Two, he shows a blue-pencil job he did on his own story. The minor changes make an incredible difference in the readability and flow of the story. This book is a brief autobiography plus a treatise on what ails much of the world of writing today. And, if you've ever attended writing seminars or taken college classes in the subject, you will know his complaints and jabs are right on. I only wish the book could've been 500+ pages. You'll LOVE it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Motivating","review":"I loved reading this book! It cuts through a lot of the high browed, academic drivel. I will read it again when stuck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed this book.","review":"This book was fascinating because it gave a little insight about the reality of being a writer, being a best seller, yet being human. It wasn't a book full of a lot of tips, it was more about how he became a writer, and how he writes. Sure there were tips, but that wasn't the focus (as title implies).I don't have much in common with Stephen King when I write, but I have enjoyed many of his novels over decades of reading. His memoir reminds us that aspiring authors can make some mistakes and still do what they enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for writers","review":"Absolutely riveting book for anyone who even thinks they want to write. Honest but grounded in the real world. Challenges you to ask if you really want to commit to the process but shows you how to do so in real-world language with examples from his well-known classics. MUST READ for wannabe writers."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best contemporary American writer?","review":"I was totally smitten by the writing of Stephen King in this book, and wanted to read more of his work. I'd never read him before, and was compelled to find a title I could tolerate. I'm not into blood and guts or eeriness or weirdness - but I truly admire King's use of language and his ability to create characters and the consistency of plotting he discusses in On Writing. It's so simple, but \\"What would happen if...\\" is a fine hook! I'm now deeply enjoying The Dome, but I can't imagine reading it again. Once I know the answer, that'll be that.I hope one of these days he abandons his usual stripes, and writes The Great American Novel. He's got what it takes to produce something that benefits from many runs through, like Jane Austen, say, where what happens is secondary to the characters. I'm ready, and so is he!I may well re-read On Writing, though. There's a lot of meat, and brilliantly presented, in that little book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very badly bound","review":"This should have been called the \\"cheap edition\\" rather than the 10th anniversary edition. The binding is extremely poor; the pages are detaching from the bottom part of the spine after just a couple of days' reading, and I don't usually damage books.As for the book itself, well, King's style tends to the vulgar and brusque. He says some good things, but they are mixed up with a whole lot of rambling and self-aggrandization. I'm happy to have read what many consider a classic text on writing, but I can't say I'm any more of a fan of King now than when I started."},{"rating":"2","title":"On Writing","review":"Stephen King's humorous account of his career as a writer since childhood is a great motivator for writers. He provides excellent tips and even if you've never written before, he will make you want to start. On Writing motivated me to write my novel, Time To Heal, which has since been published!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Detailed, Surprising & Inspiring","review":"I enjoyed all of this book. I listened to the audio version, and I felt like I got a private tutorial from Stephen himself! The book has lots of different parts, all worthwhile. The recommendations for writers are honest, useful & to the point. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"Simply the best guide to writing that I have ever read. It humanizes the whole process.Arthur"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books on writing!!!","review":"I absolutely loved this book! The first part of it focuses on his life and the things that happened in his life that helped shape him as an author. The rest of the book gives you great pointers with your own writing and inspires you to just get to work. I've read many other books on writing before, but most of them focus too much on the basics, which should have been covered in high school English courses. King only tries to inspire you and let you in on a few of his own tricks that he's learned mostly through his own experience as a writer. His style of writing almost makes you feel like he's in the room with you, just having a casual conversation, and not like he's lecturing you in some boring writing class. I definitely recommend this book for any aspiring writer, but remember practice, practice, practice is the only thing that will help you improve. Mr. King's own words."},{"rating":"2","title":"Right on target","review":"This is a remarkable book! It is one of the best I've ever read on writing. I have always been burdened by plot development, believing I needed to \\"plot\\" the entire story before I started to write. I felt liberated when I read Mr. King's \\"What if?\\" approach to storytelling. By using this approach, the story evolves on its own. Thanks for writing a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only one of King's works I've read, but I loved it!","review":"Some people love to watch great athletes, I admire great writers and King's book allowed me to \\"watch\\" what goes on in the mind of a successful and prolific master of writing. I recommend this book to aspiring writers or, people like me, who love to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN EXTENDED CONVERSATION","review":"More of a conversation, and less of a how to nuts and bolts text book. Think extended interview. Think Charlie Rose, or Brian Lamb(Booknotes) in an in-depth converstion/interview. Where did you grow up ? How did you start ? What is the process like for you ? What's happened recently ? Its very entertaining and informative. If your looking for a quick fix on how to write, its not here. It never is. Talent and creativity must be coupled with hard work and persistance. You've heard it before, and you 'll hear it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Craft of a Writer","review":"I bought On Writing: 10th Anniversary Edition: A Memoir of the Craft in preparation of writing my second book. I found some insights that will hel me as I craft the stoy of a business book. Thanks Stephen for reveling your process and keeping it real."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's all in the story","review":"Manuscripts at the large Manhattan houses are constantly pushed aside for lack of story. The literary art stars of modern times often turn beautiful prose that lacks depth and course. Some of these find their way to the shelves and die a quick death.On Writing maps the writing life and genesis of a true storyteller. Those familiar with King's prose understand that he embeds satire in all of his works. (He also speaks this way in person too.) This book is no exception. Take what he says with a grain of salt, but follow his advice to pursue your story one character step at a time.For the guts of storytelling, try Block's classic From Plot to Print and the up and rising Klim's Write to Publish."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Wish There Were Six Stars ....","review":"I pre-ordered \\"On Writing\\" by about three days and received it in my mailbox at one in the afternoon, yesterday. At one in the morning - after an entire day of no television or computers - I had soaked up every one of the nearly 300 pages. I was so inspired by what I read that, instead of going to bed when I completed the book at one a.m., I sat up for another two hours and wrote in my own.Mr. King offers insight and direct instruction in this book and I couldn't recommend it more to an aspiring writer. My first thought when I heard the book was coming out was: Far out! Stephen King wrote a book JUST FOR ME! And that's what he did. He managed to make me laugh out loud, smile, think, mist up and most importantly ... sit down and write. If you write - or want to write - you will feel like Stephen King's \\"telepathic\\" tome was penned just for you.Of course, you'll be wrong. I'm just sure he did it for me. ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent reference resource for any writer","review":"The story of how Stevie King gradually became best-selling horror writer, Stephen King, is fascinating for anyone - whether a writer or reader. If you've ever asked, been asked, or wanted to ask a writer how they do it, where they get their ideas from, here's your answer. And you get the answer from one of the most famous of today's popular writers. King doesn't just try to answer these illusive questions, in typical story-teller fashion he attempts to SHOW the process.On Writing is an inspirational journey and a very personal one. I'm happy to admit I chuckled a lot, choked back tears, and writhed at the description of a doctor bursting young Stevie's eardrums. King can still tell a story. This is a book I know I'll refer to often for inspiration, and for that feeling that someone else knows what it's like to spend time at this writing thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"I thought being that he wrote fiction horror stories, this book would be dark. That was my mistake. He really seems like a happy playful guy. This book mixes his life stories along with tips and things to remember when writing. Excellent read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Writer Simply States What It Means","review":"After years of reading King's spooky work, I fell upon this non-fiction piece that I couldn't put down. Well written, concise, no overdose of funny material, but funny moments nonetheless; and much to my surprise, this book was the best pizza I had embellished in one sitting. Kudos Mr. King. I feel a re-read sneaking up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stuff","review":"If you love Stephen King this book is amazing. If like me, you really like Stephen King with some reservations,this is a thoroughly fascinating and enlightening read. My only issue is that King does a wonderful job of revealing HIS method-- and this method will produce...well I believe books like Mr. King writes. There's nothing wrong with this, and obviously anyone reading this review is interested in the mind behind his immense output of quality work. I just think this is a wonderful ingredient to add to a full course of study; he covers the fundamentals with thoroughly invigorating and humorous bravura."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential for any aspiring writer!","review":"Whether you like Stephen King as a writer or not, \\"On Writing\\" is a must in your personal library. King gives in this book a view of how he managed to build the necessary discipline for his \\"craft\\" as a one of the best-selling fiction writers of all time. You'll especially appreciate his advise on drafts, language, character development, and even some tips on how to make your work accesible to publishing houses and literary agents. It's like being on a workshop with the King himself. Fun to read, insightful, and useful for any aspiring writer, no matter the genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inspirational and enjoyable but doesn't teach you much","review":"It was a pleasure to read this book. It gave me some inspiration and more will to write. If this book was prose, I'd definately give it full 5 stars, but the fact is that this book doens't teach you almost anything about writing. Yes, it tells you to write each and every day, preferably at the same time and at least some specified amount of words, but who wouldn't figure it all out himself? Besides, the book tells in fact mostly about Stephen King himself; his past and stuff like that. What does it have to do with writing? If you're a fan of King and interested in writing, this book is for you. Otherwise, it's not worth the money. There are better books out there, just go and find them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Job Stevie!","review":"I just like to say that this is one of best autobigrphies I have ever read. Stephen King's most of the books are international bestsellers. This is the first non-fiction I read by Stevie. I think this is also one of his master pieces. I personally recomended this book to anyone who like to read autobigraphies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptionally Good from [the] King!","review":"A professional copywriter referred me to this exceptional piece of writing for the writers's craft by arguably one of the very best! There is great value in having this book for periodic re-reading especially if you're a writer, but even if you're not. Why? Well, if you're a writer, there are scant few books, if any, on the craft that could be more useful. If you're not a writer, per se, you'll still be enthralled by it. I don't want to steal one whit from the reading, so suffice it to say, his subtitle, \\"A Memoir of the Craft\\" includes fascinatingly told stories within the larger story of a life of writing still in progress. Two thumbs up from the reader!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good but confusing in ways","review":"love me some uncle stevie. little confused why he included a lengthy section about his accident here. i know this tragedy affected the writing of this book but he didnt really address how the incident impacted his craft and that is the topic of the book. also he mentioned how he dislikes flashbacks and i just read colorado kid and 90 percent of that tale is flashback. really like both books though."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"Hey,I read the book THREE TIMES. It is AWESOME! Stephen King is the man and the bomb. His writing is so tight and right on. I had a feeling that Carrie was sort of true to life. Also, it was interesting to know that man so famous and probably filthy rich had such humble beginnings. Also, he isn't STUCK UP now either. Any beginning writer will appreciate the encouragement he gives to us. I hope to be as prolific as he is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now I'm Inspired!","review":"I read this book so quickly, but I didn't want it to end. It was like having an intimate conversation with the author. My writer's block is gone, and I'm very inspired to dive back into my writing. He makes the mechanics of writing an easier read. Not like it is in school. Not only am I excited about writing again, but now I wish that Steve and I could be buddies. He is so interesting. When I finished the book, it was like saying goodbye to a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two","review":"With the hype surrounding this book, I decided to pick it up to see what that was all about. I was told it was a 'must' read.I skimmed through the life sections about King. I don't think he had led a overly exciting life like he sees to think. So that left me with the writing sections.First off, King's advice is his own. It is what works for him. I am a fan but I was saddened to see how he named a couple of books throughout the memoir, mostly by dead authors and bashed them because they didn't write in his style. And when be mentioned backstory I couldn't help but snicker how this man often(very often), writes pages of it throughout his novels.Again, I am a fan but after reading this I cannot help but see him in another light and it isn't good."},{"rating":"2","title":"passionate, instructive, and revealing","review":"The author delivers an intimate reflection on the art and craft of writing with disarming passion and impressive authenticity. The result is both a revealing memoir and a refreshingly instructive handbook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guidance towards a more satisfying writing experience","review":"As a writer, this book helped me get over the unspoken demand for literary greatness, and focus on telling a good story. It also helped me develop characters and situations, rather than plotting out their responses ahead of time on some giant grid. Reflecting on King's ideas helped me find a more satisfying -- and more productive -- writing experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh.","review":"I was hoping the book would be a guide on how to be a good writer. While I'm encouraged by the biographical portions of the book (even he has a stack of rejection letters), I found his advice on writing to be somewhat stilted.For instance, he discourages people from making notes on their ideas - well, what if someone has ADD or is really, really busy? I tend to be forgetful of some pretty important things and keep a frantic schedule, so I rely heavily on notes, not just on writing ideas, but to keep the day organized. Plenty of other writers have plotted their ideas with good results (J.K. Rowling, for instance, whose writing Mr. King respects).I'm not going to go into a huge, detailed rant on every little thing I found wrong, especially since another person may find this to be a valuable resource. Maybe his advice works for him and a lot of other people, but it wouldn't work for everyone. I'd say enjoy the book, but don't make it your bible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Money well Spent","review":"I would not consider myself a huge Stephen King fan, but this book is amazing. If you're at all interested in being a writer this book is a must. It's the kind of book you can open at any page and be inspired or just amazed at this man's journey. It's a brave, honest book..that will inspire even the biggest procrastinators to write.And for those die hard Stephen King fans, this book will only make you love him more. Out of my 45 books I have bought on Amazon, this is up there as one of my favourites."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superbly entertaining novel by Steven King","review":"I usually don't read books often, and when I do I normally am not very into it. I bought a copy of \\"on writing\\", and as I flipped through the pages this novel seemed to captivate me. In a very unique manner steven King employs both a lesson to the aspirin writer and a autobiography which presets a little information about his life as well. The advice given in this book should not be missed by anybody. Reading this book gave me more confidence in my capabilities as a writer-reading a book like this could do the same for you. Steven Kings on writing is a great novel, and it finds ways to amaze even the most hateful readers(literally). Use me as an example."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read and learn","review":"I was skeptical at first as to how good this one would be. I really, truly enjoyed it! This is the book Stephen was writing when he was hit by the van. He has been very generous with advice and, as always, that King charm. A very good book if you want to see into the mind of a master."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rich In Perspective","review":"By reading Stephen King's 'On Writing' I expected a few good points about the craft from a favorite author. I received a very rich perspective about writing and life. King peels off his skin to reveal an imperfect past with neither shame or rationalization. He places each memory into a puzzle board revealing a wonderful picture his life and how his experiences affected his stories. This is especially true after his horrific accident a few years ago. Between autobiographical bookends to \\"On Writing' King provides pointers about the craft. Rather than dealing with the subject in grass blade detail, he broadens the readers viewpoint about key tools and important objectives before putting pen to paper. It is a lively discussion intended to broaden a writers perspective without constraining their creativity. Obviously, I enjoyed the book, picked up some excellent ideas about writing, but most importantly, received a lesson about how loving life is the foundation to good writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"(Memoir / instruction) King gives a memoir ofhow he became a writer and a great deal ofinstruction on how to become a better writeryourself, especially focused on fiction but - Ithink - capable of being generalized. It waswonderful to hear his process. I read many of hisbooks when I was younger and enjoyed them; itwas great to hear the foundations of some, aswell as King's tips on writing.Potentially offensive material: lots of strong language"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book - as usual","review":"Another hit for Mr. King! Very informative and interesting. Good points were brought out on writing.A must read for all who has writing in their heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some unexpected stuff","review":"I really liked the fact that he started with a somewhat autobiography. Very interesting and it's nice to know the person behind not only this book, but multitudes of books. I like his tips on editing, writing in active tense, and allowing us to look at some of his first drafts that were, uh-hum, terribly written. Nice to see the master is human when it comes to a first draft.I was looking for a bit more knowledge about writing and I got it."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring.","review":"I found this book to be dull, boring, and a slow read. The first part was a little interesting; about his childhood. Then it turned into a \\"how to\\" write like him. Not my favorite book AT ALL."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read, even if you have no plans to be a writer","review":"I've not read any fiction by Stephen King in years. I've just never really enjoyed the horror genre. But not only has this book really got me jazzed about writing, it's made me want to read Stephen King fiction again. I just ordered \\"The Gunslinger\\" to get started! This book is extremely entertaining. One of those rarified books that I just didn't want to put down. The autobiographical section is endlessly enjoyable. The section on writing is just as enjoyable and educational. I highly recommend this for anyone who just wants a good book to read. I definitely recommend this book to any Stephen King fans and/or budding writers. One of the smartest book purchases I've made in a long, long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent writing resource given like a great King novel","review":"Great book. Tons of writing direction and insights to take away. The book develops a tremendous respect for King beyond his novel fandom. I hadn't read a King book in years, but this may be the one I enjoyed the most, because I feel like he really opened us into the working mind. This non-fiction is paced like King's best fiction writing even though the material is deeply personal.The level of insight feels like he is revealing the secrets or giving away the keys to the kingdom.Wish that more great writers would take this approach at some point in their career, very inspiring and interesting to anyone that ever wanted to write anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aspiring writer? Read this.","review":"In the interest of brevity: This is my favorite book. I first read \\"On Writing\\" as a college freshman, and have revisited the book at least once a year ever since. King can be a controversial figure among snobby bibliophiles (you know who you are), but I would recommend this in a heartbeat for anyone that ever enjoyed creating something personal, or appreciated the works of someone else.King bares his heart and soul on these pages, giving the Constant Reader an inside look into his creative process, the methods that made him the literary giant he is today, spliced in with equal parts autobiography.If you are an aspiring writer yourself, or have someone bitten by the bug in your circle of family or friends, this book is probably the next best thing to Strunk & White you can gift them. Can't recommend it enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent resource for writers","review":"I'd heard a lot of talk about this book being the eminent book for a developing writer to read. It did not live up to the hype initially, but redeemed itself in the end.I enjoyed the conversational tone King took in this book. Reading it is like reading a letter from an old friend. He does a great job of describing his early writing life and imparting the urgency for writing that all young authors hope to have.The advice given in the latter section is invaluable. Most of it is stuff that most writers have heard ad nauseum, but King puts it all succinctly. He makes the reader believe that writing is a gift that we have. It is up to us to put in the work and time to make ourselves better. It is up to us to improve our craft.This book left me very hopeful for my writing future. Thank you, Stephen King."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stimulating, heart-warming","review":"I listened to this wonderful audio cd as I drove across the usa over the summer. I'm very interested in learning to write. I picked up a lot of great ideas and tips but most of all I LOVED getting to know Stephen King. He is a very down to earth guy with a different way of looking at the world. I admire and respect him as a person and felt horrible to learn of his unfortunate accident. I recommend this book to people who really want to learn about writing from an intelligent yet humble, sweet guy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Writing - it's just telepathy","review":"I found this book concise, informative and a joy to read.It gave me a great deal of useful information on writing - from keeping style simple, to not over-plotting, to my personal favourite, the brief chapter defining writing as telepathy (you just have to read it)!Anyway, if you like to write, I recommend you buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"On writing","review":"Very insightful both into the author, himself, as well as his style of writing. Takes the fear and/or reluctance out of plunging in and getting started. It's written as a series of flashbacks, so it's not preachy, nor does it follow a logical sequnce. It's a kind of memoir (though short of a biography) on how he approaches writing, what he likes, and what he dislikes."},{"rating":"2","title":"On Writing","review":"This was the 3rd Stephen King book I've read, and the first that's non-fiction. I found it to be remarkably well-written, and enjoyable. He has down-to-earth, common-sense advice that come from experience, and doesn't pull any punches. As a relatively new published author, I found the advice and anecdotes very useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a King fan, but...","review":"I'm not a big Stephen King fan - haven't read any of his books since middle school - but I found this really refreshing. His bio (the first half) dragged on a bit, but would probably be really interesting for fans. The second half - when he talks about the writing process - had some good tips, different from those I've read in other how-to writing books. Tips about where to write and how to approach the craft of storytelling that I actually have found useful. He uses frank language and a conversational style and it is a relatively quick read. Mostly relevant for fiction writers, but others might find it useful, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute Perfection","review":"One part autobiography, one part writing guide. Stephen King answers the questions that most of his readers ask, like, \\"Where do you get your ideas?\\" A very good mix. If you would like background information about one of today's best authors, as well as a guide to make a good writer great, this is the book to read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST READ FOR ALL THAT EVER THOUGHT ABOUT WRITING","review":"This was the first book I read on writing, and because of this book I started my first novel. Though it's been several years since I read it, what stick out in my mind the most is Stephen Kings words \\"just write\\". I had no idea how to even begin, let alone if I could finish a novel. He gave me the okay, and the courage to just start and see where it leads. I was too focused on the how's and what's...all things that had hindered me from starting. He also offers some helpful insight to how he accomplishes his own writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally--a non-scary Stephen King book that I can read!","review":"I've often heard people rave about Stephen King's ability to evoke the scene and scare the wits out of people---the main reason I never could bring myself to read his books. Not that I haven't wanted to, mind you. As an aspiring writer, I came across this book and gobbled it up. A very interesting read with helpful ideas to boot. I'm even going to try to read one of his previous books so I can get a better feel for his fiction works and understand better the examples he used in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool","review":"I thought that it was cool he did this. It was a quick read, and it wasn't Earth shattering, but I thought it was insightful. Quirky guy."},{"rating":"2","title":"King an Excellent Teacher","review":"I've just finished reeading Stephen King's On Writing. What an amazing book. Not only is this a memoir of King's life but a complete, though brief, guide to the whole novel writing process. King discusses character and plot, paragraph development, and basic grammer (to name a few). He gives advice on extra help, (The Elments of style, Strunk & White), and even sample writing to correct, which can be submitted on his website. It's an exciting, interesting, and quick read, (I finished in three days). You hear King's voice throughout the whole novel as if he were teaching a creative writing class. Not only will Stephen King fans love this book, but aspiring novelists, and writers alike. I reccomend tis book to any fan of reading or writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're a beginning writer, you got to read this.","review":"To say Stephen King is candid about what it's like to be writer is an understatement. He visits with the reader, and not from a pedestal. I felt at home. It is a refreshing read \\"on writing\\". Stephen King does not fill the pages with prim and proper, cute, tidy, clever, but empty phrases-like other works I've read. This book has provided a lot of insight for me and will continue to do so. If you're a beginning writer, you got to read this. Mr. King, thanks for caring and sharing."},{"rating":"2","title":"On Writing","review":"I found this book by Stephen King both interesting and useful.It allowed me to see what style of writing he has and how he came about.I wansn't a big Stephen King fan but decided to buy the book and I learned a lot about him and his career. I am very gald that I came accross it. The most important thing that I learned was to just write, write, write on your first draft. Then revise and edit on your 2nd draft.An enlightening read!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiration","review":"I loved this book, being as I am a would-be aspiring writer. I flew threw this book, part autobiography, and part writing seminar. The biography was very appealing and inspiring and the writing lessons were very eye opening. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a Master for the Masses","review":"This is an eye-opening book for anyone aspiring to write. Plus it's a great side-splitter, with Steve's own true mess ups, life lessons and wonderous achievements ... all for us regular joe's (and jane's) who don't carry a thesaurus with us wherever we go. Yes, he does say the f* word, fellow adults! Stevie, you're as amazing as ever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"cure for writers block","review":"I loved this book. Its candid and humorous.

A great autobiographical tale as well as an incredibly inspirational yarn for anyone who is suffering from writers or artist block!A+"},{"rating":"2","title":"Long time King fan","review":"When I picked up this book, I expected to like it since I am a rabid King fan. I was refreshed by the information he included about himself. I too, am trying to write a book of my own and while it is not in the style or Mr. King, we are in the same basket, so to speak. He made me feel that writing is not an impossible goal and that I just have to remember the story wants to be told. His advice was simple and clear, with a few rules peppered along the way. Much more interesting then dry, boring text books, I would recomend this book to anyone who was trying to break out in this form of business. Thank you again Mr. King, your simplicity is your greatest gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular","review":"The advice and insight provided in this book is invaluable.

This would make a great gift for someone interested in becoming an author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stephen King \\"On Writing\\" is inspiring read for beginner and experienced writers","review":"I bought this book on the advice of a published writer friend. I am beginning the process of researching and writing my first piece that I hope to publish. This book is absoulutely fantastic. First of all, it's a great book for just pleasure reading about Stephen King and how he developed. Second, it's an inspiring book for a first time writer like myself. I have been highlighting and bending back pages all day and expect this to be a one-day read. I just can't put it down. Thanks to Stephen King, I have the inspiration and confidence to get started...and that's half the battle won!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable romp","review":"It's clear that King had fun writing this. It took me back to the days of my College English and Journalism classes, and the amusing asides were a nice diversion. King can get a bit windy at times, and the stream-of-consciousness romps through his memories can wear on you a bit, but overall, it's a good read and a great deal of fun for the reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great advice and a great story","review":"If you are a King fan you have to get this book -even if you don't have an interest in writing. His advice and stories blend toghther wonderfully and it contains a fair amount of biographical information. It truly is a peek behind the curtian and the techniques he advises will be more evident as you read his future stories. It is a great book and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting, readable and helpful","review":"First, I have to admit that I have never read a Stephen King novel. Ever. But I know that everyone else on the face of the earth has read his books. As a writer who struggles for ever word, I wanted to find out what Stephen King had to say about writing. It turns out King has some wonderful ideas for finding just the right word as well as great ideas for finding stories. His life story is fascinating and the step-by-step writing help is invaluable. I couldn't put this book down and I bought a copy to keep. In the autobiographical section, King tells us how everyday experiences sometimes give him story ideas. For example, at one point Mr. King slips in a restroom... and he uses the experience as the basis of a very imaginative story. This book is highly recommended by me."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the writer, yes...but for the reader?","review":"I really liked this book, since I've been writing science fiction and horror for the last ten years and Stephen King is my favorite horror writer. It didn't blow me away with any writing tips, however. The autobiography portion of the book, I felt, was much better, only because it featired some anecdotes on how he got some of his ideas as well as his early days as a writer.So, from a writer's standpoint, I can see why this book is popular, but from the casual reader's standpoint, I'm puzzled. Over 200 reviews here on Amazon and I'd be willing to bet 175 were from readers, not writers. That statistic, if it's true (and like I said, I'd be willing to bet it is), says a lot about King. He can write a book that is basically writing tips and sell it to READERS! Anyone else would have been laughed at by his publisher. King is like no other writer on planet Earth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Advice from one's who's been there, done that.","review":"Let me begin by saying I'm not a fan of Stephen King. Nothing against him, I'm just not interested in the genre he typically writes in. I've not really seen any of the movies based on his books, except for the first half of Carrie, (the old one), the whole Carrie, made for TV version, the last part of misery, and Rose Red.But I was eager to get a book on writing written by one of the most famous writers of our time.King's writing is simple, straight-forward, and just plain blunt. He cuts to the quick, but makes it easy to understand why some people, no matter how hard they try, will never be great writers, but a few can be good.Even more, he illustrates from his own life how writing is, and how it comes to be, and how it can affect one's life.Finally, King was right to pay tribute to Elements of Style, by Strunk and White, the essential tool for all writers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Book on the Craft","review":"Stephen King brings his wealth of experience, humor, and intelligence to create a most readable book on what it takes to be a writer. Combining his own life stories with his first forays into writing and submitting work, this book is a must for all aspiring writers. After reading it, and reading it again, replete with highlights and margin notes, one will be compelled to commit pen to paper. Or fingers to keyboard. Buy it. You will not be disappointed. Kudos to Mr. King!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This book is extremely helpful for any young writers looking to follow in King's footsteps, albeit the fact you should find your OWN style of writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!!!","review":"I have to admit that this is my first Stephen King book, and it most certainly isnt my last. It also helped me make the decision to become a writer.The book is written in several parts, the first part, his memior, is good enough to stand as a story on its own, then he goes into detail about what he believes makes a good writer. I have seen people on amazon write that his teaching in this book isnt much help but i will say that everyone is different and will have different writing styles, this is Kings point of view.The book is warm, funny and wonderfully written, its almost like Mr. King himself is sitting in your lounge room and having a chat with you and he feels like an old friend once the book is finished. He is the sort of person you wish would teach your english class.I recommend this book to any aspiring writer and even if it doesnt help you in any way it will no doubt entertain you."},{"rating":"1","title":"great book, greedy publisher","review":"many other reviewers espoused the virtues of this well wriien tome. my one star review is for the greedy publisher setting the price of the kindle edition at $12.99 when you can purchase a paperbook edition of the same book at amazon for $7.99. A $5 premium for an electronic version which has close to zero production and distribution costs compared to a paper book is insane and illustrates one of the key reasons the publishing business is hurting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why","review":"If you want to be brow beaten this is the book for you. It is one thing to say you will never be a good writer in person but why take negative feed back just because of a name. It is like take a course in Spanish from a CD ROM. You never receive feedback as to why you are makeing the mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Paper","review":"This was definitely the least informative book on writing I have ever read. I picked up a grand total of one tip, and that was so ordinary that I didn't bother writing it down when I gave the book away to a charity shop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah blah blah blah blah","review":"Just goes on and on about his childhood.The guy's got a lot of nerve selling us a book designed to make us better writers, and then writing on and on about his childhood.The stories are \\"wonder years\\"'ish except not as exciting.Just blah blah blahI've only finished half of it but so far it's been utter torture."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY DOESN'T HE OFFER THIS FOR FREE?","review":"Well, guess I made my point. I am informed I need to offer up a minimum of 20 words.I have no problem with an author being paid what the market will bear, but this book should be offered for free as a sort volunteer effort of Mr. Kings; as if he were directing and helping along the poor beginning author's early career. Just becsuse one owns a kindle does not mean one does not struggle financially! After all, I don't have enough space for an ever-expanding library; the kindle is cheaper than the rent for a larger space."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring!","review":"To be really honest, I am not a Stephen King fan and have never read one of his books. I abhor horror, hate is not a strong enough word, because they give me nightmares. After being forced to watch It by my ex-husband, I couldn't take a shower for months afterwards. I am a great big scaredy-cat. There, I've admitted it.On Writing, however, is not a horror story. It was recommended by members of a group I belong to on She Writes. At first I thought Stephen King = Horror. Will I take the plunge....yeah. It was worth it. On Writing is a great little book. It is full of useful tips and insights into the mind of one of the most successful writers even if I don't read his books. I love his writing style and sense of humour. After reading this, I felt inspired. Not inspired enough to pick up one of his horror novels, but inspired to work on my own writing. Recommended for all the writers and would-be writers out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Instructive without being pretentious","review":"A necessary book. Without losing Stephen King style, he writes a book on writing that is quite informative without being pretentious. Well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Making of a best seller","review":"I thought this was a realy cool book and a departure for King. The last book of his I fought through was Needful Things. I found it a rehash of salem's lot but anyways that's not the book being reviewed here. If you've ever been intrigued by behind the scenes stuff in movies, On Writing is the literary equivalent. He talks about how he was inspired by stories and how he develops characters. Some of it fairly candid about doubting himself but allowing the process to take over and finally succeeding. I read it in a few days. A very easy and enjoyable read for wanna be writers of just plain fans of his work."},{"rating":"2","title":"The beauty of it","review":"What most impressed me about this book was the ease at which it cuts to the point. I think we've all had times in our life where someone else felt that something we did was out of their reach, but we knew that there was nothing mystical about it. I'd almost re-title this book \\"Demystifying Writing\\". He does an amazing job of cutting through the fluf and getting to the heart of it; hard work. Put in your time and follow the rules. And along the way he adds a lot of humor and a bit of insparation.That, along with the short biography makes this a great insight into the person who is Stephen King. I'd highly recomend this to just about anyone.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"I ordered two packages and was so disappointed in the quality of these washcloths, especially considering the amount of money I spent. First off the seams on half of the washcloths were not sewn together correctly. They were just folded over and sewn, so that one edge of the washcloth isn't straight at all. (The other half of the washcloths were sewn together just fine.) Plus, the first time I washed them (normal cycle with other towels), one of the washcloth's seams completely tore off.I would have given it one star, but to be honest. . . they are very soft and thick and I really like them - except for the fact that the seams are all messed up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little washcloth","review":"These washcloths are the perfect size and weight for my baby.

Fine even for newborn, sensitive skin."},{"rating":"1","title":"kitchen aid toaster Model: KPTT780PM","review":"I purchased one of these heavy duty toasters from the Kitchen Aid website about a year ago and I had to exchange it right away because it would only toast one side of the bread at a time. Another pain is once you put the bread in it, and push the slide down you still have to turn a switch to turn the toaster on. I can honestly say that this toaster works just as good as any other $10.00 dollar toaster that I have bought. (I think I paid over $125.00 for it, ouch!) If you want a nice looking toaster buy it, if you want a toaster that makes great toast, shop around.."},{"rating":"1","title":"real disappointment, when I thought I had made a smart investment","review":"I have had this 2-slice toaster for about 4 months and stopped using it last week after I bought a $29 Oster as a replacement. Toasting bread with this Kitchen Aid takes about three times as long as a regular toaster. The highest setting (9) takes about 4 minutes to complete, yet toasts come out a little brown but still too soft for my taste (and I like them to be soft inside, not like biscotti!) For the second cycle, though, I have to readjust the setting to about 3-4, then pull down the lever, and finally turn the On/Off knob to turn the toaster on. Too many steps for one slice of bread. All in all, each slice takes about 6-7 minutes to toast.The toaster does look nice and is heavy, which I liked at first when I received it 4 months ago, and the signal it gives when the toasting cycle is complete is nice. But, in the end, who cares about that?? I prefer a toaster that fulfills its main function properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"It only looks good","review":"For the price of this toaster one can almost buy four of other brands which probably works a lot better. It weighs a ton and toasts unevenly. Toast takes a long time to brown. I would have never bought this toaster except that it was a gift. I have the red one and I guess it looks good in the kitchen. My sister-in-law said that one is paying for the novelty of the blue light that comes on when it is turned on and the buzzer that sounds when the toast is supposedly ready. Definitely not worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Item Color is Not as Shown","review":"Had to return the dishes.

It is very cute, but doesn't hold much money at all and money gets jammed in it very easily. I really wouldnt reccommend it. It wont hold more then 10 bills in it, the drawer really is teeney tiny. Would be a good buy for a kid not looking to keep money in it for very long, but to me that defeated the purpose so now it is a toy, she likes to put her money in to see it count up but since it wont hold much she takes the bills back out and keeps them in something bigger.

I was looking for practical, sensible tips on how to live my life in a more frugal and environmentally friendly manner. All I got from this book was pie-in-the-sky, warm and fuzzy, painfully trite prose. It became increasingly obvious as I forced myself to plow through this book, page by sappy page, that McBride spent far too much time researching quotes as headers for her chapters.

This is due to some kind of auto correction the camera does by itself and cannot be turned off. If you buy this camera remember to buy at least two packs of rechargeable nimh (this is of extreme importance (for normal ones won't last 20 min), you should also get the ac adaptor for downloading pics. Also keep in mind the download is through a serial port, this is aprox 115000 bps, this means it's really slow (it can take up to 25 secs per image on fine mode).

Otherwise, I've taken some fantastic pictures with this camera! In fact, I'd have to say it does better than some of the newer Nikon Coolpix cameras (like the L18, which I also have). I've found newer models to have focus and flash issues, as well as severe shutter lag. This may not be comparable in resolution, but it's quite enough for most uses.

It is really fast. I save my images on Zip disks and use PhotoSuite III to adjust most of them. Adobe Photo Shop 5.5 is used on the very important ones. This camera is teriffic and the price has really come down in 9 months.

With the 950 I found that I needed to read the manual with care because much of the interface is restrictive and confusing if you try to just \\"go for it.\\" After blowing through several dozen test pics, I started to find the tricks to metering, autofocus and Nikon's digital simulation of shutter and aperture settings found on a traditional camera. The quality of the pictures, once you get the hang of using the camera in a particular setting, is amazing. This is the highest digital quality I've experienced with a digital camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"A decade of Escapes","review":"This is the first & ONLY digital camera I have ever bought. Yes, I paid over $1000 for it new, but that is what you get for being on the cutting edge of technology.

Had it re-vamped with new CCD chip, belt, door & I have dropped it outside a number of times. Once it took a topple from my tripod in a super windy ghost town at night. Although it has been in the shop a number of times (twice under warranty), I still swear by this camera. Great quality of colors, contrast & light balance!!

Only this time the repair bill is $$$ with absolutely no information from Nikon ... on what is actually wrong with the camera and/or if this is likely to happen again.When working, the camera is mostly fine and the reviews here ... are generally fair and accurate.

When I'm out with on a hiking trip with my camera and I need to find out some information...all I have to do is pop the CD into my computer, set up my solar battery array and run the CD...right? Someone at Nikon wasn't thinking about the customer. I'm also thinking about getting a flash memory card reader for fast downloading to my computer.

The parts are complicated and do not disassemble easily. There are 2 large parts that need to be unscrewed from one another, and one in particular gets sort of jammed when the water creates a seal in it and then very difficult to unscrew. I kept thinking how someone with arthritis or who was elderly or just not very strong could never use this thing. I thought that there must be more user-friendly ones out there, and I am so grateful to find out that there are! I decided to try the Drinkwell Platinum fountain out to see if I could make this any easier. I wish I had done this a year ago. The cats seem like this one even more than the Cat-it, and it disassembles and reassembles so easily! What a huge relief!

We had the other Fresh Flow type before, and thought this one looked pretty neat. The filters for this are quite expensive, and basically hard to find in our area. The cat dish itself gets slimey pretty quick if you don't take it apart regularly. The spring on the part you have to push down to fill it up, stops catching so you have to hold it down while you fill it. You also have to keep up with taking the pump apart and cleaning it, or the water will stop pumping.

They drink soooo much more water now, I'm very glad I bought it. I've found a trick to getting the water to flow over the whole dome evenly. You fill up the bowl once, place it on the fountain and turn it on for a few minutes. Then, take it off and fill it up again. The bottom resovoir needs to be partially filled for it to work correctly. The instructions don't tell you this. This drove me crazy when I first put the fountain together but now it works great. Also, I'm giving it 4 stars because not only are the instructions not clear on how to get it to operate properly, but the stopper is very flimsy and mine broke after only a few weeks. My boyfriend had to make a new one out of cork and wire hanger. On the Catit website, they offer replacement parts for this - but I think it should last longer than it did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drinkwell was WAY better","review":"After trying this one, for several days, I worked on and put back into operation our several year old Drinkwell cat fountain.

I thought it looked cool and the cats and I typically agree on things like that. After the first month it stopped pumping water over the dome. I found that this was because the \\"cotton\\" aspect of the fliter flakes off and gets jammed up in the filter. I finally figured out how to clean it, but to keep it running it's a weekly process. Today I noticed that the pump had burned out, the cotton had gotten inside causing the motor to die. I can't find a replacement pump online, e-bay or anywhere else. I think I'll go get a new filter system today and get rid of this piece of junk.Jeff"},{"rating":"1","title":"great when it works","review":"bought this in april - cats loved it and i loved it. easy to fill. got replacement filters for it and then it started getting gunky and slimy so i washed in water by hand with no chemicals and using just my hand to clean it. made sure pump was flowing good and put it back together and it stopped working. The water instead of flwing nicely over the dome started spurting out in heavy streams flooding the floor. I've taken it apart and put back together several times and keep coming back to a flood. Called the company who sent me to the m aker Hagen and that wasnt a good experience either. At this point my only options are to send back and get money back or send to manufacturer and let them look it over lolreally disapponited in this product and all parties involved in selling it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Most enjoyment was smashing it on my patio","review":"I have a Drinkwell Platinum and bought the Catit large to get something more quiet. It is easy to assemble and take apart. Locating the top bowl is easy after you figure it out the first time. The main problem is that no amount of fiddling with the bowl can fix the glaring design flaw that puts the pump input JUST below the water level. This thing works for while then starts sucking air even when the bowl is full of water. It is also frustrating to get the water to flow over the outer side of the bowl where the cats can get to it without getting behind the unit where the power cord is. So you fiddle with it, get it working, then 10-20 minutes later the pump starts sucking air again. I took it out back and smashed it on the patio - that was my most enjoyable part of owning this piece of garbage.I am using the Drinkwell again and will put up with it's noise. Petmate is also OK (I had a low capacity model before my Drinkwell Platinum)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Cautious!","review":"I purchased the cat it fountain, and for about 1-2 months, it was the greatest thing I could have imagained for my cats. They were drinking fresh water and it was great for them, they loved it. Very shortly however, it began to break down. The valve broke during routine washing. The water never formed a continuous stream over the dome, even after \\"running my hand over the dome to release the static electricity.\\" I was lucky if there was a single stream, but I took it because the water was at least getting cycled. Now, 90% of the time, my $40 investment won't even throw me the smallest of streams, effectively turning my investment into an electricity wasting door stop. Sometimes, when I am lucky and seat it just right, it will give me a stream.It's touch and go... just be warned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Had problems with this one","review":"I bought this from petfooddirect.com and thought it would be great for my cat. Unfortunately, problems were immediately evident! For one, the floor must be PERFECTLY LEVEL, otherwise the water will not cover the dome, and if you wedge it like i did, it will make an annoying vibrating sound from the pump. Two, my cat was afraid of it! He wouldn't even approach it. And third, which i thought was the most troubling, was that if you touch the dome even lightly, as if you're a cat trying to lick water, the pump would respond and the whole thing would vibrate and make that same noise again. Also, as the other reviewer said, there's no way it holds that much water, and you'll definitely have to top it off at least once in two days or it makes a gurgling sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good alernative to your cat drinking from the sink....","review":"That is what my cat was doing, and it was clogging up the drain - all that hair!

I set something on it one day and the dial wouldn't move. For the money, I'll just go get another one because it is so handy to have around. It is nice for measuring fruits and vegetables especially, rather than estimating whether the tomato I am using is 'medium' or 'large' to enter on MyFitnessPal tracker. More hard-core nutritionist will go with a digital scale, but this is nice for the casual user and dieter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all precise","review":"The scale looks good, but won't measure with any precision. The tare knob works just fine, until the basket moves. Then, what was set to zero suddenly reads 3 ounces - bump it again, and it's suddenly negative two. I can estimate better than that. Maybe it was just my scale (everyone else seems happy with it), but I'm returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"okay, but broke easily","review":"I bought this for about $3.50. I tested it many times after buying it and it seemed accurate. However, it broke less than a month after buying. It takes a little more weight now to push the scale down for some reason, so something inside must have broken, which means it's useless now. I didn't bother to go back to the store and return it, and I'd rather invest in a digital scale now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good at all","review":"Until last week, it worked...not very well...but it worked. Having purchased this in April 2012, it lasted approximately 9 months. During this time I have constantly had to readjust it via the small wheel at the top in back. That is a bother. Now even that doesn't work. I can put a single coffee filter on it and it measures 8 ounces...WRONG! Never again will I purchase anything like this again. My advice is to go Digital!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap scale inaccurate and difficult to zero","review":"I found this to be too poor in quality to use for my purpose. When I unpacked it, I found that the weight indicator rested at 1/2 ounce with nothing in the weighing hopper. I found adjusting it to zero almost impossible, requiring a small screw driver and lots of patience. Once adjusted, I tested it against 3 other scales and found inaccuracy between 1% and 10% in the range of 1 ounce to 14 ounces. Not good enough. I returned it as defective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needed this product!","review":"Have to stay on a restricted diet due to kidney disease and this helps with the portions. Wife really likes this.

Leon's portrayals of crime and justice in Venice may be a bit cynical but her characters are likable and the books contain subtle humor. I did not find any of Nadel's characters likable, and the salacious and violent sex scenes were definitely not to my taste. After reading 2/3 of the book, I found I didn't really care who committed the murder or why and didn't finish reading it. In my opinion, this author is not like Donna Leon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating book","review":"This book has all the right ingredients for a successful mystery debut, but...I am aware that Ms. Nadel frequently visits Turkey. One would have to assume that she has some special connection with the place. Even so it is impossible to take the uterly false peacuful and tolerant nature of the Turkish society. It is hard to imagine that in a country, where even the mention of horrific genocide on Armenians in 1912 can get you in jail, people of different religions live in harmony. It is very easy to be democratic and tolerant when there are almost no Orthodox Christians left in Turkey. Ms. Nadel has a flair for characters but the plot of her debut is so outlandish that this reader lost his patience multiple times.I'll be willing to try one more of her novels. Perhaps these were the pains of a writer novice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"Granted this is a first effort but where were the editors?

All I want to add is that it is a tasty way to find your path into and through Istanbul. The city is of course one of the most magnificent in the world, littered with history layers and layers deep, from Alexander the Great, to Constantine and the Romans, and on to the Ottoman Empire and then Attaturk and the challenge of modernization. This novel is obviously written by someone who has travelled the City's byways and is familiar with many of its neighborhoods. And Ikmen is just as Turkish as can be. A great way to become acquainted with the City and its people before going, or a great way to re-visit it from afar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"My wife suffers from deppression, so I was looking forward to hearing how Emme and her husband survived.

We can all benefit from this wonderful book!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An honest and personal accoount","review":"This book is a very quick read because the telling of the story is so well done. For those who suffer from debilitating depression and think, \\"nobody understands,\\" here's proof that others can see what's happening. Phil and Emme's story shows just how otherwise happy, thriving people can be blindsided by an emotional disorder and then wrestle with the chaos that follows.Emme and Phil obviously have an amazing relationship that helped both of them get through their ordeal. As they explain, most people just don't \\"get it\\" when the darkness of depression affects a previously full-functioning person. This is why their story is one to read. Emme's support and efforts to be part of Phil's journey--rather than giving up on him--is an inspiration.If you read this book, you will breathe an air of optimism and hope that is sorely lacking in most first-hand accounts of emotional disability."},{"rating":"2","title":"An extremely warm and open story that adds new dimension to life.","review":"I guess most people heard about depressions, but this is for real. I don't think anyone that hasn't had a very deep depression knows what it is about. The story really tells you what a depressions is about and also gives good clues on how to deal with a depression.

It captured my attention immediately. It has a fore front of a powdery, soft floral scent overtone, but gently enhanced by the undertones of vanilla. It is a very playful cologne but yet very mysterious and alluring. It is can be descibed as being a tom boyish kind of cologne but yet it captures the spirit of a well confident woman.The bottle itself is also unique. A long, slender bottle with a poppy is flower on the side. Once this delicious cologne is gone, the bottle can be refilled so there is not another bottle to throw away.

And it turned out to be the most favorite perfume in my collection of more than 50 different kinds of perfume. It smells very flowery and classy. A very unique scent. And it lasts the longest among all my perfume. My job requires me to run around all day. At the end of my 8hrs working day, when I walked out, I still got compliments from people who walked by me. I have to add that while my friends use the perfume that smells great and lasts long on them, I can use the same one but it doesn't smell the same.

My roomate had this phone at college and didn't find it handy at all. I would have liked to have a redial button too.

It would be lighter and possibly less breakable as it uses lighter batteries and doesn't have a built in speaker.I like the features (I like the setting for three favorites) and I like the locking feature and the 90 minute automatic turn off.

Arrived quickly in good condition. Can be put together with only one or two tools. Problem is, it's not so easy to put together, definitely need two people. One side kept popping out while I was sliding the back into its grooves. The door is put on with 8 very, very tiny screws and someone has to hold the door in place while another is screwing it on. While I was putting it together (and I was being very careful) two small pieces of the finish chipped off, one on the side and one on the bottom edge. The finish in those areas is awfully thin. The finishes on the door and top are much stronger. It looks really nice with the Crosley turntable/CD recorder, holds a lot of albums but is not good for CD storage. For $88 though, I'm happy enough with it.Crosley 4-in-1 Music System - Paprika (CR66-PA)Crosley CR248 Songwriter CD Recorder - Paprika"},{"rating":"2","title":"Crosley Entertainment Center","review":"It's exactly the size and color I wanted to match the 5in1 radio/photograph.

It was extremely well constructed - I mean the pieces were clearly marked, everything put together securely, and the entire stand is very attractive. Best of all was the door knob - very heavy, beautiful brass finish (it looked and felt like solid brass). We HIGHLY recommend this stand and other Crosley products (we have other cases by this company)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for my gramophone","review":"This stand is absolutely perfect for my gramophone. When I was looking at the dimensions online, it seemed like it would seem too short under my new gigantic gramophone. Once assembled, it is the perfect size. The color is beautiful and the stand is a good looking piece. However, the quality is only mediocre. The finish scratches very easily. It took me about 30-45 min to assemble on my own. The parts fit together well. The directions are easy to understand. Hopefully, this is something that will last me a while.

It assembled easily, the only issue was that the magnet was assembled backwards, a simple unscrew and reattachment fixed that. The turntable fit well, just the look I wanted.I've assembled a lot of furniture over the years, the instructions were well written and simple to follow. I used two screwdrivers, both phillips, a standard one and a smaller one for the smaller screws. The only thing I'd advise is to not screw in the back plane to secure it until the top has been put in.It was delivered in great shape, looks elegant, great price and easy to put together.

Big mistake--a few nicks and scratches I don't mind, but the pieces arrived in terrible shape. The finish was not consistent and was not even finished on the bottom front. The outer front sides were deeply scratched and look awful. I immediately wanted to send it back, but to return the item the company wanted $75, plus the shipping!!! They sold me a completely damaged and poorly constructed piece and wanted nearly the price I paid for it new to send it back to them. I am outraged and will never purchase from them again.

We also purchased the matching Crosley Stack-O-Matic and it too has a gash in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Little Stand","review":"Great hardware would have made this a great stand. The wood is great. The design is great. It's the perfect little stand to go with my Crosley nostalgic stereo. It was even easy to put together, at least, as far as the instructions went. The only problem is the poor quality hardware that comes with it. A couple of the cam locks were broken, the cams screws were cheaply made, and the knob for the door was missing. I chose a knob that I like better at a local retailer. Unfortunately, the cam locks are unique, so you can't run out to the local hardware store and get a couple quickly to finish the project. It would serve Crosley well to find another supplier for the hardware and get a higher quality that lives up to their product. The only other thing that I would change about the stand is to make it approximately 1/4\\"-1/2\\" taller, so that the top shelf has enough space to store 45rpm (single) records."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value","review":"This is a nice little cabinet for the money and matches my Crosley record player perfectly.

The color was fine, however putting it together took longer than I expected and once I got it together I thought it was quite wobbly. In fact I have not yet put the crosley system on top because I am concerned about how strong the unit really is. All parts were in the box however there was some damage to the side panel. If I could return it I would but the aggrivation and expense in doing so would not be worth it.

It is extremely difficult and it comes in a million pieces. I called the help line so they can walk you through the assembly process. It was useless to me because you can only reach them during the week, up until a certain time.. I spent my time talking to a person on the job, while at work. It's pointless when you don't have the product in front of you. I think it should be indicated that there is a large amount of assembly required.

I am a American Civil War student of many years. Within my library I have a nice collection of books on this subject. It seems that the common photographs are often repeated in the various books and seldom do I find an American Civil War photograph that I have not already seen. However, this book, \\"An Illustrated History of the Civil War\\", offers many photographs that this student had never seen. The book is well worth the price for the photographs alone, not to mention the text which was published in the highest quality. A good buy! One of my very favorite American Civil War books."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good Civil War book","review":"I just bought this Civil War book several days ago, and I'm very glad I did buy it. While it doesn't seem to go into much detail about the battles, it still seems to tell the story of the Civil War well. I did notice that it mentioned Stonewall Jackson being wounded at Chancellorsville, and how he had an arm amputated. I don't think it mentioned the detail that he didn't actually die from that wound; he died from pneumonia. Still, the pictures are intriguing, to say the least. One of the other reviewers mentioned that. I would recommend buying this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Ideas","review":"Shupak's 59 Minute Baseball Practice is first rate. The video contains of a lot of drills appropriate for any level of baseball. Each drill is described, then it is demonstrated using Little Leaguers.This video was very helpful to me in organizing fast moving, more interesting, and quicker practice sessions. Although the coaching points for each drill are mentioned (for example, \\"turn to the glove side when making a relay\\"), they are not discussed in any depth. A novice coach will need additional resources to teach the fundamentals to younger players.If you are short of practice space, Shupak's rag ball drills are the solution. If your baseball practice runs two hours -- an hour of batting practice and an hour of situations, get this video, and change your practice. Your players' skills will improve, and they will be more willing to practice hard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy for all coaches","review":"My neighbor bought this video for his nine year old girl who is playing softball. After he saw this video, all he did was rave about how it was the best one he ever saw. I had to get myself a copy. When the video arrived, I popped it into the VCR and was very impressed with its content. I had to grab a paper and pencil, however, to keep track of all the drills and ideas that the video presented. Most of the drills were new to me, some I have seen, but most opened my eyes to a new type of practice. I used to stand out there and throw BP until my arm nearly fell off. Practices would go for as long as three hours and the kids that took BP would have no reason to stay. Now, my practices are no longer than an hour, but I'm getting three times the work done. Excellent work, very well thought out, and could be used at just about any level (under the collegiate level)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greatly Disappointed","review":"I purchased this video after reading the great reviews online. However, I found the video a great disappointment. If you are looking for a video that presents instruction on fundamental techniques for youth baseball, then this is not the video to buy. There is absolutely no description of technique, just a presentation of disjointed \\"drills\\" often without a clear explanation of what is accomplished with the drill. In fact, some of the infield drills that are supposed to develop speed and coordination, will encourage sloppy technique.

The drills are not well suited for 8 and 9 year olds, who lack the physical and mental maturity (which is the level that I am coaching). However, I was able to adapt some of the drills to the younger players.I'd love to see him make a video for PARENTS to help their kids outside of formal practice time, since time restraints make individual instruction difficult for the coaches during practice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real help for little league and/or youth softball educators","review":"This video will help even the worst players on the team. My personal advice to coaches that have kids that just cannot get a feel for playing ball is to hide them behind home plate. Let them each take an inning or 2 there. This way they can learn to catch and throw and the team still has a chance of winning. This is a great video.

The reason I like them is that they are no nonsense workouts -not aerobics- where you learn Yoga moves that will help you get stronger, more flexible and more relaxed. Some of the videos I've tried before are either too long or too difficult for a beginner. Some will talk you to death. You put this on and that's it :you're on and ready to go with a minimum of fuss.

I wouldn't say it's for a brand new beginner to yoga though it is pretty basic.

I recently had a high-end 50\\" plasma / surround sound system installed and I thought Aquaria would be something like the impressive aquatic computer generated screen savers available today.

Thought a vertual aquarium would fill the need, but when I saw the deseased corals and fish with clearly visable parasitec infections I became very angry. This horrifying display of aquatic life should not receive any support. I hope that the general public does not believe that this is what coral or salt water fishtanks should look like. I see nothing beautiful in any of these diplays. They are a poor representation of even the worst PETSHOP aquarium dispays. I wish I had never seen this video, it has at least ruined this day for me.

Even from mediocre signals like regular t.v.. I was very excited to pop this DVD into my player and watch some dazzeling scenes but was very disappointed. The picture clarity leaves ALOT to be desired especially on the long shot of the full aquarium. With no less then 42\\" of screen I could barely make out the fish in the tank!

Having a plain fish bowl with one fish would have been better. Basicaly the camera stays in one spot, with may be 2 fish to look at, and they barely move around. Then to make it worst the background is void of any color, its just gray and horrible. I got my DVD and through it into the trash. If I had a fire place I would have burned it! This DVD is only worth .99 cents at the .99 cent store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult \\"Watchers\\" Aquarium","review":"I am disappointed in Aquaria's The Coral Reef Aquarium in that the background lacks color and all the fish are small varieties, but those with fish know-how would probably find the setting \\"correct\\" and some aspects, swaying coral and little creatures would be interesting in a zoomed view.But I highly recommend Aquaria's Natural Aquarium. Lot's of color and diversity in the background and colorful fish of all shapes and sizes for those of us just wanting an aquarium.

I still give it four stars, because the story and the characters were very good and I really enjoyed reading the book.

With a creative premise and a smooth writing style, she delivers an engaging romantic adventure through the winter landscape of 13th century London and France. Paranormal elements are woven into the fabric of the story with a deft hand, and the characters are both larger than life and humanly (or not-so-humanly, as the case may be) flawed.There is much to enjoy here, and very little to quibble over, but I found the book perhaps a bit too sexually graphic in places and the hero a bit too arrogant and domineering to be completely likable. Nevertheless, I did enjoy the book as a whole. The premise of the series is intriguing and original, and I will likely purchase the next release to see where the author takes it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart of the Hunter (Dragon Chalice) Lara Adrian","review":"Lara Adrian is another one of my girls that write just for me.

Infectious pop melodies,smooth sweet vocals, along with riffs that'll be stuck in yr head for weeks. Has a lot of what the Donnas missed: vocals on this are better, the rock anthems aren't as corny, and it's at a good speed. By far, the two top tracks are 'Rediscover Fire' and 'Pay Attention to Me'. It doesn't take a while to get into it, it happens immediately. VERY dancable...you'll be clapping along on the first listen.

I had told my 25 year-old coworker about this movie and he said, \\"Cold War? What's that??\\" It's a very fascinating movie on many levels. There are two or three other movies in this series, but this is the place to start.Grace and peace,Jeffrey"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Worth Watching Documentary of Earth's Most Feared Weapons","review":"As many customors rate it (obviously), this is a very fascinating film. 'Trinity and Beyond' is a worth watching documentary of Earth's most feared weapons: the atomic bombs, and the more destructive hydrogen bombs. Whether you love world history, or have interest to the nuclear weapons, or just want to fill some excitement in your living room, this is a film to watch.The documentary describes numerous kinds of nuclear bombs and displays the haunting, spectacular ignitions. Forget the special effects from fictional movies; these are genuine explosions which would loom the world. As an avid lover of classical and orchestral music, the cryptic, powerful background music composed by William Stromberg gives a perfect flow to the terrifying footages, some not ever released by public before.Overall, a very great film. Worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Documentary...","review":"HiI just finished looking at this and what a great documentary for those who are interested in atomic testing and from where it all begins.As far as the quality of the pictures its great BUT like all older movies that they remake in blu-ray it doesn't compare to the new blu-ray movies like tranformer,live free die hard,etc...The movie quality of this movie is a bit like my blu-ray Total Recall movie.So don't expect to be too perfect and you have to realize that most of the footage in this movie is from the 50's,60's,etc..NOT 2010. But i am glad i bought this and why not buy it in blu-ray since i just got one for xmas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it.","review":"This DVD has poor production quality, with very little content worth watching. Borrow it from your local library to see for yourself. People giving good reviews are probably related to the seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful, but totally dubious as documentary","review":"I suppose most everyone will spot the bad taste that screams off the cover and choose to look past it if they are still curious. William Shatner's narration is adequate, I suppose, but the music, while technically accomplished would be more appropriate for fiction- some sort of awful action movie. The \\"documentary\\" consists of an obvious, superficial history with no intellectual or analytical distinction. Most bothersome is my suspicion that some of the footage has been colorized (black and white frames digitally duotoned, for instance) and accentuated (increased saturation, etc.). Make no mistake- the footage looks fabulous, and the film is an almost irresistable purchase. But don't expect it to tell you much, and don't trust its integrity."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh.","review":"If you're interested in seeing a bunch of bombs exploding and a chronology of the evolution of nuclear warheads, this movie is the one for you. Personally, I felt like i wanted more information. what did they ACTUALLY learn about radioactivity, it's effects on life, it's staying power, how it disperses through the atmosphere? what were some false assumptions they had while developing these weapons and how did their understanding change? There are so many interesting questions around nuclear weapons, I felt disappointed this movie just focused exclusively on, \\"then they developed a 45 kiloton bomb and this is what it looked like blowing up. then they developed a 10 megaton bomb and this is what it looked like blowing up.\\" etc. etc. It got tiresome by the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY","review":"If you watch the History Channel, Discovery Channel, et al, you won't find anything of substance in this movie that you haven't seen on the aforementioned channels. I bought this solely for it's alleged \\"recently declassifed footage\\" and was grossly disappointed. \\"Recently declassifed\\"? When? 1950? Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"This is a great movie. If you like atomic bombs....then you will love this movie. I have bought other a-bomb movies and none compare to this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Atomic weapons review","review":"This DVD is all about atomic bombs. Throughout the movie Atom and Hydrogen bombs are shown at the moment and pictorially what the expplosions look like as they go off. It is very fascinating if you enjoy seeing large detonations of bombs going off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good movie","review":"If you like a historical a moral view on the testing and delvelopment of the hydrogen/atomic bomb this is your movie. I personaly enjoyed this film and will wacth it until the tape breaks. END"},{"rating":"2","title":"Baker shot rules!!!!!!!","review":"I enjoyed this documentary, though I hesitated to give it 5 stars purely based on the subject matter. Nope, not the worlds biggest fan of nukes. But it has some amazing footage and information, if not a few silly sound effects..(Goats making goat sounds while being vaporized, kinda...funny?) Shatner gives a good narrative as well.Some of the blasts look like ameobas forming or something. Lots to see here that you haven't seen before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never forget","review":"This is a great movie to watch and remember where we came from, and where we hope we will never return.Nuclear weapons are not just big bombs, they have a major impact which goes beyond the initial blast.While it's interesting to watch the size of the weapons get bigger and bigger, the movie barely touches on the repercussions of detonanting nuclear weapons even in a test. There was little acknowledgement of radiation disease, the after-effects of the bombing on Japan, nor the current lasting effects of the USA bombing it's own territories for nuclear testing.A nice sub-sub-title might be \\"5000 explosions and a supernova\\" (to steal a title from Arthur).If you have a surround-sound system, make sure to crank up the bass. The soundtrack is dramatic, too.But just remember, these are REAL weapons which still exist today, and not all are accounted for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heck yes!!!!","review":"I would just like to start off by saying that this is BY FAR the best documentary I have ever seen and probably ever will see. I ordered the DVD (You should too!!) right after I saw it. One thing to remember...no matter how much of an A-bomb maniac you might be, no matter the dozens of documentaries you've seen, YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THIS FOOTAGE. One and only declassified images and videos from dozens of nuclear research and detonations. The score mixes seemlessly with the images to take your breath away at the sight of the huge, towering, yet beautiful behemoth of the mushroom cloud. Includes surface, underground, low atmospheric, undersea, and high altitude detonations, including the one that disrupted radio communications for 8 hours and damaged electrical circuits with it's Electromagnetic Pulse. This film is not too scientific for ANYONE!! Buy it, watch it, and memorize it, but for heavens sake, learn from it too!! Don't ever forget it!! But then again, you won't want to!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"timo filme e excelente trilha sonora!","review":"Eu adorei o filme, pois adoro a história e a fora das bombas atmicas. Porém, no dei 5 estrelas porque o filme se demora muito na entrevista com o criador da bomba-H e no mostra tantas exploses como eu esperava. Mas a trilha sonora merece 10 estrelas! É excelente! Imperdível para quem é fascinado com a \\"arma do armagedom\\"!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Exciting","review":"I thought that the movie was very interesting. The narration by William Shatner only added to the excitement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry and impossible to read","review":"It is more like a monologue than a well-organized textbook. The author spent way too many pages in glory details of ER modeling and EER modeling. You might think that it can serve as a good reference book. Wrong! It is impossible to follow the logic (or lack of) of the authors. They would go pages of plain text without and summary, highlights, or bullet points. In some of the figures the authors intentionally planted several errors (without marking them), and you'd stare at the figure for sometime and get confused, and need to go the tedious explanation to see what is going on. Who in the right mind would write a textbook like that?As for the non-traditional divergences brought up by another reviewer, this is a textbook that is supposed to be about standardized and well-accepted modeling and designs so you can communicate with others, why do you ever want to learn some non-traditional divergences that only the authors use?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Grey Ghost","review":"I gave this as a gift to a very avid reader of John Mosby. I have traveled the area extensively where Mosby's Confederacy was located and now actually marked as such. This book gives great historical insight into Mosby's Confederacy and the his operations during the war. A must read for Mosby fans! You are going to enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"what will computers be able to do?","review":"What imagination! What will computers be capable of in the future? What ethical questions will there be? I enjoyed the freshness of these short films - and the wonderings that they inspired."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joey is so Adorable and the others are hot too!","review":"This is GREAT vid. featuring all the guys and a few fans but more of the guys than the fans WHICH IS WHAT I WANTED TO SEE!

This is a high voltage CD. Two tracks are absolutely stunning: \\"Fallin' high\\" & \\"Rise\\". The 7 minute \\"Rise\\" is mind boggling; it is amazing how this track manages to sustain the high energy without slipping into the run of the mill \\"Thump Ding Thump Ding\\" tone.The CD deserves the maximum, but some of the tracks have vocals and are annoying. I am referring to the \\"All the people in the world track\\". I guess the duo are better of playing their drums and not spoling it with annoying vocals.Watch out for the bonus \\"Played-A-Live\\" track, it is soothing track and goes to show their diverse talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get screwed by this CD","review":"My complaint is simple: I heard the Safri Duo song \\"Rise\\" on Sirius.

If you are a REAL animal lover, you will appreciate how Ms. Brown gets inside her pets' heads. This series of books could only be written by someone who has spent a lot of time around animals of all types.This specific addition to the series is not the best as far as the mystery aspect of the story, but I no longer read these books strictly for the mystery. It is still a great light read that continues the story of the denizens of Crozet, VA, human and animal alike. Ms. Brown's humor and story-telling ability continue in this book. I can't wait to get my hands on the next book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Glorymongering for rednecks.","review":"I read Brown to get a belly laugh. That is about all her mysteries are good for. The rest of her books I never bother with simply because they aren't worth the effort. It is nice to see that Brown has finally gotten around to having some Blacks as characters.

It is however harder to find so we decided to get the subscription from Amazon. Unfortunately a couple of the packs were old and tasteless.

That was not the case, in my non-expert opinion. The \\"variety pack\\" comes with four different blends. The \\"Java blend\\" tastes OK. The \\"Colombian blend\\" tastes like a regular French-roast type of coffee: slightly bitter and burnt. The \\"Brazilian blend\\" is the smoothest of the three. I haven't tried the \\"Kenyan blend\\" yet. I was rather disappointed with the taste of these coffees, as I am used to buy whole bean coffee from different regions. Also, why market a \\"blend\\"? If Colombian, Brazilian or Kenyan coffee is supposed to be good, why blend it with an undisclosed variety?

The entire case is made of plastic and the back doesn't even match the front; it's black rather than the silver-colored plastic that covers the rest of the clock.

It's quite ok, but I hate the cheap plastic casing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Description is misleading","review":"The info on this Seiko clock describes it as having a \\"metallic case\\".

The case is NOT METAL."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent little alarm clock","review":"This is an excellent,attractive, well-functioning little alarm clock. You just have to read the instructions so that you know to set the alarm by turning the dial counter-clockwise, etc. The sound of the alarm is a little funky, but not shrill or disturbing. It wakes me up and motivates me to shut it off! I like the clock, happy to have purchased it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately it can't tell time","review":"I ordered this clock because I really wanted one where the alarm at first would go off softly, and became gradually louder, as I often wake up with a migraine. This clock doesn't do that, the initial alarm is loud and annoying. But worst of all, it can't tell time. The alarm went off 40 minutes early! I then tested it by resetting it to different wake up times and it went off anywhere from 20 to 40 minutes early. Ridiculous. Also, it does look cheap, black and faux silver plastic. I thought I was getting old time Seiko quality, but this clock is just another cheap thing made in China; more expensive than it should be because of the Seiko name.

The 1901 version can be found elsewhere. I have been looking for the 1914 version for years, but it has been held captive by BFI.

However, I find that his effort was lacking. What we have here are 44 short vingnettes about what could be very interesting characters. And there lies the problem: Short. We only get bits and pieces on each subject, not enough to make us really care to any great extent. I do believe the subject matter is here for a truly great novel of Americana which would tie all these Adirondackers together through their love of survivinging in this harsh land. Instead, what we have are stories you might hear in any bar, donut shop, or back stoop.

His research seems to extend as far as watching others play, scanning advertising materials and frequenting the game stores with a notebook in hand.The author gets the names of games wrong (_The Adventure of Zelda?_), and a section accusing the game _Dragon Warrior_ of sexism is especially embarrassing. He complains that the back of the game box does not name the Princess that you have to rescue. If he had bothered to OPEN the box, then he would have found her name displayed very prominently in the instructions.He does not even stop to consider the fact that most (all?) of the games mentioned in his book come from Japan, a country with a different set of cultural assumptions than his.This book is _very_ poorly researched."},{"rating":"2","title":"An attractive addition to personal art library","review":"Super illustrations of inticing work.

Final word: DONT WASTE YOUR TIME!."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Grinder","review":"Were it not for the price I would give it 5 stars. $120 to $150 would be a good fair price for this unit. This mill does a great job of grinding. No powder, no heat, just great coffee. Some may say it's a little noisy but trust me, there are far worse. The glass receiver, the heavy-duty construction, the ease of cleaning and adjusting, it all makes for a top-notch product. I like to measure the beans and grind only what I am going to use so I run the unit until it is completely empty then use all the grounds for my pot. This way I can use different beans every day without having to empty and clean the unit. It works great.

While the KitchenAid doesn't seem to grind quite as fine (which it might do, but I haven't actually tried to fine-tune the grinding mechanism yet) and while it takes up a bit more space on the counter top, it is MUCH quieter, MUCH faster, and MUCH easier to use!

Looking closer it appears that the gray coating cracked in a million places but they clear-coated it anyway. The clear coat is smooth but it looks forever like its scratched all over. But I didn't buy it for its looks, so I gave it a try. It ran for maybe a total of 5 minutes over a couple of days then just STOPPED!!! Its as if it were unplugged. Completely dead. I paid a bunch to try and get a strong, quality item. I waited two months.

We were looking at 1, finding a company that would stand behind it's product, 2, find a company that would be around/easy to find when it was time to replace the blades and 3, ease of cleaning the equipment. We are very pleased with the KitchenAid. Right out of the box, it looks and feels good. It is heavy and does not have that plastic feel to it. It is all metal and glass. They say that is part of the reason that there is less static. I don't know why there is, but I can tell you there certaintly is. The grind is actually fluffier when it comes out from the blades. The machine is easy to operate. The only negative we have noticed, and would certainly never keep us from getting another one, is it seems to be a wee bit noiser than the Maestro. we are completely satisfied with the purchase. We highly recommend this to fellow coffee lovers. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An outstanding coffee grinder","review":"Burr-ground coffee tastes better. This is one magnificent gleaming bull of a grinder. Espresso may be a delight but it's over too soon for me, so I can't pronounce on the fine end, but the Kitchenaid's coarse settings yield French press coffee without mud; one click finer feeds my moka pot (Bialetti Moka Express 6-Cup Stovetop Percolatorwhich fills one mug); the mid to fine range produces perfect drip in a plastic cone (e.g.Manual Drip Coffee Filter Cone). Other Kitchenaid small electrics have given me good service for a generation.

She shares several selections with the playlists of performers such as Vanessa Mae and Escala, but with her own style (and piano) - just amazing.Some have commented on the huge variation in musical style. While (thankfully) I find no trace of hip-hop (as one reviewer noted), the track selection is all over the place - variations on classical composers as well as modern movie soundtracks and some stuff in-between. To me, this variety makes the album more interesting - I see it as a Good Thing.I didn't care much for the drum machine in Track 6 - Moonlight Sonata (is this the hip-hop that the other reviewer mentioned?).

I liked the book very much. Character development is excellent. The reasons I gave the book a 4 rather than a five is for the following reasons:One, I know this is not a romance novel. So I did not expect that many love scenes. However, I felt that the loves scenes that did come up wasn't well thought out and surely deserved more than 5 or 6 sentences.There are few other things I want to mention that did not sit well with me regarding the cars vs. wagons, etc. I don't have the book close now to include excerpts.However, Black Gold was an excellent read, and highly recommend it if you love good writing and story telling. This isn't a romance novel. I thought I would warn the romance fans. Serious readers please dare to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breath taking!

The one thing they did let me have for a treat was Honees honey filled drops. I still remember the wrapper with the honeycomb and honeybees on it that we would often find at the local drug store. As the years went by, I stopped seeing them and will randomly get nostalgic and look for it at candy stores that carries some of the childhood products but no luck. I even tried ones sold by honey companies at the farmer's market but it never tasted the same. So 25 years later, imagine my excitement when I just randomly typed in honey candy since I was too young to remember the brand and up popped Honees which vaguely sounded familiar. After reading the reviews and seeing the video,I knew I was finally getting reunited with my childhood sweet treat. Thank you Amazon for the best reunion.

I can only imagine how great they are to soothe a sore throat, too. When I saw them on Amazon, I bought the entire pack of 24.

I did find enough in this book to purchase it. This book has many good ideas, and would help many families get started on home schooling. I'm not a christian and so I just skip the bible study parts, or substitute with appropriate moral lessons or stories.What I like is the suggested reading; my children and I are always reading together, and the more suggestions for reading the better.This book was originally spiral bound - I recently saw an old spiral bound copy at a book fair, but I purchased the newer version, and will put it in a 3-ring binder. (I had a 3 year old remove a book from a spiral binding once - ug what a mess).My best advice to parents starting out is read all you can from the library, and then purchase only what you think you will use!! -- be prepared to resell most of it, and don't be afraid to ditch it all and start over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different versions different bindings","review":"I just wanted to let others know that the picture above shows the 1988 version which IS spiral-bound.

When I was getting my Ph.D. degree in human anatomy, all of my class professors warned the students to never buy or read this textbook. I took their advice and didn't read the book when I was in college. A few weeks ago, I was reading some of these reviews saying how bad the book was and decided to purchase my own copy. I just wanted to see if the rumors were true. They are true! DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An absolute disgrace","review":"This book is an excresence. Nowhere is there any evidence of the liberal application of an editor's red ink. I suspect even the authors do not understand their topic; there is no other explanation as to why the subject is so dense and poorly presented. Topics and concepts are introduced without explanation, and nowhere is any information integrated.

The actual color of the flowers on the plates is more of a muted lime green. Not quite the color I wanted, but not ugly enough to return the set.On the plus side, every single piece arrived intact, no cracks or breaks anywhere. The plates are lightweight but don't feel fragile. I'm not wild about the square bowls (they're white with a lime green ring around the top) because I think they look kind of cheap.

Shortly after finally getting the replacement we noticed the boiler insert has a similar split. Aarg. My husband said something about overworked and under annealed stainless. Here's hoping it doesn't split further.As for functionality, it works. Why the double boiler insert is so much smaller than the pot baffles me though.

I just don't quite get the pricing on this, its $153 for this with only seasons 1 and 2, if you just buy seasons 1 and 2 seperatly on blu-ray, it only comes to only $89, so you'd be paying $64 extra just to buy them together in this \\"Franchise Collection\\". I mean really, you could even add in season 3 and STILL be cheaper than this. It makes even less sense to me that the prices I used to figure this out were all shipped and sold by amazon. Anyway, if you're thinking of buying Heroes on blu-ray, I would highly recommend it, Heroes is awesome and blu-ray is awesome quality.

The problem, however, was that the shoddy craftsmanship used to construct the parts was not correctly measured. In a word, the pieces did not fit together or even come close. Out of desperation (it was a gift) I even tried using \\"krazy glue\\" to assist the poorly measured angles into place, but it was not enough to bridge the gaps between the frame, and certainly would represent a fire hazard, should my recipient tried to hang it on the wall with tealights lit.

In fact the show has very much regressed. Fans aren't complaining because Family Guy is changing or evolving, we are complaining because the writing is poor and repeated. Family Guy now seems targeted to a typical 15 year old male audience. Volume 10 in particular had some of the least appealing episodes to me. And the only character growth we see is Lois becoming a horrible person. I use to see Lois as a matriarch of a dysfunctional family, but now she is mean and cruel for no real reason.

Rather than \\"an American housewife\\" in Havana, it should be touted as \\"a capitalist consumer\\" in Havana. Tattlin's view is one of privilege and naveté, which would have been okay had the book been creative, informative or engaging. Sadly, it was full of complaints, misunderstandings and an unnecessary over-protectiveness. As an American who also lived in Cuba, Tattlin is the type of person I dreaded there the most, the modern day colonialist.It makes me wonders who \\"Tattlin\\" knew in the publishing world to get a book deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stretching It.....","review":"I have been to Cuba many, many times and Tattlin's book caught me rolling my eyes a bit. She tends to stretch the truth to make the book more interesting, or rather, she gives an unrepresentative portrayal of Havana. Life in Cuba may not be mansions and BMW's, but if you want to see real poverty take a trip over to Haiti, the DR, etc. etc......the difference between Cuba and the rest of Latin America is that in Cuba even the rich white foreign people have to struggle. The books shows a lack of perspective and frequently is pompous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleech!","review":"Truly is what it says it is: An American housewife whines about not getting fresh whatever daily from the servants. She could visit the south side of Chicago and whine, sans servants. Her Martha Stewart sensibilities are out of place in a poor country struggling with social issues, quite successfully, I would add, despite North America's stupid blockade.Needless to say, this book was an aggravation and disrespectful of another place and culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't stay interested","review":"Just a day-to-day account that got to be a little boring.

Would it be a collection of mundane observations about the deprivations of life in Cuba as recorded by a pampered American? However, I was immediately captivated not only by the characters and situations the author describes, but by the skill with which she records them. Tattlin is a *good* writer with a sharp eye for detail, a disdain for the unnecessary word, and a voice that is sympathetic but never sentimental. I enjoyed this book from beginning to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I read the first 30 pages of this memoir and put it down I was so bored. I know I can't give a fair review but I was so struck by a memoir that manages to convey no personal feelings or reactions. Cuba seems like a fascinating country and such a mystery. While the author's descriptions of, for example, the bizarre contents of the local grocery store actually were interesting, I wanted more than just a straight description. Not just the facts but the emotions and colors and general vibe of the country and how it FELT to live there.

Janis has a fun sense of humor with her workout which makes her enjoyable to watch while working out. Also,her background credentials are reflected as she constantly reminds you how to correctly do a move. I definitely recommend this workout to all levels. The gloves provide a tougher workout for the intermediate to advance clients."},{"rating":"2","title":"Workout hits all those problem areas","review":"Get problems with saddle bags, flubber buns, and all the other unfortunate problems like them? This work out if used consistantly will take all that away. I used it for the first time and my buns are sore but that's how I know when something works really well. This is my third Saffell dvd and it's seems to be the best one so far. Only thing is after the warm up she says it's time to put your gloves on then 2 seconds later everone had the gloves on and the work out starts so you have to pause the dvd so you can put yours on. That's my only complaint.Janis your amazing!!I'd also recommend Hardcore Kickbox Circuit w/Guillermo Gomez.Guillermo, your awesome!

It is very challenging if you focus on technique; if it's not hard, then you're probably not doing it right! I like Saffell's instruction style and personality, and she has a good sense of when to push it more and when enough is enough. I usually get bored with a video after a couple of run throughs, but I can see myself using this at LEAST once a week.

For starters, unless you are using the camera in bright (and I mean solar-flare bright) light, you probably won't even get a recognizable image. Most of the time what you will see on your screen is a black and red mess moving at approximately 2 fps. Two frames every second is obviously way too slow for any kind of video, and the optics in this camera make it unsuitable even for still snapshots.I originally purchased this cam because it was one of those free-after-rebate deals, but even the sales tax I had to pay was too much for this piece of junk.If you want a usable webcam, buy a Logitech."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazed this made it to market","review":"Well, the quality of the picture from IBM's line of PC cameras is decent enough, but the software that comes with it has all sorts of problems. There's a high probability you'll have to get updated software/drivers and serviceability instructions. The video drivers are very finicky; your own system setup (OS release, patches and software installed), number and type of other USB devices installed all contribute to possibilities of the software and camera not working together. Also, I don't know if this is typical for webcams, but there's a good 1/2 second to second delay between live action and what's show on the computer. This may or may not be important for your purposes.

This camera, is the worst I have ever owned or seen in use. When I could get the buggy program and drivers it came with to work, the image quality stunk. I would not recommend this product to anybody, it's a waste of time and money. Stick to a more reputable company like Logitech."},{"rating":"1","title":"tried & returned!","review":"Video quality of this camera was extremely poor, no matter what lighting situation was tried. If you make a movement, you will see it seconds later instead seeing it as you are moving. Constant attempts for the camera to focus seem to be the problem--even trying to sit very still it did the same thing. Still photos looked better than a couple of other pc cameras I have tried, but only if you held your breath and absolutely DID NOT MOVE while taking picture. Have tried 3 other cameras in this price range, this has the worst video quality--extremely jittery and annoying, sort of like the old home movies we had in the 60's. Much better video performance can be had for same $$ or less. No trouble with installation, though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Xirlink is a horrible company","review":"The camera is OK at best due to poor software.

The manual focus doesn't add focus to anything, and it is difficult to get the light exactly right for the camera to work well.

Xirlink Tech Support was of no help whatsoever - they don't even answer their phone (you have to call long distance and leave a message)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible... don't waste your money!","review":"This camera is terrible. The manual focus does not work at all. Under normal light, the picture quality is acceptable, but really poor under low light. The software included is extremely poor, and the technical support from Xirlink (the maker of the camera) is worse. I tried using the camera on both Win98 and Mac, the Win98 driver works but I had to download a 3rd-party software for the capturing to work. On the Mac side, the driver provided is from 1996(!) - what a joke.For the money, you're better off getting the Logitech or the Kensington for a little more. This camera will only give you big headaches."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality and unstable - I'm getting rid of mine!","review":"I plugged the IBM camera into my USB port and installed the software, and...I could not get an image to appear on the screen. After a couple of hours of trouble-shooting I discovered that this camera is not compatible with all USB ports, so you have to use a different driver which doesn't work as well. Choppy, low-quality video. I strongly discourage anyone from buying this product. FYI, this is not an IBM designed/produced product - they simply put their logo on a no name brand which they clearly should have researched more."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can get something better for less money","review":"To put it bluntly: This camera is awful.

Their styles match each other perfectly and when one verse is finished it's hard to wait for the next one. And on top of that the production is great and the beats as tight as you can imagine. Street Military is rolling with MJG ( of Eightball & MJG) now so you can tell there's something special about this group.

He never mentioned in the entire book anything about throwing knives or more egzodick knives such as parrying dagger with moving parts. Infact he never mentioned a simple dager or dirk.

As I watched, I thought, these actors could have made a better movie if the director had given them broad story sketches and allowed them to improvise dialogue and action. What I saw was unnatural dialogue, action, and re-action. This movie stinks.My experience with Film Movement is that their films are hit and miss.

But then the director(some hollywood hotshot)tries to be classic with a piece of cinematography in a gun fight scene-Slow motion views in silence with only the sound of the bullets' impact and the victims...\\"AH\\" After this stupid and not called for piece of film I took little interest in the rest of the pathetic little film.

After seeing Fight Club, American Beauty, and Man on the Moon, I was ready for some inventive filmaking. I love Spike Jonze's work, but the plotline was so horribly weak. I found myself wanting to get up and walk out. It was such a done once.. done again movie. This movie brought relatively nothing new to the table (including the \\"black hole sun\\" shot of the three main characters after they steal the gold). Good compilation, great premise, but very poor execution. Try making me think next time.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unnecessary bad language and violence","review":"The opening 30 minutes has unnecessary bad language, gratuitious violence that does not contribute to the story. Dim view of military personnel behavior. The bad language continues throughout the film but after the first 30 or so minutes, the story line kicks in and it gets more watchable - still B grade stuff though. I'm putting the disk on the auction block."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great ideas, poor execution","review":"There is much that is both right and wrong with this film. It's extremely funny, well acted, and has some very intelligent things to say about war and its effects on people on both sides-- during the first half of the movie. But midway through it loses track of what it wanted to be, or maybe didn't ever know at all. What starts as a condemnation of gung-ho Rambo warhawk mentality then turns into exactly that: a gung-ho Rambo action movie with people outrunning bullets and explosions and knocking down choppers with explosive-laced footballs. But you're not supposed to notice this is happening because the characters are doing it for \\"good\\" reasons, and are supposed to laugh as the \\"bad guys\\" die by the dozens. The intelligence and wit and irony built up at the start all goes up in a big explosion, and then gets wrapped up in an all too convenient, simple conclusion-- a tragic waste of an inherently complex, interesting premise."},{"rating":"1","title":"What kind of movie is it?

It did not have near the entertaining value of Kelly's Heroes. I did not see any talent in the script or the actors. I believe that George Clooney surrounds himself with no name and no talent actors in most of his movies because he is afraid that good actors may show how little talent he has. The redeeming factor is that a neighbor loaned the movie to me, therefore saving me wasting money to buy it. I gave it two stars out of pity.

From its sterotypical portrayal of middle easterners to the predictable one-dimensional main characters, it fails as a comedy because it isn't funny enough. But that must mean that it was a drama.

I think that somewhere in my inner mind I thought it might get better as it went on. I was very wrong. This movie could have lasted 5 hours and that still wouldn't be enough time to recoup from it's horrible movie writing. Like so many movies people wasted their time on, this one has a popular actor in it. \\"George keep your day job on ER or please be more selective with the projects you take on.\\" If your just in to people in the movie and you are a die hard Clooney fan buy it!

I was at first rather excited to see this movie based on the previews. After about an hour or so into the movie wondering when it was going to pick up, I knew I was in for trouble. This movie had no redeeming qualities. Bad plot, anti-climatic ending, bad sfx, so-so acting, and it was too long. Maybe it wasn't too long, but it felt like it. If you're a fan of clooney watch E.R. reruns. If you're a fan of Wahlberg buy Fear--that was a great movie. If your a fan of Ice Cube then you've already seen Friday---but watch it again. PASS ON THIS MOVIE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snubbed.","review":"Maybe the best film I saw in 1999. The cinematography is far superior that of American Beauty's. This is a complex story and a good one at that. It makes you question not only the Gulf War, but all American wars. All I can say if that if you like good movies, you'll like this one. Spike Jonze is a personal favorite of mine, so that weighs into my descision."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Simply amazing.

This is where George Clooney really comes into his own in acting. I saw this in the theaters and thought how could George and Ice Cube make a movie work? Such an odd pairing really made this movie stand out though. A great mix of seriousness and a little bit of comedy mixed in. Spike Jonez was also a great actor in the moive. The movie really gives the view of actually what it was like in the gulf war. This is definitly a DVD to have in your connection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even the CNN coverage wasnt this much fun!","review":"Coming on like a gulf war \\"Kelly's Heroes,\\" this movie is enormous fun. The ever-watchable George Clooney is on fine form with strong support from the likeable Ice Cube and Whalberg. Events take place shortly after the end of open hostilities and in an atmosphere of mild chaos. Some great action is interwoven with cool dialogue from the rather reluctant soldiers and clever camera effects (check out the bullet wound sequence!) The movie never really taxes the grey matter and the sudden moral awakening of the main characters at the end is a little hard to swallow, but don't look to deep and this is a great rollercoaster of a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Off-beat/Quirky/Action-packed/and suprisingly touching","review":"This is a movie that has it all. Great cinematography, Great writing, and a great cast that really has its act together. This movie was funny, Spike Jonze in particular is hilarious as the oblivious, ignorant, soldier. The effects and pictuesque desert of Arizona(where the movie was shot) are great. This movie is just plain great, and also suprisingly touching at the end, the dialogue is witty and well crafted that you don't even realize the attachment you have to the charachters. Go out and buy this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"huh? an action movie with a fantastic message? believe it!","review":"Ok... I'll admit it... I refused to see this movie in the theaters... I saw the preview, the stars, and just figured it was just another cheesy action movie. Boy am I glad I gave this movie a second chance. It ad some really cool action sequences, but at the same time had some incredible social commentary about the gulf war. This is not a movie to be missed, it is written very well, directed very well, acted very well, and has a great visual style. Alot of the desert shots have the color bled out, given the picture a very washed out look, very cool. Give 3 Kings a chance, it's not an everyday action movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"wanna be everything","review":"Three kings is that kind of movie that has ambitions to be everything. A realistic war-epos, a fun comedy and a \\"condemn the US government\\" work. It failes totally in with every ambition. The movie starts with a funny and comic dialogue and ends with a sentimental \\"10 years later\\" review. You ends up as a big questionmark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Propoganda","review":"The fact that war has many different points of view is a moot point. Why, then, make ANOTHER movie about it? Full of innocuous pontification and one-dimensional characterization, this movie is as annoying as the original coverage of the war was back in 1991. The only puprose of this movie is for a very liberal Hollywood to take shots at a very conservative era that hasn't been dragged through the mud yet. Right or left, there's nothing worse than a propoganda movie and this one stinks of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"In two words this movie is intended to be an anti Bush satire.","review":"The whole point of the movie is anti-Iraq War and anti-Bush. Oh and some gratuitous lust--that was another part. It was so on the nose with the anti-Bush rhetoric and bias that I laughed out loud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it me?","review":"I realize my tastes are different than the average film goer but this is bizarre. This movie is horrid. It has no plot development. The special effects are juvinile and unrealistic. The acting was phoned in. The theme is cliche. Worse of all....and believe me I tried to see past this......is the right wing -America is great -Sadam is Hitler - blak blah blah....this is a propaganda film supporting our war on Iraq; thats the sad part that no one ever mentions that when they write about this horrible movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"Even though this movie had good actors in it, I would not recommend it. I especially was turned off by the language and I'm sorry to say this ended up in my trash and this was a first for me to do that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flawed DVD? No Center Channel in 5.1","review":"I thought the movie was so-so, maybe worth renting but not worth buying..however, I just could not get a center channel on the Dolby Surround 5.1.

I had to watch the movie in regular stereo w/o effects..maybe that made me enjoy it less considering the potential for surround sound in a war movie taking you live to the battle field!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Were there two different scripts?","review":"The first few scenes had me rolling in the aisles. Then, the movie turned so dark and depressing that I kept thinking that I was somehow watching a different movie with a similar plot and the same actors. I'm not against a dark ending (I thought \\"7\\" was great), but felt that the dramatic switch from lighthearted comedy to depressing social commentary broke the promise that a good story makes to its audience. Whoever wrote this movie needs to learn a lot about plot cohesion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Things Kings of Yuck","review":"I was so bored at this movie. I bought it to see what George Clooney was like. He cannot act. He's in unfamiliar territory in this movie, trying hard. I have friends at work that act better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dramatically Overrated....","review":"This movie has all the ingredients to be a Great movie (good actors, great plot, interesting story line)... but it FAILS TO DELIVER. The inaccurate portrayal of the American GI's makes them look very inept and childish (unfairly so), the editing is very poor (slow motion scenes are over done and the COLORS? ), and the plot quickly bogs down in the over done political over tones regarding the reason for the Gulf War. The actors do a very good job, but it's not enough. I very much wanted to like this movie, but it left me very disappointed. Do yourself a favor, RENT the movie before you buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Sorriest Movies I've Seen","review":"Can Hollywood ever get a war right? \\"Three Kings\\" has reduced my expectation that it possibly could. The opening scenes are about as ridiculous as I've ever seen--taking any sane person's suspension of disbelief into the realm of viewer apathy--why waste your time? It's not entertaining and there is no grounding in reality whatsoever. There is a GREAT series out by the BBC if you can ever find it, covering the lives of a British motorized infantry company in the Bosnian war. I watched two episodes and I was transfixed. Don't waste your time on this--try to find the BBC series if you're interested in substance and in learning what modern war is like in the process."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uneven and trivial","review":"This film didn't know what it wanted to be: a social commentary, a drama, an action adventure, or a comedy. Because of its lack of focus, it does none of the above, and actually becomes a bit of a bore. Mark Wahlberg does a fine job with a pathetic script, but the rest of the actors barely earn their pay. Nora Dunn is mildly amusing as the Christiane Amanpour character. Skip it, there's a lot better things to do with your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uhh...bad plot.","review":"...A movie about awol american soldiers who decide to go after iraqi gold before returning home after the gulf war. A taxing inner struggle between aiding the civilians of an enemy nation and taking the gold makes for an impressively parched storyline. 115 minutes grows tortuously long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch, my ears!","review":"I have been a military wife for 8 years and I have never heard such language in my life. I asked my husband if soldiers really talked like that on deployment and he answered an emphatic no. Of course there are the usual swear words, but the way these soldiers acted is expressly against any military code no matter what branch of the service you may be in. I thought this movie was demeaning as well as impossible. It was a total loser flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very ordinary...","review":"This was a critically lauded film, so when I went in, I had high expectations. Roger Ebert himself called it a masterpiece. I saw it, and it was certainly interesting, but I immediately forgot about it right after I left the theater. There really isn't much depth here. It's more reminiscent of getting a quick rush from something, then after it wears off, you don't even remember how you felt afterwards. I remember a scene where a cow is blown up, but other than that, it's hard for me to remember anything about it. It ultimately was very ordinary, and not a really deep film about war."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the biggest letdowns of 1999.......","review":"I had wanted to see Three Kings ever since I saw the trailer at the cinemas, and I was very angry when I missed it. When it eventually came on video, I was highly disappointed. The story movies way to fast, and the way it was filmed was boring, ugly and hard to watch. And the really disappointing thing was, such a great cast, and a good director, but a failure film. The cast is brilliant, but there performances make them look like they are playing Barbie dolls, not heroes. If you want a big disappointment, and a torture, see Three Kings. Otherwise...."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's all the fuss about?","review":"I saw this on the big screen about 2 months ago. I disliked it then and I dislike it now. In all honesty, I felt that it tried very hard to be everything you expect from an action movie and failed. The fighting scenes were too violent for a 'comedy', which is what it seemed to be lacking. What is true about it is that it can't be catergorised for the simple fact that there's just too much going on and none of it is good enough to sustain real interest. It's a guy's film. My boyfriend loved it, I didn't, and that just about sums it up. For all you movie fans out there, your time and money would be better spent on such new masterpieces as 'The Matrix'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"This is a good movie that starts out as an adventure and slowly changes into a morality movie.

For starters I didnt really want to see George Clooney in the first 10 minutes of the movie having sex with some reporter. Now I will be emotionally scarred for life. Secondly its alot of fun! Going through an ultra realistic depiction of the Gulf War... Until... Things start to get serious.Suddenly the movie switches gears and the team wants to go out on a mission from god to save people being threatended by Saddam Hussein. Members on the team are killed and one gets captured and tortured. I didnt pay my money at the theater for a drama, but thats what this turns into halfway through. Lots of crying and deep religious and spiritual issues are faced which I dont really care for since I have enough drama and religious issues I face in real life. If this movie had kept on its free quest full of adventure, humor, danger and excitement I wouldve loved this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps my favorite movie","review":"There is no movie that I recommend to friends more than Three Kings.

The acting is of extremely poor quality. The story plot is non-existent. The movie is about three U.S Marshals who intend to steal a large sum of gold. The surprising and very unrealistic thing about this story is that the three marshals get past top Iraqi security then into an underground lair full of armsmen without a sing bullet being fired. They even steal the gold from the iraqis in front of them with only two shots fired between at least two dozen men.To cut it short this movie is PATHETIC.

This movie is hilarious, thought provoking, and harrowing in its presentation of what the gulf war must of have being like, in a thinking, action, caper type film that grabs you from the first frame to the last. It is a pity if OSCAR does not honor this film. From my readings, the general consence of most critic put this film in their top ten. Many place it as one of their top three, citing its irrevelant wit, outstanding performances and visual experimentation. Maybe the OSCAR voters will have as much insight and name it their best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Your Typical War Epic","review":"For an odd cinematic experience, watch Saving Private Ryan and then Three Kings.

If you like to see depicted what happens to your internal organs when your shot - it's for you. Can we expect later some snuff scenes \\"for authenticity\\"? The supposedly important woman reporter cried when she saw birds covered with oil - but thought nothing of bodies lying all around her. The story is incoherent.

And I'll agree, it was somewhat entertaining. Some of the cinematography tricks are pretty neat, but that's the only thing I found appealing about the movie. It just seemed to brush lightly on the major touch elements to the movie. It has a political agenda underneath which, while is a good message, appears heavy-handed in the end. It is OK, but by now means the best of '99. Save your money to get Fight Club. Now that is definitely the best of '99."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Paragon of War Movies","review":"I personally think that this movie is the paragon of the war movie pedistal and that is on VHS. This Movie on DVD yeilds the best color technology and the best sound technology and when you add a killer plot to that you have the perfect veiwing experience. I suggest this DVD for anyone looking for a breathtaking viewing experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good fun all round","review":"Three Kings is set on the end of the Gulf War about four soldier (yes, four not three) looking for 23 million Dollars worth of gold from one of Saddam's bunkers. The movie is fast moving with action right from the start and loads of humour thrown in; the scene with the cow at the beginning will have you in stitches. The action sequences are all handled well with a lot of smart camera work to keep the audience entertain. If your are looking for a war film similar to the likes of Saving Private Ryan or The Thin Red Line then you are on the wrong path. It is a much more lighter war film than those but it does have it's own morality about the Gulf War thrown in. Overall it's quite good, it won't win any Oscars but it's fast, funny and entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three Kings DVD","review":"I have seen this movie and have it only on Tape and wanted it on DVD this did arrive on the day that it was promised and in excellent shape."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brother, could you spare a lime?","review":"Three Kings is a shining example of why children shouldn't play with matches. This movie is a filmed book report. Tagline: \\"A world with pedestrian themes just got windier!\\" Three Kings is a movie modeled on the tradition of using a simple adventure story to guide the viewer on an odyssey of discovery and symbolism. Unfortunately, film school wasn't quite the primer needed for these fellas to make a good war picture. Bob Hope's cigarette case has seen more fire than these kids! Since when did snowboarding qualify a person as war-weary? Did the lift break? Everybody wants everything too fast--especially movie directors. Note to Hollywood: youth is NOT as good as it gets."},{"rating":"1","title":"complete rubbish","review":"please don't waste your money on this film it is terrible. Comparisons to M*A*S*H are quite frankly insulting. As for saying this is a realistic \\"war\\" movie, can someone please tell me where the \\"war\\" part is. To me it is more a poor attempt at a heist movie than a classic war movie. The director also got too carried away with his tricks, which leaves you with a haphazard, dizzying movie which will make you sob at the loss of your $20. Youv'e been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY? Why did I watch the whole thing?","review":"I have see many movies in my time and have like, loved and hated them. This one is 100% on my hate list. I just can't believe I watched the entire movie. I think that somewhere in my inner mind I thought it might get better as it went on. I was very wrong. This movie could have lasted 5 hours and that still wouldn't be enough time to recoup from it's horrible movie writing. Like so many movies people wasted their time on, this one has a popular actor in it. \\"George keep your day job on ER or please be more selective with the projects you take on.\\" If your just in to people staring in the movies you watch and you are a die hard Clooney fan buy it! You can watch him and try and talk yourself into liking the movie. If your a serious movie watcher and don't have time to spare on bad movies, STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A travesty of the Middle East","review":"To describe Three Kings as absurdly comic is to describe a war as such. This film is filled with an excess of gratuitous violence and unnatural foul language. While greed & cruelty may be rampant in the region, Three Kings is simply absurd. At best, it is nerve wracking entertainment and does (handsome) George Clooney's reputation no favors whatsoever. Any Indiana Jones episode would run circles around this thin and preposterous plot. I would rate this \\"B\\" movie a miss on all fronts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah, right","review":"Yeah, this is the best war movie ever...if you've never seen Gallipoli or Paths of Glory or Kelly's Heroes, which it was apparently stolen from along with the Kuwati gold. The fact that so many people \\"looooove\\" this film is sort of a sad comment on the MTV generation that doesn't know what's come before and can only sit though a film that sifts scenes as often as an eighteen wheeler heading up a hill. And for a film that is supposed to be important, it sure treats war, death and destruction frivolusly, then tacks on a studio ending so we're supposed to feel good about greedy soldiers who desert their unit to make some money. At the very least the movie should have examined why they were driven by greed. I guess the director was more interested in cool shots than a good script. Yeah, it's the best film of '99, as long as you don't count every other film that was made."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've Seen Better Film On Teeth!","review":"This film had me in tears......from boredom!

This movies was a complete waste of their talent and time.

To me the Movie was a very disappointing film. If our military was as chaotic as this movie portrays it to be, we are lucky we won the war. Now to make people mad, maybe this is how reservist units behaved in the rear, but I saw no such stupidity on the real battle front, during or after the war. Had a good plot ruined by foolishness. I am trying to sell my copy, just to be rid of it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking","review":"If you have the ability to seperate yourself from reality for over two and a half hours then this is the movie for you. The story line a good idea, but to compare it to Kelly's Heroes....c'mon. Ice Cube, Mark Whalberg and even George Cloony can not compare to Clint Eastwood and Donald Sutherland. The idea of three guys in the Gulf War walking into one of Sadam's bunkers filled with gold and waltzing out again is a bit overboard, then they feel they have to help the refugees get to the border. Only after that do the Iraqis feel they need to be stopped. It was laughable. The movie gave me a headache, the story line was jumbled and never really made any sense. If you think you are going to see a shoot'em up action movie, your wrong, if you think you are going to see a funny twist on the gulf war, wrong, the only thing here is a weak story line compounded by an even weaker cast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reviews are wrong","review":"Three Kings has some action, but is not like many reviewers make it sound. I rented the video because I had heard good things about it and how much other people enjoyed it. This movie was not very entertaining. The only thing it did was make me not want to go to Iraq even more. I do give it credit for showing how the life of people in Iraq is. The only thing this movie did was bore me, and make me relize I had better things to do with my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The real thing","review":"Ostensibly a humorous action movie, \\"Three Kings\\" is actually a savvy and sophisticated exploration of what exactly was happening during Operation Desert Storm. For those who haven't yet figured it out, the alleged liberation of a formerly and presently undemocratic fiefdom was somewhat less important than re-stabilizing the entire region in order to safeguard the continued flow of cheap oil to the West. While most of us hopefully don't need a movie to help us out with this, it's nonetheless very refreshing to see such issues even being addressed within the medium of mainstream entertainment. Hats off to director David Russell for confronting us with the disgusting realities of this woefully under-examined war."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, fiercely intelligent adventure drama.","review":"BY EVERY RIGHT AND STANDARD A BRAVE AND TRUE AMERICAN CLASSIC!

Three Kings uses very unconventional cinematography, much like Fight Club (another excellent, if rough, movie). Quick cuts, slow-motion, and a washed-out colour palette are some of what Russell uses. Yet underneath this lies a very human story worth watching. I went into the theather expecting a typical war movie and came out satisfied and dare I say touched. I have not yet viewed the DVD version, but I can only hope the DVD transfer is crisp and clean. With the effort put into the extras (commentary, trailers, behind-the-scenes, etc.), I expect the video and audio quality to be excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising good!","review":"I had serious doubts (not being a \\"war\\" film buff.

And the use of music was interesting. A very unique movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not live up to its promise IMHO","review":"Basically, did not live up to its promise. I think the plot would have been much, much better served by just setting this in 1400s Europe, doing the massive amount of scholarship associated with the then necessary historical implications, and stretching it out to 700 pages or so. Real people, places, and precursor plot points could all have been picked and tweaked to achieve a real and powerful effect. Maybe the pure analogue *could* have worked, but it didn't. As it is it just seemed like a knockoff of an imaginary book (the one based solidly in history) - and I am not saying do away with the dweomers, werewolves, etc, incorporate that stuff. I would say do away with the clumsy church conspiracy and do away with the CS Lewis style reveal (probably). Also, there is some controversy/shenanigans perhaps in regards to publisher intervention.

Rux's post-apocalyptic tale/myth is really at its core a journey of self-discovery told in a prose style that's poetic, at times dense, really heady, yet absolutely lyrical, even mesmerizing. If, like me, you are a reader who is dazzled by the simple beauty of words, Rux is the wordsmith for you: it is as if he labored over ever single sentence, agonizing until he found the precise sequence of words all to a positively mellifluous effect. This potpourri of greek mythology, urban reality and verbal gymnastics is a difficult but thoroughly enjoyable read. Half the fun is figuring out what is real and what is imagined."},{"rating":"2","title":"cool game.","review":"This game was quite hard for me! I don't understand how to get the doggie!!

As a consequence it is impossible to tighten the tilt head all the way, and so your camera will flop around atop this monopod. The heavier your apparatus, the worse the problem will be.It's hard to see how this obvious defect got past the manufacturer. I've had this monopod for several years and made several unsuccessful attempts to fix the problem. Ultimately I simply super-glued the ball to the tilt head, which defeated the tilt feature (that never worked anyway), but at least it allowed for some functionality.I came here to see if Vanguard was still selling this piece of junk when I went back online to buy an add-on tilt head. Think I'll go with the Manfrotto 234. I could just get a whole new monopod, but I really want a good tilt head, and this appears to be the only way to be sure I'll get what I want--as long as the superglue holds (it will)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful","review":"This is a very well recorded CD by two excellent pianists.

At the end of the day, most of us realize that we can't ever know enough to judge what is \\"right\\" or \\"wrong\\"; we can only bumble along doing our best and live with the guilt that our lack of certainty brings.I think Singer just never grew up.

When the unit arrived, I assembled it and tested it out. To my dismay the pump was surging and would not deliver solid pressure. I tried different water taps and verified the tips were clean. After taking the washer to a dealer, I had to wait 5 months to get a new pump in. During that time Karcher would not honor my warranty because I did not have a sales receipt. After I explained I got this through an awards clearing house and had the original shipping slip, they would still not honor my warranty claim.So, the point is:1. Washer was broken out of the box.2. Karcher tech support sucks (online only)3. Ordering parts is a nightmare (most retailers listed on Karcher's web site have dropped the Karcher line all together)4. Abysmal customer serviceHopefully now I can find a Sears pressure washer that uses the same engine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy Pressure Washer","review":"I bought the G2600PH 2 years ago - used it 4 or 5 times (total of 3 hours). I was using the washer when it just stopped working. Brought it to an authorized service center and was told that the pump SEIZED. The total for repairs would be $375.00 (more than I paid for the washer new). Karcher customer service SUCKS! I put in 7 phone calls and 3 emails - NADA, not even a response.

I have used the washer less than 10 times in a little over 2 years. The wand broke in the middle where the trigger assembly and the lance portion connect. I contacted Karcher and never did get to speak to a human. I finally got the parts from an aftermarket seller of Karcher parts. I received the new wand assembly and installed it. I used the washer for approx. 20 minutes and the engine seized. I figure it cost me a little more than $30.00 per use.

California defines biodegradable to mean \\"a material which generally will decompose when it is disposed within one year through natural processes into a nontoxic condition, as defined\\".

Instead of a straight line perforation, now it's curved so that it's extremely hard to tear off a new bag without ripping a hole in the next one. Even when I try to tear a bag at the perforation carefully, the bag rips, causing me to go through several bags before I get to one without a hole in it.

What a terrible design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Small, Too Hard to Tear","review":"I primarily got these bags due to price.I have two problems with these bags;I train and work with German Shepherds who can leave some larger waist. I find I sometimes have to use two for one disposal, particularly if I want to tie a knot in the top. I find myself having to pack twice as many on trips.The second problem is I find I have to be very careful when tearing off a bag. They do not tear strait across. The way they are perforated, they tend to tear along one side, and will take the side of the next bag with it. This makes the next bag a two sided piece of plastic.May be OK for small dogs, but I still have a problem with how they tear off the roll."},{"rating":"1","title":"The New Design is Tearable (get it?) - DON\\"T BUY","review":"I received a new \\"improved\\" kind of bag instead of the ones pictured. Instead of a perforated edge that is straight across, the new design has a curved perforated edge that turns into the handles, there by \\"saving\\" 10% or 20% of the material. Even in a lit room, following the long curved perforation is difficult and results in torn bags. Can you imagine using these on a dark night? And the reason I bought these is because they are (used to be) bigger than many of the cheap knockoffs. Not anymore.-1 point for tearing-1 point for smaller-1 point for the picture not matching the product-2 points for the text that makes an advantage out of using 20% less material.Sigh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please bring back the previous design!","review":"It's a bag designed to hold poop, how bad can it be?? Well, we've tried a lot and this one was our preferred brand. We have bought this brand for years - in bulk - so we don't reorder that often. Unfortunately, since the last order, the design has changed and these are no longer functional. First, they are difficult to tear because they are curved at the top and bottom to form \\"handles.\\" If you tear too quickly, it rips and you put a hole in the bag rendering it useless. Second, the opening is much smaller and it's harder to fit your hand. Third, the bags are shorter, leaving more of your hand exposed to, well, you know what. Finally, the part that holds the poop is a smaller teardrop shaped bag, which is fairly small so it's hard to fit your hand all the way in without ripping it. It also holds less requiring the use of a second bag. We want the old bag back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor quality","review":"These bags are very poorly constructed.

But it seems like the quality is getting worse and worse. My 2nd to last batch had bags that didn't have an opening. The were perforated and tore apart nicely but none of the bags had an opening on either end. I had to use scissors to cut an end open. I thought \\"fine, probably was a bad batch that passed quality control.\\" My last batch was worse. 4 out of 5 bags slit apart. Not because the bag are \\"weaker\\" and \\"thinner\\" but they seem to be CUT vertically. I open the bags and it splits right down the middle vertically with a perfectly cut edge. This make 4 out of 5 bags completely useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bags with Tears in Them? Yuck!","review":"I don't think these bags are of very high quality.

I decided to try these to save some money, as they were about $16 for 315 bags. Big mistake. The bags are much smaller (a little too small for comfort with my 45lb dog) than the bags in the 120 bag packs. More importantly, about 25%-50% of the bags per roll were ripped in the middle/side of the bag, which made the bags useless. I would sometimes go through three or four bags in the roll until I found one intact. I will be sticking with the original 120 pack blue bags from now on.On the marketing aspect, a few of the reviewers complained about misleading advertising about biodegradability of the bags. However, at least the bags I got a month ago made no such claims about being biodegradable on the packaging.

I walk our dogs (2 Shar-pei's - 45 and 55 lbs) every day and have actually NEVER had a failure of a bag. These bags are large enough to be able to pick up 4 poops with a large hand inside as I have done many times - (usually 2 per day). I heartily recommend these bags for durability, reliability and size - What more is there? I trust them and will continue to use them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bags are now smaller on the 120ct!","review":"I have been purchasing the 120ct Bags-on-Board for a while now and have always been satisfied. They rarely rip, perforations tear well, opens well, etc. etc.But, when I purchased the 120ct bags a couple of weeks ago, I found that they shortened the bag significantly and am having trouble tying a knot on the bag! I have 2 small dogs (about 10-15lbs) and use 1 bag for each, so I am not stressing the limits of this product.I don't know if they are trying to cut corners by making the bag smaller, or just are having temporary issues with quality control. Either way, I DO NOT recommend this product until they correct this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid Redesign!","review":"Why did this company try to fix what wasn't broken?? This was a good product before they decided to redesign it. Now there's more 'handle' to the bag than there is area to hold the poop. And the plastic is thinner and very flimsy. The seams don't hold up either. I will not buy these bags again and I've been using them for years. Thankfully there are alternatives that are biodegradable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice concept but poor quality","review":"I ordered these bags a few months ago and have been meaning to post a review. After looking at the pictures on this page, I totally didn’t get this style bag. I ended up getting bags that were in the shape of a mitt, fitting your hand in perfectly when picking up after your dog, \\"new shape w/ 20% less material\\". I thought that was a great idea until every other bag was ripped and not usable. This was very frustrating and I always had to make sure I brought several with me knowing I’d have to go through some to find one without a rip in it. Great concept, but they need to be made a lot stronger so they don’t rip when you are separating the bag from the roll. Going back to the biodegradable bags from Downtown Pet Supply, I've never run into a bad bag with that product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Warned: Horrible 'New' Design!!","review":"I would give these bags ZERO STARS if I could!The design of these bags has changed and NOT for the better. Now each bag is tough to separate from the roll because the join is curved and poorly perforated. As the bag's length is partly a handle now, each bag is WAY smaller (okay if you've got a tiny dog)! It's easy to ruin the bag you are removing as well as the next bag. Really hard to do in a hurry or at night too!They are supposed to be saving on plastic, which sounds like a great idea, but this is a lousy design. BE WARNED!We will be avoiding this bag in the future. What a pity we got a pantry pack!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful - used to be good - not now","review":"We have 4 dogs and I foster dogs all the time. This was the only bag I would ever use - no holes, did not rip easily. They changed them to be less plastic (which is a great concept). But they are now thinner and have curves which don't separate easily. I now waste 1-2 bags per roll and I bought the box - ick! I will not buy these again - they are a waste of time and money and now worse than other comparable bags."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, bad re-design of a once fantastic product","review":"These bags used to be great! The perforation between each bag used to be well-defined, so it was easy to tear off a bag, and you'd never have problems tearing the bag itself.Not anymore - the bags have been redesigned for the worse - the perforation is very shoddy now, which makes it very easy to tear the bag itself apart.This product WAS easy and convenient to use. This is no longer the case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT ORDER","review":"The bags have changed. They are no longer rectangular but now oddly shapen and pretty much useless with a curved edge that makes them hard to tear apart and hard to use and leaves straggling \\"handles\\" sticking out the dispenser.

When we ordered them it didn't say it was a new design and it still doesnt' so we are not sure about reordering them. The photo is not what our box is. We thought we would give them a try and not return. However, with the curved shape it is harder to tear off and I don't even use the container anymore because its so hard to do. You can't even tear them right every time without ripping a hole into another bag. It's so hard to fit your hand into each bag and our dogs are small. So we won't buy these bags again these are terrible. What a pain."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHANGED PRODUCT issues 20% less material. Tearing/Handles. Shorter Bags.

I wish I knew of this new design before purchasing this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE Redesign","review":"The new design of these bags is terrible. I lose two bags by ripping them trying to get them off the roll for every one that I successfully rip off.

Bags on Board must want to save some money, because the new design of these bags make them WAY smaller than the normal size, making it very difficult to pick up poop if you have a bigger dog. It's hard to explain, but basically the top side and bottom side curve in, so the plastic part is about half the size than the middle, so it takes some work to pick up the poop without it getting on your hands.

The pictures are few and the written pages are not many. I read the whole book in a couple of hours. I was disappointed because I like to read and I was expecting many days in company of the Boss and his comments about his songs.I dont see much sense in printing the lyrics of Bobby Jean (to put an example) first with Bruce's own handwriting in a full page, and then the same lyrics type written on the next page... and so on, album after album. Only some brief notes by The Boss at the beginning of each album. So you better go and buy a book about the Boss that can actually be READ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the Boss-This book not worth it.","review":"I am a huge Bruce Springsteen fan and a struggling songwriter so when I saw that there was a book written by Bruce himself about his feelings during the writing of his wonderful songs, I knew I had to buy it right away. The book is very thick but 90% of it is reprints of ALL of his lyrics with like one or two pages telling about what he was thinking during the conception of each album. If you skip over reading the numerous pages of lyrics, you'll be done reading this book in ten minutes! Bruce...you've brought us so much joy with your music but this book was very misleading and disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book damaged, return policy perfect","review":"The book I ordered was second hand. This was not mentioned very well on the Amazon site; I really thought the book was new. It also turned out that the book was delivered by a third party, not being Amazon.com. That also was not mentioned very well on the site. So I was very disappointed when the book arrived! Fortunately, the return poliscy was perfect! I got my money back very fast. So my lesson was to look better when ordering a product at Amazon.com."},{"rating":"2","title":"I just spent 75 bucks on Bruce--and it was worth every penny","review":"A beautiful, wonderful, absolutely worthy accompaniment to the new boxed set, this book combines the complete lyrics to all Springsteen's albums (so THAT'S what he was saying in \\"Kitty's Back\\") with lots of great, intimate photos and--best of all--commentary by the Boss on each and every album, as well as looks at the development of the lyrics to selected songs. Seems to me that, what with the big 5-0 coming up and all, Bruce wanted to do some serious looking back over the first 25 years, and what better way to do just that than with the fascinating boxed set and this book? I just hope the next 25 are even better."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product royally screwed me over","review":"I actually bought this lock de-icer at a gas station. I have an '06 Focus and the door locks tend to freeze in the winter. I bought a bottle of this de-icer to carry with me in case I can't get in my car. Last night we had an ice storm and all my door locks were frozen. I attempted to use this de-icer and there was no pressure, so it wouldn't spray. You could hear the liquid, but it doesn't spray.

Was a great help for me, a BI consultant and 'occasional' salesperson of my own services.I was surprised not finding reviews on this book here so far.

I expected something along those lines: exciting, conspiratorial, and action filled. No. This was the worst combination of gratuitous sex, midnight talk show and \\"psychic\\" reading of the crystal ball I have ever had the misfortune to pick up. The grammar was atrocious, and spelling was horrible all the way through. I forced myself to finish it (for the sake of reviewing it, if nothing else) and found the ending to be as climactic as a TV special on watching grass grow. Don't waste your time or money on this. I don't know if it was being set up for a sequel, but just let this program rest in the black files like it should.Sidenote: I've just finished another book by the same author, The Children's Hour. An excellent book, a brilliant read. I didn't care for this book, but the author is really quite talented. I strongly recommend trying one of Mr. Clegg's other works!"},{"rating":"2","title":"another good one from Doug Clegg","review":"Julie Hutchinson's husband \\"Hut\\" has been murdered, and she is having trouble recovering from his death. She believes that he visits her at night while she is sleeping. She also begins to fit together fragments of his life that were unknown to her while he was alive, and they fit together into a rather strange whole --- including evidence that Hut was part of a secret project when he was a child that tested psychic abilities in children.AFTERLIFE was a page-turner and a good, fast read. It was well-written and suspenseful and has some great twists and turns. The book seemed quite different from other Clegg works that I have read. There were some creepy moments, but the book didn't really seem likea mega-horror book to me. But don't let that stop you from reading it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can The Dead Walk? Talk?","review":"Julie Hutchinson's world takes a nosedive when she is informed that her husband has been murdered. As she tries to deal with the horrific event, she slowly comes to realize that there are many parts of her husband's past that have been kept secret from her.Julie tries to uncover the truth of her husband's past. While doing so she begins having erotic dreams about him. Her daughter thinks she can talk to him. Her mother puts her in contact with a TV psychic. She contacts her husband's ex who is in an asylum. Eventually she begins to doubt reality. The whole story culminates in a dramatic conclusion that can give readers shivers.This is a very interesting although a little slow to build at first. The histories of psychic studies, open and covert, tie into Julie's dilemmas. It was refreshing to find an ending that was not obvious right from the start. A fine book from a talented author (although a little shorter than previous works)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be a movie","review":"Oh my gosh, this book should be made into a movie. You seldom find a great scary movie anymore, well this book would make a great one! It would be in the money with The Sixth Sense and Signs etc. I wish I had discovered Douglas Clegg earlier. I started with Dean Koontz and have everything he wrote, but am finding it hard to find these older ones of Clegg's. I got it from the library. This book is so exciting all the way to the last page. I found myself reading faster and faster as the excitement grew. Do yourself a favor, try to read this before it is gone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clegg at his best","review":"This is a relatively short book and seemed to appear without any great publicity (unlike his more recent Priest Of Blood and Mordred). However, as good as all his books are, this, in my opinion, is Douglas Clegg writing at his best. The story of a wife whose husband is murdered is engrossing from the start. Mix into this the well-written journey of her gradual break down, the fact that her husband was not who she thought he was and, for that matter, neither was the murder, and you have an excellent story told by an excellent storyteller. The twists and turns will keep you guessing right until the end. I highly recommend this book, both to Douglas Clegg fans and those who have never read anything by this very talented author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good book!","review":"I really dislike giving bad reviews but this book needs some. It started out pretty good & I remained fairly interested for about 2/3 of it, but then it went nowhere fast! The protagonist was just plain irritating: whining about everything. It had some great reviews, in the book, by some authors I respect a lot - some of my favorites. This time they were wrong. I have never read a book by Mr. Clegg before, maybe I will try one more before deciding \\"never again!\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"AFTERLIFE","review":"I had high hopes for this book after reading the reviews. Very disappointing. I nearly stopped reading it several times but still hoped that there would be more to this book than graphic sex and psycho babble. The ending was incredibly lame and I still can't figure out where the 'horror' and 'thriller' parts were supposed to be. This was one boring book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitious Babble Leads to Lousy Ending","review":"I was eager to get into this book, my first Clegg. The story started fast and then slowly fizzled out to nothing but repetitive psycho babble, an unbelievably weak protagonist, PG sex scenes and a lost storyline. I ignored the typos and amateurish formatting, thinking the story would get better. It didn't. The ending was nothing short of ridiculous. Did Mr. Clegg grow weary of this novel and say to himself, \\"Oh, I've got a great idea for this one; let's overuse deus ex machina and leave the readers scratching their heads muttering, \\"What the ...?\\" My own fault, really. I usually read a sampling of reviews - the good, the bad and the indifferent before deciding to buy. I didn't on this one, sold as I was on the description and sample read. I won't make that mistake again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This is one of those books that you think about long after you have finished reading. I was taking every available moment to read it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite","review":"Out of a dozen, or so books that I have read from Douglas Clegg, this was my least favorite. Not a fan of the main character, and the story just didn't do it for me. If you want to read some other really good Clegg, check out the criminally insane series, The children's hour, Attraction, Halloween Man, etc..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not stretching...","review":"I wanted a good stretching video to work out tight muscles, as I've just started an intense cardio/strength program and need the stretching afterward. This video is actually yoga, and not the relaxing kind.There are a few relaxing poses, but also things like downward dog, and other moves that require you to be extremely flexible and strong already (walking your feet to your hands on the floor, bending knees all the way beneath you, etc). Some of the movements can be intense. I'm very disappointed, simply because the title/description doesn't accurately portray what you get.Nothing against yoga, but if you're selling a yoga dvd, then title it appropriately. If you name your dvd 'stretching,' I actually expect stretching, not active yoga!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grandson's favorite","review":"I know nothing about this, or other new Star War characters, but this figure was in my grandson's top favorite 5 list.

I paid 12.00 for the tiny bottle. I was so excited to try it out as my 10 year old's goggles were fogging up almost immediately after he put them on, my 12 year old's were fogging up only once in a while. I have tried this solution on their goggles probably 8 times now and not once have they become \\"anti-fog\\". My 12 year old has had less fog issues, but they still fog up.

When McClintock denied Keller access to her letters and notebooks, Keller chose to rely on McClintock's recollections. Consequently, we learn how McClintock wanted others to see her, and perhaps how she wanted to see herself, but not the truth. McClintock is portrayed as a genius struggling against a world too stupid to appreciate her brilliance, but the existence of transposition was never in serious doubt; it was McClintock's theory of genetic control that was controversial, and later discarded as incorrect. For a better understanding of McClintock's work and its reception, read The Tangled Field by Nathaniel Comfort, which manages to tell the real story without diminishing the scientific importance or originality of McClintock."},{"rating":"2","title":"History of science","review":"This book is a biography of geneticist Barbara McClintock. Keller is a scholar and researcher with a special interest in women scientists. In this book, she presents the life and work of Barbara McClintock. She explains the importance of McClintock's work and her incredible ability to observe of genetic variation from the physical appearance of plants. She also details the context of McClintock's work, noting the difficulties McClintock faced in pushing her research program forward in an academic world that had no room for women scientists. The book is quite interesting for bringing to light McClintock's discoveries regarding gene transposition, as well as for its description of the special challenges McClintock faced as a woman trying to work in a man's world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating figure","review":"I read this in college and recently bought it for a gift.

I read this book as part of a philosophy course interested in \\"ways of seeing.\\" We looked at this books to discuss scientific ways of seeing and the fact that McClintock saw scientific things that her colleagues didn't see. The book is very interesting, if a bit wordy, and would probably be fascinating to someone actually interested in the topic.

A lesson in living, in loving our time we spend on this earth together, forever, striving to fill space vacated by the other. As heard in our youth and still true to this date, should you look to your love and have no good to say, forgo hitting mute and letting silence rule the day, buy a Greg Godek book, and feel your love propagate!"},{"rating":"1","title":"please brotha, spare us the details","review":"I thought this was going to be a romantic guide to enhancing a relationship but all I got was the autobiography of a cheesy womanizer Mr Peck. Who objectifies women in the relationship and thinks he can win them over by annoying them with pieces of paper everyday(birthday cards, comics, i love you notes ugh) and sucking up to them and giving them roses and chocolates and the whole 9 yards. Relationships go much deeper than the superficial way it does as this book shows, it's just cashing in on what society says about love and sex anyways. Any fool off the street could write this book or even send it as attachments to their friends as a joke. This book is a joke. If you really are in need of tips, why not just grab a pen and a paper and come up with the craziest, wackiest ideas to impress someone you like or are with; cause gregory pretty much did the same thing in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over Rated","review":"I was expecting this fantastic book of great ideas on presents and dates and fun things to do with my sweetheart. Instead, it almost read like a book full of advertisements of all the things you could buy or vacations you could take. I returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very, very, very bad, indeed","review":"Amazon.com is such a pleasure to deal with. The representatives are courteous, helpful, and accomodating. I had the pleasure to experience this myself when I was returning this piece of trash. Mr. Godek came up with a dozen or two \\"o.k.\\" (but nothing extraorinary) ideas and filled up the rest of the space with quintessential garbage. My fellow Amazon customer, I wish you all the best because, like me, you are on the path to becoming a true romantic for the woman you love. That's very noble, and I couldn't respect that more. That's why I say to thee: DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY AND NERVE CELLS! This book is not the one you need. Allow me to recommend another one: \\"How to Romance the Woman You Love - The Way She Wants You To.\\" By Lucy Sanna and Kathy Miller. The ISBN is 0761508708. Good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Warning. This book is pretty big. Too big in fact. While there is some good material in this book, the majority of it seems to be lists of favorite songs, romantic movies or phone number of cruise ships. Lots of \\"romantic\\" quotes throughout but not many good ideas on how to be romantic -- isn't that what this book is supposed to be about?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I returned it!","review":"I returned it the same day. First of all it is written basically for men. It had a women's only chapter a page and a half long. It assumed that all men are into sports. And it suggests things to do like \\"Do something you hate to do that your sig other likes.\\" True Love and romance aren't compromises or sacrifices. Instead they require Understanding and thoughtfulness. Some of the ideas in this book are G for given (basic). You have to be totally out of tune with your romantic self to get help from this book. Spend the cash on a flowers and candy instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the idea's for the women????","review":"I read the book after hearing about it on a near by radio station.....

I bought them a few weeks ago from my local pet store for my 5 month old Golden Retriever. I broke one treat up into tiny pieces to use as a training treat in the morning. By lunch time my dog had terrible diarrhea. She was fine that evening, ate and drank as normal and didn't have any more diarrhea. The next morning I gave her 1/2 of a treat during our training sesson. Again at lunch time terrible diarrhea. I summated it was from the treats and threw the rest away.

I could have done better watching a TV show even if i had to endure the commercials. Everything I checked out was really poor copy.I purchased it for a gift and before it was watched and returned to me it was past Amazon's return date.

These are like the first \\"talkie\\" movies, or something. Quite odd, really. There are limited sound effects, and no music to set the \\"mood\\". (It's amazing how much difference that subtle \\"mood\\" music makes!) The stunts are cheesy, the dialog predictable and forced. And the movies are SHORT - 55 minutes on some of 'em!All that said, it *IS* John Wayne and if you know what you're getting into, for the price, these disks are a bargain."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Duke, But a lot or them have been edited","review":"I found this and jumped on it. As already stated the Lone Star movies are old and they have not been restored. [Package says Digitally remastered] The worst thing is that they have been edited. Most [not all] of the run times are from 2 to 7 minutes short. On a movie that last only 55 to 59 minutes that can change the movie. I bought this for RAINBOW VALLEY. This movie's original runtime was 52 minutes. On this DVD it runs 47 minutes.If you are trying to collect the full movie pass this by. If you don't care and want to watch some classic Duke it's a good price.Too bad they spent more on packaging it than they did on production."},{"rating":"1","title":"for the price they are still not very good,better collections are out there","review":"these collection of the duke's early movies are not the best transfers out there. they are blury and the pops and lines in the picture and sound are really bad. check out other collections and you'll find better copies."},{"rating":"2","title":"the old saturday afternoon at the movies kinda fun","review":"I am 50 plus years of age and I remember the saturday afternoons at the movies. There was always a coming attraction (for the next week for the kids),a cartoon, a chapter serial,& two features. Usually one of the features was a western. These films of Mr. Wayne bring back memories when the good guys always wore white hats and bad guys always wore black hats, drank too much, and always lost the fight with the good guys. The good guys had a romantic interest in the heroine, but no mushy stuffever happened in these films, not for young eyes who always like action and no kissing face stuff! Only comment I have wrong about this collection of horse opera is that the first two films (the Dawn Rider and the Desert Trail)have some glinches in them as though they are old copies of them but the others are good copies in this 20 pack. Worth the price of 5.00 dollars in all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awfully Bad Quality","review":"The quality of this DVD is wildly bad NOT because as one reviewer put, the film prints are some 70 years old.Those film prints are still fine. It's just terrible compression. The image is dark and blurry, you see the pixels. It's a bit like someone made DVD copies of VHS tapes. In other words, super cheap.But, hey, I suppose if you get 20 films for $5, you can't complain. And it's not like you can't make out the story. Still, it would be nice if Amazon could at least acknowledge the low quality here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gun Control & Wife Abusers' fantasies.","review":"I only saw two of these movies in the set. The first is Angel and the Bad Man. That was pretty cute basically, except the toss-away-your-weapons pacifist message - the Duke gives up guns for the Quaker girl - isn't one I agree with. The second movie was McClintock. The basic message seemed to be that women are irrational, verbally abusive nutcakes. But no problem!Just humilitate them in public, give them a hard spanking with some kind of metal instrument, (couldn't tell which kind) and they will transform into little obedient lambs. McClintock passses on his \\"paddle\\" to be used by his daughter's fiance.On the other hand, the frequently drunk, carousing husband doesnt' show any remorse or signs of changing himself.I am not going to watch the rest of the movies in this series. But if McClintock is an example of what any of the others are like, I think this dvd set should be placed in the genre of \\"Scary Stuff.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Black and white","review":"Didnt like the color print of this DVD.

The Packaging was good though."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Wayne 20 Movie Pack DVD","review":"If any of you not only enjoy the vintage Western genre,but in particular,John Wayne's start as a Western star,you will thoroughly enjoy this set of 20 movies,starring \\"The Duke\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"We were very disappointed when my husband opened the factory sealed set and discovered that only 2 of the 3 DVD's were in it. We have heard nothing from the distributor yet, after writing for a replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Do It","review":"Many of these movies were not the best quality to begin with. This set further lowers the quality by using copying from low quality prints, and (in the case of the wide-screen movies) lopping off the sides of the movie. Spend a little more and you won't be distracted from some fun movies by the quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad quality discs","review":"I bought this set, watched it once, and put it on the shelf for a year.

It not only makes a ton of noise, and I have sprayed it liberally in all areas using a quality dry lubricant made specifically for exercise equipment, but the motion is stiff and jerky no matter how much you adjust the knob. It also has a tendency to tip backwards if you happen to not have your feet all the way forward on the treads. I wish I had saved the packaging so I could return it. I also wish I had seen these latest negative reviews before I bought and not only that I paid way more just a few weeks ago than what it costs today. Just a totally disappointing experience no matter how I look at it. Shame on companies like Fitness Quest for putting such garbage out on the market and taking people's hard earned money away from them for nothing in return. I'll be taking this along on my next Goodwill run. If I had to say anything positive about this item it would be that it looks nice and you can use it barefoot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun little exercise device","review":"Got one of these off eBay. We've had no problem with noise. The whole family likes to stand on it and just pop up and down while doing other tasks.The only downside is that my youngest stood on the edge of one of the black foot pads and broke off the plastic. I think I can figure out a fix, but haven't gotten around to it yet. The family keeps using it anyway.Edited to add: was able to fix the foot pad by drilling through the pad at the old plastic post points and using a bolt and nut to secure the foot pad to the metal portion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Screaming cat","review":"Using this stepper sounds like you are stepping on a cat over and over again.

It is full of typos and the chapter material does not relate to the case studies at the end of each chapter. DO NOT BUY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly erotic","review":"This book is amazing! In my opinion, Steve Diet Goedde is the only true successor to Helmut Newton. What makes his work stand out is his intellectual and honest approach towards alternative sexuality. Unlike other photographers in the fetish world whose images rely on subject matter, Goedde's images are powerfully artistic. He replaces the explicit with an ethereal romance while retaining the sexuality of his subjects. Plus, he has a sense of the actual art of photography which is rare in the fetish mainstream. His images will stick in our collective cranium for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"fetish fans~BUY THIS BOOK!!!!!!","review":"This beautiful hardcover book is the absolute best I have found on fetish photography! It is in no way degrading or \\"pornographic.\\" It elludes to much more than is pictured, giving hints of smokey seduction (as in plates #22,50-53,and 113), playful kink (plates 125,79, 21), and good ol' bondage and foot/shoe fetish (#74,109,118,127,128). There is plenty of rubber, corsets, fishnets, cigarettes, and feline like women slinking around, not to mention the hint of Betty Page throughout. I cannot recommend this book enough.

I then began to listen to Liquid Mind (which is also quite awesome). This is my first Deuter album, but I get that he generally is relaxing and good for meditation or massage. What I absoluely LOVE about this album is that it IS relaxing but lively and engergizing. It refreshes me, not drains me. I feel SO good after listening to it. I love the recorders on this album (I am sure I have identified them right0, and how they dance together on some of the songs. I downloaded all but one song. I didn't feel that one of the songs gelled very well or flowed as well. This album will be one of my summer gems to listen to. I love it!!! I love to listen to it while I play trains with Nick or when I am in my gardne. I am plotting my next Deuter album to get...stay tuned!! I would HIGHLY recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get into this one...","review":"I have 2 CD's by this artist. I bought one for relaxation, massage, mediatation, and one to impart a bright and lively mood for the beginning of the day. This recording is OK, but not special in my opinion. The music is bright and lively, but for me, not engaging or inspired and doesn't seem to have a flow. I was looking for music I could put on in the morning as background as I started my day and find myself smiling over. I just found this mildly irritating. My other Deuter CD, \\"Wind & Mountain\\" is wonderful and perfect for all of the relaxing applications that I had in mind when I bought it. I have listened to Sun Spirit serveral times and at different times of the day, just to give it a fair listen, but I don't like it and won't be keeping it in my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is a really, really hard, but awesome work out. I just love it!! The DVD is divided into four (4) sections. First part: A good warm-up. Second part: A regular kickboxing class. Third part: Kickboxing with a step and a partner if you want to. The Fourth part: A good cool down.If you do all four (4) sections at one time, I promise you will sweat like you have never sweat before. The work out is just about 1 hr. and in that time you will work every part of your body. Janis is a great instructor, but if you have no previous kickboxing experience you may be a little confused.

Original drawings from the Le plus bel album du monde pur les industries de luxe published in Paris at the height of the Art Deco period. These are the design drawings, not pictures of the finished pieces. There is a brief publishers note, but no other commentary to put the designs in perspective.A good resource for crafts inspirations, but not a book of patterns or designs. Since these are drawings it is not always apparent what the finished piece, if it was ever created, would look like, but perhaps that is all to the better as an inspirational source.I am confused by Dover's restrictive copyright since the material is public domain, but if you are interested in copying the designs for your own projects you should have no problem.Overall a fine example of the art deco sensibility expressed in jewelry."},{"rating":"2","title":"52 Fun things to do at the beach","review":"This book has ideas in it I never even thought of!

On the down side, when baked in a loaf pan made for standard-sized bread, it does not hold together well, so I bake it in a mini-loaf pan which makes 8 small loaves. I make sandwiches by slicing the small loaf lengthwise, making 2 half sandwiches per small loaf.

Then I found this mix and I have to say I'm done searching. This is it. This gluten free bread is just delicious! Doesn't even taste like it's gluten free. It is nice and dark in color with lots of tasty seeds inside. The whole house smells great when the bread is in the oven. When it's done, I slice it and freeze it.

With the cocoa powder and sugars in there and all those grains (I did like the sunflower seeds though) it felt more like a mix between a brownie and bread... it had a strong, dark rye smell and feel to it. Not bad if that's what you're looking for but I was wanting something more middle of the road, more of a good, medium brown bread with a bit of grains in there but not with all that dark cocoa, sesame seeds and the sweet-ish, brownie quality. Bob's should re-name this mix to \\"Hearty whole-grain \\"Rye-Style\\" bread mix."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free Bread Mix","review":"I found this bread mix to be very tasty and easy to slice.

The costume information is voluminous, the illustrations are clear, and there are brief historical notes on the famed personages plus amusing anecdotes. There are also contemporary quotes on fashion and behavior.As a more knowledgeable friend warned, some of the drawings are affected by the fashions of Norris' era, and the few primary-source illustrations are black and white. Bibiographical references are sadly lacking.However, it is overall a pleasant introductory volume on Tudor clothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great resource","review":"I've used the Norris book for Medieval Costume before and I love it, and this one is that much more. In addition to plates and figures, that show the costumes in period illustrations, the book is organized by reigns, and includes sections on orders of chivalry, headdresses, hats, shoes, jewelry, and discussions of usage of every part of the costume. The biggest danger is allowing Norris to be your only source, just because it has everything. Enjoy, I have already spent several evenings just perusing the book, and I have several plans for costumes."},{"rating":"2","title":"detailed","review":"great book. detailed descriptions of clothes, accessories and court day-life related objects such as chariots.

What he could not derive from the Victorians, he just made up. In addition, his redrawings are much changed from the originals. If you want to make a halloween costume that has a medieval or renaissance \\"feel\\" to it, go ahead and purchase this book. However, if you are a historical costumer or are interested in accuracy at all, buy this book only if you want a paperweight."},{"rating":"2","title":"RenFaire Enthusiast and Costume Designer","review":"I found this book to be a superb resource for designing and constructing Tudor period clothing. I agree with other reviewers that his ramblings can be distracting at times, but the entertainment and interest value overcome the drawbacks. The accessories shown in drawings are superb resources for hair styles and equipages used by Faire Cast persons. Once you have the vision of what you want, there are other sources available to tell you the \\"how to\\", this book is primarily a vision book...and a grand one, indeed. If you are interested in Renaissance Faires as a Cast member or a member of the Needleworker's Guild then this book is well worth purchasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"would be good but.......","review":"i wanted to try these memory fit insoles but when i recieved them it was the wrong ones and i was very dissapointed"},{"rating":"1","title":"Works too well!","review":"As soon as I attached the alarm to the bracket, it activated...and began to go off.

Nothing new, nothing exciting, exhilarating...just plain boring!"},{"rating":"1","title":"MEGADENCE !!","review":"Great pop songs. Bad heavy metal. This allbum is Megadeth's Youthanasia. I hope they earn money with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened to Megadeth","review":"I couldn't believe it when Metallica did it and I cant believe its happening to Megadeth. This record is the metal turkey of '99 ands among solid realeases from Machine Head and Nine Inch Nails , this flop looks horrible. The only tracks of any worth are the two part \\"Time\\" opus and the only really heavy song \\"Prince of Darkness.\\" A great dissapoint from a band that could do much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"After the laughable disappointment that was MAchine head: the burning red, it is good to see Megadeth back with a great CD. Being a long time fan of Megadeth, I must admit, the first time I heard this I was thrown off, but after that I loved every minute of it. The songs on here totally rock, especially Wanderlust, both Time songs and Prince of darkness. This just keeps getting better and better, as any great CD does. I would have to say this is the best CD I have bought in ages. Keep up the triumphant work Megadeth!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS NOT MEGADETH!","review":"Well what happend to megadeth.

I get so sick of the same sound from a band with different artwork each time. Glad to see they're exploring their talents instead of seeing how fast they can play. Once again, everyone follows metallica. ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not Megadeth","review":"Why have you changed your style? Please, not another Metallica and their Load. Machine Head did it, Metallica did it, and now Megadeth did it. You want to sell cds, well, stay loyal to your roots. You played real music: fast, with real lyrics, and almost symphonic. But now, listening to what Jimmy De Grasso can do in the A.N.I.M.A.L. \\"Poder Latino\\" cd, and then listening what he is forced to do in Risk... I won't waste my time. Megadeth, you died for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"i am the biggest megadeth fan ever....when cw came out i was sooooo excited,my husband and i followed them all over the states on thier cw tour and were soooo excited about the new album we tried to get the lady at the music store to sell us the cd on the 30th of august,of coarse she wouldn't. i am disappointed! ihate admitting that,cause i really want to like it! i have found my self liking it more and more with each time i listen to it,but my first reaction was total disappointment! nothing like my first reation with cw or countdowwn or youthanasia or rust,etc.hoping it will \\"grow\\" on me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your money on this one.","review":"I am a huge megadeth fan. I loved every album from peace sells to cryptic writings, and i made a 3 hour drive to see them live. But im being honest when i say that this album sucks. It isnt megadeth, the soloing is nothing impressive. No more harmonies like on she-wolf. Also the production isnt nearly as good as their previous album. Listen to it before buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truman doesn't know what she is talking about!","review":"If you are a true Megadeth fan go out and buy this album and you will not be disappointed.

Megadeth has gone the way of the dollar and sold out big time with thier \\"new\\" hardly metal sound and more to the simplistic alternative route. There is only one left in the four horseman of the apacalypse that hasn't sold out, and that's Slayer. Megadeth fans, skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"megadeth risk","review":"This album was hard to swallow. I don't know where Dave Mustaine was going with this. The title alone makes no sense unless the RISK was to see how many fans you could annoy. First of all this band used to have a drummer named Nick Menza. This guy was amazing. The drum parts were so much fun to listen to. This new guy Degrasso may be a good drummer but on this album the drumming is so lame. Seriously my 10 year old nephew had the bulk of this albums drum parts down in about 3 hours no exaggeration. If you want to hear amazing music from these guys then check out Cryptic Writings,Youthanasia,Countdown to Extinction and Rust in Peace. All of these albums were done with their best line up which included Menza on drums. A note to Mustaine. Please take a look at the fact that your album was on billboard for less than 10 weeks as a sign that the bulk of your fans disliked this. We don't mind you taking risks just rememeber to make it rock like your other great albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak!","review":"Its very weak compared to anything they have put out in the past. It just doesn't pack the punch(whose album does these days...) It doesnt have bite I expected from a Megadeth album. I am still listening to it trying to like some of the songs but like LOAD and RE-LOAD I can see I'm gonna get bored with this album quick!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"I am a big Megadeth fan. I have loved them since 1985. So anyone who says a true fan has to accept what you get is an idiot! We heard the same crap when Metallica released load and the even worse re-load. Risk is a sad attempt for Dave trying to still be \\"metal\\" and yet sell even MORE records. I am all for change. Change is good. Sucking is not. This is not a musical depature this is blatant laziness and commercialism. If you are a megadeth fan, it's worth it to have just to have it. But if you plan on enjoying good music, go else where. I already got rid of my copy! True metal fans will forget Megadeth and put there faith in the new Iron Maiden album, sure to please any fan, I hope."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes Some Gettin' Use To","review":"I understand why a lot of die-hard fans don't like Risk. But let's face it, it's not 1986 anymore folks. Mustaine and Company aren't the same angry at the world guys that they were 13 years ago. People grow, and in my opinion, Megadeth has grown for the better in the last decade. There are some great songs on this disc (with the exception of Crush 'Em, which was obviously written to be played at hockey games), it just takes a while to get used to 'em and get used to the fact that it's Megadeth playing 'em. Personally, I'm glad that Megadeth is taking some risks on this disc. I would much rather see them exploring new musical territory and trying out new ideas than to here them re-releasing Rust in Peace over and over and over. Megadeth is evolving. Too bad that a lot of their fans won't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shocked!!!","review":"This isn't Megadeth!!! This album is the worse supposed-to-be-metal album!!! Dave, stop going Metallica's way!! Be yourself! This album doesn't deserve the 1 star. It deserves a big 0."},{"rating":"2","title":"The title is risk, and that is what it seems to be.","review":"Ok, so Risk is the strangest album to date by Dave & the boys. And as the title suggests, it was a risk. Somewhat of a disappointment to those of us who have been Deth fans for a long time and were expecting another Youth. But, I still love the album. You just have to separate yourself from your preconcieved notions of Megadeth.I really appreciate the strings, it reminds me of G'N'R's November Rain(Remember how good that song is?) So to appreciate the album, you cannot think of the album as Rust in Peace. Look at it for what it is, something that is either gonna make or break the band - AKA RISK."},{"rating":"1","title":"WTF?","review":"This is the biggest disapointment since MD.45!! Risk went way off, It has simularities to Cryptic Writtings but it isn't heavy enough. It doesn't even sound like Megadeth any more. Dave should have stuck to his roots!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Effert by Megadeth!","review":"weak album!No wonder it's called Risk!I took the risk of buying it and i didn't like it at all!I messed up last time on my review and gave it 5 stars!I mean't to give it 1 star!If you want real metal try slayer or pantera!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who are these people, and what have the done with Dave?","review":"I put this next to Peace Sells and Rust In Peace in my CD collection, and they kicked it's butt and threw it out on it's ear. Took it's lunch money too. It's sulking in a corner now, whining about it's feelings. Where's the low end? Where's the attitude? Where's the REAL DAVE MUSTAINE?!?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Risk in the disc","review":"I'm a metal fan, and like every metal fan it makes me happy to put my hands on new material from great bands like Megadeth. When I purchased Risk, I knew I should have expected something different, my friends had told me that much. But I've tried to set aside everything I've heard before and listened to Risk just like a Megadeth fan who had just put a new Megadeth album in his home stereo without any forethoughts. Unfortunately, I failed to get into the album, the feeling of nativity when I was listening to Megadeth simply wasn't there. There were too many synthetic sounds which were tiring to listen and they prevented me from properly listening to riffs, vocals and drums, too. The main instruments which built up Megadeth's sound during all those years were simply hidden behind a thick wall of annoying synthetic sounds. After a while, I was really tired of all that and I had to eject the CD and put Rust in Peace into the CD tray."},{"rating":"1","title":"Risk is now the worst album ever made!","review":"--1 out of 5! Just when you thought Megadeth couldn't degenerate more than they already did on Cryptic Writings, Risk is now the nadir of their career. Cryptic Writings was the worst album ever made, but now it has a twin. It's difficult to discern which is worse, but after listening to both in agony and sadness, I would have to say that Risk has now taken Craptic Writings dumpster. It's difficult to imagine a band like Megadeth, with 6 of the most dominant albums ever made(killing through youth), to degenerate to this kind of position. Anyway, if you are thinking of buying this record, do yourself a favor and don't. If you are a hardcore fan of Megadeth's first 6 albums, and you hated Cryptic Writings, as you should have, then you will also be disgusted with Risk. To all the old hardcore fans, stay true to Megadeth, and destroy Megacrap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"I will admit I don't have the remaster of this album where Dave supposedly has removed all the little Bud Prager sound effects. I am here to tell you that it doesn't matter if you remove the crap stain from crap, it is still going to be just crap. In other words this album was horrible and nothing can change that. I find no redeeming factors to this, not one song that I can pick out and say \\"well at least there this one song\\". It doesn't even really make a good pop rock album, which is what he was going after. This one can be likened to Load and Reload for all of you that love making the Metallica connection to all the Megadeth albums, only this goes much lower then those ever could. He always did out do them when it came to thrash metal, I guess he wanted to prove he could suck even worse then them too, Dave is just that kind of guy."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"RISK\\" buying it!","review":"Bought it at 12:30 pm before going to work. 1:15 pm I flung it out the window like a booger doing 75 mph on I290 to Chicago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hehe","review":"See, how they changed the words \\"Dave Elefson's guitar\\" to \\"Dave Elefson's bass\\" in the review up there? LOL I hate the new album btw. I have always loved Megadeth for their songwriting. Being a songswriter myself, I find most the songs downright insulting, especially that \\"seven\\" song !!

It sure doesnt sound like megadeth. Then Crush was on i couldnt stand it. I am use to there speed metal sound not this kind of music.

Just because it isn't pure thrash like \\"Peace Sells \\" or \\"Countdown\\" doesn't mean it isn't a good album. I'm not always in the mood for thrash..sometimes I just want something different. My fav. tracks on this are of course \\"Crush Em\\" \\"Prince of Darkness\\" & \\"Insomina\\". The guitar work on Prince of Darkness is great! It really ROCKS! I would recommend this album to any Megadeth fan.

I remember waiting in line at midnight to get countdown to extinction. When I first put countdown in my car I remember how different it sounded, but it ended kind of growing on me, but I still hoped this was not a permanent change, as long as they didn't turn glam! But it seems every album they get closer to the \\"G\\" word! I hope the fate is not sealed. I still am a fan of megadeth, but I find that Rust in Peace is already in my CD player more than Risk ( and Ive only had Risk 2 days!) Some of the songs are OK. I didnt really like Cryptic Writings that much and even that one kicks risk's ***! Anyways, be careful and listen before you buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, well, well......","review":"What happened here? I was so pumped to get this cd. This cd is a disaster. Prince of Darkness is the best song on here. That is the only reason I gave it 2 stars. I would have given it 3 stars, but Prince of Darkness is nothing but recycled MetallicA music. Has anybody ever heard of \\"one.\\" That is a great riff, but MetallicA plays it better. The verse for Prince of Darkness is a slight variation on \\"Bad Seed.\\" Again, MetallicA played it better. And don't forget, this is the best song!! Crush 'em is ok, but it is so cheesy. I mean, did they really need the lame intro? The last two songs should be one track, not 2. I kept looking for Bon Jovi printed somewhere on the cd, but I couldn't find it. If only they could have taken a real risk...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fans Afraid to Face The Truth","review":"First of all ths is a great HARD ROCK CD. Notice I didn't say Thrash or Metal Megadeth just like Metallica have moved on to more diverse music and it is a great CD with plenty for the listener to enjoy. The great Insomnia, The heavy Pnce Of Darkness, The Bluesy Seven and Wanderlust. The Amazing Time and Truly great Ecstasy which will be a rado hit.Some of these bad reviews come from fans who said Megadeh would never be like Metallica and outgrow Thrash well true hurts doesn't and w all te nasty things you said about Lars and the boys applies to or band.

We should have seen this coming though, from Countdown to Youthanasia to Cryptic Writings all signs were pointing in this direction, although none of us could have imagined this bad. Aside from Dave's voice which is always unmistakable there are no signs of early megadeth here. So if you're just getting into megadeth or thrash metal in general this album should not be a consideration, go back to Peace Sells which in my mind is Megadeth's crowning jewel."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE SAD MOMENT WHERE MEGADETH FALL.....","review":"TRUTH BE TOLD...From KILLING IS MY BUSINESS to CRYPTIC WRITINGS, MEGADETH bring only GREAT THRASH HEAVY METAL to the world...There's so many great songs...So many great albuns...but this one, Risk is trully THE SAD MOMENT WHERE MEGADETH FALL...Risk got 1 or 2 decent songs for a MEGADETH fan, but what i hear on risk can't be trully a megadeth album...People say metallica is a sell out, but this one is THE BIGGEST try of being a SELL OUT from all...some songs could easilly be found on a bon jovi or a nikelback album...I think unfortunatelly after this sad mistake, MEGADETH kind of lost their way...after risk there's 2 great ones: THE SYSTEM HAS FAILED and ENDGAME...."},{"rating":"1","title":"metalhead","review":"what a pile of crap!! can't stand nothing on this megadeth release.

If you're a Megadeth diehard fan avoid this album. If you like even the weakest metal avoid this album. Long time thrash metal fans will be disgusted by this commercial teeny bopper garbage. This is not a metal cd. This is pure rock n roll. If you like Blink 182 or anything else that mellow than purchase this. Go for Rust in Peace, Peace Sells, or Countdown to hear the band at its best. This was the ultimate slap in the face for longtime fans. Dave only did this album because he read in an interview that Lars Ulrich said Megadeth never takes any risks. Load was a risk and sucked.

Sure it is different than all of the others, but that is what makes it great. Megadeth took a different musical direction with this one and I think they greatly succeeded. The songs are more lyrically mature, so is the subject matter, and the music is more artistic. I have been a Megadeth fan for many, many years and I still feel that this is a classic Megadeth album. songs like Wanderlust, I'll Be There and Breadline are just awesome Megadeth classics. so when it comes down to it, this is just a great rock album all Megadeth fans should own."},{"rating":"1","title":"InSOM-ni-OM-ni-OM-ni-ugh","review":"The day I popped this album into my cd player, a part of me died.

Nothing but radio ready corporate rock bull$hit. Half of these songs wouldn't sound out of place on a \\"Light Rock\\" radio station next to Hoobastank and Maroon 5! In fact, I think even \\"American Idoit\\" by Green Day is heavier than this piece of cr.ap! This is more like a Megadeth album for non metalheads. Sure a 12 year old girl would probably like this radio ready pop rock ditties, but she would also probably like Avril, Green Day, and all that other cr.ap they play on the radio.

I guess whatever Metallica had to do, Dave had to follow (of course we all know they crossed over into Alternitive-rock in the mid to late 90's) yet at least Metallica had some OK songs from RE-Load, this one just plain sucks.

In fact it sounds a lot like Load and Reload by Metallica, another metal band who softened up their style in order to cash in on the alternative rock craze just a couple of years before this. I'll bet my boots Megadeth got their idea to sell out and do an alternative album from Metallica and copied them! This is a TOTAL sellout CD and I wouldn't reccomend it to ANY metalheads.

This is just plain terrible. I knew after hearing Crush em on the radio that this was gonna happen. Cryptic Writings was sorta good, but I no idea they were moving in this direction!!!

You might think as I did that you have to hear it a few more times to let it sink in. It does not matter how many times you listen to it, your still gonna feel an empty void afterwards. If your a hardcore Megadeth fan your sooner or later gonna get it no matter what anybody says so take my advice and don't expect anything from it. That might ease the pain. If you take the album for what its worth you might at least find a few tracks you like. Prince of Darkness is actually a good song. However with Prince of Darkness being the albums only redeeming quality, I think this album more than earns it one star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this?","review":"Dave has always considered MEGADETH to be the \\"number two\\" heavy metal band, coming in after METALLICA. Did they think that they could capture the throne with this? Even Load and ReLoad crush this stuff. MEGADETH will forever stay at \\"number two\\" if they didn't already drop off the chart with this. Oh yeah, did you ever notice that MEGADETH's intro to FFF on Cryptic Writings sounds alot like MOTORBREATH, even if Dave was somewhat part of the band then. I also believe that The Prince of Darkness (I think) sounds alot like METALLICA's Badseed. Listen to the riff."},{"rating":"1","title":"A RISK NOT WORTH TAKING! BUYER BEWARE.","review":"OH GOD! WHAT HAVE YOU DONE? THIS ALBUM IS TERRIBLE. I AM NOT SAYING THIS BECAUSE IT IS NOT AS HEAVY OR TECHNICAL AS PREVIOUS OUTINGS. IT IS JUST REALLY AWFUL.

YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN DAVE'S FACE WHEN THEY PLAYED BREADLINE AND CRUSH AND ONLY ONE OR TWO FANS IN THE CROWD WERE ACTUALLY ENJOYING IT. I THINK DAVE WAS CRUSHED! AT LEAST HE LEARNED HIS LESSON AND WROTE \\"KILL THE KING\\" AND \\"RETURN TO HANGER\\" FOR THE NEW ALBUM. I HAVE LISTENED TO THIS ALUBM THE FIRST DAY A FEW TIMES HOPING IT WOULD GROW ON ME, AND SINCE IT HASNT I THREW IT IN MY STASH OF WORTHLESS SH!T AND HAVENT PICKED IT UP AGAIN.

Why is it that they must copy whatever Metallica does? Metallica decided to play radio-friendly \\"metal\\", so what does Megadeth do? They put out an album of radio friendly \\"metal\\". Now, don't get me wrong, it is a decent album. \\"Crush 'Em\\" is catchy, \\"Prince of Darkness\\" shows signs of life, and \\"Wanderlust\\" is a cool tune. The songs are well written, hard rock anthems. That is the whole problem, though. They don't rock. Listen to \\"I'll Be There.\\" That song reminds me of the Friends theme song. This band is just a shadow of the band that wrote heavy music like \\"Train of Consequences\\", \\"Holy Wars...The Punishment Due\\", and \\"In My Darkest Hour.\\" Heck, they are a shadow of the band that wrote Cryptic Writings."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS CD WILL MAKE YOU SICK","review":"Anybody who liked Cryptic Writings or Load and Relaod stop reading here. Now for the real heavy metal fans, if you are not sure if you should buy this album I will give you a simple answer...DON'T. Listening to any song off this album is a waste of time.

The song 'Prince of Darkness' is ok, but why lift a guitar solo from the classic 'Holy Wars'? The lyrics are not printed inside the cd, and with good reason. They are horrible and cliched.Also- play the beginning of 'Ecstasy' and sing the words to Counting Crows 'Mr Jones'. YIKES!RISK is not a 'Megadeth' album. At least not the band I have been following for 10+ years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable!!","review":"This is the worst release of this great band. Instead of the good musicians they are, this cuts show us how big is the RISC they are taking. As well as Metallica with their Black Album 'turning point' awesome experience, Megadeth is trying to follow the same root but...I do not know...I think they are loosing their north with no turning back. Mr. Hetfield will say: Sad but true..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Like This Risk!","review":"Megadeth's RISK is nowhere near my favourite album of the year. The hard rock stuff on this album is a genre long lost and better left dead. They listened to Fleetwood Mac for inspiration for this album. We don't need decent heavy metal bands like Megadeth reviving that style of music.As a pop album it's a failure, pop music is totally different, and as a heavy metal album it is hopeless. The best song is Prince of Darkness, but is weak compared to any song on another album. Cryptic Writings was bordering on sellout, this is way over the line.I only gave this album half a star for \\"Time: The Beginning\\" and \\"Time: The End\\" together, and the other half for \\"Prince of Darkness\\".A bigger RISK Megadeth could've taken is to create a decent speed metal album like they were doing back in the early 1990's (Rust In Peace)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addicting...","review":"I have been listening to this album for the past two weeks since I bought it.

They have excuses saying that they needed to change they song style or else they wouldnt sell anymore. Well its true, they changed, and now they are going to the hole of dance music :) I belive that this album will not sell more than the soundtrack of godzilla writen in japanese language, buts thats ok, lets see if megadeth wakes up and return they good old style.DAVE WAKE UP!

I tried my hardest to get into this new Megadeth \\"listner friendly\\" sound but it's not working. This CD SUCKS... Totally weak, and unworthy of the bands namesake. I'm not sure whether or not I should chunk it or trade it in.

Feel that this is Megadeth's weakest album ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"new different megadeth style","review":"This album doesn't really sound like Megadeth. They have changed. It's still pretty good music, but the older stuff is better. I like this album, but it's no comparison to the Rust In Peace material. I think they simply grew out of the speed metal and matured. Still, Megadeth is way better than the Limp Bizkits and Kid Rocks today. Megadeth still rocks man!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't even finish it.","review":"This book was horrible. HORRIBLE! I stopped about 3/4 of the way through, completely disgusted. It centers around 2 sisters who are supposed to be each other's best friend. Throughout the whole 1st half of the book they're so sugary sweet to each other I wanted to puke. That's not how sisters usually treat each other, best friend or not. Then, since they're such best friends, one of the sisters has sex with the other sisters man as soon as she possibly can, because she was feeling left out and lonley. Pitiful excuse for a book. But of course, the man they both want happens to have a twin, and the twin is the one that the stupid sister has sex with instead of the other one. Of course.

Instead, it contains only a mish-mosh of material that was stolen from a valid tradition of wica, misinterpreted, and then put forth in a manner demeaning of each author's original tradition. Janet Farrar demonstrates huge amounts of disrespect for her original teacher, Alex Sanders. Gavin Bone shows just as much disrespect for his original tradition, Seax Wica and Raymond Buckland who founded it. The only way the title fits this book is if the word progressive means an attack on established Wiccan elders. The cheap shots at Gerald Gardner and Alex Sanders abound. But even then, accuracy is not this book's high point. Where on earth does the sun rise in the West? Despite what this book says, the answer is no where.On the high note, if you enjoy arrogance, you will love this book.

No one dares use the word seriously, because it has become a joke. but sometimes the purest bands are just your basic bands. Enter superdrags newest album. From start to finish, this album takes all the infulences john davis and the band have, and roll them into one. For exsample \\"in the warmth of a tumb\\". Explores guitar rock, as well as the snesablity of pop. \\"Lighting the way\\" Proabley one of the best rock songs superdrag have ever written has pure engery in it, and nothing less. But, one of the most beautiful and challenging songs, is unprepared. The way the paino parts are written, the vocals are out of this world.

I found it to be the perfect guide for a beginner. Of course, if you want to be a veterinarian or horse nutrition specialist, you will have to do some further reading.Downside: first quarter of the book about horse history-- BORING. Babylonians, mesopothamians, hunns, wasn't really my cup of tea. I love horses, and don't really care about their evolution from the ice ages until today.

Yes, the topics are those that should be studied, but it is too dense. Sections are too long and exercises most of the time need you to have understood all concepts in the section. It has practically no graphics (and graphics are important for understanding). Sadly, it seems more like the author is trying to impress us with his knowledge than wanting us to understand what he is exposing (it is what it seemed to me, just an opinion).I'd prefer a book with subsections and exercises for every subsection: really, if you don't do excersises frequently during the study, you (well, at least I) can't really grasp what is exposed.If you are going to teach (or to attend) a class on Analysis, I recommend \\"Elementary Topology\\", mixed with other Dover books.En conclusión, el libro es muy denso."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a good book for beginners","review":"This book is a good supplement to an introductory class on real analysis.

The book has no illustrations and makes sure that no engineer or applied physicist has use of it. This book was probably written with the intention of getting more graduate students in the Math department, who would spend endless hours solving the problems from this book and then get hooked on to analysis. If one reads the follow up of this book which is \\"Real and Complex Analysis\\" he or she would surely end in this quagmire of definitions and proofs, which has little real world significance"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not a teaching tool","review":"Beautiful, elegant proofs resulting in little or no understanding on the students part.

If you have 140 dollars,buy 3 or 4 books on real and complex analysis, you still have 100 dollars left to buy other books. I strongly recommend the book Whittaker and Watson's \\" A course of modern analysis \\", this is the real classics of the classics, think about that, the 4th edition was published in 1927, nowadays it is the best ( if not ultimate reference ) on analysis and special functions.

And while she admires Diane Warren, Diane's songwriting here would make fodder for 500 Hallmark card commercials. The sappiness goes into complete overload here. I liked \\"Call Me Gone,\\" but the rest of the album never matches up to that upbeat song. This is the only Patti album that I don't like as much--the ballads kind of drag here; there's no kind of passion in the songs. But her latest, Timeless Journey, is far, far better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened, Patti?","review":"What a pity. What a pity Patti LaBelle and MCA saw fit to release this poor offerring. This is a slap in the face to all the fans who have supported her for so many years. This is the thanks we get? I wouldn't be surprised if MCA drops her after this horrific project.When Patti is not embarrassing herself by attempting to sound hip-hip (\\"Call Me Gone\\"), she sounds uninspired on most of the cuts. No wonder this turned out to be one of the poorest selling albums of her career. The presence of Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis doesn't help matters, with their tired, out-dated production. Just listen to the samples!I love Patti but this CD is just through! It saddens me to think that Patti thought this was good enough for her fans. I strongly advise anyone who is thinking about blowing their hard-earned bucks on this CD, DON'T! You will be very disappointed. Try some of her older stuff instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patti Should Retire","review":"Yes, after this embarrassment, Patti Labelle needs to retire, quickly! The songs are sappy and when Patti is not screaming her way through the songs, she sounds just plain bored and uninspired. Not to mention this CD sold very poorly. The only people she could sell this to were her son, her minister, her best girlfriend and the 2 queens who do her hair and make-up.I was very disappointed with the quality of this CD. I sold mine immediately. I strongly advise any one who is into GOOD music, pass on this one. You will be bored to tears. This is for hard-core Labelle fans only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Call It Gone...Please!","review":"I have been a huge Patti Labelle fan for the past 20 years. Although, I must admit, Labelle has failed to make an entire album that I actually loved. \\"When A Woman Loves\\" continues that streak. I'm sorry, but this CD is B.O.R.I.N.G.! Which is really a shame. I don't know where to place to blame. Patti sounds pretty good, although she has sounded much better on previous albums. The songs are, at best, mediocore. I don't think other, far more talented vocalists like Aretha, Diana or Gladys could have done much with these songs. Okay, Patti! Just write this one off as a mistake and go back to the drawing board, please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"seeing is not believing","review":"I bought this set for my son who is crazy about firetrucks and firemen. I was really disappointed to find that the 'firetruck' pillow featured on the main picture and in the smaller details is not included. It has cost an extra $34 (including S & H) to buy this one feature which looks integral to the set. I have to agree with the other review that the material isn't as comfortable as I would hope - it's just that there are so few bedding sets around with this subject matter"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was very disappointed with this product. The only issue with these pens is that the ink flow is very poor, but that's a BIG problem for me. It bleeds around the curves in my letters making the words look sloppy. If I pause for too long I am frequently met with a glob of ink pouring out the second I put the pen to paper. I had a set of these pens a while ago and they were the BEST. Sadly, I could never find them when I went to office supply stores. I figured they'd gone out of business. Naturally, when I saw them on Amazon I was very excited and bought 2 boxes. Bad idea. Now I'm out $20 and have 24 pens that I don't have any desire to use. I would not suggest this product if you like neat and fine lettering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ideal Pen for Journaling","review":"I do a lot of journaling and write songs on paper.

I like using new writing utensils and also get easily bored with them. Then I try a new pen. I've used this pen for the past 3 years and love it - both fine and medium point. It writes very smoothly and comfortable. Only downside to it is sometimes the ink tends to run and its ends up on my hands or mini globs at the beginning of a word.Also, I ordered this from amazon.com and only received 11 of the 12 pens. No biggie but still, you should get what you paid for."},{"rating":"1","title":"comfortable but unreliable","review":"I bought a pack of of Pentel R.S.V.P. pens a few months ago, and have since thrown them all away.

Sometimes it bleeds and the ink seems to be inconsistent but it writes well and looks great. The design is lacking somewhat but that is not a big deal. The grip is comfortable but could extend a bit more so all my fingers can fit on it. Overall, it is a good pen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Occasionally leave large ink splotches, which occasionally gets onto clothing","review":"This is the second time in six months that one of these pens has left a substantial splotch on a page that ultimately got transferred to a pair of my work pants, and the ink does not wash out (I've purchased expensive cleaners to try). These pens occasionally and randomly bleed a lot of ink onto a page. Sometimes these splotches, which do not dry for minutes, get picked up inadvertently on a hand, which then may be swiped against clothing.I understand that nearly all pens will leave a small splotch that might transfer to a hand, but most pens don't leave so much that they will continue transferring to additional objects (something like a \\"second order\\" transfer). I'm done with these pens. My $70 pants can no longer be worn to work due to the extensive ink damage from these pens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"I tried four of these pens (3 fine point and 1 medium point) and with each one I had the same results. They wrote nicely for a brief time and then stopped (no ink). If I shook them repeatedly I could get them to write again but only for a short time and then the ink would stop flowing again. Ended up throwing them out, one after the other. Then went out and bought more pens (another brand)."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"This RSVP pen is my favorite pen. The pink color is vibrant, but the fine tip is far superior than the medium point. The medium point smears and is very splotchy while writing, but the fine point doesn't do that.

Remember the episode of the Brady Bunch where Peter's voice was starting to change? This sounded sort of like that, somehow the Brady's figured out a way to make it work, but this singer has not, and since I would assume he's already gone through puberty, this could be a problem for him in his music career.And when Meade Skelton is thinking of his Nicole Kidman song in the shower, I doubt that he's singing, more like planning how he will kidnap her and go all Silence Of The Lambs on her, \\"Nicole Rubs the lotion on it's skin and puts it back in the basket.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete and utter crap","review":"Wow, just.......wow.

Recorded live it contains some of the best love songs of the past and two orginal compositions. The 1st of the new songs \\"Nicole, Will You Marry Me\\" is a whimsical look at a marriage proposal as it might be sung to Nicole Kidman by one of her many male fans. The 2nd \\"I Think We Are In Love\\" is a beautiful love song and my favorite of this album.This CD is a departure from the country style of the previous CD's and shows there is another side to this talented entertainer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"I was hoping for some over the top chocolates to provide my wife as compared to the regular Godiva or Ghiradelli that can be bought at the local malls.

That took a star right away. I've owned this since June 2012, and got good service out of it for about 3 months. As a NiCad, I always charge it fully then let it discharge quite a bit (or completely) before recharging. As of January 2013, it now holds a charge for barely 2 days with minimal use. The original battery for this phone lasted over 3 years before starting to have these problems. I do not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery life","review":"I got this camera as a brithday gift. At first it was sufficient and actually lasted a while but the battery life was HORRIBLE. 2 AA batteries barely lasted one night out and I found myself constantly buying new batteries. The pictures it took were decent and I really had no complaints simply because I took ordinary shots of friends, etc. One day, the camera just stopped working all together.I'm in the market for a new camera, and I'm looking into the Canon Elph because I've heard only good things and I realized that I NEED a rechargable battery.I would never get this camera again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"This was my very first digital camera. At first I was really excited but there were many problems with this product. My biggest problems were as follows:1. The pictures were very blurry. (The pictures could only turn out decent if you had a steady hand and could not take pictures of moving objects whatsoever.)2. Even with flash, the pictures were dark and noisy.3. The battery life was horrible. This product runs on AA batteries and uses them up very quickly (especially with the flash).Overall if you want a decent camera, this is not the product for you. You will save tons of money on batteries that fuel this camera which doesn't even take decent pictures. I do not recommend this product to anyone and your money is better spent elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor picture quality","review":"My girlfriend and I have used this camera for over a year now and no matter how many setting adjustments we've made the picture never comes out right. Our problem is not with the shutter speed or the flash speed its the overall color quality of the photos. The people in our pictures are always way too dark or way too white. Only decent pictures are ones taken on sunny days. Don't bother using the camera inside or on overcast days because you'll just end up dissapointed. We're not proffessional photographers by any means but after messing around with this thing for over a year we've decided its the camera that stinks not the users. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this piece of junk","review":"I was very excited when I purchased this camera as it was very small and could fit in your pocket or purse and looked like it took really good/clear pictures. WRONG!! Its the worst camera ever. You must be completely still in order to get decent pictures that aren't blurry and you will spend the cost of the camera plus in batteries. When using the flash it will only take about 30 pictures before you have to replace the batteries. Pentax normally makes great cameras, I don't know what happened with this one.

The flash is only effective about 6 ft. away. The pixel images are blurry at best. The colors that follow are not even close to being vivid, or natural.

The tale will travel through the dark streets filled with shrieks as a stalker prowls along cutting both women's garments and flesh into the taverns where the Monster hunters gather and to the Old Bailey and the somewhat farcical trials of young Rhynwick Williams. The author keeps the story moving along at a brisk pace while yet still creating more than sufficient atmosphere for the reader almost to taste the London fog in the air while reading. In the last chapters he helpfully expands the scope of the book to give the reader a broader perspective on the case. A very entertaining and informative read to be saved especially for the history buffs when the nights grow a little longer and the wind howls just a little louder."},{"rating":"2","title":"What The Eye Reveals","review":"The book was in good shape and treated well with no writing.

Its hard to criticise Dolph for this one. The script is not very good to start with and Dolph is given very little to try and work with. The second half of this movie which suffers from badly staged action pieces, does not live up to the well staged and enjoyable first half. The plot is an obvious Under Siege rip-off.

I finished reading this book, but I found myself very reluctant to continue, which is very unusual for me when it comes to Sharyn McCrumb. My opinion is that Nora Bonesteel should appear more often in this dry novel. She has been a great character in past books, and she should be used much more often."},{"rating":"1","title":"not highly recommended","review":"This book was a bit drawn out through most of it, then cut short with the very predictable conclusion.

He manages to convey more emotion and thought in 50 pages than Sharyn McCrumb can squeeze out of 400.McCrumb has clearly done ample research for this historical \\"mystery\\" (where! ) novel, and she clearly did not want to discard a shred of the knowledge she picked up. It's all there... page after page of repetitive descriptions covering farming techniques, dressmaking, the proper way to hang a convict. McCrumb certainly could have used an editor for this book. The plot displays little progression, and the flashy juxtposition of modern and historical murders never ties together in a satisfying way. Indeed, key points in the novel are motivated by characters' intuition (and even mountain psychics!), leading me to think that the author couldn't figure out how to conclude the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something a Little Different","review":"McCrumb weaves a very interesting tale between cases 100 years apart in her usual comfortable but clever style. Almost as good as the book is Ms. McCrumb's explanation of her research into the legend who was Frankie Silver. Well done.

And I did miss Nora Bonesteel in this book who wasn't used much."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable summer read","review":"Sheriff Arrowood's obsession with the case of Frankie Silver over a century ago is interesting because of how the author connects it to a 20 year old case that the sheriff has growing doubts about.

I've enjoyed the other books in this series as well, but I think this is the best so far. The continuing characters (Nora Bonesteel and the members of the police department) are the framework McCrumb uses to tell the true story of Frankie Silver. This is not so much a \\"whodunit\\" as a \\"how-it-happened\\". Frankie's story and the parallel story of Fate Harkryder will stay in my mind a long time. Well done, Ms. McCrumb!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe people liked this book","review":"Maybe I was deceived by the blurb on the audio edition, but I thought this would be an exciting police procedural. I didn't realize that it would be a long-winded repetitive telling of an old story with scant attention given to the modern-day crimes and no police work at all. Ms. McCrumb seems to believe that 19th-century writers are able to fill a lot of space because they said the same thing again and again and again. How many times did we have to hear about how Frankie probably killed her husband? Maybe four. Then switch to the present, and the sheriff goes all over it again! How much of this can one listener take?"},{"rating":"1","title":"In all her research, she lost the heart of the story.","review":"Sharyn McCrumb spent four years of her life researching this novel and, By Jimney, she's gonna let you know it! I understand her reasoning for droning on and on about the family networks; the legal system then was the Old Boy Network to the extreme. Got it. The first time. Why did she have to keep hammering the same old nail? And what was with the Fleming/Waightstill sypnosis? Oh, oh, I get it...the rich don't hang. Okay, got it. Can we move on now? I was supremely disappointed with this novel. I feel if she had stayed on one story or the other, Silver's or Harkryder's (And don't even get me started on that redherring Trail Murders thing. I hate being teased.), it would've made a more entertaining and meaningful story. And that is what was missing from this whole, long charade: the heart of the story. She broke a cardinal rule of storytelling: she told us a story but did not show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ms. McCrumb hits incredible notes in this \\"Ballad\\"","review":"I've truly enjoyed all of Sharyn McCrumb's previous 'Ballad' novels, especially \\"She Walks These Hills\\". With her new novel, \\"The Ballad of Frankie Silver\\", Ms. McCrumb strikes a perfect chord between the past and present. Her new book is well-paced and laced with the flavor of the Appalachian mountains as they were in the 1830's and today. Weaving a spellbinding tale of today's death row and yesterday's mob justice, Ms. McCrumb notes just how much has changed...and how much remains the same. Sheriff Arrowood returns in his most limited, but perhaps most effective role, as do Deputys LeDonne and Ayers, and the unflappable Nora Bonesteel. If you have just been introduced to Sharyn McCrumb's mystery novels, or if you're a long time fan, this is what every previous McCrumb novel has led to - history and today's headlines, the personal and the social, family...and the costs of protecting it. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting bit of Appalachian folklore mixed with fiction.","review":"I found the book dragged in places, but overall, a very good book. I was unaware, until later, that the Ballad of Frankie Silver was a true story, passed down from the generations in the Appalchians. The author writes a good mystery and I was surprised at the ending. I would recommend her books to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mountain folklore at its best!!!!!!","review":"Regardless whether you happen to be from the actual setting of the novel or somewhere across the country, this is a novel that keeps you entranced. As a reader of all Sharyn McCrumb novels, I was not disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A deep look into the past and paralells to the present","review":"I have known the Frankie Silver(Stewart) story for some time, but the detail of life during those times including the court process, the prison conditions, the struggle that everyday life had to be back then really struck me. Frankie was my great, great great aunt. Her brother Jackson was my great, great, great grandfather. He was a colorful person in his own right, also meeting a strange and untimely death. This book takes the reader to the scene, bathes them in it and makes them feel the pain and suffering all must have gone through. The modern story was an interesting mix and I found it to be entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made in 2005?","review":"I bought three of these as they were on sale and the price seemed pretty good.

I then noticed that it was dated July 11, 2005. I threw it away since I had already discarded the boxes and packing, and sending it back was going to be more trouble than it was worth.

I received the second pair and the left one fit fine, but the right one was still too small. I am sending them back, so I can't really give a review. My husband has a pair of Keen's and loves them, though. I may try to purchase a pair in the store where I can try them on first hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keen's are keen!","review":"I received my Keen's in about 3 days.

I don't know how I lived without them for so long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great hiking sandal","review":"I was looking for a good hiking sandal for my trip to Kauai later this year. I wanted something that had toe protection and was not completely hideous. I found this shoe and read various reviews from a variety of sites and decided to try it. I read that it ran about a half size small so ordered up to an 8.5. Just got the shoe yesterday and wore it, without socks, on our dog walk. Our walk goes through an undeveloped area in the desert. I walked over cement, dirt, loose rock, up hill and down and it was perfect the first time out. No blisters, great arch support, very comfortable. I have the Canton Bayou which is a pretty aqua color. In addition to all this, this shoe is washable.Can't say enough good things about it or the Appalachian Ski and Outdoors store that actually carries the shoe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic purchase!","review":"These are absolutely wonderful!

They are lightweight and airy but they still provide wonderful arch support and are sturdy to wear. I never feel like my foot is going to slip out of the sandal. I wear them when I am out running errands, when I go for my daily one hour walk, I have even worn them while I am gardening. They cleaned up with nothing more than water from the hose!! I can't wait to wear them to the beach and my pool club this summer. My only regret is that I only bought one pair. I need another pair, in blue this time!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable, practical","review":"A good shoe for all sorts of warm weather activities.

This is my fifth pair and highly recommend them to all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keen Women's H2 water shoe","review":"While the shoes I received weren't the color I ordered, I am quite pleased with them. They are wonderful. The only negative I have to say about them is that they are a little too warm. I love the toe protection they offer. They are comfortable to do lots of walking in. I love the fact they can be machine washed. They have gotten quite dirty and when I wash them, the look brand new."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best sport sandal ever","review":"I bought the blue ones 2 summers ago and just had to have a second pair for casual cafe days out that aren't salt water and fish pummelled"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keen water shoe from Amazon","review":"I loved the green color of the Keen water shoes.

I have narrow feet and they fit very well considering. I can cinch up the elastic & they are good to go. . The arch and sole is good, but not nearly as good as the older ones that are no longer made. I love that I can toss them into the wash & they look practically new. I have one pair of Newports and do not like nearly as much.(org bought 3 pairs but returned after found they fitted differently).If you have narrow feet, go with the Venice II, NOT THE NEWPORT ( REI doesn't know there are differences besides the number of straps)"},{"rating":"2","title":"second pair","review":"love them. this is my second pair. i wear them till it snows. i owned my first pair for three years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Aware poor traction on wet rocks!","review":"Just came back from a hiking trip by the river, my keen sandals had zero traction.it was like hiking on ice!Fell on a rock and hit my head....4 stitches and brain CT scan thanks to keen non grip, super slippery on rocks that are wet sandals, $90 waisted and a big bill from the hospital!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Shoe!","review":"Good for the feet!

It was immediately comfortable from day 1. no breakin period. size is true to stated sizes. I'm not familiar with other styles of Keenes. This one doesn't have a significant arch support for those who pronates or needs added support. Nonetheless, its very comfortable, no odor after spending hours in them. I didn't develop any blisters! If you plan to use socks with sandals, consider upsizing by 1/2 size."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really do love it","review":"Truly my favourite shoes in the world. My last pair survived much abuse, and I loved them so much that I continued to wear them for a year after they were chewed by a dog. I'd wear them with absolutely everything if social conventions didn't dictate otherwise! They're comfortable and ridiculously practical and I really like the colour. My only problem was finding this style widely available in Australia. I tried on the Keen Whisper as an alternative, but they're way too narrow for my liking.

Great for those pool swims at fitness center or could be used at the beach. Provides great stability in the water especially in water aerobics and poolside-wet floor suraces.

Havent had the opportunity to actually test this shoe at the beach yet but I am sure its durability will hold."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best shoes","review":"OK, they aren't the most fashionable looking. But they are comfortable and sensible. You can walk anywhere and not feel the pain afterwards, or during. I used them in NYC where you have to walk everywhere, need support, some folks actually asked me about these shoes. Perhaps the orange helps compensate for the not so stylish. I got rid of some sandals that are as thin as a wafer, and my feet thank me every day. Love your feet, they take you where you want to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Colorful, Cool and Comfortable","review":"I bought the Venice H2 Sandals in Raya Red.

They are the Keen Jamestown, Keen Venice H2, and Keen Newport H2. In my opinion, there are no shoes out there that can compare to Keen. This is quality at its best! All three pairs are comfortable and never need a break in period. I'm almost unaware that I'm wearing them! They go from hiking and running to trips to the mall or grocery store. Like I said, treat yourself to a pair, they are fantastic. Make sure you order a half size up as they tend to run a little small.

And to tell you how good it is, my OB dr recommended it but I already had it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED This Book","review":"I bought this after we found out I was pregnant after hours of sitting on the floor of the bookstore. I'll admit I was initially drawn to the real photos and overall layout of the book because I don't have time or patience to read super-wordy books. Because of how it's laid out, you can choose what you want to read and when.I felt it was broken up well, but any first-timer would ideally want it broken out by day. I loved knowing, at any given week, what was going on with my baby. I also loved that it went 6 weeks beyond - when they don't send you home with instructions for the little human. While I was lucky enough not to need it, there are entire sections on Cesarian, delivery problems, birth defects, etc.I really only recommend this book to expecting moms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Covers The Basics","review":"A decent general pregnancy book (much better than What To Expect When You're Expecting.) I liked the photos and the open way different aspects are discussed. I do wish that instead of several weeks at a time being discussed, that the individual weeks would have been discussed seperately. If you are expecting, check out a beautiful motherhood pendant at www.lifemedals.com/mothernecklace - I love mine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't care for it.","review":"I'm pregnant for the first time and grabbed this book because my local store didn't have What to Expect. While I'll agree that the book is informative - I wouldn't agree that all the information in the book is accurate. I also felt that most of the information on choosing where and how to deliver was incredibly biased and pointed toward choosing a midwife."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pro-life readers beware.","review":"I loved this book until I started reading the fine print. Anyone who is pro-life will not appreciate the references to termination. It is also seemingly bragged that few down syndrome babies are now born due to early diagnosis and abortion. I find this to be a sad fact rather than something to rejoice over. The book was fantastic except for those parts which took the joy completely from this book. Many pregnancy books discuss medical issues without having to suggest abortion. It ruined the book for me.

The underline mystery story was a bit weak (and predictable!), but everything else was so good it really made up for it. This book is different than what Jill Shalvis publishes today. Her more recent novels are lighter romantic comedies - and they are all great too. Blue Flame has a gritty realism that makes you believe these people are real. There is a lot of depth to this story. It's also very sensual and packed with great chemistry between the hero/heroine.

As a combat vet and law enforcement officer, my friends and family often seek my advice when they want to purchase and use a firearm.

I read the book in about 30-40 minutes and found it contained some of the best advice and information I have ever seen in one work. This book is very user friendly to those new to the gun world.

BLEED BLACK LABEL!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Good","review":"Black Label Society is one of the few bands that plays real metal (as opposed to the likes of Limp Bizkit or Linkin Park), and they've put out so many great songs. But while the songs on here are good, they missed some of BLS's greatest songs like \\"Stoned and Drunk\\" and \\"All for You.\\" Of course, if you are getting into BLS, this is a decent place to start, just know that there are great songs that were left off of here as well (motivation to pick up the individual albums). The two new tracks are pretty good, but people that already own the majority of the songs on here need not pick this up just for those two songs. This is just one of those albums that comes out after a record company loses and band, and release a (usually terribly put together) greatest hits package to take as much money from the band's fans as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shameless cash in attempt from Spitfire","review":"With guitarist extraordinaire Zakk Wylde's Black Label Society departing with Spitfire Records, let the cash in begin. \\"Kings of Damnation\\" is nothing more than a shameless cash in attempt, with two new songs (\\"Doomsday Inc.\\" and \\"SDMF\\", both of which are killer) thrown on to attract longtime fans. The BLS songs you would expect to be here are here: \\"Bored to Tears\\", \\"Bleed For Me\\", \\"Counterfeit God\\", \\"We Live No More\\", \\"Stillborn\\", and \\"House of Doom\\", but there are other amazing songs that are not here, such as \\"Hey You (Batch of Lies)\\", \\"Just Killing Time\\", \\"Damage is Done\\", \\"Layne\\", and even Zakk's take on \\"No More Tears\\". This compilation is completely worthless for BLS fans who already own every album, and while it may be a nice intoduction for new fans to the band, this is still better left on the shelf for everyone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why so many hit albums","review":"Seems every two-three albums zack gives us a lame, pointless greatest hits that doesn't need to exist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it says it is ...","review":"The advertised 1800 mAh at such a low price (from eforcity) intrigued me, but upon arrival it turns out that this must have been a classic bait-n-switch deal since the battery is a generic type with little or no information on capacity or manufacturer. In fact, it doesn't even list a number for capacity. Just like a previous reviewer, I am using this battery in an EOS 20D and while I didn't have the same failures, the true capacity seems to be way below 1800 mAh. Compared to my original Canon battery with 1300 mAh (2 years old), the new battery doesn't last much beyond half the time it would with lower rated original.

Didn't order from Amazon after reading JimJ review to avoid the problem he had.The sterling Tek batteries came via US Postal Service. At $9.99 each plus $6.99 shipping for the order, the price came to $13.50 each which is very good.The batteries are labelled as 2000mAh. If it is the case, then this is probably going to last a lot longer than the stock Canon BP511.So far these batteries work fine. I took hundreds of pictures with one of them to try out the capacity (BP511 usually give me some 400 shots), but even using image stablization on a 28-135mm lens, the battery gauge still shows full capacity after more than 300 shots.Have not had them long enough to report on long-term results hence 4 stars, but at this price, they look like winners to me.Sterling Tek ordering, shipping and customer services are very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"The real dirt on bears","review":"I read this book long before I saw the Grizzly Man documentary/series on TV, so I figured that guy was a little bit of a loon (I was not at all surprised by his tragic end). \\"No Room For Bears\\" gives the reader a realistic view of the nature of bears. They aren't fuzzy, cuddly pets that you should hand feed and try to befriend. Rather, they are wild, dangerous and often unpredictable animals that are better left alone (for their protection and yours).

I have been reading the regular little house books to both of my girls, which have captured their interest even though there aren't pictures and they are 5 and 2 years old. But then I came across these and this gives them a chance to reread the stories and with beautiful illustrations over and over again. (My 2 year old gets more out of these than the regular series of course) But as my 5 year old is learning to read now, she will soon be able to sit down and read these herself. These books are such a nice change from so many other books out there today for little girls. (I'd rather my girls be into this stuff than skanky Bratz and things like that!) They like to read and look at these over and over again. And again I must say, the illustrations are beautiful and my girls are fascinated by them."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a good introduction","review":"These books are great to introduce little ones to the Little House books My duaghter loved these stories and has since moved on to the chapter books to hear more details about Laura Ingalls Wilder's life on the prairie.

So it's a win win in my book."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE - This is NOT \\"Little House on the Prairie\\"","review":"I didn't read the title carefully enough. It is certainly misleading.

I was just going through it some more to track a song I was listening to, and realized that the charts from May 31, 1997 to the end of '97 are totally missing. It leaps from May 24, 1997 to November 13, 1999. It then goes to the end of 1999, then lists all the songs that hit the Hot 100 in the 90s, then starts back up with the January 10, 1998 chart. I don't know how I missed this when I first got the book, but I am not amused and wanted to warn others that might order this book to check this out right away. I'm really disappointed that I didn't notice this right away.

Since then, I have gotten hold of ALL the books in the series by ordering them online from England. Absolutely worth the time, trouble, and money. These books are hilarious and will be read and giggled over MANY TIMES by the young and not-so-young in your house. I am sorry that the series is relatively unknown in the US; it is very popular in Great Britian. Do yourself and your kids, friends, or grandkids a favor and GET THESE BOOKS. At this date, November, 2000, \\"Humphrey Hits the Jackpot\\" is the newest book in the series. I don't know if Oakley is going to write anymore for this series--I sure hope so!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enter the civilised but zany world of the Church Mice","review":"Fate was with me when my 5 year old randomly picked this book off the library shelf. Five minutes later, I was hooked and eagerly looking for other Graham Oakley books in the stacks! You will love this book; your children will love this book. The illustrations are so richly and humorously detailed that they add a whole other dimension to the story. Each reading is more enjoyable than the last--there is always some funny detail never noticed before. The picture of Sampson, the church cat, babysitting the young church mice is hilarious, especially since the accompanying text is quite understated. This is Oakley's method: slightly droll, understated text with detailed and really funny illustrations. Do yourself a favor and read this book with your kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible quality, product, and looks nothing like the picture","review":"This is a terrible product.

Two lengths of screws and excellent finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"So glad I listened to recommendations for this product","review":"These are a must-have item. Heretofore, I've been using the Planet waves strap with a straplock mechanism. While it's an innovative system that doesn't require any installation, the plastic ends are large and a bit awkward and can get in the way of things.I installed the Schallers on my Warmoth Strat body -- I found that I needed to add some toothpick pieces per the recommendations of others to achieve a super tight fit -- not a big deal at all. These Schallers are exactly what I wanted. 5 stars, and a no-brainer."},{"rating":"1","title":"To be avoided","review":"These straplocks came standard on my Spector Euro 4 LX. After only 10 months of ownership, the strap horn straplock failed, causing my bass to nearly end up on the floor. I caught it just in time to save my bass from being potentially destroyed. Inspection of the part showed metal particles on both halves of the straplock.Regardless of being rather easy to operate, these straplocks are not very good. Straplocks are useless if metal is scraping off during routine use. Heaven forbid they should fail while you're playing standing up, especially if you own a really nice guitar or bass.You'd be better off buying a competative brand, such as Ernie Ball Superlocks or the Dunlop type. Avoid Schallers at any cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible experience with these","review":"I bought these for my Les Paul, and they were sold to me as being the 'best on the market'. Several times after installing them I noticed the nut was coming loose, which is pretty scary considering when you have strap locks you usually handle the guitar in a very cavalier fashion, expecting everything to be secure. Then, I lost one of the nuts. Guess what...you can't replace the nut, its M10 x 0.75 metric nut which is basically impossible to find. I attempted to force an M10 x 1.25 nut on there and ended up breaking the whole thing. So, I would strongly NOT recommend these because they kept coming loose, and the replacement nut costs just about as much as a new set."},{"rating":"2","title":"They work...period!!","review":"I've been using Schaller strap locks on all my guitars for the past 30 years.

The Best","review":"I've been playing since the 70's and have dropped my first guitar, (A Memphis LP copy). Since then, I've equipped all of my electrics with Schaller strap locks. I bought my son his first guitar this Christmas and included a set of these in his stocking. Do yourself a favor and get a set of these as cheep insurance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great security for your instrument/4.5 stars","review":"These things are easy to install, and you never have to worry about your strap falling off. No problems so far, they work great. I wish I could give it 4.5 stars because they end up looking a little weird because they are kind of big. But as far as performance goes, they are perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Schaller vs. Dunlop strap locks","review":"I just wrote a similar review for the Dunlop Straploks. The Schallers are prone to loosening and coming apart, the Dunlops are not. If you keep on top of the Schallers and make sure that the nut on the strap is always tight, they're fine. But I've had them come apart on me several times, and I don't trust them anymore. I check them regularly, and I could put thread locker on the nuts, which will help, but I'm eventually going to replace all of my Schallers with Dunlops. In my view the Dunlop is a superior design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect fit for Gibson Les Paul Standard","review":"After nearly dropping my prized LP Standard I knew I had to do something. These Schaller security locks work very well. I emailed the company to verify the screws would fit into my Gibson. The owner replied within a day, then mailed me two sets of test screws for free to check if they would work. Very impressed by the company. The longer screw fit the bottom strap button hole perfectly, as did the shorter neck position hole.The hardware is machined exceptionally well, it's made in Germany!Once attached to the guitar and your strap, it just clicks in and will not come off until you pull on the strap lock knob. I feel very confident that my beloved guitar will not fall off the strap. The design also protects your guitar from the hardware or strap rubbing against it. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't be beat!","review":"I think all of the strap locks basically do what they say they do. I prefer schaller because to actuate the release you have to pull out the tab on your strap. This seems to me to be something that is much less likely to happen accidentally than with a button you have to push in. But at the same time, I've never had a strap lock of any make come loose unexpectedly. I would recommend with any strap lock system that you occasionally check all of the elements of it for tightness and secure mounting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ut Grandma","review":"I really appreciate the quality of this line of doll house accessories.

After seeing it I ordered two of them (one for the bike, one for the car, plus qualified for free shipping) and after only two weeks I believe I have become emotionally involved with the thing. It keeps water super cold all day long, and I carry it with me everywhere. It will fit inside my purse, and it's not too heavy. I put water and ice in it in the morning, and then just add more water throughout the day. The bottle will still have ice at the end of the day. And I have found that I tend to drink more water than I did previously, because I have a supply of ice cold water always nearby.

(x 2 18oz & x 1 22oz.)The 22oz ones are made for more rugged environments, stay cool longer, dent less, and don't lose their vacuum effect right after you drop them on their side.I learned the hard way with my 18oz one, as it went from staying cool from 4 hours to about 1.In the end, I like the feel of the 18oz one more, as well as it's ability to open every time like a spring when button is pushed, which the 22oz one doesn't allways.Also for the 18oz's wider top to easily put normal/large ice cubes in.Both products are awsome though."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Really works as advertised","review":"Even though this product had so many glowing reviews, I was still fairly skeptical b/c I had bought another insulated water bottle that didn't really do anything.Well, this REALLY works.

I just realized today though that it is NOT 18-ounce. It's 15 ounces. We filled the water bottle to the rim and then poured it out into a measuring cup. But that's okay because this is the best freaking water bottle ever. No condensation, leakage and it is sweat-proof. seriously buy more than one.

I suppose I should have guessed it based on the construction, but normally I try to avoid things that can't go into the dishwasher. Still, the size is perfect, and I love the pop-up drinking cap, plus my water stays cold, so other than being a little whiny about the extra dishwashing work, I've been very happy with this bottle for almost three months.

This is the only bottle I have found that actually works with carbonation. I can fill from a 2-liter soda bottle or my favorite SodaStream, store this in my fridge door, and grab it the next day when I leave my house. Many hours later I can easily pop the top (some bottles are almost impossible to open with charged water) and drink cool soda. My husband drinks plain water and I bought him his own for the golf course as I got tired of him taking mine.I have been using it daily for several years and have had no problems. My only complaint is that it is not dishwasher safe and it only holds 18 ounces (I drink a lot and need to bring several bottles). It is one of the few bottles I have had that was worth my shelf space. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously flawed","review":"I'm a retired Infantryman so I understand how a product must stand up to the rigors of hard use. But I currently work in an office. I bought 2 of these. Within a month the blue rubber ring on the inside of the cap which keeps things sealed came loose and kept flopping out on both of them. You lose that ring and forget it. You won't have a seal. Then another month later the blue rubber cap that serves as a plug in the cap came loose and dissapeared. The thermos is useless without it. These are serious design flaws and I can't recommend them. I am sure the manufacturer is aware of these issues. They just don't want to fix them."},{"rating":"2","title":"For cold drinks!","review":"Great at keeping drinks cold. But the container does sweat.

Unfortunately, this thermos leaks and now is at the point where I need to throw it away (the klean kanteen classic screwtop and the REI insulated bottle with screwtop also leak). After going through countless brands over the past 2 years, I just ordered him an insulated camelbak with the bite valve. I purchased one for myself this summer and it has proven to be the best purchase of them all so far - it keeps water cold for a long time and does not leak.

It will keep ice all day, seals tight, simple to use, and easy to clean. My only complaint is that it doesn't hold an extra 4 or 5 oz of water. The flip lid could get annoying to coworkers if you keep closing it and opening it (it clicks and pops), but it is easy to avoid the noise if you push in on the release button lightly while closing it, and catch the lid as it springs open.

I got in and the outside was pretty hot, but I was really thirsty, so I opened it up and it didn't seem too bad so I tried it. It was ICE COLD. After 8 hours in a hot car in the sun.

It's overall a great product-doesn't sweat, doesn't leak no matter what, it has the latch to keep the button from getting pushed open, the cap doesn't hit my nose when I take a sip, and it's not too big. My main concern is that the inner silicone ring inside the cap, and the silicone circle on top of cap absorbs odor from any drink I have that is not water. No matter how I wash it or how much soap I use, the odor does not go away and I end up drinking water with the odor of juice or any other drink I had before.

We would put water, soda, flavored water - whatever - in the cup in the morning with some ice. Then drive around all day and leave the cups in a car that was over 100 degrees and by the end of the day the beverage was still ice cold and the ice had not even melted all the way.

I was pleased to see that there was still ice in it after all that time.Being stainless steel, you don't have to worry about plastics or leeching or any flavor transfer using this. It is so well insulated, that the bottle does NOT form condensation even on a humid day--very humid here today and had it outside for hours with ice and water, and no condensation.I'm only sorry I didn't buy a bigger one since I do have to refill quite a bit.

I could not fix it, in fact it was very perplexing, as I'm not sure how it's leaking at all.

After several emails and no responses I decided to just send back the Thermos hoping for a replacement that didn't leak. Well after paying $5 shipping, I got my Thermos, but it leaked just the same. I specifically stated when I sent it back (with a note) that the leaking problem was not due to the rubber stopper, but rather the screw-on part of the lid. SO they replaced the stopper and sent it back. I don't plan on spending another $5 to get another leaking container. The product is very close to being excellent, but it is not there yet.

It's really easy to open close- Mouth piece, very easy to drink from, so no spill and you get plenty of water, so no sipping like Dasani bottlesCons:- The only one I could think of is the opening is kind of small to it can be hard to put ice in there if you have large pieces of ice or you are trying to fill the ice from an ice machine.

No sweating, spotting etc. I just found that a little condensation can form around the plastic cap if I keep the bottle in my bag for a couple of hours. If it sits on top of my desk - no condensation.Does not spill, or open unexpectedly. Looks very nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I've used this water bottle for two years and it works as well as day one. I've dropped the bottle numerous times and the top is cracked quite badly, but it still holds water and never looses a drop. I can latch the lock, toss it on the seat of my car and never worry that it will leak. I love it and carry it with me everywhere. Fits in all my cars' cup holders as well...another huge benefit. Plus, being double wall insulated, there is no condensation on the outside of the water bottle. Keeps water cold all day, even without using ice. I don't have a single bad thing to say about it! Buy it without worry...you'll love it too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as advertised!","review":"I purchased several Thermos/Nissan can coolers several years ago which I loved so I decided to stick with vacuum insulation for my water bottle. These things are worth every penny as they keep things hot or cold for hours! In Arizona, it's nice to get into your 120-degree car and have an ice-cold drink waiting for you. I was dubious about the design, but it is almost perfect. I do miss the rubber bottom that the can coolers have, but otherwise, I have no complaints."},{"rating":"1","title":"metal latch too loose","review":"There is a metal latch on this product to prevent it from opening if the lever is accidentally pushed. On the one i recieved, this latch was so loose it just flopped open, thus allowing the lid to be accidentally opened with ease. I returned this product to Amazon. I ordered a 16 oz backpack/briefcase thermos at the same time i ordered this thermos. the backpack/briefcase thermos has a fully functional metal latch. I have been using the backpack/briefcase bottle daily for a couple of weeks now and other that the fact that i have to refill it often, i am pleased with its performance. It keeps my ice water cold for frequent sipping even in a hot car in 100+ degree weather."},{"rating":"2","title":"gooood","review":"it's really of great quality as my expected! It could keep water warm over one day and has good resistance to water leakage, safe for taking in the bag!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money!","review":"I bought this to help cut down on the number of plastic water bottles I used after I bought a water filter. The tag claims it's supposed to keep beverages cold for 12 hours, and it's true. My beverages stayed cold all day. Yes, the temperature of the beverage does drop a little, but at the end of the day it's still MUCH colder than it normally would have been. I even had ice cold water in it in a dark car on a sunny, hot, humid summer day, and the water stayed ice cold for the 4 hours it sat in the hot car. I mainly bought it for camping and other travelling, but it's going to be used daily for work now that I've found out how well it works. Now, I've had it for almost 18 months, and I noticed today that the leak-proof rubber lining inside the lid is loose and I need to replace my thermos. I don't want to replace it, but I'm definitely getting another one. It is worth the money. It definitely pays for itself within the first month or two. I would definitely recommend this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"As Pictured???","review":"I love this style of Thermos but I wanted the brown that was pictured. A true brown with a kind of dull finish. What I received from Amazon.com, which I usually trust, was a high gloss redish brown.

I really am disappointed in Amazon.com."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved this bottle.......at first","review":"This was my very favorite bottle but after using it several months, it began leaking and is now unusable.

I had to return it for a refund. It was not a good experience to have my purse flooded with tea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for keeping cold drinks cold for an extended period of time","review":"Excellent job in keeping liquids cold for an extended period of time, just like thermos nissan coffee mugs which I would also highly recommend having used them for 10 years. I would like it to hold more than 18 oz but unlike the larger thermos this 18 oz fits all beverage holders in the car. The large opening in the top allows for easily putting ice cubes in the container."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best thermos ever for hot liquids","review":"If you need a thermos that retains heated liquids for 4-8 hours outside in cold weather, this is a great thermos. Indoors I would suspect contents would stay heated for 8-10 hours. I am a golfer who plays often in 40 degree weather or below and the first 9 holes can be quite cold. My husband and I bought 4 of these products (two each). He uses one for coffee, one for soup. I use mine for hot tea and for soup. I would not recommend cleaning them in the dishwasher as the o-ring at the top, which provides the seal to prevent liquid from leaking out, can get loose or lost. However, when I called Thermos about this, they sent me out a replacement ring at no charge. Great customer service."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME Bottle!","review":"This is greatest water bottle. So easy to use...just a press of the button, no unscrewing a cap in order to drink from it. The design is so well thought out! My Mom and Sister all have the same one and also love it! It's like a grown-up version of the kids funtainer only bigger and has an opening/spout instead of a straw.The size is good in my vehicle's cup holder. It's tall and can be tipsy if full while driving around a corner. My car's cup holders aren't very deep. It seems to be the same size around as a soda can if not a tiny bit smaller.Double walled so it won't sweat on wood furniture.I love the rubber grip around the middle, keeps it in my hand and it is not cold to hang onto like some metal ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Thermos Ever","review":"This is my all-time favorite bottle! I have 4 in case they stop making them. When my husband had his brain surgery, I kept one by his bedside and he always had ice water. Fits in my car holder. Have one at work and one for home/travel."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect water bottle","review":"We love this water bottle. When the cap cracked on the last one (after a couple of years, and I was putting it in the dishwasher, which you're not supposed to do) I ordered two more. I've decided that, even though the budget is tight, this is something I'm not going to do without. It keeps your water cold all day, even on the hottest days, and there's no unscrewing the top just to get a sip. It's perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, average ease of installation","review":"Great product.

It suprised me that someone could respond the way they did to a delicate teaching such as Hua ching Ni. Anyhow the teachings of \\"mother of the yellow altar\\" are informative, historically and spiritually. For any who wish to grasp the ungraspable or emerge themselve in an immortal tradition, this book is an experience. For those unaware of the female contribution to Tao, then this bok will illuminate your understanding.

It goes right along with what I have learned from other sources except for the fact that it sugar coats some of the answers. The book has questions and answers from someone who is learning about Islam. I am a Catholic and I expected the book to make excuses and claim that Islam is a religion and First Amendment Right. The book makes it very clear that that Islam is an Ideology and has nothing to do with religion. It is a political, and military way of living and uses religion as a cover. Islam very clear tells us that the goal is to take over the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inside Islam: A Guide for Catholics","review":"I find this book is based on fear and confrontation. As Catholics, we embrace all that is good and true in other religions. I'd like to see a book that highlights this while in charity acknowledging that we do see some things different as far as our understanding of Jesus' divinity and the notion of God as trinity. Still, we share a common desire to work for human dignity, social justice and the common good. Both Christians and Muslims have fallen short of this common goal in the past. Let's stop trying to prove ourselves right and admit that we've both made mistakes. let's seek greater understanding and build on the common ground we have and work for mutual respect."},{"rating":"2","title":"a bombastic explosion of post-hardcore","review":"Their non-traditional song structure is engaging and permeates throughout most of the tracks on the ablum. Even on the final track, which instead of traditionally fading out ends as it seems to be building up to something. This, I imagine, is to leave the listener wanting more. It succeeds. The dualing vocals work well in conjunction with the varying styles and breakdowns within each song. One vocalist snotty, screachy (yet pleasant) voice adds to the furious nature of the hardcore/grindcore areas. The other vocalist exudes deeper, more rhythmic sensibilities. Along with their brilliant blending of punk, hardcore, pop, emo, and even ska (the list could go longer but let's not bother) easily turns Blood Brothers' \\"Burn Piano Island, Burn\\" into an instant classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Only Band That Matters","review":"Well if you don't know who these guys are, then where the hell have you been?

Switching from stoneware to Corelle was a good decision. They take up much less space in my kitchen and it's easier to carry a whole stack of them with my arthritic hands.Because of their smaller size, we use the lunch plates more often than the dinner plates. But we miss having the smaller bread & butter plates, so I ordered some plain white round 6 3/4 inch plates. Disappointed that we couldn't get small square plates, but the round ones will be OK.The 22 oz. bowls are larger than most. The slight lip on the rim helps to remove them from the microwave without getting burned. Corelle doesn't heat up like stoneware.Also disappointed that the mugs are NOT Corelle glass, but porcelain. They feel nice in your hand but could tip easier than most mugs.Overall I really like these dishes and would buy them again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Colrelle 16-piece Dinnerware Set","review":"Cups were not made out of Corelle material.

That arrived with a bowl and a dinner plate broken. I am still waiting (a month now) for replacements for the so called \\"unbreakable Corelle\\".

By some miracle, not one piece of Corelle was chipped or broken and I was short on time, so I had to find another box to re-wrap all of the pieces and give the gift in another box, advising the bride to be that, \\"I didn't buy the set at a yardsale\\".

Why then, when there is a more than adequate story line, and very clear descriptions of the characters, do the film writers have to alter details. Surely there was no need to distort the details to such an extent that Brother Oswin, who had nothing to do with the disappearance of Yves and Ermina Hugonin in the book, should suddenly be so closely involved? Or is it just that the script writers could not make the plot fit any better? Why also is the Hugh Beringar of this film so unlike his description in the books - tall, solid and fair rather than slight and dark? Perhaps I'm being picky but why change for the sake of change?"},{"rating":"2","title":"This one is actually better than the book!","review":"I have read almost all of the books and seen almost all of the videos and this one really stands out as being better than the book. I really empathize with Brother Oswin in all of the videos so it feels right that he should be the focus of this story. \\"The Virgin in the Ice\\" is also one of the best acted, by all of the cast. Derek Jacobi and the other monks are always flawless, (even Julian Firth as Brother Jerome who we all love to hate) but in this one, even the children do an exceptional job. If you have never seen a Brother Cadfael mystery, I highly recommend that you start with \\"The Virgin in the Ice\\". And if you want a wonderful book to start with, try \\"The Confession of Brother Haluin\\" by Ellis Peters. Bravo to a video masterpiece!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than no video at all...","review":"I suppose you get what you pay for, but in some cases (like here), even that's not the case.

But I didn't go through adolescence in the 80s. And thats where most of the humor comes from in this overrated movie.Its not dull or totally unfunny. But no moment warrants anything better than a smile. Horny Jewish kids at a camp. Most of the characters and storylines aren't that funny. And the actors playing them add most of the life to the movie. The only reasons to watch this movie are the funny characters who are in the background. David Hyde Pierce, the one-note funny of Paul Rudd, Amy Poehler and Christopher Meloni all play funny cliche bit parts, usually found in other camp movies. But its the unfunny original characters who get the most screen time. Garofalo, Showalter and the rest are just boring and unlikable. And I'm sure they can be funny in other roles.Watch it once. You won't remember much because its not a great comedy. Not even that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arts and Farts and Crafts!!","review":"This movie rocks hard. Early 80's camp-movie satire hard.

Either you will dimiss it as garbage, or you will love it and watch it repeatedly. I liked it, and upon subsequent viewings I caught more and more of the parody.The movie is a parody of 80's 'teen-exploitation' movies like Meatballs and the like. If you aren't familiar with such comedies, very could well miss the humor in Wet Hot American Summer.For fans of Christopher Meloni (Law & Order SVU, Oz), this is a good chance to see him take on a comedic role that you don't usually get to see."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the better spoof films I've seen","review":"It's unfortunate that there are so many bad reviews for this film. I saw it last year at Sundance where it recieved a standing ovation in my screening. They don't make spoof movies like this anymore. It had been a long time since I had seen a film that made my stomach hurt from laughing so hard, Wet Hot accomplished this in the first 20 minutes.

Other than David Hyde Peirce's performance, this was awsome. I think the greatest performance of all, however, was that of Chris Meloni!

Like a lot of low-brow comedies, the basic idea of the movie was to make every scene funny. Usually these movies more occasionally, but most of the jokes fall flat. The reason why this one worked so well was, quite simply, 'cause almost all of the jokes wre hilarious. The extended drug scene gave me stomach cramps it was so funny. Even actors I've never liked before like Garafalo and that dude from \\"Frasier\\" were funny. Must admit, I've never seen \\"Meatball's\\" or other films it parodies, so I can't verify it's originality. Maybe it rips off all it's goof jokes from other movies, as a couple reviewers have suggested. Then again, that's post-modernism for ya, ain't it? If it's true that \\"there is nothing new under the sun,\\" than ya might as well recycle the best of the old.

This movie suffers from bad writing, a lack of continuity, an uninteresting and undeveloped plot and-- it pains me to say this-- bad acting. Often, bad films can actually be funny for all the wrong reasons, however, this movie isn't even unintentionally funny. The film is good for one or, maybe, two smirks while the rest of time is spent feeling genuinely embarrassed for everyone involved.

Some of the things here I can imagine actually happening at a summer camp. I watched this with other former counselors, and we went through and were able to say, \\"Oh, that character was so-and-so at my camp,\\" and so on. (It's rather scary, but Janeane Garofalo looks EXACTLY like my camp director.)Now a Program Director at another camp, I'm definitely showing this to my staff (at the END of the summer, so as not to give them any ideas).

However, mostly it's just a bunch of unrelated vignettes fueled by no real plot. This movie includes a man humping a refrigerator (this same man talks to a can of mixed vegetables),a horrible \\"semi-spoof\\" of ARMAGEDDON, and pathetic attempts at satirizing 70s and 80s camp movies.

This was no parody, the attempt at humor came off as just being irritating and obnoxious. Since this film was rated R, the film makers should have at least offered some gratutious female nudity which is standard in this genre. Instead they showed an appalling male homosexual sex scene which I quickly fast forwarded. Matter of fact, this film was so bad that I watched more than half of it on 1.5X speed, which is a nice feature on my DVD player.

I really wanted to like this movie. David Wain grew up in a city right next to mine, and it's always great to see someone from this area make it big. But even that couldn't get me to like this film. How could such a great ensemble cast with some good performances come together to make such...? I really don't know. But whatever you do, do not buy this movie. DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the top 10 funniest movies of all time","review":"When I first saw this movie, flipping around the TV, I wasn't expecting much so it really took me by surprise! 80's summer camp has terrific potential as a setting for hilarious off-the-wall comedy, and it does not disappoint. Many of the scenes are so funny you do not want them to end. The characters are extremely likable and you want their laid back, goofy mood to rub off on you. I cannot count the number of times I laughed out loud. My only criticisms are that it is set on the last day of camp which leaves you feeling like the fun is always about to end. The other is that occasionally the suggestion that there is a plot gets in the way. Comedies are much funnier when you're not distracted by worrisome complications. Hilarious choice of songs - I will never listen to Foreigner, Loverboy and Rick Springfield the same way again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A confused collection of papers.","review":"May be it could be better to name this book a collection of papers and theses.

Here are my main reasons:(1) The content is a result of badly organized copy and paste process from the first author's research group with major errors.(2) Even the author diversity visible in various chapters does not add value, I believe the second and third authors are Paulraj drones. There is not one good chapter that I can recommend someone to read.(3) Branka Vucetic et.al.'s book is a much better organized one although it suffers from the cut and paste process.Recommendation: AVOID!

The simplest recipes in this book take hours to make: the more complicated are recommended to take several days. One of the best (and certainly the best flourless) chocolate cakes I've had in my life came out of this book: I had less luck on my own making a simpler cookie recipe.The directions are amazingly detailed, but this book simply isn't appropriate for beginners or people with quasi-normal kitchens, and you're left to your own devices if you want to adapt them.

The metaphors in this book he makes have truly put a new frontier out for the mind. How he never really says that all food is compared to life, but subtly adds it, blows my mind.

I would have loved to have had this book while I was teaching knitting just to use as exercises.

The creators do a good job of capturing the excitement of being Superman and flying around Metropolis--as much fun at times as being Spider-man in his excellent games. However, that flying is about as fun as it gets. The combat is horrible with the player fighting the same enemy types at the last level encountered in the first level. An attempt is made to tie the game into the mediocre movie, but the player is never saving Lois or fighting Lex Luthor. The huge boss battle at the end is against a tornado. Seriously. The game also suffers from being short--easily beaten in six hours or less.If you're a fanboy like me, rent it and get it over with, but you'll be returning it to the store the next day.

When it was pushed back I thought that it was a decision to make the game better - Not at all in this case. Unfortunately their additional effort must have gone into marketing and cut scenes rather than gameplay. The controls are unresponsive, camera does not follow well, menus are lame, and the manual is an afterthought.With games like God of War that do so much with visuals and even Hulk Ultimate Destruction (if you want to talk superhero games specifically) their is no excuse for such a third (or fourth) rate effort - especially when the game was pushed back!!!

If you have seen the movie the climatic scene takes place in the fortress of solitude. The game has no option to go there or fight there. I play the whole boring game waiting for this battle against Lex Luthor and his goons in the fortress just to get out of the city of Metropolis that never materailizes. They do the whole scene via cut scene. Ridicuolous! They could have at least shown him falling back to earth or something.I would talk about the mindless game play and camera angles but I think those shortcomings were well addressed in other reviews. Don't buy this game!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and to hard","review":"This game is really bad.The first couple of levels are pretty fun but then you are set free into the city of metropolis.I was reall looking forward to flying around metropolis wich I enjoyed for a little while but evetually I got bored and tried a mission.The Mission was incredibly hard and once I beat it I couldnt save and quit because you have to keep playing until you get to the next chapter.Unfortunately i did not know this so I saved and quit.When i came back to play it I was shocked and I was mad that the game restarted from the first mission in the chapter.So there it is you decide if you want to buy this awful game"},{"rating":"2","title":"True Firehouse fan","review":"This CD seems like a totally different style again from Firehouse And I mean that in a GREAT way..they are always giveing you something NEW. The only thing I didnt like about it was there didnt seem to be much of the other guys singing..All C.J And I know these guys sound great when they sing strong, loud and proud together! But get the cd if your a fan at any level..MANY good love/rock songs I think and maybe a few good ones for a wedding"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Hair Metal Band With Not Much Hair","review":"WOW!!! What a great comeback album!!! Firehouse is back. This album rocks like the good ol'e days. If your looking for classic firehouse, like the first 2 albums, then this one is for you. I was honored to see them perform just a couple of days ago for free. It was a hour and a half of free music, and these boys can still rock and roll. Go get this album, and i promise, you wont be let down. Great singing with great guitar and drums, what else could you ask for? Welcome back Firehouse!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a sales pitch","review":"I had to review this book as part of a post-graduate study. The book is highly disappointing and is little more than a sales pitch for Weigel's so called \\"Knowledge Rooms\\". The book also goes into great detail on IBM/Lotus's \\"Quickpace\\". Weigel fawns over this product and I expect that he will get a box of chocs from the sales & marketing guys at IBM. Weigel also has a habit of telling irrelevant anecdotes and the book as a whole is ill-structured.My advice? Build your own room and write a book about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"The album is one of my favorites. I compare it to like a loose mogwai and kinda in the vein of godspeed you black emperor, only I think it survived the death of that slow swelling post-rock genre. It's great on so many levels, for one it's more of a grouping of several songs which are largely experiments with loose song structure and uncommon instrument arrangements/sampling, save a few of the more concrete songs. How Animals Move (and the solo violin version) being one of the more concrete songs, is an amazing and well composed swelling/emotional/moving song. The low fi recording style/sound is very interesting and amazing in itself (over-reverbed violin solo song and sampling on several songs). This is a very unconventional album and definitely worth a listen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tony Takitani","review":"In my opinion, TONY TAKITANI was the best film of 2005. It's about a man who has lived his whole life with loneliness until he meets someone and can finally find love... except she has this flaw that leads to tragedy for both of them. Every inch of the film is beautiful- the cinematography, score and writing are extraordinary. It's very literary, poetic and powerful. I was so moved that when I left the theater I was talking to my boyfriend about a scene from the film and I started weeping. We walked right into this restaurant across the street and I had to excuse myself to the restroom to pull myself together. No film has ever had an effect like that on me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tony Takitani","review":"Based on the trailers and reviews I thought this would be a great vidio. Wrong this movie is so boring I regret every minute I watched it. I got it for my mother, who's Japanese, and she is even more diapointed in the movie than I am."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning","review":"A distant hommage to Hitchcock's Vertigo, this movie is about solitude and destiny. The sweeping camera makes you think you're exploring a beautiful japanese parchment. This movie is an old master's work, and every picture confirms his mature talent. And it's funny, too!Seeing it on DVD for the second time, I found it less appealing than the first time. Be sure to drink a lot of coffee before pressing PLAY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very convenient","review":"These can be kept on the shelf. If my husband wants blueberry pancakes, I soften them in milk. Terrific pancakes. In the morning while I am getting breakfast, I put a half cup in plain nonfat yogurt and place the bowl in the refrigerator. At lunchtime the berries have absorbed moisture from the yogurt which makes me feel I am eating something more substantial. I have also used the dehydrated fruit in a smoothie. It makes the smoothie seem thick and rich."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for snacks","review":"Just blueberries, no sugar, not too sweet, great for healthy snacking right out of the can. I have started to add them to yogurt and cereal, highly recommended. Great to have around in the months when fresh fruit is not an option."},{"rating":"2","title":"blueberries","review":"The blueberries are great.

We like the robe, but the sash is silky and slippery, and I think I will have to replace it with something that will work best for keeping the robe cinched. I don't mind this, but it will be a greater issue for folks who don't have material and a sewing machine to whip up an alternative from stock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for beginners...marginally useful for experienced runners","review":"This would be a great book for beginning runners.

I laughed when she laughed. I love animals and one thing I liked about this book was that Ann M. Martin kept saying that Tigger was with her. This book is incredible and I think that ,even if you don't like the BSC, you should read this book. Keep going strong Ann!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book Ann M. Martin has written of the series.","review":"I believe this to be the best book that Ms. Martin has written in the Babysitters Club Series. The story is very compelling and it takes you through the grief at losing it all to the realization that things will have to change. It is very well written and makes you feel some of what the character was going through. I really enjoyed this book and I love reading Ms. Martin's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real tear jerker!","review":"This book made me cry just to even THINK what it would be like to lose everything you own! It makes you love what you have, to feel greatful that your not in that situation. Also, if you ever GET in a situation where you lose your home, you can always find some way to read (or even just think about this book) and you may feel better knowing that other people go through this kind of thing too. I think that this is the best book Ann M. Martin had ever written! No contest! Better then her novels, better then all the other BSC books, better then California Diaries. That's saying a lot. This will be a book I'll remember forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poor Mary Anne","review":"I cannot believe Mary Anne's house burned down! She and Dawn were VERY upset. But I can't figure out why Mary Anne could not cry. She normally cries right when she SEES something sad or cute. Or even HEARS about it. Finally one night she is able to cry. Dawn cried when she got one look at the house. I was glad they got to save A FEW things even if they weren't worth very much. I an VERY glad Tigger woke Mary Anne up. She might not have gotten out in time if he hadn't. I loved the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not going to read AMM anymore","review":"Sometimes it's nice to get away from reality by reading a good book.

What an excellent product! I always keep a few in the diaper bag or in my purse just in case. Trying to put sunscreen lotion on a baby that is just learning to explore the world around her is nearly impossible. With the towelettes, I can get in there and get done in no time so that she can continue to play. Bonus, after I finish wiping her down, I use the towelettes on my neck, shoulders and face to make sure I have a protection where I burn the most."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Product","review":"I purchased this product because my toddler hates when I rub sunscreen on his face. I thought this would be like a diaper wipe where the product applies easily. This is basically a cloth dipped in thick and creamy sunscreen, it takes the same efford and mess as applying it with your hands. The only difference is that this is a lot more expensive (6 applications for $10, while a whole bottle of sunscreen cost about $5). On top of it, my son got a really bad reaction from the product, it is definetely not made for babies' and toddlers' skin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not just \\"bad\\"......painful","review":"If you gave uncle irwin a video camera before he went to maui, you would have a more interesting and realistic film about marrakech's Jemaa El Fena.

But I would beg you to see the real Dragon Ball Z before buying this chopped up, edited version. I know that it says uncut, but it's really not. I'm not saying that violence is good or anything, but I am saying that this was a show that was originally meant for adults in Japan and was brought over seas by Funimation and turned into a little kiddie show. If you do not want to see the real Japanese version, then be my guest and buy this video, but if you would like to see the real thing, pick it up at your local comic book shop. But, since Funimation is clearly not going to ever bring the real thing over seas in subtitled, uncut Japanese, then DBZ will never have the charm that it was meant to have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Freiza defeated","review":"I would recommend buying this uncut because you see Freiza split in two and they also cut some blood out to.Really cool.It does drag on a bit but it still rocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Trunks + DBZ, what more could you want?","review":"Not all that much more, I was impressed with this newer batch of DVD's, and hope the next bunch comes out this good... It says I can't spoil the plot, but that means that I really can't say much about the little quirks in the DVDs, which mostly are little purist things to begin with... When the Cell Saga comes up, we have some huge moments though, and I think the DVD's really let the American viewer see them the way they were meant to be seen (Yea, that music in the FUNi dub isn't the original) and the very very cool \\"Unmei no Hi (Spirit Versus Spirit)\\" moment, which shouldn't give anything away, but spark a fire for these DVD's to come out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trunks is a Great Character","review":"This video will shock you if you have no idea what is going to happen. The most shocking part is when you find out who Trunks is. Goku is finally back. The bottom line is this tape is worth getting. You won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD for a great saga","review":"This dvd is a must for dbz fans. It even has 5 episodes instead of 3 and that is awesome. I would buy this trunks dvd because in my opinion it is one of the best sagas on dbz.My only problem with the dvd is that the picture seems kinda grainy. It seems like the picture could be clearer and fine tuned but this also beats the 3 episode VHS version by far. So if you want the trunks saga, be sure to buy them on dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Japanese DBZ Bliss","review":"This is what the American Dragonball community has be salivating for, for years now.

Well read, good book to listen to on tape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely stunning in its analysis and presentation","review":"This book is not for the faint-hearted. David Halberstam, who personally witnessed and suffered from the incompetence of the US and ARVN forces during a crucial period in the mid-1960s, has produced an overwhelming case study in poor political judgement, outmoded military thinking, and above all arrogance. Reading this book at the time of the US-led bombing of Serbia in mid-1999, and reflecting back on Halberstam's account of the US decision to bomb North Vietnam and the inevitable intervention of ground troops following that, I couldn't help thinking: does anyone out there ever bother to learn from our past mistakes? Our politicians and military leaders should be made to read this book, and read it again, until its messages sink home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best ever on Vietnam","review":"I recommend this book to any of us who served in the lost cause in Vietman. Well written and informative. One of the best books I have ever read. A must reading for our Presidents and leader in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"gave up","review":"This is a pretentious book even before it begins. The long-winded preface written by Halberstam was self-serving and vain, and rubbed me the wrong way. After getting that behind me, I tried plowing through the main body, but gave up. I was born in the early 60s, so I'm not as familiar with some of the characters or politics of that era (hence my desire to read the book), and I found myself getting lost by some of the tangents, complex sentences, and ancillary information. He was trying to cram too much information and too many diverse thoughts into each sentence. Despite my effort, I was not getting much insight into the characters.I read his book \\"The Fifties\\" a while ago and remembered it as a good book. Likewise, I had high hopes for this book, but in the end, I gave up."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Times That Tried Men's Souls","review":"This is probably one of the most masterful non-fiction books written in America in the past thirty-five years. It is also the best book I have read on Washington power, with the possible exception of Hedrick Smith's \\"The Power Game\\".What makes this book so distinctive is Halberstam's passion for his subject: The quagmire known as Vietnam. Rarely does one come across a writer who has not only a strong intellect, but a keen sensitivity and insight into the people who are portrayed in his pages.Since I was born in 1963, the Vietnam War to me is just a vague memory of school classmates wearing POW/MIA bracelets on their wrists. Since I lived near a major air force base, some of the bracelets worn were of the children's own fathers and uncles. This book captures an era I knew nothing about. And it shows the truly sad confluence of stale policies, rigid mindsets, blind ambition, and cruel truths of history that came together in a little known country in Southeast Asia."},{"rating":"2","title":"bought it as a present for a friend - he LOVES it!","review":"If you are a Viet Nam buff, this is the encyclopedia of information and, according to my friend, Very readable.

Some tracks like \\"world of girls\\" and \\"Gotta Have Ya\\" are reminiscent of the sound that I am talking about, otherwise the album has a hip-hop sound rather than a techno-funk sound Egyptian Lover first made so popular.

These batteries charge rather quickly. I have four of them now and am prepared for any shooting situation. I also like the higher capacity when doing video photography. I believe that one battery will power my Canon 100-HS for one-hour in video mode. Install a 32 GB memory device and you'll be able to take 9,930 high-resolution photos without having to download them first to a computer. That's more than a year's worth of photos.

There is a broad range of exercises depicted and the descriptions are clear enough that a beginner should be able to get some good tips to assist with his/her learning.I like the fact that \\"standing at the stake\\" is emphasized and the drawings explaining the finer points of the stance are very helpful. I cannot over-emphasize the positive effects of this exercise! It seems many other Qigong books only depict sitting meditation which, in my opinion, misses out on a great opportunity for advancing health and energy. Some of the other exercises are not perfectly clear since the illustrations could use a bit of improvement but overall there is a lot of information here.Combine this book with one by Frantzis and a couple of meditation books like \\"Mindfulness in Plan English\\" or \\"Zen Training\\" and then find a good master - you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A simple (too simple!) yet immesurably effective guide","review":"On first reading, I thought that the techniques in the book were too simple to be really effective; after all, they only involved standing still and relaxing; there were many other books with more fascinating systems.

QiGong's burgeoning popularity has generated a plethora of both violently skeptical and credulously New-Agey essays. Rather than taking either on faith, you can actually experience internal Qi for yourself and make up your own mind as to its value, using this volume as a guide. Lam Kam-Chuen is one of a tiny handful of QiGong teachers who are fully qualified to write a practical instruction manual geared to the average Western person.

The acting here is good enough for the simple dialogue and story and the visuals are great. I guess some people expected to see dinosaurs. Sorry, wrong eon."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can't just excuse away the glaring historical innacuracies of this film by taking the word Fiction into your description.","review":"Horrible. Just Horrible. \\"Historical Accuracy be D@mned!\\" must have been the cry of the people who produced this Idiotic movie that I was unable to sit through. I got to the scene with the big Velociraptor/Ostrich things and that was it for me. Not to mention that Horses were not domesticated for thousands of years after the movie was meant to take place. If you want a mindless popcorn movie with some impressive special effects, knock yourself out. If you want to see a good movie about prehistoric man, check out Quest for fire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nonsensical","review":"I had not expected much but this was even worst than I feared. Basically, it's a \\"Last of the Mohicans\\" wanna-be movie but the script is nonsensical. It's based on the borderline crackpot theory espoused by some that there were advanced human civilizations before the last Ice Age, spawned by refugees from Atlantis. Too many things defy a suspension of disbelief, however; I won't go through them all.To cut to the point: while not the worst movie I've ever seen, this is a bad film. I would have been pissed if I would have paid full price to see it in the theater (or to buy this DVD).Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey, it's a fun movie, really.","review":"I just love to tag the idiots who think they're so smooth panning a movie because they're above it all. Get a life! If you wrote a review you must have seen, or heard others comment. It was good, clean fun, not action packed idiocy throughout - some just don't get that.

Just one example of the silliness you won't be able to suspend your disbelief over. I won't even start on the historical / geographical nonsense. Did i mention it was boring?

Needless to say, the hero killed the \\"God\\" and when the veil was removed, the \\"God\\" was an old grey-haired guy. The CGI of the Saber Tooth Tiger was laughable...

If you don't expect more than that it does the job. The story could have been more sophisticated, but the rich landscapes and the detailed CG prehistoric creatures make it quite believeable. The trailer was a bit misleading as it puts the emphasis on the creatures, whereas they have a rather minority role in this story.I'd recommend it on Blu-ray rather than DVD if you watch it over a large enough screen, as it is mostly a visual story. There are epic battle scenes (an Emmerich speciality), but I think the movie goes beyond that.Also there are more efficient top notch image blu-rays (Planet Earth series, Pixars, etc.).Don't set your expectations too high and you'll enjoy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing","review":"I was very disapointed in this film.

There was no effort made to explain where the 'god' came from, what kind of powers he had (how he got all these people to obey him) or the background for this weird civilization.

Its slow and boring, not a lot of good if any decent acting, the cinematography is well done at least so it looks pretty as does Camilla, though once again she's not terribly expressive or that good of an actress. The battle sequence at the end is fairly underwhelming and just kinda there, sure there are some decent visual effects but when the story and dialogue aren't that energetic it makes for a long and boring alleged epic. * out of 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rivals Battlefield Earth...","review":"...in being quite possibly the most horrible, illogical movie ever made.

First, the story line is a ripoff of Mel Gibson's Apocalypto. Then, the constant anachronisms make it irritating to watch. 10,000 BC and you have guys riding horses and carrying metal swords. The Bronze Age was still a few thousand years away. Pyramid building in the age of the sabertooth and wooly mammoth! Yikes! I assume the story was taking place on the African continent because of all the African tribes; the heroes had to cross what looked like the Sahara desert, but at 10,000 BC the Sahara was a great big grassland. On and on these anachronisms went, so many that it was impossible to maintain the suspension of disbelief that is necessary to get into a movie. I'm willing to give a director dramatic license in order to make a good story, but in this case, he really abused it."},{"rating":"1","title":"what were they thinking??","review":"OK, I watched it. I was curious to see where things went so I watched it to the end. When it was over, I wished I had waited for it to come on television and not pay the rental fee.It has all the classic themes: good v/s evil; them v/s us; a group can conquer most things; love will survive. Hmmmm...The special effects were okay. The sabre tooth tiger could have been much better, but the mammoths and birds were great!What I didn't like: historically completely out of line with vast differences in dress, language and technology... and animals for that matter. I'm suprised a phone booth didn't pop up somewhere.The scenery was great, filming great, costumes I'm not sure about, music very good/appropriate. Acting was as good as it was gonna get.This movie should have been geared toward children, it would definitely suit them. It does have plot, action, special effects and a moral.

Yes, they look the same as us, but again not every movie has a crazy budget. Some producers/directors are more into how they can make us relate to the characters.In todays world it's easier to relate if they A: speak the same language and B: look similar. Those things draw more people in.So, if you want to be drawn into a movie just because it's good then see this.If you're only watching it because you're looking for historical accuracy, don't bother, you'll be very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Judge a book by it's Cover.","review":"I went go see this movie thinking it would be a wild action ride of a movie like the preview made it out to be. I was wrong big time it was very slow and drawn out throughout most of the movie. Also I know it is a movie but it was just so historically innacurate. They had domesticated horses which weren't around until 4000 BC. The only animals domesticated back then were Dogs, Sheeps, and Goats. They also used hancuffs which werent invented until at least 1 A.D. if not later. The story is also riduculous. So I am just giving you a warning I never received this movie stinks.

I liked all the bc animals...mammoths, sabertooth cat. Liked the spiritual link between the human and animals, and that the tribe was led by a \\"mother goddess high priestess\\". All together it was a fun, adventurous, good natured movie. No pointless blood or sex in every scene which I find boring and mind numbing.

You can make a movie without a semblance of a plot. What you can't do is make it boring, and that is this movie's biggest fault. I was not expecting much from this film, either.I'm giving this movie one star, but an extra star for the digital copy.

While I fully enjoyedThe Ballad of Jack and Rosewith Daniel Day Lewis, I did not recognize Camilla Belle until I started looking at her credits. As Evolet, she is certainly the belle of the ball at this tribal gathering. Mona Hammond does a nice job as the Old Mother. New Zealand actor Cliff Curtis who was inFracture (Widescreen Edition)does well as the faithful Tic Tic. This film about the Yaghal tribe falls apart as the story becomes so farfetched. However, the cinematography made it pretty to look at. Two weeks after I saw the film, I struggled to recall much about it; so I think it probably is forgettable. Belle & Strait are worth watching.

No plot, cheesey CGI, and poor action scenes doom this to obscurity. The only saving grace (and hence a second star) is some of the landscape scenery, but even this is lessened by the characters jumping from snowy mountaintops to steamy jungle to arid desert in about 5 minutes of walking. Anachronisms abound, and even if you turn off your brain (a prerequisite for making it through the movie) it just isn't that good.

When it arrived, I was moving to a new home and this would be our only breakfast table. When I openned the package, the pedestal was cracked in several places. One chair arm was also cracked. I had to put them together and hope they would hold until the company sent a replacement. The company (Visiondecor) was very slow to respond and required photos of the damage. I had to send the photos twice which caused more delay. They then wanted me to return the pedestal before they would send a replacement. No telling how long this would have taken. I tried to pay for a replacement and they would not consider this approach. Since time was dragging on, I gave up and paid a handyman to have the pedestal repaired (rebuilt). Don't count on customer service from this company!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD COMPANY","review":"This company is very deceptive. It does not care about their customers. They also DO NOT stand behind their product.The table looks like its better quality than it Really is. You are gambling by making a purchase through this company.....Good Luck. Wonder why they reduced the price by $500............Look out for a bad beat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing to write home about...","review":"This book is \\"ok,\\" I wouldn't go beyond that. The use of simplified and traditional Chinese is nice, but not necessary. My main complaints are that this book does not explain the grammar enough. Beyond this the lesson content is a bit over the top. The whole \\"Deng Xiaoping\\" argument in chapter two is a bit OUTDATED. This is not 1990. Also, there is a chapter where someone visits a monk to talk about love (Chapter 9). This book also gets so increasingly difficult once you hit chapter 8 its insane. This book might be alright for people that are learning 4th year Chinese and have a thorough understanding of Chinese grammatical principles for the three previous years. Also note- it has very UGLY illustrations, actually they are more \\"hideous\\" than not. Some of the lessons are helpful, but I don't think a student should use this book unless they have a vocabulary of at least 1200-1500 words PRIOR to starting this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did any Chinese learners actually read this before they published it?","review":"The dialogue in the book is reasonably interesting and challenging, but it really speaks poorly of the authors when they can't even bother to list all of the new vocabulary that gets used in the book. Granted, it's not part of a series, but by the 14th chapter, I had to look up no less than 30 words to understand 2 pages of dialog. I meticulously keep track of all vocabulary that I have ever learned and so it's impossible that I just forgot it. This really just gives students a lot of unnecessary frustration. I can understand you might miss a word here and there, but 30+???. Come on guys. Have a student read the thing before you publish it and mark all the words he had to look up, add those to the new word list. I seriously hope the problems are fixed in the 2nd edition of this book, but I doubt I'll bother ever reading it to find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book.","review":"I found pronounciation errors in this book and some times they use the wrong character."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book needs lots of improvement!","review":"I've tried this book/cassettes and it's not a bad book, but it's just needs some improvement. First, it needs to be in PINYIN! All the texts are in chinese characters and not pinyin. Secondly, translation paralleling the text would be extremely helpful. It has none! Thirdly, the people who speak on the tapes are not trained in \\"play-acting\\". They just read but do not have a realistic dialogue between 2 Chinese. Better and clearer voices are needed to speak in the recording. I understand that the purpose of \\"intermediate/advance\\" book is for the student to look up words/vocabularies by themselves but since it is for self-study purpose it is so extremely time-consuming to do it by one-self."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super warm mid-layer","review":"This lightweight, athletic fit, type of stretch jacket really traps heat well. It's a fantastic layer for under an outer layer (wool coat or ski jacket). Although Arcteryx and the online companies that sell Arcteryx hype this jacket as \\"windproof\\", and it is---that's what helps trap the body heat, I've experienced the entire jacket getting cold when it is worn as an outer layer when it's under 40 degrees. But under a good wool jacket, I can stay out in 20 degree weather for hours. I used it sitting on stand deer hunting. I can attest to its heat trapping ability. Great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Persistence Rewarded","review":"More than most books on the teaching of the Buddha, this one requires persistence (just as meditation does) for its reward.

I feel that I need to pump about 5 times the product just to feel like my face has been thoroughly cleansed. I'm not wild about the smell, either. And if you're a makeup wearer, you definitely need something stronger (even if you use makeup remover beforehand)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light Weight, Great Cleansing Power","review":"I suffer from hyper-pigmentation and am always searching for products that fade dark spots while maintaining breakouts and are non-irritating. I heard of the Ambi line for women of deeper complexions and so far I love this cleanser!The foam stays true to the idea that less is more as about two pumps delivers enough to wash off makeup and dirt with none left behind. The salicylic keeps my pimples at bay and I have not had one since using this cleanser for about 3 weeks now. The fragrance is not overbearing and this balances the removal of oil without over drying. I have combination skin (oil on t-zone and chin) and usually use toner after cleansing to remove the extra oil but since using this I do not feel excessively oily as the day goes on.No white heads or clogged pores and my skin does feel fresh without that tight feeling. So far I have not seen a drastic change in dark spots but I plan on continued use."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING","review":"Cleared my skin up RIGHT away and made it wicked smooth.

It shows sunny and bright in the worst storms and cloudy and raining on sunny days."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very handy and simple unit","review":"This unit is quite handy for quick and simple information. Basically it gives you time & date, temp and humidity indoors, outside temp, and a forecast which is essentially a trend reading of barometric pressure. It works fine and you get alomst trained to look at it every day. I live in Wisconsin so our weather can be extreme and its been right on all along. - 2 things to note though. 1. Try and place it somewhere so it stays dry for the most part. When it gets wet the batteries run dry VERY fast (like 1 month). 2. With that in mind, use good batteries. I gave it 4 stars due to the battery issue mainly and some RCC setup issues. I'd like to say 4.75 but did not have that option."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, accurate, easy to set up....","review":"I love this thing. First of all, those of you that said this unit is difficult to set up, do not know how to read directions! TIP YOU MUST INSTALL THE BATTERIES IN THE OUTDOOR SENSOR FIRST! This unit is very accurate. I live in Wisconsin and the weather changes by the hour. I love being able to see the outdoor temperture at a glance. The weather forecaster has been supprisingly accurate. If it says it's sunny, it's almost always sunny. If it says its raining/snowing its usually snowing or going to snow. Not to mention this unit is very attractive. It's not too big either. I recommend it to anyone. I even bought one for my father in-law, a great Christmas present for the one who has everything or loves gadgets!"},{"rating":"2","title":"works good","review":"I followed the instuctions to get the weather station to work and had no problem.

I installed it as directed, put in new batteries as directed, and followed all of the installation and location suggestions. After a couple of years the temperature sensor stopped working.I contacted La Crosse Technology and eventually contacted Allan McCormick, President and Founder, and Scott Shies, Customer Service Manager and a direct report of Allan's.Scott, with the full knowledge of Allan basically told me tough, buy a new one. He stated that the manufacturer told them to only warranty the product for 12 months. When I pointed out that if it was taken care off, installed properly, it should work for more than two years, his response was \\" buy a new one\\".As an aside the retailer was more than willing to send me a new sensor, but La Crosse could care less.Understand this company before you buy their products. They do not support them."},{"rating":"1","title":"The outdoor sensor just does not work.","review":"I bought it as present to my parents. However the ourdoor sensor does not work.

Tried everything, including reading all instructions on their support site, which were horribly complicated. and watching their videos.Ever notice how makers of a bad product do not offer a live customer support phone number on their web site - or they bury it?In fairness, this is my second unit - the first one worked fine for 7 years, until the batteries leaked. Bottom line, this product hasn't been improved for years. The screen is hard to read, the equipment is temperamental. Before you buy, suggest checking out their web site and reading the manual.Returned the item to Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is a must have","review":"I use it before I go out to know otside currect temperature. I have 2 weather stations one in my bedroom and one in the office. Very accurate and reliable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product for the price","review":"We've found this weather station to be accurate, attractive and just a nice little gadget to have around. The indoor and outdoor temps are always correct within a degree or two, and once you put the batteries in, it practically sets itself using the signal from the US atomic clock. It would be nice if the display was backlit so I could see it in the dark, and it was a bit smaller that I expected (should have looked more closely at the dimensions, I guess). As for complaints about forecast accuracy, this unit is just as good as the guy on channel 5, and that's without whatever Accu-Nex-Sat-Rad technology they employ."},{"rating":"2","title":"LaCrosse Technologh WS-7014CH Wireless Weather Station","review":"The item works well,shipped and was received on time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Temp Wrong","review":"This product does not read the correct temp. no mater how close it is set to the other part of the unit.
