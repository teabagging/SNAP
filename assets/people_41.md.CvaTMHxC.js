They did the same thing on the PLaystation software series, and I seriously thought they would have learnt how annoying it is for consumers (putting greed ahead of customer value).5 out of 5 for the concept, 1 out of five for Customer treatment (again)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best idea worst design","review":"I must admit first off I found myself more impressed than let down. I never tought these games would look and play so much like the arcade versions it blew me away. However, two major flaws came in arcade remaster perfections way. Sadly my atari has a better joystick than this sad to say for a product retailing at 30 dollars. The button isn't very responsive and it takes many trys to fire. Secondly it takes batteries when it really doesn't need to. Worst yet they are 6 Volt batteries where can you even buy those? If namco were going to make such a cheap joystick they should have made it a system and provided different joysticks. However what really makes this never the less a four star is these games are exactly like the arcade!

I wanted a book that covered game physics and could help me reconnect to the math I was using on the job. But this book, while covering every topic I was interested in does a very poor job of explaining what is going on. The author often throws out a complex equation with no explanation of the terms and transforms the equation into a seemingly different variation with all new terms and zero effort to tie them together. The code is too agnostic, and not useful for reading or using. I am back at amazon looking for a better book, this one is to simple for someone versed in the math and lacks the explanations needed to help someone get back up to speed on the subjects.

The result is a lifeless walk through a hodgepodge of references, humourless, boring to the extreme and not really interesting for the fans of the above mentioned fields. The text displays a false depth with no relation to the extremely slim narrative plot. When you think he has also authored the truly excellent \\"League\\"... you wonder what demon got into him."},{"rating":"2","title":"This might be interesting","review":"Alan Moore decides to share his ideas on religion and magic with the world. To make it more palatable, he chooses to interweave it with a conventional super-heroine comic, and in volume 3, she sets off on a literal journey through the Kaballah (and finishes it in volume 4) seeking a dead comrade.If you are already neck-deep in mysticism and magic and Kaballah and stuff, this book might prove to have novelty value. The art is quite amazing, and is always appropriate to the subject matter.If you have no interest in magic, religion, or any of that, then do not buy this book. You will be confused and bored.If on the other hand you are new to magic, and wish for a stepping stone to deeper waters, I suggest this series as an excellent \\"get your feet wet\\" exercise.

It is impossible to pour from this carafe without dripping all over the counter. The method we've learned to use, is to partially open the lid while pouring however, this also means your thumb is subject to scalding hot steam which escapes right at the handle hinge.

Then, with the lid held up as you pour, the condensation that has built up under the lid drips onto the counter as you tip the pot.Also the filter basket doesn't fit into it's position without a trial and error method.I'll be back in the market soon for a different pot and don't think i'll consider anything from Delonghi."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't buy it again","review":"Very dissatisfied with this coffeemaker.

So the use of red is acceptable (in fact, preferred) by me; it's the fact that the ink used in the book is a bit \\"neon\\" that detracts from the experience.

There are some great reviews on this page for this extraordinary album and I'm just another voice to endorse this work. Whatever you might expect - DON'T. There is humour here, pathos, and total dis-orientation. This album is way out in left-field, like the little schitzophrenic voice that torments all our souls from time to time. Give in to it! Take time-out from whatever you are into to get a whole new perspective of what music is capable of. This is Jazz not because of the sax stabs but because there is an improvisational logic to Nordines crazy stories. It is surrealism for the same reason. There is a stream-of-consciousnees feel to these tales. The net effect is slightly unnerving but great fun nevertheless.

The best choice the writers ever made was dumping him to the curb for Christopher Lloyd for the rest of the series. You'll notice his face isn't even on the box art. There's good reason for that. Nonetheless, if you can blot him out (like CBS did when they put this together) the episodes of the first season were pretty darn good.There are however some minor audio issues with this first set.

I couldn't wait to watch the two episodes per night starting at 10 pm, a good way to end the night.So it was with a comforting pleasure when I finally purchased season 1 of Taxi and popped the DVD into the player and witnessed the fun all over again. This particular set contains 3 discs in three separate thin/plastic DVD boxes. The first two disc contains 8 episodes each while disc 3 contains 6 episodes.There are no special features, commentaries, etc. Subtitles are not included. But picture and sound quality is top-notch.

The footage is old, faded, and out of focus. The Hitler Diaries contain NO narration, only a poorly base-balled text over the actual image which is distracting at best. The Rape of Nanking is rank amateur, as well. Save your money and purchase other quality documentaries.

There are 19 tracks, all untitled. The mixes are not flawless but is forgivable because it is supposedly live. Qbert's track selection is amazingly diverse, and often silly.

Janet took a sample from America's Ventura Highway, to make this song romantic, upbeat, catchy and chart topping. After listening to her recent work, I explored her past hits and purchased all her albums. Now I'm a Janet fan, and I owe most of it to this song.The reason I gave this CD only 4 stars, is because I wanted more. Releasing only a 2-track single in the US is a waste.

This mat keeps things OFF the bottom of the sink, but also allows air to flow underneath it to help it dry better. However, for those of us with hard water, rust may still occur, but because of the microbial coating, it tends to almost just wipe off. What manufacturers might want to consider in future outings in sinkware is to make them not out of chrome, but stainless steel --- that way, there's no rust.

Thereafter the author gets into basics of energy, entropy and engines which at best could be an introduction on the subject for high school students.The various sources of energy, the issues of global warming, waste disposal, cost and feasibility are explained well, but again lack the depth that one would expect from serious reading on these topics.However I would certainly recommend this book to all those who would like to have an overview of the current and future energy sources, but lack formal education in science and engineering.It would be appropriate to rename the book - \\"Energy, Engines and Environment - An Introduction\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"the end of oil","review":"A simple easily read and understood description of the mess we are in written by one of the great teachers of the modern era.

His analysis of possible future energy sources seems generally correct, but his discussion is too brief to convey much information.

This book has a scene in the first third where the young girl describes a scene of exposure between children and describes it as strengthening friendship. I'm not sure what the author's intention was for her character development, but young children unguided and reading this passage are bound to come away with a problematic message, particularly if they later run into an abuse attempt by an adult or older child in their own lives.This may be an excellent book for adults, and a book that may be good for young adults after circumspection, but it is definitively not a book for children and needs to be classified clearly.

Alanis Morisette is not a good artist because of wonderful singing voice, she is a great artist because of the purely unique approach she takes to everything, including singing. She doesn't have the voice of Mariah Carey or Faith Hill, and that's GOOD. Every syllable is packed with emotion and enunciatined in just the right way to get across what she wants to get across. THIS is a sad attempt at making Alanis Morisette's music more...pop-y.

You would think that the antenna would be inside the system, but no, it is in the headphones, which means if you lose the headphones, you're screwed.

I had to call customer service seven or eight times and was met with an uncooperative computer, operators who were not knowledgeable of helpful in any way and I was put on hold and hung up on repeatedly.

I tried to use it for construction work and it was impossible.The ear buds are no better and even though I'm working out in the middle of a field, the signal drops off constantly.

On the bus in New York City, it's great because they put up tons of relays near Sirius headquarters. Once I leave NYC, specifically .25 miles outside the Lincoln Tunnel on the NJ side, the signal goes dead. There are plenty of windows on the bus so this is unacceptable.The device froze/started skipping when I paused the Stern show.

I also have an S50, and it is without question the superior device (at a much more reasonable price). I'm not knocking Sirius, because it's a fantastic service.

For all the author's obvious knowledge about horses, I question her motives in writing a book where every horse suffers terribly. I found very little to like about the heroine (Nate) and, once she passively allowed Twister to die, I could never forgive her.

I was angry that Nate was so impotent in her communiccation with Pierce and others. She could have been an advocate for Twister and the other horses but instead contributes to the death spiral. She could have made a difference in both human and equine lives and let her loss produce a positive. Show us the healing that takes place when you connect with a horse!

Once again, while reading In the Presence of Horses, I have been able to immerse myself in horses.This is not a happy story and our heroine, Natalie, does not emerge as a perfect role model but it's a story filled with believable emotion, characters you will recognize and a dose of reality about living with horses.I've recommended this book to all my horse-loving friends, and even given it as a surprise gift to others. It's good enough to share."},{"rating":"1","title":"A miserable book","review":"No horse lover would want to read this book--it's totally depressing. One star is more than it deserves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating reading","review":"I am not a horse lover, but this book captured me from the start. I enjoyed every page of it, had trouble leaving it, and bonded with each character. I would recommend it to all who enjoy good fiction. To horse lovers I would think it to be a must. It is about relationships, love, committment and the courage it takes to proceed beyond the surface. Well written, and tugs at your heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN ENGROSSING STORY NOT JUST FOR HORSE LOVERS","review":"I FOUND THIS AN ABSORBING STORY. THE AUTHOR OBVIOUSLY KNOWS, LOVES AND UNDERSTAND HORSES, BUT ALSO KNOWS AND UNDERSTANDS HUMANS AND THEIR FAILINGS AS WELL. THE WAY THE STORY DEVELOPS THROUGH NATALIE'S WORK WITH THE HORSES KEEPS THE READER WITH HER. THE CHAPTER WHERE TWISTER DIES IS EXTREMELY MOVING, AND THE END KEEPS THE READER WONDERING AS WELL. I THOUGHT THIS WAS BETTER THAN THE HORSE WHISPERER AS THE CHARACTERS, BOTH HUMAN AND EQUINE WERE REALLY DRAWN FROM LIFE."},{"rating":"1","title":"In the Presence of Horses","review":"I DID NOT like this book. It kept shifting tenses, and oddly enough, the present tense indicated the past. It had very little to do with horses. The girl in the story is totally irresponsible, leaving a job with no advance warning. The end is TERRIBLE. Perhaps she is trying to leave it open for a sequel, but it was depressing and very poorly done!!!! This girl had more to work out than horses could help her with. I took it as soon as I had finished it to a used bookstore. It sure isn't my kind of book!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"When the book jacket compells you, head to the register..","review":"Waiting for a plane on the other side of the world I spotted IN THE PRESENCE OF HORSES. Having recently moved to Eastern PA, and with the possibility of working with horses in the near future, I was immediately taken by this book. Natalie's story is not unlike like that of many of us who have travelled, trying to find our way. Along with her we learn about life in a boarding stable and how teaching young girls to care for horses can teach us how to care for ourselves. With a somewhat mysterious air, we learn details of Natalie's past history and how it has shaped her psyche. With startling honesty it reveals how sometimes, circumtances totally out of our control help us find our way. This will tempt the reader to examine their own life decisions. I look forward to a possible sequel to learn more about the other characters we come to know in this story of one women's search to find her place among the people and animals who make up her world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing, depressing, depressing!","review":"Although I love horses and books that have horses in them, this book was a disaster. Most of the horses die, most of the people die and I really didn't see any great change in the main character's life. Like I said before, this was a depressing book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A horsewoman who loved this book...","review":"I have worked with horses on and off all my life. I grew up riding, having learned at the age of three from my beloved grandfather. I worked as a groom and trainer for some years. I can attest to the accuracy of life this author portrays within her novel. Even if you just look at the surface, it's a good book.But delve deeper and you find yourself involved in the private torments of a woman from whom life has taken much, and to whom little was given. The plotline is sad, yes. The horses, some of them, die, yes. This reflects real life. Horses that we dearly love, sometimes, horribly, die bad deaths, despite our efforts. This book does leave us with hope at the end, that despair can be overcome, that life brings with it the seeds of joy, that the spirit of one beloved horse can be sensed in the struggle to live of another small foal. Take a chance, try this story and see..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't say I enjoyed it, but I'm not sorry I read it.","review":"The horse ascept of the story, mainly Part One, was very interesting. For those who enjoy horses and especially anyone who has had a horse as a part of their teen years will indentify with the bonding the main character, Nate, has with the unique horse, Twister. But after the moment of truth and the startling conclusion to Part One, the story is far too depressing. The theme of death is too heavy handed. Granted the issue of love and loss is important in all our lives. The theme seems to be encapsulated in Nate's eventual realization that, \\"without a willingness to suffer, we keep nothing in our lives.\\" I would not recommend for troubled teens or anyone struggling with mental illness, specially depression, there simply is not enough hope or constructive responses to tragedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A powerful and challenging read: Are you strong enough?","review":"Written by an obviously capable horsewoman, \\"In the Presence of Horses\\" speaks to all who have ever felt alone on this earth. But for the powerful and vibrant presence of horses, the main character in this novel would have long ago withdrawn herself from the world, not just from the company of other people. For the discerning presence of one horse in particular, she makes an arduous journey back into a world of human selfishness and compassion. Mildly psychologically disturbing, this book truly tests the capacity to empathize. It is not just for horse people, but for horse people, there is an added bonus: Dimmick has masterfully and subtly captured what is perhaps the most compelling reason for our love affair with these great animals. Thirty-some year old Natalie simplifies the undefinable when, speaking of the old, wise broodmare, she states: \\"I want to be just like her when I grow up.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly, utterly depressing!","review":"After reading some of the 'favorite book' lists here at Amazon, I decided to check this book out. Once you get past the first third of the book, it just gets more and more depressing - and then at the end, all hope and joy is totally dissipated.I was hoping for an uplifting story involving horses, instead (as has been stated by other reviewers here) everyone dies or is in comas, there is no light anywhere here.Thankfully, I checked the book out from the library, so all I lost was the time I spent slogging through this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"In The Presence of Horses","review":"Well what can I say, I totally agree with all you one star-ers. What I enjoyed most about this book was reading about the author's knowledge of horses.Anything else totally unenjoyable. I came to the conclusion that this book was about people that were miserable and completely content to remain so at the expense of those beautiful loving creatures, the ones that died needlessly, because there carer decided to go on a pilgrimage of doom and gloom. As if she needed to.You couldn't get a more depressing story."},{"rating":"1","title":"In the Presence of Horses","review":"The first part of this book is wonderful. The author's knowledge of the horse is apparent. Then the book takes a grave turn for the worse. I was very dissappointed at the character who I initially hailed for her bravery & stamina, but then turns and runs away (again it seems) when life gets too tough for her. I about stopped reading the book. What happened to the theory: If you fall off - then get back on! The author has the opportunity to protray a wonderfully strong (woman) character along side a spiritual & magnificent animal. It's too bad she didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too depressing to be believable.","review":"This book disappoints. The characters are so miserable I found them unbelievable. Dimmick certainly knows horses, but it wasn't enough to hold the novel together."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great live CD on all levels","review":"So I am a relative newcomer to the bands music, but I have seen them live. Although I agree that this CD is not nearly as magical as the real show, I have yet to hear a live CD that is the same as the experience. And isn't this the whole concept of recorded sound in the first place, to try and imitate the live event. We all know an imitation is never as good as the real thing. Seeing them in concert makes this CD even more special because the memory of the show can live on in your head over and over.A great selection of songs from a great band to. This CD had all of my favorites, and I love this version of Puptent (the album version never quite did it for me). If you are a luna fan it is a must have, and this would be the second album after Bewitched I would recomend to a newcomer."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Album Rocks! Ba, Ba, Ba-BaBaBa!","review":"This was my first Luna record. What a way to begin!! I listened to the first couple of tracks on numerous occasions at the listening booths of numerous music stores and eventually broke down and bought it, mainly for the wonderfully enticing rendition of \\"Bewitched.\\" Upon listening to the album in its entirety, and on a decent stereo, I was utterly amazed and completely smitten with this wonderous band. I have since bought a few of their other recordings and also had the opportunity to seem the band perform live down in Providence. This disk is perfect for both the Luna novice and the long-time fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great series","review":"This is a great series, and all of them are good.

My husband and I had watched it on PBS years ago and really enjoyed it, so I purchased this as a gift for my husband this Christmas.It is just one episode of a series called \\"Medieval Siege\\" and runs a little under 1 hour. This episode shows two teams making two different types of trebuchets based on drawings and writings from the age of castle warfare. They're made (mostly) by using original techniques and are compared by seeing how they fare against the wall of a castle constructed specially for this show.My only complaint is that I would have liked to see more detail about how the trebuchets were built. It seemed like everything was pared down to fit it into an hour-long show, and it could have been easily a 90-minute show. Also, the DVD is a little pricey for the short length. But hey, trebuchets!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This DVD just shows growned up guys playing around with more complicated toys, attempting to built a trebuchet.

It seemed like a 100 meter sprint, run in molases. Not one of the Warhammer 40,000/Black Librarys best.

Some of the worst text-on-paper I've ever read, the characters were ridiculous, the plot was absurd, the only redeeming feature was the description of the kid's mutation, but that's maybe two pages worth out of the whole thing. So less than 1% of this book is worth reading.Then it had the gall to have such a cliche ending as it did. After the crap sundae that was this book, that was the corn niblet on top to solidify it as the worst thing I've ever read, not one single redeeming feature to it.Although granted, I haven't read anything by C.S. \\"Multilaser\\" Goto yet, I hear he's really bad too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read motivational","review":"Get Out Of Your Boxx!

He was a great teacher and his book's style and way of conveying business concepts was equally satisfying. This is not a book for the scholar, rather it is a very good book for those that want a quick, but substantive way to grasp the basics of everyday business. The title also belies Dr. Levin's laid back and easy-going style and sense of humor. He teaches and writes using sometimes folksy, but always perceptive stories and examples of the concepts and points he is trying to convey. If you want to get the basics of how a business operates, how cash flow works and why it is important, why \\"buying low and selling high\\" are not only simple concepts but critical guidelines for any business, of any size or scale or complexity . . . then Dr. Levin's book is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another bad experience","review":"I purchased this VCR/DVD recorder for it's ability to dub family videos to DVD and to allow my children to watch old movies we have on tape.

Seems like they may be sorry for offering that warranty now. Of course you will need to pay to ship your unit in for repair out of your own pocket, not to mention the inconvenience of the shipping and being without a unit you paid good money for.

Ten out of ten for so much research but not many out of ten for entertainment value, (and, yes, even an instruction manual can be enetertaining)....

I know many of the people quoted in the book and it seems to portray things fairly for the most part. Some of the people interviewed for the book obviously have an agenda. Surprisingly, there are more characters portrayed in this book than in your average Oliver Stone movie.The book was rather long (sometimes less is more) but it is not bad considering it is the only book on Domain Names other than DNS & Bind - it is a good start.

Although it appears to be essentially comprehensive in its treatment of the expansion period, it is at times episodic, and subjects that Ms. Limerick favors understandably are given more coverage. By the way, although it's a good book, I didn't buy it because I was enthralled, I bought it because I couldn't find it at the library.

Of course the people mentioned have their greatness and have been all great leaders, but I am doing hard to relate them to myself. Therefore I got annoyed about the examples.

I was certainly annoyed by the authors' unrestrained endorsement of all things on the left side of the political spectrum (i.e. Obama, Gore, global warming, etc). There wasn't a lot of heavy thought put into the writing of this book, and the use of workbook-style questions for the reader seems to have been a device by the authors for adding content to an otherwise unoriginal collection of management clichés.

The path to God is not an easy one, living twenty-four hours a day in a religious community demanding strict, constant and honest monitoring of one's inner life and thoughts. Gabrielle's personal honesty and recognition of her shortcomings combine to make her personal pilgrimage toward humility seem as an unassailable mountain, the summit moving further from her reach with each passing year, rather than closer. She struggles to shed the pride in her past academic excellence and the pride in being the daughter of an eminent specialist in tropical medicine, and with the advent of war she confronts her ultimate battle when she recognizes that seeds of hate have germinated within her heart, and anchored themselves deep within her soul.

The only other drawback is trying to find a free channel to tune it to. Where I live and drive, there's not much of the FM spectrum left unused, so I find a lot of interference with nearby stations, and have to try new frequencies in some parts of town.

There's tons of static and the music cuts out all the time. The only time this FM transmitter works is when my car is still.

Out in the sticks where there are a lot of open frequencies it works fine.Update: As long as you do not live in a metro area like I do Chicago that has a lot of stations and little/no free channels.

During the quiet parts the unit will shut itself off causing my car audio to emit a ear piercing screech when it loses the signal. I haven't measured it but it seems like as little a 10-15 seconds of quiet causes this behavior.This makes this unit useless for classical music and quite a bit of jazz and other similar styles. If you listen to quiet music, avoid at all costs. If you don't it is the best transmitter I have tried.Sirandar"},{"rating":"2","title":"rather nice","review":"With the Kensington FM Transmitter...I like that there is no need for batteries. The presets are nice too. Sound quality is definitely good - only issue would be in the cities, having to adjust the stations to find one with no interference.

However, let me say that this would be a perfect costume accompaniment to a normal pirate costume. It has ties that fit and would hold well over various size shoulders.

It would not clip onto his shoulder and ended up being more of a bummer at the party than anything. As a result, he was very sad that he did not get to wear it! I can't speak to the item's quality if it were used for an adult costume, but for a 4-year old, it was a bust.

The disc is very tedious and drawn out way more than it needs to be. You have to watch the instructions for each calibration but they are so long and in depth it's ridiculous. I would much prefer simple concise instructions. Futherrmore this disc did not make a noticeable difference in my picture. I have a Sony Bravia TV and the Standard picture setting is very good.

I really liked the audio portion for speaker setup as they use a voice instead of that test tone which helped me find a problem with how I had hooked up my 7.1 speakers. The only part I found lacking was that unless you buy a meter to measure sound you pretty much have to adjust your speakers to your preference instead of being able to balance them professionally.

If you don't know much about American photography you may find it interesting, it is well written and easy to read. If you are already well informed about the work of classic American photographers like Walker Evans, Stieglitz, etc then this won't strike you as an especially interesting book.

It won't teach you anything about the nature of photographs, why the great photographers are great, general aesthetics, etc., but it is an entertaining read from an engaging writer. Imagine the best kind of sprawling human interest piece from your favorite publication that, instead of an out-of-the-way attraction like an adorable small east-coast town with an old rail car diner, uses the enterprise of photography as its focal point for the author's impressions.

The musty odor from his skin also has disappeared. I have talked to a Veterinary allergist and she also told me to make dietary changes, that it could also be his food that was causing the abundance of yeast.

I didn't realize how much it was really working until I ran out, so I ordered two more boxes. I've kind of hit a plateua, so I am going to increase the amount...there's a good article [...] on how to use Threelac effectively. I'm also taking some acidophilus, B-12,adrenal and thyroid support and some supplements that help clean out parasites, which seem to go hand in hand with the candida.

Seems like a lot of hype...but perhaps it does work for some people, but just didn't work for me.

The candida infection really had me listless and even loosing time in my memories and just daily functioning.

The yeast in you GI are dying and they release toxic substances that make you feel sick. For that reason, you might want to start taking it on a Friday, so you can get some rest at the weekend. After this initial discomfort, I felt the way I wanted to feel for years: full of energy, able to wake up easily in the morning. I hope it does the same for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have been taking this product for 3 months and it is the best!

I followed all of the instructions on the box - took one pack per day with water, after a meal. The first two days went fairly smoothly. I experienced headaches and increased muscle pain, and wrote it off as the \\"die-off\\" everyone is talking about.On the third day, about 45 minutes after taking the packet I got, erm, 'explosive' diarrhea followed by very intense abdominal cramps for several hours. A full day later my digestive system is still not working OK.Be careful with threelac. Following the directions doesn't necessarily mean your body will be OK with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"Does not work.Expensive, noisy, bulky.

Thankfully this PetMate box was given to me because despite working better for a couple months, it now jams constantly. It's huge, litter gets scooped over the corners onto the floor, and scooped under the liner until I taped the edge down. I've torn it apart several times and still can't get the rake to stop binding up on the return stroke. I've just about had it with these \\"self cleaning\\" cat boxes, they're expensive and both have been more work than an ordinary litter box. Doesn't anyone make one that *works*?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"I bought my first one of these after my littermaid broke in August of last year.

The word is shoddy craftsmanship for Petmate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't make the same mistake that I made....","review":"I wanted a better solution to the old fashioned litter box. I bought the Purrforma Plus not realizing that you need to also buy their plastic liners trays and special plastic bags shaped exactly to fit the disposal box. That means you need to keep buying their products and can't use plastic grocery bags. In addition, it may be hard to believe, but the bags are very complicated to put on. Also, the rake sits at the back of the box (but not all the way back) so the cat can pee on the rake and behind the rake (anything behind the rake stays there). Lastly, the rake gets stuck on the lid and you have to keep fiddling with it to get it to work right. The Purrforma has done nothing but made me feel like I'm spending more time with my hands near urine and feces and I paid a lot of money to do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"great idea, poor implementation","review":"Just purchased this last week and returned it after 3 days.

AVOID, AVOID, AVOID."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great product, doesn't last","review":"We had one of the original littermaids (with 2 cats) and it lasted for almost 4 years before it finally died. I was actually surprised it lasted so long. But I was a little frustrated over the rake getting litter stuck to it. This litterbox has a metal rake, so we decided to give it a try. When we first got it, we realized one of our cats would not use it with the hood on. I think it got too stinky inside for him or something. After removing the hood, the cats seemed to like it; I liked that it had a liner for the bottom, and instead of plastic receptacles it took plastic bags (cheaper than littermaid), so monthly cleaning was a snap. Unfortunately it died after about a year, when it was no longer under warranty. I wouldn't recommend this box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Purchase","review":"I was so determined to find an easier way to deal with litter that I ignored all of the negative reviews for the Purrforma and purchased one anyway. BIG MISTAKE!! The motor has no power and gets stuck often. The rake leaves all of the urine so the litter becomes wet and stuck to the bottom of the liner, causing the rake to get stuck and an awful smell. The instructions claim that you can change the bags once a week and the liner once a month...WRONG!! I had to change the bags every other day and the liner was disgusting after just a week, and new liners cost over thirty dollars!! This box made my entire house smell terribly and my cats began to use the bathroom on the floor because the box was so gross, and I changed the bags and added fresh litter and a smell absorber every other day! Don't be stupid like me and ignore reviews, don't buy this product! The Purrforma is a waste of money and time, I only used it for two weeks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Product","review":"Don't waste your money on this. I bought one just over a year ago and it worked ok for about a month, but it would not scoop properly. After several months, I'd have to use a hand scooper to get most of the clumps left on the bottom and behind the rake. Do yourself a favor and spend a little bit more on a Litter Robot. The greatest litter box I've ever had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much $$$ for such Short Service!","review":"We were searching for an automatic litter box and found the PURRFORMA PLUS (hooded) claimed to do the job. It was more expensive than the others but offered the hood, liners, etc. It PURRFORMED well for about 9 months befor it began to act up. After one year we were cleaning it out ourselves because the sensor and/or motor (we are not sure) is not moving the grates. I called the company (PETMATE) several times and after all the diagnoses, they stated that it sounded like the mother had gotten wet. I said how could that be when the lid is covering the product? Then I asked if there were parts we could buy since the warranty had expired. The representative told me no and there were no plans to have any available. I think this is unfortunate that a company doesn't offer to repair (at a cost)products that are not under warranty or at least sell the parts. There are too many complaints on this one...don't buy it unless you want it for looks."},{"rating":"1","title":"waist of money","review":"This is a waist of money. The rake gets caught up on the lid and then it jams the littler box. I still use mine but the lid and the outside trim are in the basement. It was just a big waist of money.

I would not recomend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Performa(nce)!","review":"We have tried two of these unitsPURRFORMA PLUS XLG HOODED WH& they wear out between 6 and 9 months; we have four cats. The problem is the motor is too weak. I called the company to find out if they had any plans to put in a stronger motor. I was put through to someone in marketing and left a message but never received a call back. In the meantime, I tried the Omega Paw Self-CleaningOmega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box, Regular, Green and Beigeand it works beautifully. In fact, I bought two for less than half the price of one of the Purrforma. The Omega uses less litter, it takes far less time to clean, and does not require the expensive bags or trays. Definitely lo-tech and definitely worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"smelly box!","review":"I've owned this box for over a year now. I bought it thinking that it would solve my litter box scooping days, but instead it smells and is a hassle. I have a very messy kitty who likes to pee all over the sides of the box and on the rake itself. I have to agree with several other reviewers, the litter does clump behind the rake once the cat does its business and makes the box malfunction. Also, my cat seems to go to the bathroom frequently, so once the \\"trap\\" fills up, the vented closer does not seal and lets all the odors out. I gave the box the benefit of the doubt, it does a good job of scooping out the mess in the box, but it does a horrible job with odor control. There are better products out there for the same cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neat idea, poor quality product","review":"This sounded like a great idea, and it was in theory... but it broke after just over a year (as soon as the warranty expired, wouldn't you know), and it had various glitches even while it was mostly working.The final breakdown came when the sensors, four little \\"eyes\\" that are supposed to stop the automatic rake from completing if something (like a cat) is in the box, freaked out and decided that something was ALWAYS blocking the sensors. Always before, I emptied the box, scrubbed the sensors, and it worked again. At the end no amount of cleaning/clearing made any difference. It just ran a half-cycle (raked half the box) until the waste piled up, toppled over the top of the rake, and got packed behind it. What a mess.It wasn't worth the $$ for just over a year's service."},{"rating":"1","title":"so far so good..ended up not so good!","review":"I used the other brand, Littermaid, it lasted less than a year and cost me over $200 about a decade ago. I was upset that the motion detector could not be repaired/replaced and that the plastic rake plugged up all of the time. Due to the fact customer service was so unhelpful I vowed not to buy another Littermaid Auto litter cleaner. I find the Petmate easy to setup and keep in service. The stainless steel rake looks as if will last and is easy to clean. It took a while for me to figure out how the liners worked. It's nice how they seal off the scooped soiled litter and can be used over and over or just trashed with the litter in them.It broke down within a year, had to throw it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"I bought a purrforma JUMBoO MESS","review":"I also did not read any reviews.... What a mess! after having successfully used littermaids (have 2) I added this expensive JOKE!!!!Thought it might be better!????!!! SMELLS!!!

I have to use a scoop to clean this. What a waste of $$$$$$. The newer model littermaids are good. I would never buy this brand again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I'm so sorry I didn't read the online reviews before I bought this piece of junk. The rake sits too low and too far forward to be effective in cleaning out clumps of urine; there is always a good amount left behind the rake that causes the rake to get hung up and stall. I have to take the whole contraption apart just to clean the rake (on a daily basis, mind you) and at this rate it would have been better and cheaper to stick with a regular cat box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fancy Looks Take Your Money & Time","review":"These contraptions look great but just don't work. I tried a LitterMaid product very similar to this one. First, are you really willing to pay this much for a kitty litter box? Don't forget that you have to buy special easy-tie bags for this product (let's see; keep counting that money), then you need the 9-volt batteries (not included) and premium scoopable, clumping litter that is a tad more expensive than regular (Arm & Hammer is the best). The handy-dandy \`ramp rug' needs to be cleaned regularly and the Zeolite filter has to be replaced at least once a month (more money). It all looks good and care-free, but the reality is, that this is a gimmick that takes your time and money. Go simple, save money and use good Kitty Litter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perrforma PlusXL Self-Cleaning Litter Box","review":"I have five cats. I had a Litter Maid for about three years before it died and then bought this one. It is quieter than the Littermaid and it was also cheaper, but that is about all I can say about it.

You might as well use a normal litter box for as much as you have to clean the thing out manually anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible design","review":"My wife and I have two cats. We originally had a Littermaid Ultra automatic litterbox that seemed to work for us. It kept the litter fairly clean and was relatively trouble free. The motor gave out on it about three months ago after about four years of daily service. I purchased the Petmate thinking that it would be a superior product. I was mistaken. The rake continually jammed, the soiled litter liners were much more complicated to change, the tines on the litter rake were spaced to widely apart to really clean the litter and the item simply did not work. What ever you do, do not buy this product! I would give it negative stars if I could. It is now in the trash can and has been replaced with a conventional litterbox."},{"rating":"1","title":"I miss the no frills","review":"This is the worst thing ever. It is huge. It is an ordeal to clean. The rake gets stuck and goes back and forth constantly. I live in an apt so i have to unplug it at night so it won't wake me up. I just turned it on 5 minutes ago and it just stopped. It is slow, loud, and only picks up the big stuff. Most of the time things just get stuck in the rake and then it scoops it all behind the rake instead of in the waste bin. You'll end up scooping this thing regularly behind the rake otherwise it makes an awful noise. The roll things on the rake broke after one month. I even duck taped them so the one is staying together for now. It makes it a little less messy to scoop, but the point of the product is for NO scooping. I'd rather stick to my quiet no frills standard litter box than this hunk of junk. I am regretting not giving these reviews more credit before I bought this. I'll just try and get my money worth and wait till the motor dies."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a waste of money","review":"I am currently on my second machine in less than a year.

The plastic bag idea is why I orginally when in this direction. Who vents a cat box in the house, hello we want to vent I would open the door and let the cats out. This product is a piece of ;aldjfoiuewqr. The sad part is that I spent $200.00 buying it. The second nail in the coffin is the pan, I had no clue that there was more then one size. I will disconnect the power, put plastic bags in for liners and use the cat box the old fashion way.

Boy, was that ever a mistake. Less than 4 months old, it is a pile of junk. It got \\"stuck\\" routinely. The cover has to be lined up \\"just so\\" for the belt to drag the rake back properly. Heck, even when it WAS lined up \\"just so\\" it gave me a headache not working properly. I also observed the same thing as another reviewer with clumped liquid waste getting behind the rake and making it a pain to clean. Right now, it has quit raking all together, because I could never get it lined up just right and the motor went to \\"motor heaven\\".

This does not work! I told the lady that I had just cleaned the entire box and it was still clumping to the rake. I currently have 3 different types of boxes of litter and nothing helps the clumping on the rake. At this point I feel very violated after spending over $200 for this.

It is terrible at controlling odors. The rake doesn't remove waste clumps neatly so there are lots of bits and pieces left in the box. Cleaning out the waste tray is difficult. The tray is tiny so you have to clean it every day. You have to buy special bags for it (Litter Robot, which is a FAR superior product in every single way) uses regular (cheap) garbage bags.I had to shut the whole stupid thing down this weekend, take out the rake and just use it as a regular litter box which I scoop manually.

You shouldn't have to do this but the Camera does give a good picture. Once you open a browser and assuming you can log on and connect the first time, and after you have logged off, don't close the browser or go to another Web page on the same browser. Just minimize it and open another Browser for other Net activity. When you want to connect to the camera again, restore your minimized browser. You should have the Connect screen to sign in with. Have done this process the past few days and have connected everytime. It appears that when you log off from the camera and then go to other websites and then go back to try and log in again is when the reboot issue seems to come up way to often.

He also fails to mention why NASA has denied the existence of the face for so many years, and then suddenly mounts an expedition to the Cydonia region with the face as one of its main objectives.Overall: one of the poorest books I have ever read.

But following Dallas as she follow the clues to solve that mystery makes for a great police procedural.More importantly, the personal revelations that come up in the case pack a real punch and offer an intensity all their own. The relationship between Dallas and Roarke, and the various relationships between these two and everybody else are well portrayed and sometimes riveting.WARNING: If you are new to the series, this is probably NOT the book with which to start. So much of what goes on here is based on a character history that has been built over many previous books, you might miss some of the impact.Stand out book, even in a series that is almost nothing but."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have read better books","review":"This was my first time reading a book of J.D. Robb and I did not care that much about it. I really think that it is stupid that an author as big as Nora Roberts has to make up another name for herself to do murder mysteries. When I started reading the book I thought the concept of the books was great. I was really eager to find out what was going to happen. After reading about half of the book it began to drag. And it dragged and it dragged. At one point I did not care to even finish the book but I did finish it. I thought the ending of the book was so disappointing. I thought more would happen.

This is the first and last J.D. Robb book I will chance reading. I only read it half way through. It was so unclear, seemingly written with the pretense of intelligence. I thought the constant empty dialogues were wasted breath. I have read seven books by Nora Roberts and I will have to wonder if she has a twin sister living insider her mind who must be writing the J.D. Robb stories. She seems to me to be wandering from realism in her Roberts books to total abstract in her Robb books. I think in her Robb stories she must be letting her hair down with all of the unnecessary swearing and attitude the female characters have. There is a lot of rage there. I will take Nora Roberts over Robb any day. Sorry Robb fans, I just think it is all to shallow to waste my time going there again.

I am not at all a fan of the J.D. Robb books (another pen name). These take place in the future and feature a policewoman who gets to the bottom of murders and crime. The reason I don't like these books (after reading two of them) is because it is too obvious the author doesn't know much about police work and real crime fighting. It is as if she sits at the computer just making stuff up--maybe that is exactly what she does. There doesn't seem to be any research to make these stories realistic.

Robb a/k/a Nora Roberts is one of the most prolific authors I've ever read. How she manages to produce books that remain fresh and vibrant attests to her incredible talent and creative imagination. I've read this series out of order, but each book is written so that the book itself can stand alone.

After numerous flats I noticed the little slice was always where mr. tuffy overlapped itself. I believe the hard edge of the liner was actually cutting into the tube.

Some kind of \\"lock\\" switch would be nice in future models.The controls aside, I'm loving the ease of adding songs and photos, also the blue, backlit glow is very cool!

Here I sit, at work the next day, staring at the cover, hoping I can steal a glance at that last chapter at lunchtime. This book is about life. And cats. And Paul Gallico. I always knew Gallico was a sports writer, and that he actually got into the ring with fighter Jack Dempsey -- a rather nervy move for a writer.

Imagine my joy when I discovered it here, on Amazon.com! This is the WONDERFUL story of a boy who loved cats but wasn't allowed to have any as pets. He has an accident and 'wakes up' in the body of a cat, but with the mind and emotions of a human. He is rescued by Jennie and taught how to be a cat. Their story together is poignant and will make you look differently at cats after reading it. You do not have to be an animal lover to enjoy this book, it is so beautifully written.

For me to have noticed at all, they must have been blatant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland as bread","review":"I love to read P&P sequels. Everyone likes to imagine what would have happened to Darcy and Elizabeth. None will ever stand up to the original of course, but I have read many sequels that I've enjoyed. This treatment of P&P however is the most boring I have come across. The characters are not fleshed out at all and the story is boring and simplistic. Usually I can find something good about a book, not this time. I feel that I have wasted my money. I will avoid purchasing any of Ms Birchall's books in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst sequel I ever read!","review":"This book violates the characters characteristics so badly that it is offensive. This book is Terrible. Of the 15 sequels I have read to Pride and prejudice this book is BY FAR THE WORST! DON'T BUY IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfectly Terrible","review":"I am in complete shock that this book has received such an excellent rating from other Austen fans. I thought it was absolutely terrible. \\"Excellently mimics the language, the structure, and the dialog of an Austen novel\\"?? Has this person read a Jane Austen novel? I felt that the author strained at every turn to sound \\"Austenesque\\" while never actually achieving it. And as for the plot, it was nothing short of contrived and trite. There was no clever weaving of the story line, no intricate details, no anything that is deserving of so many stars for an Austen sequel. Don't be fooled!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not like this book","review":"My husband bought me two P&P sequel books for Christmas. I finished this one in a day. I found this book with a lot of cliches, and not enough appeal to keep my attention. The story line is oversimplified and predictable. The only reason I finished it is because it's short."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mrs Darcy after 25 years","review":"This book tells of the Darcys and their family 25 years after PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. In the intervening years there have been many births, deaths and marriages and the characters created by Jane Austen have aged. These events are highly credible.This is definitely one of the very best sequels to PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. Diana Birchall is an accomplished writer and has produced an excellent and most enjoyable book.The new characters in the book are realistic and the whole is very entertaining. I would recommend it very highly.I very much look forward to more from this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyment!","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It was very well done. I loved the way the characters spoke to one another. The story line was a little perdictable and the whole mistress thing was a little awkward but I really was entertained. Elizabeth wasn't as spunky as she was known to be in P&P but she is a grown woman with grown children so her character would change I'm sure. Anyway, if you are contemplating this book, just do it. It is worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good sequel!","review":"This is the worst of the pride and prejudice sequels. The plot is disturbing. Having both the Darcy and Bingley heir use their cousin Miss Wickham as their mistress. The book really grossed me out! If you wish to avoid an explicit and soap opera book just say no!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthy sequel","review":"Although I have been a reader for years it is only lately that I have discovered Jane Austen. I only recently read Pride and Prejudice, and loved it so well that near the end I could hardly dare to put it down. And once finished, I hated to see it end and wanted to know what happened further with the characters.Thus it was such a pleasure to read Ms. Birchall's book and get to continue the saga. The read was most enjoyable, and the best compliment I can pay this book is to say that while I was reading it I completely forgot that I was not reading Jane Austen herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where was the editor?","review":"The plot is mildly entertaining, but the writing style feels strained, and punctuation errors are frequent enough to be distracting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks nice but don't sit on it","review":"Attractive looking but almost impossible to put together.Pieces don't fit together and hardware doesn't work.Ended up hammering it together.

The X Men mythos is also adapted into the the now defunct Marvel comics 2099 world that sees classic characters in the year 2099. X Men is like the third best 2099 title behind Spider Man at number one and Doom at number 2. These sees some forgettable characters that don't have the depth and compassion of even Cyclops or Jubilee. Worth checking out for those who got these 2099s when they first came out. Wouldn't recommend this first issue unless you want to make X Men 2099 YOUR comic."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor recording quality","review":"This is a low fidelity live recording of a 1970 performance.

As with most, programming, though relatively easy, is time consuming. Now, however, the time has reset twice in 2 weeks. Customer support says to fix problem, unplug and remove batteries --which means all memory will be lost. Like I have a couple of spare hours to re-program...I regret this purchase. In shopping for this one, I saw a Sharp which you could program from your computer. Although it costs about $100 more, the time saved in re-programming would have probably been worth it.Great features--just a pain in the butt too soon after purchase.Edit: We replaced the batteries and have had no problems in the almost 2 years we have had this. My suggestion: don't use the enclosed batteries-use your own fresh batteries! We didn't unplug to replace the batteries, so did not lose the memory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well...","review":"This was the first game I got for my PSP about 2 years ago, and quite frankly, I was disapointed.

Gameplay is a lot like spiderman 1, You go in a level, beat up some people, peter says something funny, you're on to the next level. However, I was not deterred. Don't get me wrong, this game is great, that is, until you beat it. I havn't picked it up in about 16 months.

About 2 1/2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spiderman 2 PSP","review":"I recommend this game to anyone who loves Spiderman. But this game doesn't have the \\"go anywhere\\" like the console games do.

However, regardless this item seems to fool you into thinking that the psp version is just like the ps2 version. This is not the case. It's a linear smash-em-up and you don't do a lot of smashing.

It gives the psp a bad rep when people play sucky games like this on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spider Rip Off","review":"Where do I start?

I played it on the PS2 and to this day I still pop it in just to swing around the city and kick the crap out of car jacker and bank robbers. I put in Spiderman 2 on PSP and \\"POW\\" I was upset 5 minutes into it. I should have listened to Evil Bob he warned us that this was just Spiderman 1 all over again. $49.95 I THINK NOT. My only hope is that I can take this game back and get a refund.

I'm taking the time to write this to save some other poor soul from purchasing this piece of junk.

They will learn that Wiccans are holy and pure practioners of ''natural herb medicine'' and that while they are witches, they are white witches and that makes them good! Seriously, this is a sad, propeganda flick for the Wiccan Witchcraft religion. If I can't be any blunter, this is a pro-Witch flick, I kid you not! Now I know some people see the devil hiding under every rock and nook and cranny. I know it could be easy to dismiss what I say as the writings of someone with those seniments.

I bought it in the $5 section of a local department store.I thought I kept hearing the words Wicca, Wiccan...nature...good witches...and things along that line and I was blown away. Then came the so-called explanation of Wicca and how Wiccans are largely misunderstood. I sat down to watch and tried to stay with it for another 20 minutes or so but I just could not sit there and let my 3 year old soak this in.This movie glamorizes and sexualizes Wicca. I can't say much about the plot because we only made it about half way through before it got thrown in the trash. I've read the other reviews and am glad I took it out when I did. Deeply disappointed that Scooby is endorsing Wicca."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much propoganda...","review":"The themes presented in this Scooby Doo movie are not at all age appropriate for the targeted audience. What I used to love about Scooby Doo is that the monsters were never real and in the end the mystery was solved. I wish I had pre-screened this one before letting my 5 y.o. watch it. Bad decision on my part. I'd love to see them put as much Christian propaganda into a Scooby Doo movie as the pro-wiccan propaganda featured in this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"KPepper2, Please","review":"I am at a loss as to how you can say the movie doesn't promote Wicca. I mean, did we watch the same movie? Characters in the movie are Wiccan, the Wiccan religion is explained in quite detail and the end song embodies all that was explained about that <cough> religion. HELLO?????The movie is more Warner Brothers, New Ageism, Wicca GARBAGE. It falls right in line with Harry Potter and has no endearing qualities about it whatsoever. It's propoganda aimed at conditioning your little one's mind to accepting withcraft and new ageism. Steer clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"nasty","review":"What a horrible Scooby video! The characters had \\"grown up\\" and were much more detailed in their thoughts. It's definitely not the old Scooby where the answer to the mystery was found mostly by accident. The video is also quite violent - not very good for smaller kids. The professor ends up casting evil spells and doing physical harm to the other characters. There is also a lot of gender bias - Velma and Daphne are stupider than normal, while Fred and Shaggy (zoiks!) end up being the \\"heroes\\" on most occasions. There is also a focus on the Wiccan religion, so be prepared to talk about that if kids watch it. All in all, yuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scooby Doo and the witch's Ghost : Not for kids","review":"What ever happened to the fake monsters and thelma saying there's no such thing as....? This video must have been made by people involved in the occult. Its like an ad for wiccans. They need to bring back the mystery element and get rid of the occult message.

I turned it off half way thru."},{"rating":"1","title":"too few gags, too much pro-Wiccan time waste","review":"We love Scooby and crew, but the series is supposed to be focused on humor, not on preaching in defense of Wiccans. There are several scenes here where Velma's character makes extended, and extremely boring, defenses of Wiccans as misunderstood kind-hearts. That's fine for the New York Times op-ed page, but it bores the kids. These Hollywood writers were so busy trying to annoy Christians, they forgot to write some jokes. Total waste of money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scooby Doo teaching my children Wicca----Really?????","review":"I found this totally inappropriate.

However, this movie was far too scary for them. I am not a prude. I have no problem with the movie's references to Wican religion. And generally I don't have problems with stories/movies featuring witchcraft or magic, such as Harry Potter. However, the real witch that appears near the middle of this movie is very scary and the storyline gets freaky. It is a full reversal from the other Scooby Doo mysteries always ending with a logical explanation for all the things that have happened in the show(i.e. robots or a person in costume). We watched this once and threw it in the garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"we LOVE Scooby, but not the PRO-WICCAN message in this one","review":"My children were particularly scared by the characters in this Scooby-Doo, with the very dark rock music. But we were most disturbed by the pro-wiccan message at the end. Don't buy this movie unless you want your children to think wiccan is a great lifestyle. We watched this once and threw it out - in fact, my 6 year-old threw it out happily for me. We didn't even want to pass it on to someone else. I have always loved Scooby-Doo and the distinction between good guys and bad guys, but the lines are blurred in this one.

There are also songs by the \\"hex girls\\" one of whom is part a 1/16 WICAN, The songs basicly tell your children more than you would about WICAN beliefs. The Exact same message is related in movies such as \\"Book of shadows: Blair witch 2\\" and \\"The Craft\\". I didn't realize that this movie was like this, I would have never bought it. By the way the typical Scooby Doo parts, were good, they are just what you expect, Bad guys, chills and thrills on a childrens level.

As one reviewer commented, one CAN see these Gothic types of things in any American HIGH school (I know--I teach in one), but one does not expect to see discussions of Wiccans and the Salem Witch Trials in a \\"Fun for the Whole Family\\" video. There is some really warped stuff in this film. Teenagers may like it, but my son was not a happy camper. I advise parents of \\"young'uns\\" to stay away from this video no matter how tempted you are to think Lisa and I are just some religious zealots.

This new Scooby & Gang movie only survived one viewing in our home. It's theme and guest characters are much darker than in movies/shows of Scooby's past. As a huge fan of Tim Curry, he is a great villain in the movie, but a little too villainous for the under eight set. The witch is super scary compared to previous villains. Also, the \\"Hex Girls\\" are scantily clad and have a Wiccan sex-kitten thing goin' on that is a little over the top for children. The \\"Hex Girls\\" make being a teenage Wiccan look really cool. Our children will be really excited when I bring this video out of hiding again - in about 5-7 years.There are many other great Scooby Doo movies to choose from if your children are under eight years old. Hope this helps!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not classic Scooby, but still a great movie","review":"Another family hit. You just can't go wrong with Scooby. Obviously, technology is much better today, so the movie doesn't have that classic touch that the originals do, but my kids absolutely love it. I can't believe people have a problem with the wicca content. So much for having an open mind. Trust me, your kids aren't focused on the wiccan elements of the movie. You'll see more supernatural events on the Trinity channel than you'll see in this movie, so watch it for what it is; a great animated feature that is appropriate for kids of all ages (1-100). Can't beat the price, either."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my daughter's favorites","review":"My daughter ,who is 4, loves Scooby Doo. This movie is her favorite.

However, despite some strong points (the major plot twist isn't bad, and Tim Curry is better than memorable until overacting ruins it near the end), the plot drags in the middle and the big climax could have used some of the time the middle didn't need.Also, there's a big build-up to the song the Hex-Girls (the Wiccan band mentioned in a few other reviews) are going to perform, and the show makes the mistake of having them actually perform it at the end. The song alone is bad enough that it moves me from not being sure whether to give this movie two or three stars to making it clear that it doesn't deserve more than two.If you want to get one of these new Scooby-Doo movies, skip this one and get Zombie Island instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"scooby-doo and the witches ghost","review":"My granddaughter loved this show.

How many people out there actually think your childmight sacrifice the neighbors kitty to the Dark Forces Of Evil on the basis of something he/she saw in a cartoon? For the rest of you- fun movie, a little short, not as good as 'Zombie Island', I still don't like the new voices they're using for Daphne & Velma (they sound alike), and the animation is not as good as the groovy-retro-early '70's style of the original cartoon but what is? Positively recommended for past, present, and future Scooby fans!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give if 0 stars I would!","review":"I cannot even put into words how inappropriate this video is.

I knew I couldn't return it but I wanted to let them know how disappointed I was..apparently so many other families had the same issue I had that they had removed it from the shelves!!!!

If it were there, consumers could decide for themselves whether or not it was an appropriate video to show their children."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT WATCH THIS","review":"We love Scooby Doo. We feel incredibly betrayed by Warner Bros. and Hanna Barbera. Scooby Doo uncovers pretend ghosts with a great deal of suspense and humor. This movie deals with a real ghost and the wiccan religion. It is way too intense and inappropriate for children. It really isn't all that funny either. This was a terrible movie and that they would use a lovable children's character is an outrage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for preschoolers!","review":"My 4-year old son adores the classic Scooby-Doo shows and has quite a collection. We purchased the Cyber Chase and loved it, as well, so we thought we would try this one and Zombie Island. Boy were we surprised! Not only was he frightened by them, the content of the movies is not acceptable to me for small children. The Witches Ghost seeks to teach your children about Wicca and the positive sides of witchcraft, while Zombie Island is just downright scary. From now on we will stick to the old classics. Whomever is making these new ones has lost the touch. The monsters are supposed to be fake, not real...and it's supposed to be funny, not frightening. Sorry Scooby!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Modernism ruins it","review":"...I bought this DVD so my kid and I could enjoy something, together. The premise seemed cool; Scooby and the gang go to New England to solve a mystery. But, the fact that the producers and writers tried to make being Wiccan, cool, infuriated me. I wonder if they would produce such a movie, shedding the same positive light on Catholics. I have 2 ex-Hollywood friends who agree that secularism has totally taken over film and media. This is just another example of it. Any potential buyers, stick to the original series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Great Movie!","review":"First of all, this move is great entertainment. My daughter (4) absolutely loves it! She's a true Hex Girls fan! Cute insider jokes for old Scooby fans sprinkled about the movie as well. Even thought the movie was inaccurate about witches, it was nice that they gave a positive view of Wiccans and others who may not \\"fit in\\" or who are close to the Earth. A not too sublte message of this movie is not to judge a person by appearance or condemn them for being different. For anyone raising non-Pagan children, this movie does not have any type of religious teachings even though it mentions Wiccans. It shows that they exist and that they are into natural type stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty lame","review":"At the risk of someone saying \\"lighten up lady\\" I have to agree with the old school one star folks on this one. The memories I have of Scooby Doo definitely differ from this movie. Its blatantly pro-Wiccan premise is, frankly, weird. I think I would think that any religious context in a Scooby Doo movie is weird. The fun and entertainment value of Scooby was the innocent mystery solving almost by happenstance. The resolution was typically a ruse- no one actually had powers, let alone demonic ones. Yeah generic witches are fine, but glorfying a pagan religion- just not Scooby. Go for a video with the vintage characters and story lines- kids love that, and so do parents. I watched it before my kids so I avoided the \\"teachable moment\\" other higher star reviewers seemed to value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"Who doesn't like Scooby-Doo.

What a mistake! This is NOT the classic Scooby formula where the monster turns out not to be real. The ghost is real and scared my littlest ones. Also, these dopey \\"Hex Girls\\" are running around in skimpy costumes with \\"Gothic\\" type makeup and fangs. To say I was disappointed with the WB studio for making this would be an understatement. They took one of our favorite brand names in cartoons and updated it with sex, Gothic stylings, and a view of the occult as real. NO THANKS. I won't be buying any more new Scooby movies because I can't trust the PTB with my kids that way. I wish I could have them \\"unsee\\" this movie. This is not for little kids. What a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Classic Scooby Doo - ALWAYS - ALWAYS - exposed the creature, monster or mystery as a fraud. I couldn't believe that a story intended for young audiences included: a warlock, Wicca, real witches casting spells to make trees and pumpkins come to life - to throw balls of lightening, and to bound a spirit into spell book. Hello? What happened to the part where they ALWAYS pulled the mask off and explained to our young viewers how the candle in the window was rigged or the footprints were made by scubba diving fins! I knew a lot had changed since I was a kid - but I was still very saddened to learn that Scooby-Doo is no longer fit for children to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Because I cannot return it, I will throw it away.","review":"If the movie would have ended when they caught the people who were spooking the town, I might have kept it.

Nietzsche, Rilke and Ortega y Gasset have been showing us life as fight which moral reason doesn't exist in the future paradise.

Cadillac Jack describes a month or so in the life of an antiques dealer on the road. In Jack's world, all people are eccentrics with funny names like Pencil Penrose and Sir Cripps Crisp, and all women he finds attractive are willing to sleep with him at the drop of a hat. Set in the pre-AIDS era, the book reflects a cavalier attitude about sexual responsibility that may appall late 1990's sensibilities. Nevertheless, Cadillac Jack is amusingly written, especially when it describes the bizarre and wonderful antiques that are the real objects of Jack's passion. Not bad, but compared to McMurtry's epic works, Cadillac Jack has a flat tire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slightly Entertaining but Empty","review":"This book offers a glimpse into the tawdry life of Cadillac Jack, a narcissistic antiques dealer whose whole ambition seems to be peddling junk and meeting women.

Does McMartry advertise Cadillac Jack as another Terms of Endearment? Why it's wrong to be entertained and ask yourself - So what?- when the book is finished? The book is funny,unpretentious and concise. I made myself finish Moving On, dropped all these prequels & sequels to Lonesome Dove and Terms of Endearment halfway through, gasping at McMurtry's productivity, enjoyed his Pulitzer Prize winner and the book the Oscar winner is based on. But it's the books like Cadillac Jack and Anything For Billy that gave me a few precious hours of enjoyment and relaxation.

You can literally take the top and wobble it back and forth as it flexes the fuel tank! As someone else said, the lever to lift the globe to light it is so thin that it cannot stand up to the task.

It is not. If a woman is looking for reasons to not have a servant's heart, read the Groothuis book. (We are commanded as followers of Christ to be servants in Christianity). This book hurts God. It does not inspire any woman to serve children with her time and nurturing nature or her husband, for that matter, but it is egocentric and vain in message and attitude. How can the author be filled with the Holy Spirit and yet be so filled with herself? This is not any book I could ever recommend as a Christian.

Upon Oedipus' death, it was agreed that each would take the throne from one year to the next. After the first year, however, Eteocles, the elder, refused to step down. Polynices and six foreign princes marched on Thebes. All were defeated. The brothers killed each other in a duel, making Creon king.

That's a serious downgrade in both roles.

I never even got to use the espresso maker.

As others mentioned, in the beginning it worked great. Steaming milk for a latte was simple. My real need was a programmable coffeemaker with auto-shutoff. It made great coffee for about a year, needing descaling only twice. Then I noticed that it was not soaking all the grinds, and the descaling warning lit more often. The steamer didn't work, either, and last weekend the coffee side stopped working. Now I'm left with an expensive, oversized espresso machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"75% does not equal 100%","review":"Although the product says it will make coffee, cappuccino,lattes, and espresso, it does NOT make lattes. There are no instructions on how to make them, no place to make the steamed milk, and customer service won't say what to do. As it was purchased mainly for espressos and lattes, it was returned. (The return service was 100%!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good luck with Delonghi's shameful customer service!!","review":"I bought this coffee maker after owning the Figaro BC0110. After about six months of normal use with the Figaro, the handle to the water tank had snapped in half. The espresso side clogged frequently, and the milk would never quite get hot enough, so I decided to upgrade to this model.I went online to purchase an additional water filter for $5, and discovered that Delonghi charges a \\"standard shipping charge of $9.99 per order\\" for any of their replacement parts. I was outraged, as this was the only place I could find to purchase this filter, and they were charging 200% of the filter price to ship it to me. When I sent an email to their customer service, they replied by restating their shipping charge. I have rarely had such a horrible experience with a company after the point of sale, and this will definitely keep me from giving this company any more of my business!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good when it works but not long","review":"It's a good combo when it works but after a 6 months water is leaking from a couple of places.Look for a another brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Instructions a bit confusing","review":"I just received this machine today and took about an hour using water to figure out the instructions. Maybe I had a long day and could not understand how to make a cappuccino portion. I looked for that cappuccino button for a long time. It is located on the expresso side together with the strong/light flavor knob. When you start making the expresso, be really quick to turn this knob at the right timing to froth the milk.A bit inconvenient. I also want to try pods because it was messy to clean up. Coffee grinds everywhere ... My first cappuccino was ok, a bit strong but need more milk. I do prefer lattes, and would love to lean how to make them."},{"rating":"2","title":"DHT","review":"My family and I love it! If it continues to work as well as it did yesterday (we just got it), we are VERY SATISFIED!

It does it all for you with ease!Thanks DeLonghi for making a great combination product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Disposal Coffee Maker","review":"I had my DeLonghi coffee maker for a little over a year. I thought it made great coffee. I was disappointed when it just stopped working. I wrote DeLonghi and since it was just over warranty they wouldn't do anything for me. I learned that it had something to do with the heating element but tried to get the part locally but was unable. I had a Krups coffee maker that lasted for over ten years and the had bought the DeLonghi since it was on sale that day. I think a coffee maker should last at a minimum five years...not till the warranty expires. Extremely disappointed in Delonghi for their poor customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second broken DeLonghi","review":"I received the BCO130T as a gift a year or so ago and because my first DeLonghi espresso maker broke in less than a year, I took very good care of this one. Unfortunately, cleaning it regularly and following the provided instructions did not prevent this one from breaking too! Shortly over a year after having it, the steam part of the espresso maker stopped working. One day, after having few problems with the machine, I turned it on only to have nothing happen. No sound, no coffee, no nothing. I contacted DeLonghi and they said that the warranty had run out and that I should contact a local repair shop to fix it. I would NOT buy another DeLonghi product. If someone pays $100 for an espresso machine, they should get the satisfaction of having a functional product. After having this happen twice and seeing several others with the same problem, I give it a thumbs down and a wave goodbye. My next espresso/cappuccino maker will NOT be DeLonghi."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaking large amounts of water","review":"I purchased this from Macy's about a year ago and now it leaks water from the bottom when I brew.

As an engineer, I decided to see what the problem was. After taking a few pieces off it was clear this thing is very poorly designed and made. Screws used to hold the top on were rusted through. Plastic cable ties were used in at least 2 places to hold tubing in place. I was never able to find out the exact source of the leak because it was down inside the machine. I don't think it's even worth the effort to repair. The frothing device never worked well, I had to add extra water and cycle it 3 or 4 times to get all the milk out. And the coffee it made wasn't any better than my old $12 Mr. Coffee (which leaked too by the way, but only after 2 years). I would highly recommend you purchase a different coffee maker.

Makes a great expresso (make sure the grounds are very fine), steams up milk for cappucinos and even for hot chocolate, and makes a great cup of regular coffee. All for less than many other coffee makers. It does take some time to learn how to use the machine properly, but once you get it you can really impress your friends and family as their own personal barrista! Have fun.OK.

It is extremely frustrating, and a huge mess to clean up every morning. The design of the inner tank makes it difficult to clean.

Then it began to leak around the bottom. This morning, after putting in 6 cups of water and mopping 5 cups off my counter I decided to see if I could find a solution on line.

We were please with it until mid June 2010 when the espresso part stopped working. I contacted DeLonghi and was told by them to take it to a repair shop in Orlando. I dropped it off for repair on July 9. It took them over 2 weeks to let me know it was not repairable. They said they had already contacted DeLonghi and that I would receive a new one in 14 days. Today is August 23, 2010 and my coffeemaker has not arrived yet. I called DeLonghi, 3rd time now, and they don't even know what is going on. The costumer service guy said he will try to find out more about that and will get back to me in 5 to 7 days. Isn't that very disrespectful?! I'm tired of waiting.

We are actually on our 2nd machine as the 1st was was returned to DeLonghi and they replaced it before the warranty ran out. In fact, the coffee maker in the 2nd machine stopped working within a month after we received it and required returning it to one of DeLonghi's certified repair centers. Once we got it back, the 2nd one began leaking water a few weeks after that. So far, we've spent ~ $30 in shipping fees to the repair center. The screws are beginning to rust at the top which another reviewer pointed out as well. It's been frustrating, and now I'm getting ready to do battle with DeLonghi to see about obtaining a full refund or negotiate getting a more superior product from another line.

I couldn't locate the leak and, as it got worse, I decided to replace the unit. I found the new model and assumed the problem was a one-off. I bought this model at a good price and everything was fine until after 6 months, the same problem occurred. I took the unit completely apart and although I found the leak was coming from a built-in overflow tube next to the feeder tube for the coffee maker, there was simply no reason for water to be running out of the tube. In addition, the carafe or lid is a really bad design because if you don't pour slowly, it leaks all over the counter.

One can feel a sense of their efforts and experiences from the outset of the guide's introduction. You will find a fresh outlook from the Authors' open minded base, all encompassed in the dependable structure always found in Open Road Travel Guides. If you're headed for Chile, prepare yourself, rely upon and don't be afraid that this resource will pre-shape your experience. Unlike my favorite Chilean wines, this resource is not dry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There all gonna laugh at you....","review":"I went to Chile with 8 friends and we all decided to each bring one travel book. After our second day in Santiago I don't think my book was even opened. It became an amusing side joke to the trip.Like some of the other reviews, I agree that it caters to a traveller that is not on a strict budget. It did not seem thourough or detalied enough to give the reader options. There were the few recommendations and that was it.On the positive side, the recommendations were good ones. The book simplified scenarios that could be overwhelming with too many options. In many instances it could at least point you in the right direction.If you are buying a book for Chile, I think you can find a more complete book somewhere else that would contain all the information that is in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"No more than an agglomeration of easily obtainable data","review":"It would appear that little has gone into this guidebook. The average Spanish-speaking tourist would be able to assemble all the information it contains, by simply going through each tourist information centre.

Just an extra piece of luggage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Quite \\"the\\" Guide","review":"Having just returned from Chile with this book as my primary reference guide, I found myself continually borrowing other guidebooks. Simply put, it contains too little information. I also found some of the authors' opinons a bit stronger than what I care to have when travelling an unfamiliar country. The two standards, Footprints and Lonely Planet, remain for me the best guides to South American travel. I regretted carrying this one along enough to have donated it to a hostal in Punta Arenas.Admittedly, the guide takes a fun approach, and has interesting and readable content. However, because it lacks the depth of more veteran sources, I recommend this guide only as a supplemental reference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This is a must read for any Chile traveler.

Robson Green is one of my favorite British actors and I tend to buy a lot of his movies when the movies are released. If you like Cinderella stories and maybe like to escape from reality every so often, then this is the movie for you. All the characters are very believeable and true to form.

I recommend this movie to anybody, male or female."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incoherent","review":"The documentary doesn't have an arcing narrative, it is a collection of clips and carefully selected interviews.

The problem I have with this documentary is that it's clearly ONLY capturing the ugly side. It's also laughable how they never define what they consider \\"mainstream media\\". I will assume they base their truth on things like FOX news as their foundation. This could have been a great film but they obviously have their own agenda to fulfill.

I was honestly expecting better after watching the first 10 minutes or so in terms on the video clips that they showed. But the main narrator was hilarious and very biased. Apparently community organizers are bad. And if you think CEOs get paid too much you want to overthrow the government and are against all that we stand for.

Based upon the narrative viewpoint of conservative superstar Andrew Breitbart the film is relentless in it's drive for the truth. With stunning photography , incredible editing and quick cut interviews Occupy Unmasked is an in your face indictment of the institutional left .David Horowitz and Greg Gutfeld called Occupy Unmasked \\"the most powerful film ever made about the American Left .\\" I saw this film at a theater in Orange County and I couldn't be more impressed .

The rest of it just dragged or repeated its thesis."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's propaganda","review":"This isn't really a documentary about Occupy Wall Street. It's a one-sided propaganda piece against liberals. It was apparently paid for by Mark Cuban and other conservatives with the hope of impacting the presidential elections in the US.There is some good footage in this film. Most of the interviews are quite poor. There's a strange diversion into a somewhat aimless history lesson that doesn't add context to the primary subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Right wing propaganda","review":"What a joke. If you think Fox new is fair and balanced then this film is for you. Obviously a skewed unbalanced view of a movement that should be a wake up call. Compare the bloggers and small time journalist who \\"organized\\" this \\"unorganized\\" protest according to this films makers to the Kotch brothers on the right, hardly a fair fight.

It's clear to see that this movie was not one based on facts, as it didn't really state many. I'm not saying that occupy was good, rather that this movie took a lot of ethos and pathos to put your mind into a state of shock and disgust. What I mean is that even if this movie was about something considered good you would start to believe that it's bad. Too much unrelated shots to influence your opinion. I swear most of the movie is unrelated footage depicting stuff like kids boxing a car going off a cliff and a bunch of almost random garbage that I would call junk food for your eyes. unless you don't watch the news than you really will just waste your time watching this. The production is nice though :D"},{"rating":"2","title":"Revealing and Informative But Only Part of the Story","review":"This movie is revealing but really tells us nothing we shouldn't already know. It gives us the 'against' view of the Occupy movement and would be best taken seriously by those it exposes, but of course, it will mainly be viewed by those already aware of the shortcomings of the movement.What we need is for people to be willing to let go of their beliefs and become willing to compromise and respect other points of view but that will likely only happen once a catastrophe of some sort shocks us out of our anger at our fellow citizen.

This left me with an option I knew would be less than desirable -- removing the sticker. Of course it left an enormous amount of glue from the backing all over the battery. Now the battery is a sticky mess. I refuse to stick it in the camera. I am going to now have to clean it up with nail polish remover or cooking oil or something before I can use it.Stupid, stupid, stupid. The battery comes in a small plastic box.

The book reveals a lot about Navajo culture, and a friend's father tells the children stories of the code-talkers of WWII.I picked this book up by accident but it really held my interest, which surprised me for a YA novel from 1961.

I loved it but, then again, I would have loved a bottle of poison if it had a Cowboys star on it.I picked it up again about a year ago when I was thinking about what made that team (and champion teams in general) tick. The psychological edge those teams enjoyed is probably what made the difference, to which Jimmy Johnson deserves the ultimate credit.His approach to the mental side of football is evident in this book. For example, instead of telling a kicker \\"don't miss\\" before a good field goal, Jimmy will always say \\"make this.\\" The difference is the seed, either positive or negative, that is planted in that kicker's mind.But the book goes beyond coaching philosophy to chronicle the interesting, if not a little whacky, life of an extremely sucessful football coach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jimmy's book is great","review":"If you are a Jimmy Johnson fan or a fan of good football autobiographies, then check this book out.

I loved that the light came with an enclosure to cover the bulb tube - a real bargain, even if it's just thin plastic. What I don't like is that the connectors for the power cord are very loose. Half the time, I have to wiggle the cord after I turn on the light to get it to come on. Also, when you link these, you have to turn each light on individually. It doesn't work to just turn on and off the first one in the chain. This is both a plus and a con at the same time.

One of the drive wheels stopped working. The unit was replaced under the 12 month warranty. The second unit lasted 4 months and broke again with a very similar problem. This time it was out of warranty, and the company would only honor the strict terms of their warranty, so I was out of luck.Since it is a bit too expensive to only last for such a short time, I would only recommend this product for robot enthusiasts who want to do their own repairs and modding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad quality","review":"I was happy with it for the first 3 months and recommended people to buy it.However, after 3 months, it breaks apart, again and again.

Only problems I've had is that our lanai is so large that I had to break it up into two parts, but that wasn't major.

However, the newer products, both Roomba and Scooba, have very unpredictable battery life. It's not clear whether you should leave the batteries on the charger or unplug them, and it seems like the instructions are the opposite for both the Roomba and Scooba. This confusion caused my batteries to no longer hold a charge after only 10 uses. Customer service, which used to be very user-friendly, refused to replace a battery for free. I've been on a waiting list for a new water tank for almost a year because of difficulty opening it. It's a shame. I always used to recommend Roomba products to all my family and friends, but I can no longer do so with a clear conscience.

I wanted a product that would help simplify my cleaning but this product is not it and once it decided to turn on the \\"check tank\\" light (which is a very common problem) when there was nothing wrong with the tank, nothing i did cleared the issue. If it wasn't so expensive in the first place I probably would have given it 2 or 3 stars, but it broke down well before it should have, and had to be babied and followed every time I ran it so just spend your money on a maid service if you hate cleaning like I do and you will be much happier."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have to fix it every time I use it.","review":"Did they tell you that you have to prime the pump if it dries out?

They offered me 15% of a replacement battery, in case that was the problem, but the rep didn't sound very confident that the problem was indeed the battery. So while I was really excited about this product at first, my experience leads me to recommend anyone against buying it. Its cost per use came out to $20 per wash, at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"it works","review":"after calling service and them telling me to pierce something so it would put water/cleaner down it has worked very well. have used it on some cheap laminate floors and those seem to show wear on the edges like delamination. I think it was due to water collecting in joints."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scooba Rocks!","review":"I liked my Roomba, but love my Scooba! Yeah, it's not perfect, but with two little kids and two big dogs, my house is never perfect. There are a couple of places it gets hung up under our kitchen cabinets, and it doesn't get all the way into the corners, but generally it does almost all the hard work. Our house has travertine floors throughout, and it takes a really long time to mop all of them by hand. Now, I just take Scooba from room to room and let it go. With the dogs, I was worried about dog hair clogging it up, and I do have to clean Scooba's brushes fairly often, but it does just fine. (I use Roomba or a dust mop to pick up the big chunks before Scoobaing.) It was a Christmas present to myself, and I love it, as does my (once skeptical) husband."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Machine! Hassle Free. Clean Floors!","review":"This is a great machine. Sure, it's not absolutely perfect, but for the price, it's well worth it and the only one like it on the market. It cleans well and most importantly, it does it all by itself. I fill it up, walk the dogs, come back and it's done, clean floors!As others have commented, it does leave a nice layer of water on the floors, but it's a small trade-off for the cleaning job it does. Nothing a quick dragging of a towel on the floor will take care of in a jiffy, if wanted.Purchasing tip: Buy from Hammacher Schlemmer. They have an \\"Unconditional Lifetime Guarantee,\\" where for whatever reason, they will exchange the machine for free. They even include a return shipping label (with instructions) with the Scooba for easy returns. There are many testimonials online stating exchanges continuing in upwards of 5 years after the date of purchase! Also, Google \\"Hammacher coupon\\" for a code that will save you on shipping charges ($20)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!!!","review":"Clearly at first this was an awsome gift!!! It worked great! Then after a year sadly, it did not! If you look at the reviews that have had them that long you will find this to be common. Also read battery reviews ect, individual parts! The hood would no longer come off , it no longer soaked up water or vacuummed! I did keep it very clean , followed directions and also did what another person suggested kept theres longer then a year, which I now believe was a fluke, and not the norm that they had thier's longer but only by four months. I did not use it but once a week on an average maybe even smaller size floor. So if you think 500+ a year is worth it, go for it and enjoy! I'd rather go to Cancun for a week!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Used it once and had to send it back","review":"I charged the Scooba per manual instructions and put it use on 1 floor.

I am really frustrated that we spent $250 or so only 2 years ago and now are being told that we have to foot the almost $200 bill to replace the entire unit, for no fault of our own. This is a poorly made product by a company with BAD customer service. If a product that costs this much is going to need to be replaced every 2 years, I'll mop my own floors the old fashioned way. SO angry with this company. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This one is not as good as I thought.

On top of that, I have spent hours with iRobot customer service, trying numerous \\"fixes\\" that often don't work. I bought mine brand new for almost $400.

Do not buy this product. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk After 6 Months","review":"Well, I bit the bullet and bought both this one and the Roomba Scheduler... it was a great help at first since my wife is handicapped and I have to work all day. After about 6 months, both of them died on me. This one, in particular, kept saying \\"Check Tank\\". Primed it, primed some more, Googled anything I could find to fix it so, contacted iRobot support. They sent me another one and the same thing happened again after 3 months of service. Noting I could do would fix it. Save your money folks. Also for the Roomba, just in case you want one of those, was good for 6 months, the brush motor died and got a replacement. Worked fine since then. A small note, use them every day. I noticed that we only ran them once or twice a week and the batteries will die if it is not used every day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had problems with both my Scoobas from the get-go","review":"I am having problems with the second Scooba I purchased after only five uses. I returned the first one to the store where I purchased it because the brush broke after a month. I have had to troubleshoot problems (running out of solution, changing the tank mid-clean, the brush not clicking into place, to name a few) wayyyy too often to recommend this product. Oh, and it does NOT work on tiled floors; it will not clean the grout at all, just move the dirt around. Even those reviewers who rated the Scooba favorably have comments about the Scooba not working properly. They're lucky that their Scoobas still function at all.Don't buy this product unless you enjoy troubleshooting problems and/or spending $300 for a machine that will work a handful of times before breaking."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUYER BEWARE!!","review":"My scooba is sending a \\"charger has failed\\" message. I called iRobot and I was told the entire unit needs to be replaced. I bought the scooba less than 1-1/2 years ago and used it maybe 10 times. They told me they'll sell me another scooba for $374.99, as I am out of warranty. Please be very careful about purchasing iRobot. Be prepared to dole out $300 to $500 every 1-1/2 years, as it seems that is the life span. Me? I would never buy another. It's not worth one star. Hope this helps anyone considering a purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Product....WHEN IT WORKS!","review":"This product works wonderfully...when it is working.

This went on 4 or 5 more times and is STILL going on. I JUST got it back today so we will see if the \\"problem\\" is fixed.Bottom line: No product should be out of service more than it is in working condition.

It washed one floor well. It died (a bad charger.) That's when the nightmare began.I HAVE YET TO GET A LABEL TO RETURN IT TO iROBOT!!!Yes, it has taken customer service this amount of time to get me a UPS label. This is just about the WORST customer service on the planet and they keep telling you the same lie over and over again. Two business days? Don't believe it.Also, they won't sent a new charger, they force you to send the entire unit back. More nonsense as there is nothing wrong with the unit--it worked perfectly the one time I was able to use it.Given the time spent e-mailing and calling customer service, I could have washed all of my floors for a year.It's a cool product but until the company gets its act together, you will be sorry you bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"List Price is Wrong!

The better model 350 lists for 399 on the manufacturer's website (model numbers don't make sense because the 350 and 380 are better than the 5800 and the 380 is better than the 350). The differences are how many square feet they can do and included accessories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted 5 months only","review":"I purchased the Scooba despite the many bad reviews on amazon because I had a roomba and was happy with it.The Scooba never worked very well - it would randomly skip parts of the room (and it's very obvious when all the room is wet except a part), and it wouldn't do a very good job close to the walls. In the area it actually cleaned, it would deposit a lot of water and it would take a while to dry. Also, cleaning it after every use is a bit of a chore, and I'm not sure it saves you that much time.But were it only for these problems, I would rate it 2 or 3 stars - you don't expect this things to be perfect, and it did after all save me from some mopping for a while.The product drops to one star because it did not last more than 5 months. One day, out of the blue, it just stopped putting down water. I tried many advice found on the internet, but none worked.Buy at your own risk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than happy","review":"I am not pleased with the Scooba. I have a tile floor in my kitchen - which obviously is the floor that needs to be mopped the most often. Unfortunately Scooba can not handle the grooves between the tiles and thinks it is off balance. I spend more time fixing and resetting it then it would take me to simply mop the floor myself.My living room is wood and the Scooba does work alright there. However the slightest thing can get it stuck. For instance we have speaker stands - the Scooba will run up on the bottom of the stand which is only 1/8\\" high and gets stuck.If you don't have tile floors or anything that would get in the way then you will probably love the Scooba but it doesn't work for me. I love my Irobot Vaccuum but will probably look into returning the Scooba."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love my Scooba!!!!","review":"I thought I'd never love a home cleaning tool more than my Roomba, but Scooba has stolen my heart. It cleans my floor so well, in spite of our two golden retrievers which constantly track in dirt!Admittedly, I vacuum first, because of above said dogs, but then I let Scooba loose and she cleans our entire kitchen, dining room, and family room on one charge!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a cleaning fairy","review":"I've been using my Scooba for a couple of years now, and it does an amazing job. As others have noted, it does not clean corners, so plan on wiping these yourself. I do not use the cleaner, as I have hard wood floors and it seemed to leave a haze. I've been putting white vinegar in my unit since the beginning, and it works just fine. You will have to purchase replacement parts periodically but they are reasonably priced - if you wait until someone is having a sale. I did have to purchase a new battery recently so the machine didn't work for a couple of weeks, and boy, did I miss it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Scooba","review":"I'm really pleased with the Scooba. It cleans while I do other stuff. It does a job I'm way too lazy to do on a frequent basis. My floors are getting cleaned once a week instead of once in a blue moon. I'm satisfied with the level of cleaning and I like the mild, fresh scent of the Clorox cleaning solution. I'm a happy customer and recommend this to other people who have acres of hard surface flooring and don't like to mop.(Just wish I could give the little guy a dog treat or something for doing such a great job...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta Love it!","review":"I wanted this initially just to be able to say there was a robot doing my kitchen floors. Seriously, I am very impressed. I rated it 4 stars because the machine can't do corners (it's round) and it didn't get quite as close to the cabinet edges as I would have liked. I had a little trouble with start-up, had to prime the pump - but once it got going it was wonderful. I think if one did a good cleaning on the floors and then used this machine for daily or weekly maintenance, it is ideal. I hadn't mopped in a while, so this thing had its work cut out for it. Afterward, I took a white flour sack dishtowel, got it wet, then wiped a couple of areas to check and the towel came up clean - so Scooba did the job. The machine was easy to clean, and all the parts came off and went back on as promised. I was amazed and a little ashamed at the gunk it got up.Just ordered the Roomba Discovery, we'll see how that goes."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's ok when it works","review":"This is my 3rd Scooba... when will I ever learn!! The concept is great... and when it works... it can do a pretty good job.... but... you never know when it is going to \\"act up\\" and either not work at all or stop several times during a cleaning cycle. I keep hoping they will work the bugs out... but so far... no such luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product Won't Hold Up","review":"I bought this product 14 months ago. While it was working, I was not impressed: it's loud, doesn't get in corners, cleaning pattern doesn't make sense. After about 4-5 months the battery quit and the company sent me another one at no charge. However, now it's 2 months after the warranty expired, and the motor has died. The company offered to send me one at discounted price, but at roughly $300 a year, I said no thanks. I have no use now for the case of cleaning solution that I bought. I went to a steamer mop which works better in every way. Scooba is a good idea but it's still in the beta phase. Don't waste your money on this expensive, sub-quality product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the basic work, cleanup is tedious","review":"We have had the Scooba for 6 months now. It works pretty well. I cannot complain about its ability to wash the floor, however you must remove any obstacles (chairs, carpets etc) to reduce the interference. The only complaint that we have had is that it does require a good amount of cleanup after each use. I do like that you can use vinegar in place of the clorox, so we use that once a month. We run our irobot vacuum first (kitchen and digning room are ceramic tile). ONce done, we run the scooba, then go to bed. I would say this has been effective and only twiced did it not complete the job because it got stuck.ONe bit of advice for anyone that is purchasing this for the first time, DO NOT WATCH IT WORK. It is frustrating watching the pattern it takes.Overall I think it really works, and helps with weekly moppings!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not happy","review":"purchased this as a gift for my daughter for chrismas.

While it works better than the Roomba (which I gave 1 star), it still has too many problems. I think the main reason people buy the Roomba and Scooba is to cater to their laziness and/or lack of time. (For me, both!) Unfortunately, by the time you charge the Scooba, clean it, fill it with this many parts solution and that many parts water, lock it into place, (etc., etc.), you could have mopped the floor yourself and still had time to prepare a 5 course meal.

If you leave the house with the Scooba running, you will come back to a dry floor with water spots all over the place.For me, the hard part about mopping is all the other steps involved in the process: moving furniture, sweeping, drying. The Scooba only eliminates one step - the actual mopping. But you still need to fill the Scooba, set it up, and clean it. It's more work than just doing the dang mopping yourself.Bottom line: if you're looking to save time with this gadget, you won't. Don't waste your money. Way overpriced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love iRobot Discovery, but not impressed by Scooba","review":"I have owned an iRobot Discovery vacuum clean for years, almost since it was released. I am pretty happy with it so when iRobot released Scooba I decided to go for it. Unfortunately Scooba has been a disappointment. I find that the area it is able to clean on a tank is far too limited. I am also unimpressed with the quality of cleaning, especially when it comes to corners or any area that is not wide open. At the end of the day I found myself going back to manual cleaning. I am a great fan of robots in any form and of automated anything in general (I am a 30 something computer engineer, which probably explains it). However I still expect the machine I buy/use to do a good job. Scooba is sadly not one of those."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over Priced and Doesn't Work","review":"We bought our Scooba last year.

Then it stopped working. We completely cleaned it, primed and it still didn't work. Finally, we got it to work, by starting and then letting the top tank to drop. This worked for awhile, until finally, it just won't even turn on. So now it sits in my living room do much of nothing.Two other complaints... if even a little bit of water is left in tank, during your next wash it smells moldy.

If you look at FRESH blades out of the package under a magnifying lupe, you can see that many of the \\"new\\" blades have rounded, dull tips, some are broken and some are even bent! At least 50% of my 100-pack was pre-dull--and by that, I mean the tips were worn rounded, almost as if they were sharpened that way or even recycled. Completely unacceptable.If you want the original, high quality #11 blade from X-Acto (100-count), you have to be sure to order X811 and neither X511 or X611. The originals are FAR better to work with, and you can at least count on the fact that they will be sharp right out of the box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sharp!","review":"Bought these blades recently and noticed they were pretty different.

It has to do with Greg Travis, who plays a profanity spewing redneck who gets all of the films best lines.

The black and white photos can be bleak and depressing also. It desperately needs new photos!For older children, it covers everything! Every procedure and machine.

There is a few pages that shows a map of where the camps were and the estimated number of deaths in that country.(deaths of Jews) I found these few pages very informative.

The story follows the lives of the Franks during the prewar era. It describes how, little by little, lives of the Jews became compartmentalized and restricted and how it affected Anne's family specifically. This explanation helps children understand why people were trapped---it all happened so slowly in such smalll increments that before they knew it there was no escape. This book also contains numerous maps and timelines about the concentration camps, their proximity and how people were sent from one to the other. The book then goes on the describe how Anne's diary was saved. For kids who have read her diary, perhaps in the classroom, or for those who just want to know more about Anne and see her in photographs, this book is an excellent learning tool and leaves you feeling both sad at her premature death and triumphant that her diary was saved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Educationbound","review":"This is a great book.

I too saw Ohgr at the Palace in Hollywood (this is a small place, I guarantee you would not see Nine Inch Nails here, which is more what this album resembles--back in the pretty hate machine days).

I can definately hear the influence of this project in the new Skinny Puppy yet it's so totally original unto itself. I love the almost 80s retro feel of this while it still retains a very modern sound. I liked every song on this disc and find myself listening to it quite a bit along with the new Puppy and the other Ohgr album, Sunnypsyop.

Crunchy, racing tunes against the best vocals we've heard from Ogre in years. This album doesn't miss a step; it vaults over both pop and industrial, into an insanely fun, distinctive, addictive sound. This isn't Puppy, and it isn't Ritalin. This is Ogre growing as an artist in ways only hinted at in the earlier Welt releases."},{"rating":"1","title":"industrial disco sludge","review":"I generally enjoy bands that are considered industrial but this supposed industrial band sounds more like the brain child from a collaboration between Al Jorgenson (good) and the Bee Gees (bad). Whats even worse though is when you combine good and bad you should get neutral but this album is terrible excluding the decent first song water. Let's say you like goofy loopy drum beats while someone tries to sing either creepy or like a whiny little girl listening to stayin' alive, and then there's circus music thrown in for good measure, then this is the album for you. If you want some good industrial music thats a bit newer than Ministry or Nails (both excellent) try the Damage Manual or Pigface. thanks for your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eclectic Industrial is a good thing with \\"Ohgr\\"","review":"This is an awesome album from one of the most important forces behind industrial music. Nivek Ogre and Mark Walk really put together some very different, and very good, songs on Welt. From the just plain catchy \\"Cracker\\" to the FLA meets KMFDM sounding \\"Pore\\". Ohgr takes advantage of so many different musical genres and makes them work together. This album is just a must have for any fan of industrial music, and definately for any fan of Skinny Puppy. One of the most interesting and creative albums released in 2001 ... even though it was made in 95 ... ; )"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nivek Ogre and co. still have it....","review":"Bought the Ohgr 'Welt' CD finally after months of searching for it.

Some people say you can and it's a tight squeeze, but it's so tight that if you do manage to smash it in somehow it feels like the bag is going to crack your keyboard if you bump it in to something.

Back in 1962 Bill Haley was merely forgotten in the US, but hailed as King of the Twist in Mexico. Offered to record some twist tunes in the prestigious \\"Bitter End\\"-Club in New York, he even flew in guitarrist Franny Beecher, who had officially left the Comets a while ago. Bill and the band do a good job, the sound is great, too, but the audience doesn't listen. They all talk, there's hardly any applause. The LP was a flop at the time, but it's worth a buy. Ever heard Bill Haley \\"waltzing the twist\\"?"},{"rating":"2","title":"SIGNING IS GREAT","review":"I started signing with my 8-month-old son.

Covering his years of smuggling, before the era of the Rebel Alliance, Han faces challenges and threats of death in 3 gripping, well told tales of courage, wit, and stregnth. Han is a witty young space-pilot who is well known for his courage to do nearly any smuggling job avalible. When Han runs into trouble he is known for dumping his cargo and running. This 3-book cycle is a very gripping tale of Han Solo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, classic stuff.","review":"This trilogy is a good and unique one that should be read by any serious Star Wars fan. The Han Solo Adventures are much better than the Han Solo Trilogy written by A.C. Crispin. Daley gives these books a real Star Wars feel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Han and chewy in the corpoate sector","review":"These three novels were actually written in 1979 and 1980, long before the Zahn trilogy kicked of what we now know as the EU Expanded Universe. Daley also did the radio dramatizations of the original movie trilogy. Daley also created the corporate sector. Note that almost nothing is ever written about the Corp Sector, but there it is on the NJO maps of the galaxy. Also, AC Crispen wrote his Han Solo trilogy in a manner that accommodates Han and Chewy's trip to the CS.I have placed this trilogy on the timeline at -4.9 BNH, taking place between The Hutts Gambit and Rebel Dawn (books 2 and 3 of the HST).These are the first known non-Lucas novels of the SW universe. I am not sure whether they actually pre-date the SW comic strips, but surely Daley is the real father of the EU. If you are a Han Solo fan, this trilogy is a must addition to you library. My copy is the june 1992 edition found at a garage sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not in depth stories and pretty ridiculous","review":"This book accounts for a set of stories by Han Solo almost 1 year previous to the battle of Yavin.The three stories are somewhat poor imagined and narrated. The mainframe of the story around Solo's adventures and misfits in the Corporate Sector.Although we are reading Sci-Fi and fantastic and almost unreal things happen on these tales, the plot surpasses that barrier and makes it ridiculous and unbelievable at most (especially on the first story).Han Solo has a fascinating personality and its better depicted in his other trilogy by AC Crispin."},{"rating":"2","title":"silver bracelet","review":"I bought this bracelet twice for my husband, i really like it.

It definitely answers the question of \\"Lord, where are You when bad things happen?\\" Unfortunately, sometimes God is using the bad to judge sin. This book is very thorough, though, and reminds us of the character of God. If we are obedient to Him, if we love Him, then He will turn the bad into our ultimate good. By looking at the words of Habakkuk the prophet, you will be challenged to say, \\"Lord, things look bad, but I trust You. As long as I have You, I will stand, no matter what.\\" If you're only willing to read one book in the \\"Lord\\" series, choose this one!

Perhaps, He has a dark side that doesn't care about human suffering, or even enjoys it.

After buying this album (Blue), I am happy I did. I love the standards and hearing a young Diana Ross give her stamp to these timeless treasures. I do believe that she does justice to them, but remember she was almost 30 years old when she cut this album, can you imagine if she had cut this album now with all of the life experiences she has had and of course with the feeling of her voice now!!!in my opinion, the only slacker on this disk is I Loves Ya Porgy...she seams strained and unprepared to tackle this one...sorry folks, not my favorite track on the disk. All in all, a good set of music that should have been released back in 1972, but nice it waited to get its full appreciation and what a nice piece to have as Lady Sings the Blues hits DVD this year (earlier in the year of course)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't Wait to Purchase","review":"First bought from Starbucks for I am a big fan, but have since bought several for relatives. The entire CD is fantastic, from begining to end. My absolute favorites are \\"Let's Do It \\" (the best song), \\"Easy Living\\", and Solitude. You will be satisfied with this disc, and I look forward to her new CD in September."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE ALBUM THAT MADE THE CRITICS GET IT","review":"This is the album that critics, who unfairly branded Diana's voice in an unflaterring light over the years, could not criticize. BLUE is further proof of the folly of the Grammys' failure to recognize ( thus far ) Miss Ross with a much overdue lifetime achievement award. She was not yet 30 years old when these songs were recorded, and her incite and inflections of these interpretations show just how impressive her talent was and remains."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music! Great arrangements! Great vocals!","review":"It is a shame this CD is not getting any promotion because it is wonderful and light years ahead of all the standards albums currently in release. Diana's interpretations are timeless and the musical arrangements superb. In an era of synthesized music, what a delight to hear an orchestra with real musical instruments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage Ross","review":"It's been in the vaults since 1972: a year after the release of her Billie Holiday biopic Lady Sings the Blues, Ross went back into the studio to record additional songs for what in hindsight is essentially a crossover album. The results are admirable, and in one case--Little Girl Blue--more than that. In peak voice, the singer retains her inimitable fluidity and shows she's more than up to the challenge. Too bad Motown lost its nerve, opting to send Ms. Ross to Boss-land. Now the question is, are we ready to accept the queen of girl pop as a legitimate heir to Lena, Dinah and Billie?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blue Me Away","review":"What Album has been on the jazz charts for half a year and was recorded 30 years ago. The answer is Diana Ross's 'Blue'. Listen to it and you'll know why!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Right title!","review":"This album was very well done. This was the right time to release this album so we can appreciate the Jazz talent of Diana Ross. Berry Gordy had his reasons. She should continue to put out more jazz material like Natalie Cole is doing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blues and More Blues","review":"This follow up album to Lady Sings The Blues, include some songs sang in the movie, and other gems that she sings with great ease and savvy, as well as well voiced. This is a great CD for Jazz/Blues lovers, which of course she made one out of me, and a must on Diana Ross' collections.Great, Great, Great.Berry Gordy made decisions sometimes that were foolish, yes foolish, because this album should have been release back then, and would have enhanced the moment she was having and her career, but hey better late than never.Go buy it right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miss Ross Reigns Supreme","review":"i was totally blown away by this disc. it is awesome, although a big diana fan since the days of the supremes, i have always felt she shines best with this genre. this accompany piece to the Lady Sings the Blues soundtrack was shelved and forgotten, until now. same musicians and of course, gil askey. Alternate versions of tracks from the movie plus other material. i particularly love \\"solitude\\" which i never understood how that tune never made it into the film. My favorites are \\"i love you porgy\\" and \\"Had you been around.\\" you may recall the latter from the film by another artist. This disc will be at the top of the list for all Ross fans and needs to be marketed for the world to hear this magnificent collection.i am remembering why i was such a devoted fan of Miss Ross. having been a bit disappointed in some of her more recent work, i can't be more pleased with this collection. Now, get back in the studio miss Ross and give us more !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I think I play this album every day....","review":"It's awesome. I'm kinda glad it was \\"lost\\" 34 yrs ago, because it's well worth the wait. The only misstep to me is \\"I Loves You, Porgy\\". I think Gil Askey took Miss Ross too far out on a limb and left mother hanging on that one...BUT she makes up for it on everything else. Ross is in top form and her usual self-confidence in her craft is clearly apparent (or else she wouldn't have LET Gil sell her on that \\"Porgy\\" arragement in the first place). 5 stars. \\"Let's Do It,\\" \\"No More,\\" \\"Easy Living,\\" and the swingin' \\"Had You Been Around\\" are personal faves.

The honesty and truth in what John Lee describes and way he captures and words these truths is heart-opening, validating, healing and a huge relief. It is like he is describing the places we all know in ourselves but never talk about or want to own. I thought it would be too basic but honestly it is fresh and has really useful information that is easy to practice and apply to daily life. The realness and humility in John Lee's books always hit deep places in me and I am so grateful for his willingness to go before us and shine the light of his awarenesses for us as we try to find our own way.Other great books by John Lee that I have personally found to be life-changing are \\"Facing the Fire\\" and \\"Growing Yourself Back Up\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive Collection of SW designs for glass","review":"Not your usual collection of SW stained glass patterns.

TR's vocals are very thin and he's oversinging, trying to extract something/anything out of these lame songs. Lazy production didn't add to the charm as it did on some of his earlier efforts and Bang The Drum would be TR's darkest moment, even though the song made him money as an FM jingle.

The others in the Galactic Milieu series run a close second. Her other stuff is so-so, readable but not exceptional. I was struck initially by the story, and also by the quality of the writing. It's so different, and much better, than anything else I've read in the genre, and manages to largely avoid the usual time travel anachronistic and self-referential cliches.I've recently finished reading the whole thing (including the other Milieu books) yet again, and I'm still amazed and moved by the experience, from the initial familiarity with the need of the misfits to leave, to the ultimate understanding of Atoning Unifex.

The scenes themselves represent films that can be rented relatively easy, and this makes for a great comparison study of how the screenplay \\"works\\" - compared to your own efforts.

The 4-Star material has long been burdened with after-the-fact overdubs of additional instrumentation and vocal choruses, and one would hope that Proper would present it in its original unfettered monophonic glory. Sadly, eight of these tracks are still encumbered with the incongruous ersatz accompaniment that has made them unlistenable since the LP era: High Geared Daddy, New Panhandle Rag, Heebie Jeebie Blues, Sweetheart You Know I Love You So, I'm Happy You Hurt Me, English Sweetheart, Lucy Lee and Jilted Love.The good news is that the other 20 tracks appear in their original form with good sound. And it's cheap, so one can justifiably buy it and just skip over the offending tracks. But the question remains: Will the original, undubbed versions of Webb Pierce's 4-Star recordings ever be reissued? It's time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Performance Welding Handbook by Richard Finch","review":"This was a well written book for someone with limited welding experience.

Though things are different from the book in terms of damage caused, the descriptions are excellent and are brought to life (as real as it can be). I couldn't stop reading this after I bought it.

They could also not guarantee a return date for the replacement flash, which I purchased for my step daughter's wedding scheduled in one months time.The \\"slave\\" portion worked great in testing at home and in some preliminary use ... come the weekend of the wedding, and it stopped working all together for no reason (we replaced batteries, checked and rechecked the mechanisms).

I liked the leather. However, it is not well made and the quality is poor. It had scuffs and scrapes (not an old worn leather look which would have been fine) almost immediately and after only one month of use it had a tear in the leather on the back of the bag. After four months of use it looks so bad, my husband now needs a new bag. I do not recommend this bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Professional and Classic","review":"I needed a briefcase slash laptop case I could carry to court and while travelling.

The shoulder strap is very comfortable and I chose brown for a classic legal look. A modern bag with classic styling. The only caveat to using this bag is not to zip the zippers all the way because they are so big they rattle some while carrying the bag. This is a minor inconvenience and I'd rather have the heavy duty zippers. I use this item item practically daily and recommend it to any student or professional.

There is an outer zipper compartment on the back and a front zipper compartment under the flap for phone, pens etc that are not obvious from the pictures. I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and he loves it. The only complaint I have thus far is that the laptop compartment does not fit a laptop with a 15.4 \\" screen although one of that size can fit within the bag.

Also, the poetry is just not very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jesus' Visit","review":".What happened to the keeper of the inn that had no room for Joseph and Mary? Did God condemn him for turning them away. Did God bless him for allowing them to stay in his stable?John Piper's poem, The Innkeeper, is one man's image of the rest of the story. Many questions surface when we think of the possibilities. First, did anyone, other than the shepards and the three wise men, even know of Jesus birth? Scripture is silent on that point. If they knew, how did the people of Bethlehem or the Roman soldiers react to Jesus' birth?The Innkeeper gives us one view of the story. This an excellent poem and a creative approach to the rest of the Christmas story. I recommend this book for anyone who enjoys a Christmas tale and anyone who would like meditating on the life of Jesus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Christmas Themed Christian Storybook","review":"If you are familiar with the fictional Christian books \\"The Robe,\\" \\"Ben Hur,\\" and \\"Barabbas,\\" this book follows that idea for the innkeeper from the Christmas narrative in Luke 2 although it is presented in a short storybook rather than a novel. The book is a moving story of how the innkeeper's life was impacted by meeting baby Jesus and then what a later meeting with Jesus would have been like. The artwork is very good and the story is powerful. This is a wonderful advent style Christian storybook.

It is unfortunate that I did not wait to see some of the other, less than stellar, reviews. This is a terrible book! Its writing is simplistic and many sections are repeated in different parts of the book, as if they are new revelations. The editing, especially for a fine house like St. Martin's Press, is abyssmal. It refers to Bobby Thomson as Thomas, Ed Barrow as Ed Barry and includes many other errors that even a first month editor should have found and corrected.

Even tho Allen was not as tough as he might have been on old George, reading the book was like being in the press box with the sportswriters - I felt like I was there too. And that first chapter, on the Peterson/Kekitch swap-a-roo! What a kick! That actually DID happen at the author's house, so who would know more. And that was just the first chapter! It was full of inside information about all the Yankeees - the ones you REALLY want to read about, like Mickey and Billy, Reggie and Catfish. I really enjoyed this book, and hope Mr. Allen writes more of this kind of inside stuff in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Book That Misses The Mark","review":"This book is a perfect example of the importance of truth in advertising. If Maury Allen wanted to write a book that provided an overview of his prolific sports writing career I'm sure that there would have been many interested readers. However, he has chosen to write that book and disguise it as a book about the Yankees. Sure, the focus of the book for the most part is on the Yankees, but Allen presents little that the average Yankee fan has not already seen. He also interrupts the narration on the Yankees with stories from his personal experiences that have nothing to do with the Yankees. There are no insights here for Yankee fans, which would be fine if he didn't promise a book about George Steinbrenner's years of ownership with the Yankees. Don't waste your time with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sportswriters revenge","review":"Maury Allen's book mentions, numerous times, that Thurman Munson was not a nice man. He was rude to fans, waitresses, and Heaven Forbid-sportswriters. Allen happily mentions that he has never wasted one vote on Munson in Hall of Fame votes. In fact, not voting for him appears to be revenge for Munson not giving quotes and quips for Allen's stories in the New York Post. This is precisely the reason sportswriters should not vote for Hall of Fame inductions; as Allen states, the writers vote on what they thought of the ballplayer as a \\"man\\", not as a clutch ballplayer, who always came through when his team really needed him to. And we all know, if you don't show respect to sportswriters, you don't deserve to be in the Hall of Fame. Sportswriters believe, that since they know how to put two sentences together, they are more important than the players they write about. Gotcha, Maury. And go to Hell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip It","review":"I bought this book thinking it was about George Steinbrenner...but The Boss turns out to be nothing more than a supporting character in his own story. There's next to nothing about him.The book is also confusing and reads more like the author's memoirs. He'll start telling a story, then go off on a tangent into the past (which can last anywhere from two sentences to two pages) and then suddenly he's back at the original thought. It was nearly impossible to follow.I'm a huge Yankee fan and have read lots of books on the team...there are better ones out there. This definitely isn't one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Awesome!!","review":"Finally a book that not only explains the theory and design decisions behind putting together a framework, but also supplies a fully functioning framework for you to start with. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!On a side note... the editor should be flogged because of the numerous grammatical errors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for beginners","review":"The problem with this book is that SAF, the sample framework, is a toy just for demonstration purpose. The book gives insight on why and how to construct a framework, very good in this aspect, but it doesn't give you a real framework you can adapt or use.What's is the point of writing your own framework from the base, if frameworks are supposed to be so generic that can be used in disparate applications, a framework written by a real expert would be good for you too, or at least an excellent starting point.I think a really useful thing would be a open source project, community supporting and a book.Lhotka does something like that, but his framework is focused in implement a configurable dataset, very good, but frameworks have lots more aspects.This book teach the basic well, .net technologies, gof patterns with examples.

Full with conflict, emotions, some happy scenes, and some scenes that make you want to cry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"For the most part I really enjoyed this book. I have been a fan of Ms. Savoy since she came out with Spellbound.

She shows real situations that don't apply to my own, hence, most of the book was unhelpful. This is not a particularly good book if you want to know what to do specifically - unless the examples in the book match your own. Her suggestions of what you can do to improve a room are either too broad or too specific to the particular case she uses. I've seen more helpful hints on the Internet than in this book, and do not recommend it unless you have other Feng Shui books. Not completely useless, you can use this as a supplement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Western Guide to Feng Shui: Room by Room","review":"Good book but not as good as her first best seller - Western Guide to Feng Shui."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb Book","review":"Sorry, but I think the whole book could have been written in one chapter. Most of the book was saying things like, don't buy a chair until you sit in it, or keep clutter off your desk. Advise that just takes common sense and fills up pages. I was waiting for the author to tell me not to run with a pair of scissors in my hand. I felt talked down to and unless you are very young with your very first apartment or house, you might also find the book insulting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Abundant with easy to understand ideas and tools!","review":"This book is very helpful and a joy to read.

Western is a modern adaptation of the classic feng shui (which is thousands of years old). Instead of using a compass very carefully to determine where things are to be placed, one is told to simply use the door to a room as the starting point. That means that everything ends up in a different place from where the compass tells you. I was simply not comfortable with the suggestions which are all meant to accomodate a western lifestyle. I prefer the scientific approach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too basic and repetitive.","review":"I was very disappointed with the content of Ms. Collins book, which is an extremely quick read. After buying this book on impulse, I felt swindled by this amateur feng shui consultant.The book focuses on the practical elements of Feng Shui: don't place your bed or desk so you can't see the door, don't buy furniture with dangerously sharp corners, clear away clutter by throwing away what you don't need or love. These common-sense ideas are repeated ad nauseum for each room of the house. A good writer would have cut half of the text.If you like books such as \\"Who Moved My Cheese?,\\" which I hated because it was overly simplistic and made a two-page paper into a book, you will not like this book.If you want a very quick read, simple ideas, and some horrifyingly bad pictures, be my guest.Maybe I'm a hypocrite; I did follow one bit of her advice. After reading the book, I threw it in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of Order","review":"Although I refer to this book frequently, I was disturbed by one aspect of the book - - namely, that some of its pages are out of order.

In fact, you kind of feel bad for this family - and the movie. It's a really odd and uncomfortable assortment of hoodlums, war vet, high-powered hedge-fund managers, and bickering parents. At points, the movie seems to gel and convey a poignant story - particular Debra Messing and her father-in-law. But at other times, it seems as if \\"Nothing like the Holidays\\" is torn between several themes and was emotionally confusing. At the end of the day, the movie just tried to include too much and be too many things. That's too bad, because if it had scaled back its ambitions, \\"Nothing like the Holidays\\" could have been pretty decent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something like the holidays","review":"This is a fun movie that covers familiar ground but with a Puerto Rican flavor. The movie is the story of a Chicago family with Puerto Rican roots gathering for the holidays. The son returning from the war, the professional son and daughter in law from New York, the daughter in from Hollywood and the parents are all keeping a multitude of secrets from one another. The story is told in a loving and humorous way with a lot of feeling for family. The cast was great and the story was fun. A good movie for anytime but especially the holidays. I saw some of my own family in this and believe most people will. It is a good watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartworming Holidays","review":"This is an enjoyable and darling piece of Puerto Rican culture and brings universal human qualities to the characters and the story. We all have some crazy in our families and I laughed at so many of the comical moments between family members. There were real issues that each of the characters wrestles with and the main relationship between John Leguizamo and Debra Messing is quite realistic but has some movie drama. The sweetest couple is the parents who go through their own problems and as a viewer I hoped for them. I liked the film and recommend watching it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good Christmas film","review":"I first saw this film in the theater. To give full disclosure, one of my businesses is a movie theater, so I see a lot of films. This one isn't bad at all.

Dysfunctional family gets together for a holiday, hilarity ensues.Both movies feature similar themes: family member in denial, family member with career troubles, family with an emotional struggle, and so on. And both movies were hilarious. \\"Home...\\" was funny in a mostly dry-witted manner, while \\"Nothing...\\" is nearly pie-in-the-face funny.But the seasonal message from both movies is the same: Spend time with your family; whether you want to not.Nothing Like the Holidays is a solid entry into the modern family editions of Christmas Movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"A guide to cancer treatment history","review":"Richard Walters has compiled a wonderful reference book on the origins and history of various \\"alternative\\" cancer treatments.

The great thing is that when you re-arrange things you can simply print and slide in a new label. Yes, I'm a little obsessive-compulsive, but it's great to see that kids really look at the label to find things and put things away.

You also have to make sure you take really small facial shots of your little one to fit it into the frame, I'm still working on finding one from some of the months that will fit.

The story, set in a bleak miserable town, is so incredibly boring that I have been trying unsuccessfully to read it for over a year, and have reached the conclusion that if the Nobel Committee chose to award Pamuk based on this, then their criteria could not have included literary talent. There are several other Turkish and Arab writers whose works are far superior. Turkish speakers with whom I have discussed this are of the view that Pamuk's talent perhaps does not translate well, and that reading him in the original language is a different experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly translated or badly written?","review":"Not sure which one it is: whether the book was lost in translation or whether the author did not know what he was doing.Very hard to read, raises many questions and does not provide many answers, you get lost in duration of the events described in the book (how long does Ka spend in Kars : 1 week or 1 year?), weird references to newspapers being published in advance describing events that are yet to happen like they can foresee the future (i.e. Ka will write a poem called \\"Snow\\"), the whole idea of girls wanting to wear headscarves as their religion asks of them, but at the same time ending their lives with a suicide (which is a far great sin than not wearing a scarf, I believe) seems absurd.

Pamuk's themes are now very well known. The endless introspective, arcane comment and reflections on the tensions between the west and the east, freedom and restriction, secularism and the supernatural, islam and christianity etc etc just did not hold me. I suspect that those who gave it 3+ stars felt obliged to run the race to the end because the book promises to enlighten us.

My test for all fiction is whether or not I give a damn about the characters and Snow does not disappoint.

At the center of this novel is the explosive issue of balancing religious freedom against governmental stability. Pamuk handles this deftly, and manages to illuminate without taking sides. You see the best and the worst of all parties involved. With beautiful prose, reminiscent of the great Russian masters, Pamuk explores the themes of personal and national identity, expertly drawing us in, and opening our eyes. Snow is a masterfully crafted and deeply profound novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Snow","review":"Because I love winter and the snow that defines it - I was intrigued by this book. The fact that Pamuk can define it so eloquently throughout an entire book which takes place over just a few days, unveils his creativity. It is a sensitive issue he writes about and the message is still mulling in my brain. I will have to read it again before I can comment on the issue, but as to the framing of the message - snow - it was brilliant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard Read","review":"I found this book to be incredibly depresssing. The story is a bit convoluted and takes careful attention, part of which is due to the writing style. The book illustrates a number of issues which are worthy of thought and discussion, but the presentation made it difficult for me to read and I had to force myself to finish it.My book club read the book and was evenly divided between those who truly enjoyed the book and those of us who didn't.

This book was so slow, so boring, so uninteresting in every respect, that I simply could not continue. Who is this book for, anyway? If it's written for the READER, then the author should make some literary attempts to REACH the reader. I suspect that books such as this are written for the writer and for nobody else. Well, maybe for a few people who aren't interested in certain aspects of fiction, such as scenes in which there is conflict, tension, rising action. I have noticed that when it comes to what's deemed \\"literary fiction,\\" narrative seems to suffice. But narrative alone is boring.

This was not a great book, but maybe the translation was just bad?? Also, I am not sure if the author meant it or not but I got the impression from the writing and story that Turkish people aren't that bright. It seemed to me he was putting down the muslim religion. Anyway, that was minor, the writing was just bad, bad, bad.

Yet the novelis much more - for instance the conversation between the director of thelocal school and his assassin is very compelling - Pamuk is much too cleverto dismiss fundamentalist thinking outright.This is certainly a book worth reading, but it will require some effort.I think the translation is OK, but I have a feeling that it is not superb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get through it","review":"Well written but it didn't grab me like I hoped it would.

I had to purchase this book in order to do a presentation in my Turkish Culture and Civilization class, and really, for assigned reading, I haven't yet seen a book with as many overlapping and complex themes as Orhan Pamuk's 'Snow'. On the outside, it's an examination of the clash between the secular West of Turkey and the more traditional East, but on reading the book further you find a delightfully interwoven tale of love, loss, and self-discovery. It can be a little depressing at first, what with all the suicide, but nonetheless you won't be able to put it down until you finish, and even if you are able to put it down by some master sorcery you won't be able to get it off your mind for at least a day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snow","review":"This is a brilliantly and provocatively written view of modern Turkey and it's relationship to Europe and the world.

As stated in another review, SNOW must be classified as an \\"impenetrable political novel.\\" After 95 pages or so, I was overwhelmed by the DENSITY and minutiae of conversation and thought involving the polemics of God, Islam, and church-state separatism. For other readers, e.g., philosophers, seekers of the truth, and/or religious dogmatists, however, I can conceive that they may find the story enjoyable and potentially satisfying. For those of you who are already reasonably \\"centered\\" or otherwise comfortable with the inner self and its relationship with the play of the universe, you may find the book too boring to finish, as did I."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thorough insight into small town Turkey","review":"I can see why some people will negatively review this book. It certainly doesn't read like a Dan Brown or Steven King novel. Although it won't thrill you with action it will give you a great sense of the cultural landscape of Kars, Turkey; and the diverse range of cultural identities that are inherently conflicting and absolute.Being unfamiliar with Turkish culture outside of the little I've read about its ancient and medieval history, this book is incredibly modern and insightful, as well as entertaining. I'd recommend it to any western reader who wants to explore a new landscape without being bored by dates, battles and historical figures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure what the fuss is about...","review":"I just didn't enjoy this book. I don't mind so much that a book isn't plot driven if the language is beautiful and the ideas stimulating. With this book, however, I didn't even find the language poetic or evocative. And the ideas were so repetitive and expressed so turgid that I stopped reading half-way through. I really thought this book could do with a whole lot of editing. It was unsubtle, self-indulgent and dull. Perhaps something got lost in the translation? So disappointed. I had been eager to read this book for ages and when it was finally available at the library I was very excited. Oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snow as \\"political\\"???","review":"I absolutely love Orhan Pamuk's work. LOVE it. And Snow is better than most other books that I've read recently. That said, Snow gets a 2 because every other Orhan Pamuk book is a better read than Snow, and they are all just as political. I find it very strange readers believe Snow is \\"important\\" & \\"political\\" when it deals with the same themes and issues that permeate all Orhan Pamuk's work: being able to truly know yourself as a Turk in the context of Western oppression and a country situated literally on the divide between east & west, europe & asia. My advice: buy a different Pamuk book, you will enjoy it much more. Then read it a second time and pay attention to identity and power issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be instructive","review":"I tried & tried to finish this book, but it was too dense & stifling. It does open an interesting window on Islamist issues &, in that respect, is a valuable learning tool for those who wish to delve into these issues. It doesn't work as a novel, though. The characters are flat & create little empathy with the reader. The conversations were stilted & weighed heavily with deep, philosophical ramblings. In the end, I felt mired in leaden prose."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Istambul\\" in a minor key","review":"Having read Pamuk's \\"Istambul\\" without pleasure I hesitated to read \\"Snow.\\" I should have trusted my first impression. He cannot write a novel: everything is a reminiscence of his past, whether non-fiction or fiction. His people in \\"Snow\\" are wooden characters. You learn little about either secularism or Islamic fundamentalism. What you learn is how Pamuk feels at every moment, and I for one simply don't care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Only good thing about this book is the intensity of the dialogue and the rich portrayal of characters, but this doesn't hold up till the second half of the book; the rest is cliche arguments that could in no way have come from the actual people involved in the setting. Pamuk really starts making characters say the things that are more stereotypical than actual, real, or even relevant to the discussion being portrayed. I agree with lots of the reviews here. The book does confuse and annoy. I left this book twice and read others then came back to it, each time with the hope I could see it with a fresh eye, until in the end I dropped it at the last quarter, too tired of the continuous dragging on and on which I assumed would only continue to the end, leaving me unsatisfied.May God bless my mother's soul, but it really would have helped if she'd taught me a thing or two about Turkish. I'd much rather read the original Turkish because maybe, just maybe, the problem is in the translation?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mud","review":"Would have been a more apt title because this was like a slog through it. Lost in translation? Maybe. Characters were without exception difficult to give a damn about, self-indulgent, selfish, silly. Could go on but won't except to say it was a ride thru Kars i couldn't wait to be over."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just couldn't take it anymore!","review":"I choose this book because I was interested in the political aspects of the story. I stuck with it through almost 250 pages because I kept hoping something would happen to make me want to continue to the end. You should know that I consider not finishing a book a personal failure on my part. I always finish a book but I just couldn't stand it anymore. If you read the plot it sounds interesting but when you read the actual events you are left feelng cheated. I think, for me, the main problem is character development. They have no personality. I'm left just not caring what happens to Ka or Ipek. I had to stop because I never felt like reading a book was such a let down and a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow","review":"I attempted to read this book and stopped half way because it was just so slow! The language was difficult to follow and the story did'nt seem to be going anywhere and I lost interest. Overall very boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stuck in Snow","review":"\\"Snow\\" started as promising, but gradually became boring and redundant. The story follows Ka, an alienated Turkish poet returning to his home town of Kars. The same dialogue exchanges are repeated over and over between the modern, Turkish poet and the provincial Turkish fundamentalist moslems of small town Kars. The fundamentalists are idealized as generous and pure of heart. At the point Ka, the protagonist reads his poem named \\"Snow\\" to a woman and literally asks her six times if she thinks it is beautiful, and six times she responds that it is very beautiful. The alienated intellectual Ka's spiritual quest to get in touch with his cultural and religious identity is agonizingly boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry as toast","review":"I found it nearly impossible to get into the narrative of this book. Orhan Pamuk's style of writing here is distanced, very dry, intellectualized. A love story is presented in the most remote way; its dialogue is as flat and formal as any I've read, given the context. I wonder if this has to do with an overly literal translation. Sorry to say, this is one of the dullest books that's crossed my path in a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not compelling","review":"I was disappointed with this book and couldn't wait for it to be over. There were a couple of points in the book when I thought, yes, this is really going to be great, but they didn't last long.While I gained some insight into the complex political and social dynamics of the region, I found the story largely dry and confusing. I lost track of who people were and what faction they represented. I thought it was ridiculous that each time Ka felt a poem coming on everyone had to stop in their tracks for him to write it.I was hoping for a historical novel and this is more of a political primer. Perhaps the translation was bad. This is the first book of Pamuk's I have read. I could see that he has the capacity for beautiful prose, but it wasn't consistently represented in this novel.In contrast, I am now reading March by Gwendolyn Brooks. Her weaving of history and politics into a great story with beautiful character development and imagery makes for my kind of book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Snowed","review":"Turkey is a favorite place of mine so I was hoping for something insightful and relevant. This book is neither, AND it is boring. The main character was such a chamelion that he was not even needed. He served as an improbable witness to surreal events. You will not find any of the color of Turkish life in this book; none of the complexity of Turkish views and issues. You will be depressed. You will be left wondering where the story was supposed to go and to what purpose.Save your time and money and pass this one up."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"I read it while living in Turkey after barely finishing the Black Book. I wanted to give Orhan another chance. My mistake. Unlikable characters, confusing \\"plot\\" and at least 100 sentences proclaiming the newly fallen snow over Kars as \\"white and beautiful\\". I don't get what all the fuss is about."},{"rating":"1","title":"After a certain point, it's unreadable","review":"I was disappointed with this novel, although it's possible that some of the fault lies with the translation since the original was written in Turkish. The pacing is uneven, with some portions of the book dragging to the point where I began to long for something -- anything -- to happen. And the motivations of the characters are, at best, murky.I forced myself to read 150 pages, just to be sure that I wasn't giving up too soon due to cultural barriers or some other fault on my part, but in the end I decided my modest amount of recreational reading time is just too precious to spend on Snow."},{"rating":"2","title":"An engaging listen","review":"I listened to the unabridged version of this book and found it engaging the whole way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nobel Prize for Literature??? Amazing!!!","review":"I found this to be an awful piece of writing. I quit after 50 pages. Maybe it was the translation-but I doubt it. The sentences sprout clauses like weeds and the storytelling turns into a jungle of pretentiousness, artiness, \\"poetic\\" sensibility etc. I agree with some other reviewers that the characters are flat-in fact, I found everything about this work (the first 50 pages at any rate) third rate. Seriously, what is going on here-is this Nobel Prize winning-writing? I'm amazed."},{"rating":"1","title":"No good for Darda Create-A-Course loops","review":"I needed replacement cars for my son's Darda Create-A-Course Building System because the original plastic ones fell apart after weeks of highly enthusiastic use by him and every neighbor kid who came in. We had set up an elaborate track with vertical loops. I figured die-cast metal cars would be just the thing. But they flopped off the track at the first rise because they were just too heavy. For our purposes they were a waste of money. In fairness, they hold great fascination for a younger set; the 3-year-old neighbor across the hall off with them and his mother had to run a covert operation to return them as he kept watch from bed. I didn't have the heart to tell her to keep them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful","review":"This pouch is just the right size.

All in all, it was the best album of 2000, in my opinion. 'Interlude' is more of the same, and almost as good, as the out-takes and b-sides collected here stand their ground next to the main album. Only the meandering instrumental \\"Bar Conscious\\" threatens to derail the disc, but it passes and gives way to better material. In the end a good disc for those who like their past work, but start with 'Sound Of Water' if you're a new listener."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm a big St Et fan, but.....","review":"oh my god, this album is the WORST one they have ever done. EVER. Even Sound of Water was better than this, and that was pretty much rubbish. B-sides of rubbish is even worse. I'm sorry I wasted money on this CD, seeing how I have all of their other albums and from 1991 to 1998, they were sublime. Perfect. Could do no wrong. This music has no beat, no tune, no melody. It's just DULL. If you like all the rest of their music, you will probably HATE this. A real step in the wrong direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book is more a guide to tracing ancestors in places where Loyalists tended to settle than it is a guide to tracing Loyalists themselves. I was hoping for a detailed discussion of the activities of Loyalists and the measures taken against them and the records that these actions generated. Instead, I found the book consisted largely of a superficial rundown of the typical genealogical records -- birth, marriage, death, probate, land -- that can be found in various Canadian provinces and American states. A true guide to Loyalist records remains to be written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Edit","review":"This edition of what I had come to find to be one of the best books I have ever read, has proven to be the worst editing I have ever seen. Liberties that the editor took in this edition pale the writer's intentions as I found in earlier manuscripts. I bought this edition as a Christmas present for a friend who was every excited about what I shared with him from my readings of my edition. It was so poorly editied that my friend thought I had given him a different book entirely. Very disapointing - and what is worst is I paid for overnight shipping. I have never encountered a editor's version so different from another - I have learned a valuable & costly lesson. With over night shipping I spent over $30 on this one book - it's not worth 50 cents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have book","review":"I love this book. I review this book yearly.

If this was the condition of the chuan when it left the warehouse, then that's even worse. I won't take another chance, will not be asking for a replacement, and will be returning it for a refund.

The LX7 is a very small mouse, the length is ok but the width is very narrow. If you are used to a wider standard mouse then this is not one for you. It forces your fingers to curl up for a better grip. I would classify it as an in between laptop/desktop mouse.In regards to functionality, I would have to give it a very low score. It doesn't like any of the mouse pads that I've tried: standard fabric printed, shiny plastic pad or the table. The mouse jumps around and lags. It seems to jump to the top left of my screen a lot, perhaps that's a bug. I also tried moving the bluetooth closer to see if the problem was a signaling issue. I ended up returning it and used my old mouse for now.One thing interesting is that this mouse uses a clear color optic so there's no read light on the bottom. My other optical mice that works on all of my mouse pads use a red optic light. I'm not sure if that had to do with anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent aid to productivity","review":"Not only is the LX7 handily svelte when compared to many mice with similar features, but it's an ergonomic dream. The side-to-side scroll wheel is a wonderful feature that quickly becomes indispensable. Back and forward buttons are placed sensibly to facilitate 2-fingered use instead of other models' more cumbersome thumb-buttons.On top of all this, the mouse is absolutely miserly when it comes to power use. So much so, in fact, that I've been using mine with only a single AA battery in place.My two niggling irritations? The fact that the battery sensor tells only when your batteries are dead or dying is one. But I'll give based on the aforementioned efficiency. Secondly, the Logitech SetPoint is pre-programmed button mappings take some retooling to get the mouse working with more than a few common applications. That's okay with me too; I like that they allow you the control to change them at least.All in all an excellent product."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK but mostly not good","review":"I bought this model because the Logitech support claimed that it had full feature software support in Win2000. It doesn't!Pros:Good RF performance, no trouble receiving the signal from several feet.Works with both USB and PS2 connections.Cons:Driver does not seem to recognize the mouse, and so there is no way to assign functions to the extra 5 buttons; it only acts like a 2 button scroll mouse.Wheel button is so hard to press that it is useless.Mouse is very heavy and unbalanced.The Logitech drivers are pitiful garbage. I was able to get the wheel button to function using the MS Intellipoint driver, but it is too difficult to press the wheel. Bottom line is it doesn't work as advertised so it gets returned."},{"rating":"1","title":"not impressed","review":"First off, this mouse is not for people with big hands. If you have average or smallish hands, it should be fine though.The LX7 seems to work well enough, if you have the right kind of surface to mouse around on. It didn't track at all well on my wood grain desk or the keyboard/mouse shelf that sits under it. The cursor would move a tiny bit then stop, making it almost impossible to use. I have never had a problem getting optical mice to work on my desk, until now. It worked well enough with the mouse pad I tested it with, but a good mouse works on a variety of surfaces, not just mouse pads."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Mouse, Just a bit uncomfortable","review":"I've been using this mouse for probably two years now. It really is a great mouse. Never had any problems with signal. ol faithful.

That's depending on how long you're on the computer, but for me at least this creates a problem. It makes your palm sweat and makes for an uncomfortable experience.

FYI, the size of this mouse is for average to large-sized hands, so if you want a tiny or compact mouse, this is not the one for you. Even after you consider its larger size-if this is even an issue- this mouse still demands special consideration due to its multi-button features (4-way scroll with tilt wheel, page-forward & page-backward). I highly recommend this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cruising w/optics","review":"I have been very pleased with the performance and ease of operation of the LX7 cordless optical mouse I purchased. It has greatly enhanced the use of my laptop computer & reduced the stress caused with using the touch pad. I would recommend this product to anyone wanting to simplify their work on their computer/laptop. For those who do a lot of gaming, you will want to get a more expensive mouse with more features, but for the normal routine computing you can't beat it for the price. Again, as with other products I have purchased at Amazon, I got this item for about half of the list price in most stores or on line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Logitech winner","review":"This is my third Logitech mouse and it lives up to the reputation.

My old Logitech mouse was in use for years and is still more reliable than my new LX7. The new mouse does work, but after awhile it stops responding so that I can't get any icon to respond. It starts working again when and if I hit restart. I give up. My next mouse will not be a Logitech...and that is a shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delivers a lot of bang for your buck","review":"After having a terrible experience with a similarly priced mouse that I bought from a retail store I ordered the LX7 from Logitech and immediately threw the old mouse in the trash once I tried out the LX7 for a few days.The function of this mouse is perfect. The movement is smooth and accurate as are all of the buttons and the wheel.The size might be a bit small for some (I have pretty large hands) but I find it to be pretty comfortable still. It's nicely shaped and the rubberized sides give it a good grip.I haven't had to worry about any of the silly syncing procedures like I had with my old mouse and the wireless reception is 100% perfect (the mouse is about 2-3 feet away from the USB dongle, transmitting through the desk)I don't have a single complaint about this item, and for the price I'd be suprised if you could beat it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best mouse I have ever owned!","review":"I have had this mouse for about a month, use it for several hours each day as I work from home.

Have to double click a lot when it begins to wear out. Have had three in past 4 years but always buy another because I like the top back-forward buttons I can use without having to move the cursor. However, looks like it's been discontinued (didn't find it on Logitech website today, Sept 25, 2011) and I will not pay the price I saw on Amazon's page. $35 is about right. G'luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice and smooth... Unless you connect it to a Mac.","review":"Well, the mouse quality is decent and all that -- my one gripe there is the over-sized dongle. My biggest gripe, though (and I only WISH I could return the thing), is that scrolling doesn't work when the mouse is connected to a Mac. running ANY version of OS X using manufacturer's drivers or not. I would not have rated this mouse so low for that had it not been for the fact that the manufacturer claims it works with all version of OS X.So, if you're using a Mac., stay away from this mouse as it will be useless to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great notebook mouse","review":"I bought the LX7 to use with my laptop. It's a great alternative to the trackpad. Adds the functionality of the scroll wheel, plus the back/foward buttons are a nice tool when web-browsing...they worked fine on install in IE, and also work in Firefox with a simple tweak of the settings.Portability is also a plus. The mouse is small and portable, and slips right into my laptop's carry case, along with the USB mini-transmitter. No cords or large transmitters to worry about...takes just a matter of seconds to pull everything out of the bag and get to work.I'd highly recommend this mouse for desktop or laptop use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bennie\\"s Review","review":"Works great.

I also use a larger resolution, so it requires more accuracy with the mouse, so that is a factor.overall, its a good value wireless mouse. VERY easy to setup."},{"rating":"2","title":"good mouse, but too small","review":"The mouse works very well and the price is right. My only complaint is that it is too small and does not fit comfortably in my hand. Instead of my fingers resting on the mouse, they drag on the mouse pad. It is only slightly larger than my notebook mouse and much smaller than my previous desk-top mouse."},{"rating":"1","title":"GARBAGE!!!!!","review":"I bought this mouse about a week ago along with a Logitech DiNovo Edge keyboard for my desktop computer. The keyboard is excellent, but this mouse is a piece of junk. It's extremely unpredictable. One minute, its working great, the next its very choppy and inaccurate. I tried multiple fixes, including repositioning the bluetooth receiver closer to the mouse, reinstalling the mouse, hitting the \\"connect\\" button on the mouse several times, trying a black mousepad, etc, but nothing seemed to work. I bought this mouse specifically because the reviews on Amazon were so good. Usually, you wont go wrong if a product on here has tons of good reviews, but I got the shaft on this one. I'm returning this mouse and buying a Steelseries Ikari Laser instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Stars","review":"I'd give this mouse no stars if I could.

A must have for any Jerry Lewis fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Funny Film","review":"I thought this movie was instinctively funny. I knew Jerry Lewis was going to be funny, but I didn't expect him to meet me on deeperlevels of funny. I saw a sexiness in the storyline as well,where Jerry's character struggled with his manhood. It gave me insight on what men deal with on a profound level. For example, when he fought the Japanese guy, it was almost as if Jerry was saying that it is okay to not be so macho."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thrilling, fantastic sequel!","review":"I thought it would be hard (and very unlikely) for Cross to top the Fourth Guardian, one of my very favorite novels. The Lost Guardian, its sequel, doesn't top it so much as expands upon it in a wonderful and wholly original way. There are still the thrilling fight scenes and unpretentious manner of the first book, but this one is more alnog the lines of the kind of novels that aren't written much anymore.

ALL the bad mouthing of this album relates to that second half of this one 30 minute song, all the parts that will make one cringe - the bad lyrics, the bass line with the false endings that repeats too many times, the cartoon cowboy theme that was funny for a minute but doesn't know when to stop. So you be the adult, stop after the climax where all the players are throwing out impovs together then it mellows into that spacey new age music, there you fade to black. You will find every other last breath of every other minute on this album exhiliarating. Play it loud!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The proverbial album to take to a desert island","review":"For more than 20 years, this album was easily my prime candidate in the hypothetical \\"which single album would you take to a remote desert island\\" question. The musical complexity; the intertwining themes on Ikon; the perfect production values; and the lyrical profundity (eg, the postulated evolution of God in Ikon) all make this one the best. (Though in later years, I'm finding that I'd be tempted to take a Fela Kuti CD to the island instead)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Worthy Follow Up to the First Collection","review":"This second disc is from the same performers of REJOICE: A STRING QUARTET CHRISTMAS and it basically follows the same formula. Christmas carols are arranged for a string quartet. The arrangements, which are in styles similar to the great classical composers' works, suit the music rather well. The major strength of this recording is the variety. The first disc has all the traditional holiday favorites, but this disc has a few well known carols as well as some lesser known works which makes the collection interesting. People who enjoyed the first collection will certainly enjoy the second as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tortuous Reading","review":"Supposedly the story of a murder of a young woman visiting Tortola where her parents had a house. She's found dead on the beach. Three or four guys sharing a house are investigated. One has blood on a pair of sneakers. Perhaps this could have been an interesting story, and I read a lot of true crime, but I had to slog my way through this one. I got no feel for the victim (except apparently she was flaky - but no reason to kill her), I couldn't have cared less about the guys who were arrested, and the writing was so tedious I don't know how this book was ever published. It was way too long for the small amount of information it gave."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kaplan Provides More Practice Tests for the $$$","review":"As helpful as the introductory material is in this work, Kaplan's SAT II Literature guide does not bog the reader down with hundreds of pages of \\"test talk .\\" Instead, most of the book is devoted to no fewer than EIGHT practice tests, with answer explanations included. Descriptions of the test, recommendations for test-taking and a humorous glossary of literary terms are there if you want them; but if you learn best BY DOING, then this volume comes highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A welcome discussion of major issues in ecology","review":"This book takes on some of the fundamental assumptions (and misperceptions) that are commonly presented in Ecology and Environmental Studies. Writing in a clear and forthright manner Peters lays out philosophical underpinnings of many of the \\"sacred cows\\" that all too often get tossed out to eager students by reluctant, unwilling professors who have been drafted into teaching \\"General Ecology\\" when they would much rather be doing their research. These cows then wander off and become fixed features of High School texts & wind up before legislators as accepted wisdom, rather than the tentative (and often ill-formed) hypotheses that they are. Peters is to be commended by both the strength and range of his arguments.

Not having read much erotic fiction, I wasn't sure if it was the specific books or the genre I didn't like. COOKING UP A STORM did something the other Black Lace books I read didn't do; it made me care about the characters and what happened to them. Not just Abby and Storm, but also the secondary characters, were likable and sympathetic and I wanted things to turn out well for them. This book convinced me that erotic fiction is not for me, that may seem strange because I'm giving the book a positive review, but in this case I know it's the genre, not the book.I recommend this book to anyone who wants to try this type of book or who already knows they like erotic fiction. This is a book with an interesting premise and great characters that are very easy to care about and root for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do It Again-Please!","review":"This was one book, where I was interested in the plot along with the very entertaining sex scenes. I hope Emma Holly will create a sequel to this book. I loved the way Storm was very at home with his own body. I also loved the way he brought out the heroines own sexual feelings but at the same time fulfilled his own fantasies. I think if my husband was this much fun, all I would want to do is stay in bed. I have read about 50 of Black Lace's books and I am a very harsh critic, but this book was so good I've read it a couple of times. If there is a sequel I will be the first to but."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"there is more then just the two main characters in this story. although there are points that aren't needed, it was an all around hot read."},{"rating":"1","title":"No real plot-repetitive sex scenes","review":"I really did not like this book. It has a very \\"thin plot\\", actually the book is really just one sex scene after another. Just how many times can you write sex scenes in one book? About halfway through, this books become repetitive and boring. The male lead in the book is the only somewhat interesting character. This is because the author lets you glimpse briefly into his background. The female lead has sex with everybody; male, female, groups of people, people she doesn't like. All the while she is doing this she's mentally putting herself down for her behavior and telling herself how much she loves the male lead. Of course, the two leads decide they love each dearly (how that happened--- you're a better person than me if you can figure that one out). They do marry and I sure they'll live unfaithfully ever after. This is a book detailing sex acts. If thats what you're looking for you love this book. If your looking for a spicy romance book--This isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"erotica-not","review":"I love a good sexy novel. In fact I like a good, explicit sexy novel.

It is erotic all right, but there is nothing romantic about it...unless you would call it that when two lead characters meeting each other, having a lot of sex with each other, and then saying their I love yous to each other in the end. Oh, but wait, in between the book our female character goes and have more sex with other men and a woman. I would have not pick up this book if the synopsis would have been more detailed.

I didn't feel as if I really \\"knew\\" the main protagnist and some of her reasons for doing things.

But is is central in the identification of the key-structure that allows that his works talk about his life, and vice-versa. No one, has constructed as Sá-Carneiro did, a romantical project that would make his life the total fulfillment of his poetical project. And The Great Shadow brings us the fantasmagorical story of a man pursuited by his shadow, appealing, stressing and killing his own reflection of himself; his shadow is himself, because the Other is the only condition he has to live and see himself. This obsession with the Other will lead him to death by suicide. As in the book: in a profound despair, the protagonist kills himself and his shadow, as a way to finish his life of agony and self-division. A book that situates us in the drama of the Portuguese First Modernism, by the hand of our most desgraceful and auto-biographical poet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book a few misspellings","review":"I have liked all of the books in the series and really enjoy reading Shannon's books.

She never tells us...)There are many stories, or small snippets of stories, from people who have been involved with narcisissists. Although that part was interesting, some of the stories were just too long and bizarre, and all the little snippets were mostly too small to be of interest.I'm glad so many other readers got something out of this book, but I must say that I was very disappointed. I preferred, \\"Help, I'm in love with a ...\\" because I thought it was written more professionally, and spoke more confidently about how to get out of a relationship with an NPD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't what I was hoping for","review":"I was hoping to find some solace and answers in this book after the breakup of a narcisistic relationship. I had no idea why this man I had loved so dearly was acting the way he was and discarded me from his life w/o a second thought. I hadn't even heard of narcisistic personalities before I had the misfortune of dating this man. I had to stop reading this book as reading about other people's misfortunes and heartbreaks kept bringing my own pain back to the surface. I was hoping for something that would facilitate the healing process and this book just didn't do it. I'm glad so many other people found peace and answers in this book it just wasn't for me.

It is just that I expected a lot more out of the book as a real guide to dealing with someone that exhibit these behaviors, though the only way to deal is to realize the person won't change and to leave.

This book has none of that. There wasn't a hint of the author's background. There wasn't a single footnote. Had I not suffered from RLS for over twenty years, I wouldn't have been able to even guess as to the validity of the material. Fortunately, I have personal experience of most of the conclusions arrived at in the book, and found them to be reasonably accurate, allowing me to infer that the remaining conclusions are also valid.My recommendation: Don't buy this book.

The bottom tier is fine. The holders on the rest of the tiers are much smaller (in circumference), not adjustable and don't hold standard size cupcakes, even baked in Wilton's own paper cupcake liners. If you smoosh the cupcakes together they'll sort of hold each other in place. Or you could 'glue' each of the upper cupcakes in place with a little icing. Plus, the tiers are too close together, so the icing must be simple and low, or you must angle the cupcakes outward, which means the icing had better be stiff and the decorations very secure. Angle them out too far and the weight of the icing makes them topple out.

Sal went on to star with Woody Herman's New Heard, Count Basie, Tito Fuentes and then a great career in Europe. Unfortunately Sal passed away a few years ago in his early 50's. Roy McCurdy was also a youngster on drums and I was at their gig when Roy got the call to play with the Jazz Messengers. Their talented bass player was Steve Davis.

However, it is so redundant, that there is really no point reading beyond the first twenty or so pages. To make matters worse, the information is presented in an endless array of bullets, exhibits, tables, numbered lists.

(Maybe it hooks over somebody's ears, but not mine!)The mic can only swivel--it does not adjust lengthwise at all.Sound quality is just ok.The little control device feels like it is made of plastic about as cheap as the packaging.Good luck carrying this in a laptop case or backpack without breaking it.Complete waste, in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dies fast","review":"Had 2 of these go bad in a couple months.

The headphones worked fine. Not the best quality, but certainly passable. But for the life of me I could not get the mic to work. After about 15 minutes of messing with it, I've determined that the mic is simply incompatible with the Mac OS. The machine doesn't realize that there's anything in the line in, none of my programs will acknowledge that there's an external mic present, nothing.

(aka it doesn't work ever.) This happened after under four months of heavy use.- Behind-the-head design is uncomfortable if you want to recline or lie back.- Microphone can swivel up and down, but not closer to or farther from your mouth.Verdict:This headset is fine if you don't need to use it very often, but if you use it daily it's just not going to hold up.

I was very pleased with the sound quality of this item at first- but like the other two Logitech headsets I bought previously, I am already having issues with this one only about a month or so after buying it. I'm getting a loud squeak/feeback from the mic now when I say something that has a sibilant sound. At first it was only every once in awhile, but try as I may to adjust the location of the mic, it has continued and seems to be getting worse. I had hoped trying a different model of Logitech headsets would work out better, as the cheaper two that I bought proved to be very disappointing as well- the mic quit working on them within 3 months.

Then the foam covers (ohhh how I hate those) once they fall off, I promise there is no way to easily get them back on without destroying them.

It is sized for a child, perhaps, but no normal adult will find it comfortable to wear for any period of time. The size is just too small and so it is too tight. I stretched mine out a bit, but by the end of the day, it is pinching again. Also, the gap for the top of your ear is very small and it starts to pinch there too, that is, if you can wear it long enough for it to start hurting your ears. I had a product very similar to this one (Logitech 981-000074 880 PC Headset) and it was much more comfortable. The mic broke and so I figured I'd get another model. This one looks like the next logical step. It is a step, a step backwards.

My advice to Amazon is to find a way to seperate your keyword terms so things that people want are not mixed in with a bunch of crap that they don't want. I can hardly blame the seller for this.

I keep my peripherals in supreme condition (Computer built in 2008 still running strong in 2011), but these headsets are really fragile and seem to have a really limited running time. The sound is decent, but the buds don't cover your entire ear so noise does get in. The headband is really flimsy so be careful when handling it.Pros: The volume control on the wire is very convenient and the mic isn't too bad, though if you're using Mumble, ventrilo or skype your friends and teammates will notice background noise when you speak and sometimes you won't be able to hear others talking if your mic is on.

The Mic easily picks up on your voice, and I even had to adjust it at times that way I would not be too loud when talking with friends. The mic is very nice.With only the mic being of nice usage on this headset, I would recommend going for something else.

Just be sure to take it after you've had a bite to eat, it's has made me queasy on an empty stomach.

So i contacted them again. They sent another. It was the same size, minus an inch and a half length, so still unusable. This company has NEVER gotten a SINGLE order I have placed with them correct on the first try. This one took three tries, and I have had to ask for a refund, which I will be taking to another store to get the one I want, That and the Money from selling the two incorrect ones to my local oriental market.

They had so many good ones. \\"It's Too Late\\" one of those haunting rock ballads that stays with you forever.

I loved the energy of the band and bought this on 8-track. I still laugh thinking of my friends looking at the cover and saying \\"I don't get it. Why a rock and a bagle\\"? This has always been my favorite Foghat album for many reasons. The songs are great, although the recording is a little \\"tinney\\". The beginning of \\"What a Shame\\" always gets my foot tapping. \\"Couldn't Make Her Stay\\" is one of the best ballads they ever did, although I always wished it was a little longer. But an overall great effort of tunes that blend well together."},{"rating":"2","title":"foghat improved here alot.","review":"The first foghat , while being a cool cd is produced in a way to lessen the sound of the boogie guitars and that didn't happen here.

In fact they continued it through the end of the decade , then for a while they released a more new wavish boogie rock sound that is still good but this is classic foghat all the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Tasting","review":"I think the taste is very good.

So far, S'mores is my favorite flavor.

Despite earning numerous #1s on the R&B chart during the late '80s, he's still viewed by many as the poor man's Luther Vandross. Maybe so, but as this disc shows, he still has the talent when he gets a good song. The first half has a contemporary feel, with tight male harmonies accenting Freddie's lithe tenor. The second half, largely produced by Paul Laurence, is Freddie as we knew him. Slow jams like \\"I Wanna Be Your Man\\" and \\"What's It Good For\\" will take you back when.

This is post WW II conflict seen through a child's confused heart and the adults who cared so much for his protection, but could not adequately explain war and ideological evils. Through the powerfully artistic skill of the filmmakers and music scoring, one experiences the tragic side and the hopeful side of the good that still exists in the world even in the midst of the unspeakable horrors of war. Jim Caveziel's supernatural ability to express through his eyes is evident to the max in this film. One is completely drawn into the heart of each individual who is a part of this story and the whole experience leaves a permanent impression on you. I have watched it now three times, and comprehend something new each time. You have to watch this with great patience and no interruptions.

I was hoping there would be a sequel covering Diana & French Lt.Taliaris, they were both strong individual's and nothing was really said about what had happened with Diana, if the writers are not going to write sequels I wish they would at least take an extra page or two, to let us know what happened to other important characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Young and Company","review":"i bought the 12 in version of like what your doing to me thinking it was a nice digital copy but it sounds so bad im gonna delete it off my computer...to bad they dont say it was ripped from a record...sounds like garbage"},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful and filled with lots of ideas","review":"This book is filled with tons of ideas and detailed instruction on making and decorating bags."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fooled by the Cover","review":"I was attracted to this book by its cover, so I pre-ordered it. After waiting 3+ months past the release date (Feb 6, 2006) it finally arrived in early May. Wow, what a disappointment! I was expecting some upscale professional design ideas for handbag embellishment. Instead, the ideas in this book are very cutsey-poo and childish. The only nice design is on the cover. These designs might be appropriate for very young girls (faux fur, poodle appliques, felt cat with rhinestones, pom-poms, costume jewelry decorations, etc) but not for the sophisticated handbag creator. A better choice for elegant handbag embellishment would be Stephane Kimura's BAGS WITH STYLE, or Barbara Weilands new book SEW EASY DESIGNER BAGS & TOTES."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Limited Appeal","review":"The title of this book is very misleading. I don't think any of these bags could qualify as designer bags and most do not use what I consider embellishments. Like a previous reviewer, I was mislead by the beaded bag on the cover, as well as by other reviews. While the book may have been very well put together and the directions clear, I think the bags themselves have very limited appeal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incontinence!","review":"Works great for daytime protection.

I am constantly finding that the glue or sticky side doesn't have enough stick to keep the pads in place. They often fall out of my pants when walking, leaving me an embarrassing situation to explain. I would stick with the Poise brand that fits and is stays in place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"Product was as advertised. Arrived on time in excellent condition.

Satisfied customer.Have tried the Depends brand of shield for men but the Tena brand, because of the triangle shape, is preferred."},{"rating":"1","title":"price tripled","review":"Great item but now that Amazon has tripled the price I'll visit my local drug store. Plus, I had a subscription to receive three of these things every two months and Amazon billed my credit card without any prior warning that the price was going from less than $15 per pack to over $40 per pack. Bad business."},{"rating":"2","title":"Use for my dog with Belly Band","review":"Per someone's review of the Belly Bands for male dogs, I use the serenity guards for my dog. It seems to be quite absorbent. I just wish that Amazon would sell the pads for \\"heavy\\" use rather than \\"moderate\\" although even with the moderate, unless my dog has \\"gone\\" a couple of times in the pad, there is good holding power. I also wish that the narrow part of the pad were as wide as the widest part--square-ish instead of the triangle. The guard remains in place with an adhesive strip, which I wish were as long as the guard itself. Otherwise, the narrow part bends every now and then when I put the Belly Band on the dog unless I am careful. But I am very satisfied with it and have the product on automatic delivery so I won't run out. My dog doesn't seem to mind it or the Belly Band, so I assume it isn't uncomfortable for him. I cannot say how the product is for use as it was intended since I only use it for my dog."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Product","review":"The mouse is very good.

I didn't even notice on this product description that this mouse is NOT Mac compatible. It's their only mouse that I have seen that is not, so Mac users beware! I bought it, then had to return it. I specifically bought it for the shape and size, which is very comfortable for me, does not irritate my wrists and is ambidextrous. I actually wanted a corded mouse because they are lighter and easier to use for longer periods for people with wrist problems. Oh, well...

Highly dependable and accurate!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A variety of good & bad","review":"If you can overlook some of the lamer episodes and just focus on the more plot-hole oriented episodes, you should find it interesting.Yes, one of the episodes is 'darker' in nature. Ponies are captured by dragons and turned into dragons by a centaur who keeps a throbbing 'dark' rainbow in a bag around his neck. Seeing the ponies in chains is sad, but not scary. My nieces & nephew (4, 6, & 8) LOVED this episode most of all and even began singing along with the seaponies halfway through the song!The rest of the episodes are all about friendship, helping one another, and saving the day. Sure, Crunch the Rockdog turned bushwoolies into stone, but they came back to life after he was cured of his stone-headedness. :D"},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Show from the 80's!","review":"If you have a little girl this needs to be in your house.

My sister and I (both avid 80s fans) were so disappointed. Also, i noticed that the voice of one pony would appear when another was talking (bad animation and timing). some of the story-lines were kind of stupid too (i guess that was just the 80s though :)so over all i'm glad that it came out on DVD because i love the memories but it could've used some work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrible for small children? . . . NO WAY","review":"If you are a fan of My Little Pony you would know that the first episodes weren't so cute and cuddly as Miss \\"Terrible for small children\\" wishes it was. To say that MLP is garbage and frightening is also misleading. It is about as scary as He-Man episode! If your child is frightened by seeing a cartoon beast, than it's probably their upbringing. It is certainly not a scary cartoon, but did tone down as it became more and more popular.Teaching my kids (and yours) about respecting nature and that life is not always happiness, fun, and pink cotton candy will help them better deal with Life. If seeing the \\"bad guy\\" on a cartoon freaks a kid out, then maybe LIFE is too harsh for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A My Little Pony Fan Must Own this Set!","review":"This is a My Little Pony fans' dream come true. The entire first season on DVD plus the two specials. This set is wonderful and it is about time that one came out. If I had any complaints about the set it would have to be about the artwork and the fact that they released the shortened versions of the special, each missing a song in the middle. This set however is great and I would definatly recomend buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Missing Song on Escape From Katrina","review":"I was very disappointed that there was a song missing on Escape from Katrina (which shows how Katrina and Rex were once good and not evil). At least they had two of my favorite songs on their though (Let's Not Take a Nap and Dress Like a Dream). I rate this DVD 4 stars because the way the DVD's are packaged in the DVD's look unprofessional and the fact that there's a song missing on Escape from Katrina, which is like the best special/episode in the world!! But it's a must have if you have a little girl and you grew up with MLP :) It'll bring back so many memories :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"My Little Pony - Rescue at Midnight Castle - is edited","review":"Becoming so happy to see my favorite episodes the speacial pilot from my child hood was only a sad o no its missing about a half an hour of it!

So I bought the first season. I was excited to see her face when she started to watch. But then, after the first scene, her face had this big \\"?\\" Then she goes, \\"Daddy, that doesn't look anything like the ponies\\". I told her that's my little pony. Then I realized she'd seen the new My Little Pony and not the old one. This one is from the 80's and she's comparing it with the new ones. So if you're daughter has seen the new one, she might get disappointed with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAY TOO SCARY FOR LITTLE KIDS","review":"Yeah, I know I'm about to earn the undying emnity and wrath of the many adult MLP fans, but for those buyng MLP products for little kids, you should know that this stuff is WAY TOO SCARY for the average little one. If your kids love the ponies of The Princess Promenade and A Very Minty Christmas, just be aware that this is NOT the same thing. Not only is it not the same ponies, and very poor quality animation compared to what is generally put out today, the plots are quite dark and contain many frightening elements, monsters, trolls, witches, etc. This is NOT for kids under age 8-9 years in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of factual errors","review":"Was provided to me by my employer (a CLEC on the west coast), and many of my 'old telco' peers were amazed at the mistakes. Many factual errors abound. Particularly, simple definitions and descriptions were all oversimplified to the point of misrepresenting the terms. Also, there is no glossary.This book has promise, would love to compare the 2nd edition, assuming it has corrections and glossary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Convoluted and full of mistakes","review":"The least one must expect from a \\"telecommunications survival guide\\" is that it got the facts right. This book does not pass the test. The authors get simple things wrong, which makes me wonder whether they have sufficient competency to write such a book. For example, they state that circuit switched service is the same as connectionless service. Gentlemen, this is fundamentally wrong!Moreover, the entire book is somewhat convoluted and confusing. Sometimes I had a hard time to grasp what the authors are trying to get at.I doubt that the Professor who wrote the positive review below has really read the book.I strongly discourage anybody to buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Auful, Horrible, Full of Errors, Waste of Money!","review":"...After reviewing the text and the associated Training CD I could not believe this ...ever got published.

The games are good - and easy to follow. The graphic is black/white and not high quality - but it is only $20!! My 4 year old got this for a birthday gift and she really loves it!! It teaches numbers, letters, colors, shapes - and sequencing. It is a very good gift. We like it!! I do wish it had a volume control!!!! and a backlit screen for playing in the car! But for the money - it is cute!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fits well, good protection.","review":"This Griffin case fits my e260 very well, protects the player, and gives very good screen protection. All ports are still accessible. The lanyard still connects to the MP3 player. Adding this case makes the player 3/16 inch thicker (35%) thicker, 3/16 inch wider (15%) and 1/2 inch longer (10%). It looks to be molded from polycarbonate plastic. The edges are all smooth an well rounded. The stand is very stable. The case stays on very securely, but relatively easy to remove when you want too.The only down side is the hole through the black flip-stand is small for reaching the outer ring of buttons if you have large fingers and short fingernails. The stand is tight to open, I don't click it shut when the player is stationary.If this case eventually breaks or gets too scratched up I think I'd buy another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Used for brake pads.","review":"I have been looking for a copper grease for brake pad installation for the longest of time and finally settled on this one. I couldn't be happier with it. No brake pad screeching at all. The brush-top does make it easier to use as you don't have to dip a glove in and then instantly put on a new one if you're working on a car. Do make sure to clean the part though otherwise you will end up with a dirty bucket of grease. I have used nearly every brake quieting product available at the local stores and this is by far the best I've run into."},{"rating":"1","title":"Severe disappointment and not worth reading","review":"So I got this book based off the great reviews it got and boy was I disappointed. This book is about Bella Rushdale, who is extremely attracted to her new neighbor Lucerne Marlinscar, but she has a rival for his affections... the Marquis of Pennerley... a man. So who will Lucerne pick Bella or the Marquis?***Spoilers***I like erotic books, but I have never had a main heroine just absolutely disgust me. Yes the heroine, not the sex between two men, but the main character. This book is about Bella Rushdale, a woman who will climb and ride any man's penis. This woman has no morals (or conscience) and even sleeps with her best friend's man. She is like an animal in heat. I am all for woman being sexual beings and enjoying themselves, but not at the expense of hurting other's with their actions (even if her friend didn't find out about her absolute disgusting behavior). Bella was extremely unlikeable with her lack of morals, conscience, and character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"Not very well written, all over the place and not very historically accurate either. The sex scenes were frequent in this book but short and not well developed or very hot for that matter. The character Bella was just a sex crazed maniac. Vaughn was a jerk and I couldn't see why any of the characters in the story would like him at all. Louisa character was wimpy and ineffectual. The whole book just left me cold not at all how an erotic novel should make you feel. Not to mention how effeminate the males in this story were; I prefer more masculine male characters. After reading this novel my Ms. Ellis I will not repeat the experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Product","review":"I had problems from day one with this player. It didn't work on one of my TV's...don't know why. As the other reviewer said, it has a subtitle glitch that while annoying is not that bad. Main problem is that it only lasted a few months(4). Then it stopped recognizing that a disk was loaded and was useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldnt play CD was no good","review":"the CD is no good and will not play!!!!!!!!!! it is damaged real bad and will not play!!!!!! you should have said some thing or not put it up for sale"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pale reflection of their live shows","review":"If you've seen this band live, or even heard their live recordings, you know how wonderful they can be. But this CD sounds heartless; there is no style, but rather a conglomeration of musical themes without any real substance. Their skills are never lacking, but knowing what they are capable of will disappoint you if you purchase this one. Get the live one or, better yet, just go see them when they come to your area."},{"rating":"1","title":"See them live instead","review":"This collective of consummate musicians has as much promise as Phish, but this studio release in particular lacks the spontaneity of their live performance. So much so that even a fan such as myself is disappointed; this CD feels like a poor imitation of Medeski, Martin and Wood. One groovy point (though simplistic) is 100 Year Flood. See them in person or pick up the Live CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"I dont know how one could say a negative word about this CD?","review":"I read some of these reviews, and I must interject. \\"Poor imitation of MMW\\" someone wrote.

The jam in \\"Come as you are\\" made me pull my car over the other day! \\"MLT\\" brings tears to my eyes, if Im under the proper influence. \\"Restless Wind\\" has the kind of immortal spirit as any old Dead tune.

Since you were posting a review of the String Cheese Incident's album \\"Round the Wheel\\", and you referred to the band as a \\"weak cover band\\", can you tell me what songs on the album are cover songs?

The problem I encountered was 1) that even within a single model year of a particular brand, there is no standardization of parts, and 2) that this manual is necessarily general and sometimes vague. The information one needs is probably there somewhere, but digging it out is tiresome. So is deciphering the Chinese rendition of the English language. Some of the images and diagrams are also confusing. I ended up selling off my Chinese motor scooters for what I paid for them and buying an Aprilia Scarabeo 150 (Italian design with an Austrian power train). It was the difference between night and day, and I cannot recommend Chinese scooters or this manual which does not really help much in a crunch.

I bought a Panasonic powered nose hair cutter and it works great."},{"rating":"1","title":"It just does not work","review":"Save your money, buy something else. 1) The squared-off clipping head just does not get any hair to fall into it, hence, no hair gets cut. 2) Were that not enough to dissuade you from purchasing the Tweezerman, the action of squeezing the levers that operate the cutting motion is hard to control and make the cutting head move in and out of your nose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work.

He was real cool and he even autographed my CD cover. I like all the songs on this CD-every last one! If you like all that Master P and Hot Boys music, well there is an alternate form of it. I'm not comparing Petidee to them, but if you like that style of music then this is the CD for you. It also has a mixture of reggae (Blood Lion, More than meets the eye) which is so tight.

Let me say, PETTIDEE brings it REAL & HARD! I've been looking for a disk as energetic as this for a long time!The only downsides to it are 4 of the tracks listed are interludes, yet still entertaining to say the least, and there are a couple songs that lagged...but only a couple.

The game is very grainy and sluggish, and does not play smooth. The graphics are nowhere near the level of MLB, and the load times are forever. Hitting is nearly immpossible at even the rookie level.

The game play is average and very slow on transition. You can only Save and Quit in the middle of the game without the option to Save only and not to have to quit. I believe there is also a bug with the game. From time to time when the computer player do a pinch hit or any switch, the screen will freeze and it does not allow you to do anything than to reboot. Think about playing a game up to 8 inning and the system freezes up on you and because you can't save it and continue playing, you wasted 20-30 minutes for a game that you have to restart.AVOID AT ALL COST."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time and Money","review":"In addition to being incredibly \\"buggy\\" (my game freezes up on me occasionally and I've had trouble loading), this game is pathetic. The gameplay is particularly tiresome, given that you need to swing at the ball pretty much as soon as it leaves the pitcher's hand if you want to make any real contact.

Who ever hoodwinked the great John Cleese and Kathy Bates into appearing in this epitome of dullness needs to be sent to the principal's office. The 11 year old fell asleep, his 14 year old sister lost interest and returned to her occupation of texting her friends, and my girlfriend and I wound up dreading any scene in which Reeves appeared and promptly dragged any tiny momentum to an annoying, instant halt.

The re-make doesn't reflect its own talent.","review":"Let me be brief. I hadn't seen the original since I was a kid. The re-make on blu-ray allowed me to see the original again. Michael Rennie is as good as Jose Ferrar in The Caine Mutiny. The re-make wanted to be on a level with Dark City and The Matrix. Not even close. But not for lack of talent or hard work. The effects? Again, not on a par with, say, the 1998 Godzilla. District 9 totally blows this re-make away on every count. I feel sorry for the wasted effort.

The people of the earth is destroying the planet along with each other, so aliens came to destory the people so the planet can be safe. I can understand that to a certain point. While the alien is stationed on earth, we continue to attack it again and again. The alien speaker wishes to speak to the leaders, but instead, just a person who would communicate to the president (why do I need to repeat myself twice). Anyway, the alien stop killing us and we still haven't learn our lesson about war and fighting and trying to save the planet.

For those that have never seen the original STOP and DO NOT purchase this remake because IT IS HORRIBLE plain and simple. I am astounded that Keanu Reeves would even consider playing in this remake.When one is considering remaking a classic one has to first ask why. Would one take a classic painting or musical composition, say Beethovens Fifth Symphony, and do a rewrite??? Is the producer or director so egotistical and arrogant that he thinks he can do a better job with a classic than the original? Some examples of this misguided creativity come to mind: \\"The Thing\\"', \\"Clash of the Titans\\".

Looks like they saved about a nickles worth of plastic for every fifty they produced! So then I played it and to fall asleep shortly after the 1928 opening scene...literally. My wife suffered through it and suggested that we should have rented it instead! I saw it a second time with several cups of coffee, and tend to agree with her. The trailer was much more interesting than the movie! I hope Keanu Reeves and Jennifer Connelly won't waste their skills with this director again, and I'm glad the studios gave us the original classic movie, which was great, to make me feel that I totally didn't waste my money!

Little did I know how wrong I was. Some of the extras that are included on this special edition stated that Fox had wanted to do a remake of the original for quite some time. I still wonder why. Despite a lot of jabs at Keanu for playing so wooden, look people he was an alien and I thought did a good job trying to play human. Doesn't anyone remember Jeff Bridges in Starman? The brat of this remake should have been destroyed by Gort from the very beginning. Talk about your obnoxious kid! I had mixed feelings while watching this film. I liked some parts and others I thought stunk! I guess it's due to the fact that I have watched the original so many times that this remake really didn't do it for me.

I too would recommend renting this instead of buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"An insult to the original !","review":"Most \\"remakes\\" never live up to the original. This is a prime example.

The depiction of an overboard military, political and scientific response to the invading Christmas tree ornaments was laughable. Script and acting were high school acting sophomoric. The science/technology was so absurd that any decent high school science student could poke innumerable holes in this movie. Producers do not want to hire science advisors because a dumbed down product makes more money. One example demonstrates the whole movie: To convey the emotional/informational impact of the moment the director does nothing more than a prolonged camera close up of a pretty face as the FIRST person to approach the alien space ship. That time worn shot is as creative as they can be? And, why a microbiologist (of all people) would be allowed to walk up and touch it is beyond comprehension. CSI crime scenes show more intelligence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the 1951 version...it costs less and is far better.","review":"I was saddened that this movie is nothing more than eco-babble. The environmental overtones and the politically correct role of step mom and step son really destroyed this movie. I like SciFi but I don't like spending money to hear a political message. Having grown up with the original 1951 version I was sadly disappointed that this was yet another attempt to remake a classic movie.

My 37 year old son has never seen the original movie untila few weeks ago and he loved it, we watched the remake last weekend and we both were very disappointed, I guess the movies of today depend on special effects more then on good acting, we both give this poor attemped for a remake one star only because you did not have a minus category."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS","review":"this movie like in many other reviews is unwatchable i was kinda interested at first but then got sooooooooooooo boring no interseting scenes nothing.

When they are at the Cleese character's house they hear the authorites approaching. Instead of leaving the kid there to be safe with this character, as anybody in the real world would, they rush a coat upon him and take him on a run through the woods so his mom can be taken and the alien can find his heart. Horrible writing and all summed up in a single scene. Also the kid was very much painful to watch in every scene!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Bad, bad, bad.

Notice that the little sterilizing nanites that gort becomes only get close-ups when they eat big bad polluting semis, oil refineries, rednecks and football stadiums. When klaatu and the kid are hitching a ride in the back of a big 4x4, who's driving but beer swilling white trash? All you people who liked this movie need a refund for your lobotomys. I get preached at every day for being the big bad white destroyer of the world in the news and in the markets where I am forced to go green whether I want to or not.

The alien (Klaatu, played by Reeves) has come to Earth to destroy humanity for not taking care of the planet. (Can you say eco-terrorism?) He is made to change his mind by seeing the black child and his white step mother (Connelly) cry when faced with death.

For example, if the aliens had this voodoo Science capability to permanently 'turn off' technology world-wide, why all the preliminary drama with the threatened genocide. As for the casting, Keanu Reeves took wooden acting to a new level, Jaden Smith is an excruciatingly untalented child actor; obviously the beneficiary of Nepotism, and all the characters wearing a uniform were straight out of a bad saturday morning cartoon. The only cast member who didn't phone it in was Kathy Bates as she singularly avoided being a ridiculous caricature. Aside from all the negativity, the Fx and pacing was sufficient to move it out of the dud category but just barely."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Day the Audience Fell Asleep","review":"This is quite possibly the most disappointing movie I've ever seen. So much potential, so little effort.What was abundantly clear was that the script was unfinished when they started shooting the film and they never managed to come up with any good story ideas to pad out the running time.Jaden Smith serves no purpose in the film except to prompt audience members to shout \\"Will somebody please get that kid off the screen!\\"Skip this movie. In fact, don't just skip it -- run quickly away from it.They should have released this film on Thanksgiving Day for those who wanted a healthy dose of a big turkey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This could have been an entertaining movie despite its difference from the original 1951 production. But it was totally ruined by the number of film-minutes spent on the emotions of the dumb kid. You feel like strangling the stupid little brat.The story line was weak and even with its special effects it comes in a distant second to the low tech 1951 version. The 1951 film is better written and infinitely better acted and it's story line is logical and powerful. Altogether much more enjoyable. It's a classic that can be viewed over and over again. Unlike the latest rendering which is hardly worth watching once let alone twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks for Saving Me Pain","review":"I have been a fan of the classic \\"The Day the Earth Stood Still\\" since I was a little boy and saw it in the theaters. In those days, the big fear was nuclear destruction. If you could get your brain around aliens coming for a visit, it wasn't hard to accept Klaatu and Gort as representatives of a galactic police force here to make us do what we apparently couldn't do for ourselves.I know that directors and story writers take some liberties when a remake is done. The \\"War of the Worlds\\" remake stayed close enough to the original movie and, by the way, the original novel that it was both a good flick and a well done screen play. Of course that was Spielberg and unfortunately this was not.It's a sad thing to see good talent and a good story maligned and denigrated by a bad writing and poor direction"},{"rating":"1","title":"the day the earth blinked","review":"This remake of a classic is a royal stinker. No character development, no personality. I was very disappointed. They chucked out the drama and character for FX, and the FX wasn't that good. J. Connley was a wooden as Keneu.

It was poorly acted and nothing seemed very realistic at all!! The special effects we okay, but not as cool as the previews made them out to be.

I didn't catch it at the movies, thinking I would buy this for my collection. If you want to watch an excllent version - watch the 1951 movie. This does not even come close to the original. Even with today's special effect capabilities, you cannot improve on good writing, good acting, good directing, etc. None of these were present in the \\"new\\" film. Nothing is explained; the interaction is terrible; the ending stupid. Why would Reaves and Connelly (and Bates) all fine actors agree to something this bad? Hopefully not just for the money.

However, this film takes a remarkably forward thinking film from 1951 and adapts it to give a similarly forward message about 2008. It is not only well crafted and entertaining but carries an extremely important message. To the people who use that dreaded word \\"preachy,\\" sometimes we need a little preaching. Perhaps you should try listening. Sometimes, of course, people will always be too ignorant to get it. How sad. If you are forward thinking and open minded, I urge you to give this movie a chance.

The budget would have been better spent on a series of enviornmental Public Service Aannoucements(PSAs). This remake is nothing more than a feature length PSA.The next thing that comes to mind is how could they remake this picture without including the line, \\"Klattu varadda nictu,\\" (sp?). Not only is that a signature moment from the classic original, but it is also in the story the movie is based on in the first place, \\"Farewell to the Master.\\"Lastly. The advanced state of visual effects existing today does not guarantee quality. I am speaking in this case about Gort. If you have seen the film, I need say no more. If not, run away now, you don't want to see this version of Gort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leftist political propaganda","review":"Given the travesty of making this film just one more instrument of the Hollywood elitist political movement, I'm actually quite surprised they didn't choose an Obama look alike for the part of Klattu. pass on this one big time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing to a fault","review":"While the total review carries a 2.5 star score (I checked--it comes out to about 2.59), if you look at the spread, it's canted quite a lot more heavily toward the lower score.

Hollywood's overpaid dimwit writers, producers, executives and actors should really keep their moronic NewThink to themselves, and leave the Earth alone. Simply one of the worst conceived movies I've seen yet, and that's saying something in this age of 2012 and Spielberg's War of The Worlds. This movie actually thinks it's ending on a happy note, now that after coming face to face with destruction from without, but being saved from \\"the brink\\" by it's evil ways, humanity will now have to start all over again sans technology. I guess the filmmakers applaud the thinning out of the human race that would quickly take place in such a world. Not enough bad things could be said about this trash. One final word about John Cleese (who has a meaningless cameo)...though once a genius, this now seemingly sad man should retire from the world of entertainment. He no longer entertains."},{"rating":"1","title":"contradictory","review":"The message behind this film is that humans are dumb and destructive (true, but whatever). Therefore, we obviously morally superior aliens will DESTROY YOU. Ha, ha, that'll show ya. If this isn't the dumbest contradiction ever I don't know what is. The aliens have a vastly superior technology. They can't use this to help save us in addition to the planet? Thanks a lot bozos.The Director's Cut of The Abyss (a good film) also has the exact same message, which is why the Director's Cut is terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Punch","review":"In 2008 a re-make of The Day The Earth Stood Still was released to theaters.While the original was a warning against nuclear war, this re-make starring Keanu Reeves as the alien Klaatu, serves as a warning against global warming/ecology disruption.This giant sphere comes to New York and Klaatu emerges only to be shot by a lone military man.While under the knife, Klaatu befriends a scientist played by Jennifer Connelly who believes these aliens are friendly.Fat chance. They are here to collect a few specimens and then wipe out mankind.This updated version doesn't have the punch of the original. When you cast Keanu Reeves as your lead, you should know what you're getting yourself into.And GORT, the huge guardian alien has been changed altogether.If you must, just rent this thing for a day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I expected.","review":"I'm usually disappointed with remakes like these -- I really enjoy the originals (nostalgic).

The whole plot is LITERALLY unfolded in the first 3-5 minutes. The special effects were very chinsy not to mention that you shouldn't be surprised if don't see any nominations for acting in this crappy remake. Everything about this movie sucked and if I weren't with the family I would of asked for a refund, in fact this is actually one of those movies where after watching it you feel pissed for wasting ten dollars on crap. When Keanu spoke chinese with his surfer-bro accent I busted up laughing because it was so lame. So to get to the point of the review, I wouldn't even recommend this to rent because it was so bad. I like sci-fi but not this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Day the plot stood still","review":"It's always dangerous when someone sees a need to re-make an icon like this one, and this attempt is a good example why. The message is muddled, the acting is robotic, and the effects are (yawn) nothing special. I watched the original version again after seeing this film, and confirmed that this new version is a change I cannot live with."},{"rating":"1","title":"OMG - Gort - destroy this movie!","review":"If you ever needed to see why Hollywood is finished (like the human species of this story) look no further than this absolutely horrible remake of one of the very best of breed 50's sci-fi films. Bad writing, bad casting, bad acting, but most of all some very, very bad directing (worthy of Director's Hell forever-never to return)! I'm speechless that this film was even released to the general theaters - even straight to DVD could not save this rust heap of a movie. My favorite part (other than we really get to see how hollow Keanu Reeves is completely without direction) is the actor who plays T-Bag on Prison Break as the General in charge of the army - oh, and Kathy Bates of the Sec of Defense had me rolling on the floor with laughter - and how can one completely waste a gifted actresses like Jennifer Connelly is beyond me - you simply cannot make this stuff up! It is so bad it does not even rank as a guilty pleasure - and that is very bad!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More Hollywood Drival","review":"Im not sure of the message in this movie only that man was at the brink of world destruction. Was it war, famine or the dreaded global warming? I was enjoying the film until the propaganda began (first 20 min. or so was cool). I was truly expecting Al Gore to be the scientist that helped the alien decide how to show mankind his power. Once again hollywood shows not only how it is incapable at creation but can also destroy a classic with its frail attempt at remakes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly Propaganda","review":"This profoundly silly movie recasts the nuclear anxiety of the 1950's as environmental anxiety for today. Almost every radical environmentalist position has been blended together into a FX-infused shout: \\"watch out, or the planet will get you!\\" I don't mean to be snarky about this, but hasn't Keanu overdone the poker face a bit by now? I don't want to say that he can't act, but.... oh well, at least he doesn't act. I was sorry I wasted precious time out of my limited life on Gaia to watch this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some remakes should not be undertaken","review":"The Day the Earth Stood Still is a thought-provoking, entertaining film - assuming you got the 1951 version starring Michael Rennie and Patricia Neal. What a major disappointment the remake is - an exercise in computer graphics created by a tech weenie on steroids. The arrival of Klaatu's space ship was far more dramatic in the 1951 version, cheesy special effects notwithstanding. And what was the point of Gort suddenly dissolving into a gazillion, tiny, all-consuming bugs? Very unconvincing. The sweet relationship between Klaatu and the boy from 1951 was turned into an adversarial relationship between a killing machine and a smart-ass kid. When the boy came to like Klaatu, I couldn't figure out why. Not worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Humanity is bad, but....","review":"After the universal disdain for this film, I wasn't going to buy it. My wife hates most Sci-Fi, and this was purported to be not good sci-fi, so wisely picking my movie battles, I was going to skip it. However, my sweet-heart decided to surprise me (it's the thought that counts) and we sat down and watched the DVD together.Here is the short version,People are bad.People are self destructive.People need to be destroyed.People made classical music.People love.People can learn.People need to be saved.So overall, political diatribe aside, it wasn't terrible all the way through, just really terrible in parts, and the rest was watch-able, but the bad parts are really and truly bad.On the plus side the CGI was quite good, but again the script was atrocious.2*"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Like Sci Fi","review":"I like both films. The original story for its \\"grow up or stay home\\" theme. The remake for its \\"time's up we're saving the animals, too bad for humans\\" theme. It's almost like a sequel to the original. But that's not what the director had in mind. Oh, and I like Keanu Reeves. I like the GORT update. The only way to stop nannites is with anti-nannite nannites. Jennifer Connelly and John Cleese are among my favorites as well as Patricia Neal and Sam Jaffe."},{"rating":"1","title":"GORT = Ghastly Ostentatious Remake Travesty","review":"You know what makes me laugh most about this particular dvd package? The fact that someone at 20th Century Fox thought this movie was worthy of a 3-disc special edition. This movie was so patently awful and irritating that, had a brick been nearby, I might have reflexively crushed my T.V. with it. All I could think about every time that annoying kid was on screen was getting my hands around his punk neck - that character was a total distraction from the other happenings in the film (perhaps that ended up being a good thing). If my kid acted like that, I'd give him the choice of immediate drowning or military school. As for the movie, its perhaps the worst remake in a decade - certainly of the year - and an outright insult to the makers of the original.

Because, when you \\"update\\" the whole story line is changed and therefore it is no longer the \\"same\\" story line. Ok, Keanu isn't much of an \\"actor\\" anyway, and is that the woman Ben Aflack is married to? He's prettier than her, and that annoying kid, was that one of Will Smith's offspring?

He escapes from the military and is faced with Jennifer Connely, who tries to convince him to give humans another chance by showing him human's good side. Jennifer was human's only hope left, since their technology was far behind that of the aliens.I really liked the movie. Really well directed and has a quite interesting story. There is actually some meaning and purpose behind the story, unlike other alien movies that depicts aliens as evil creatures that want to destroy humans just for the fun of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Day The Earth Stood Still","review":"If your a fan of this movie you wont be disappointed, the video and sound are GREAT!!! beside that the movie is kinda out there but its a great disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Day the Earth stood still.","review":"All I can say is that I now have both the old version & the new version and I liked them both."},{"rating":"1","title":"My opion","review":"The seller was very prompt in mailing the blue ray that I purchased but I was dissapointed in the movie.

This two disc set comes with the 2008 and 1951 versions of this title. I saw this movie in the theater twice in 2009.Attempting to stay close to the original screenplay, this version ends at the moment the Earth stands still, whereas the 1951 version continues on to see Klaatu talk with the world's leading scientists. And this version is obviously environmental.The special effects are outstanding and the actors chosen are excellent fits for the characters. It was a treat to see John Cleese in a serious role. Reeves is totally suited for this role as the unemotional Klaatu.I would recommend this movie even over the original for better effects and better drama.There is no additional media on the disc, only trailers for other Fox media."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Oscar for Keanu or Klaatu","review":"On the plus side this is a TOP 25 selling Blu ray disc.But.............on the negative side it has some of the worst reviews ever.Like this one.

This movie is NOT The Day the Earth Stood Still...this is something that has a few big name actors in it, and a good sized budget, with characters that resemble one or two from the original...but this is NOT the movie I know.And, I read on some prior reviews that people laughed out loud at the ending...I was one of them.I even went as far as to contact everyone I knew and told them to NOT go see this atrocity.Stop the terrible remakes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucked big time!","review":"This movie sucked big time. My brother and I went to see this. We had been waiting a long time since we knew of its production. We were one of the first ones that stood in line. Our excitment was building by the moment as it got closer and closer to \\"show time\\". What a freaking disappointment. I fell asleep twice during this boring movie. Save your money and wait until it comes on late night TBS. Then and only then if you are having a hard time sleeping, then watch it on TV. What a shame this movie had to suck. The acting sucked too... Just think that I stood in line for an hour and half to watch this piss-poor movie. Buy or rent the org movie, it is a 1000 times better than the 2008 release. Now I've said my two-cents and I will go finish my nap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting premise","review":"I enjoyed this film because of it's depiction of the Zimbabwe incident several ago, at the Ariel School. The difference being that the entire film encompassed this on a world wide scale, rather than restricting it to a specific locale, as the way the real incident happened. Integrating a colossal nanoswarm & an EMP spike, I thought was a nice touch. This film displays the ability of the screenwriters to mesh scientific fact in the context of a sci-fi movie. Few films these days have the ability to do this. Very imaginative!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"Soul-less drivel devoid of character development.Continuity errors galore.Mind-numbingly bad acting.This trainwreck of a film has it all!I wanted to like it.Instead, I found myself rooting for the nanobots."},{"rating":"1","title":"some good visuals, but weaker overall","review":"Ive never seen the b&w original so I wont compare the two.

It only had one disc also not the 3 disc special edition like stated.

The story line came from Al Gore's oversized SUV I think. The aliens are coming to try and save the earth from who else? Evil humans..evil because we tell lies or are morally degenerate? Well, not exactly...because we have power (i.e. electricity)..which seems to be very hurtful. So the fix is the bring destroying insects..which only destroy humans..but the savior turns out to be Keenu alien, and his grace and mercy allowing us to 'change'..and how he comes up with this is unique..

Contrary to other reviewers I actually liked the movie, but have been unable to watch it at home. All of my attempts to get it replaced by Sony have failed. All three of the disks in the package don't work, even after downloading and installing new firmware from Samsung. The data version for use on the computer also failed because somebody had already used the license for it. This is the only blu ray disks (out of twenty or so) that won't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Did They Bother !!!","review":"Can someone please explain to me why Hollywoodfeels that it just has to remake classic movies?You think they would have learned fromother disasterous remakes such as The Thing,Fail Safe,Invasion of the Body Snatchers or The Manchurian Candidate.This movie is so-o-o-obad that it's hard to know where to begin.Let's try the beginning.The original movie immediatelyset the viewer up that something was coming,by having weird music playing during the openingcredits.It created anticipation and suspense right off the bat which is something that was totally lacking throughout the remake.Boring does not begin to touch on what was wrong with this movie.I kept on waiting for SOMETHING tohappen,but it never did.The biggest sin was of course not hearing those special words \\"Gort,Klaatu Barada Nikto\\".I guess the next disasterous remake will beThe Boys From Brazil.(heaven help us)P.S. The special effects on this movie stank."},{"rating":"1","title":"As bad as it gets","review":"Decided to rent it from my public library - I'm SO glad it was only $1. In a nutshell - an intelligent alien species decides the earth needs to be rid of dumb humans to save the planet and their frontman (Keanu) have a change of heart because of a whiny kid (talk about being unintelligent). I watched the original many times and this is a disgrace to the original. After watching this movie, you almost wish the aliens would wipe it out so we wouldn't have to bear sitting through such trash. Everyone involved in making this movie (including the kid) needs to be shot into deep space."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor reenactment of a wonderful story.","review":"When I found out this movie was available I could not wait to watch an updated, more technical version of my all-time favorite sci-fi movie. However, when I watched it I was beside myself with disappointment. They had remade this movie and forgotten to include the believability and true moral essence and character of the original story. Instead they just created a hyped-up, computer-graphical, poorly acted version. Shame on those connected with the remake of this movie. They missed a golden opportunity to re-create what could have been a new, all-time hit sci-fi movie and instead just created another sci-fi dog with fleas. What a terrible disappointment. IMHO this movie should have never been made and I will not watch it again. Save your money and time and just watch the original 1951 version until a they remake it better."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Day\\" remake a disappointment","review":"While the special effects were impressive, this remake was not very good. Even the talent of Keanu Reeves and Kathy Bates couldn't save this movie from being pretty bland. To be fair, it would be nearly impossible to top the original 1951 film, and this new version fails to draw the viewer in. The original movie's alien came to warn earth of the consequences, should the violence occurring on earth extend into space. In the new movie, Keanu Reeves' alien comes not to warn, but to destroy mankind in order to save the earth itself. Have to say, I found myself pulling for the earth, and hoping the alien WOULD save the earth, and not man. Oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Day the Earth Stood Still","review":"GDeed special effects did nothing for the story. Lacked the mystery of the original.

Who allows him to coninue to make films? He can continue to act long after his death as no one would be able to tell the difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"A truly terrible movie. This movie had no plot, but merely showed a series of barely related events strung together. The protaganist decides to destroy humanity, but then he changes his mind after he has already set in motion the process of destruction. So he has to stop the process. But all that amounts to is that he has to get back to his spacecraft by driving through a checkpoint. Wow. Underwhelming.The casting was absurd -- Kathy Bates as the Secretary of Defense? Are you kidding me? So we get to look at her ugly and offensive personage in a role that she can obviously never fit. And the son of the woman was also miscast. So the viewer has to constantly contend with the miscastings while trying to suspend belief for the sake of trying to enjoy a story. This was a horribly disappointing movie for a fan of either science fiction or Keanu Reeves."},{"rating":"1","title":"GORT - Go Out & Return This!","review":"\\"It's not the Earth...it's YOU!\\" This completes \\"The Sky is Falling Trilogy\\" - The Day After Tomorrow, An Inconvenient Truth, and now this piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"..what a flop...the original is still the best","review":"This was such waste of production..great new special effects....keanu...does have any real lines....he more intelligent words in ted and bills bogus adventure....and too top off injury to insult...this movie ends with nothing............just drops off cliff.....stupid.makes the viewer to do likewise....thank god i saw this at home where..i could stop the dvd..........plus the over message of global warming non sense..remake movies have been real junkers...."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a bore !!!","review":"Buy the original with Michael Rennie.

Keanu Reeves, Jennifer Connelly, Kathy Bates did a fantastic job (as did the rest of the cast). The movie paid hommage to the original movie. The only odd thing I found was that The Secretary of Defense (Kathy Bates) was the most senior government leader you see during the entire movie. Considering this is an event affecting the entire world, it seemed a little odd. Overall, a good watch for any science fiction enthusiasts."},{"rating":"2","title":"It wasn't that bad...","review":"I've been a non-conforming artist type since I was a kid so my liking this movie while the so-called \\"average\\" masses hate it seems typical of me.

The only thing I'd change is the giant Robot type thing would step on the kid. God, what an annoying little dick!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing remake of a classic.","review":"We looked forward to seeing this movie as we had seen the original many times. However, we were very disappointed in this rather stupid remake. The movie is in many ways illogical as a science fiction movie, poor as a drama and lacks any kind of credibility. A giant space ship lands and soldiers show up with guns? Ridiculous. It made sense in the original but in this day it makes no sense. I have been trying to think of any good points but cannot come with any. The movie has a few special effects but not much else. I'm just glad we didn't waste more money by seeing in a theater."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mix of the original and Starman","review":"The remake should have stuck more to the original.

The original movie was excellent, this remake is a full-scale train wreck. Watching the extra features, you realize why it's a train wreck - the people making it were so obsessed with special effects they forgot what the movie was about or even how to do it. It turns into an extremely boring eco-preaching flick and just stays there.There's about ten minutes of impressive special effects toward the end, but that's the only bright spot in this otherwise entirely dismal movie. An absolute waste of time and money, both for those who made it, and for anybody who wastes two hours sitting through it. This is a serious stinker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only redeeming feature...the original version is included.","review":"This movie is a crapfest of epic proportions. Wow, it is bad.

He sleepwalks through the role. Gort the robot has more personality.The plot lacks believable emotion, sequencing & substance. The special effects are awful. Gort the robot looks like a carton animation. The original movie's message was a warning that our nuclear weapons pose a threat to the peaceful planets of the universe. This turkey of a remake uses the enviro wacko theme that all human life must be eradicated to save the earth from itself.Why bother to have actors. Have 90 minutes of Gort's Death Ray torching the earth. Better yet, make Keanu play the part of Gort.

Realizing that our potential for destruction was matched by an even bigger potential for doing good ultimately motivates him to sacrifice his own life in order to give us another chance. Not that these aspect don't exist in the new version, I just do feel that making this more of an action movie with loads of special effects was higher in the producers priority list.And the fact that we don't get to hear Klatuu Barada Niktu, is just the last nail in the coffin."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a good movie!","review":"Don't listen to the people saying that this was a bad movie.

The only extra pockets are the three on each side (and nothing on the back), which is ok, but not nearly what I was expecting. Furthermore, each individual shelf is not lined with some hard cardboard/plastic bottom so they collapse inward when you put anything in them.

The only complaint I have is that if the clothes rod or shelf in your closet is high up then it can be hard for a small child to reach the top two compartments, because the hook doesn't allow the organizer to hang low enough, but I solved that problem:)I just attached a couple brass links to the closet shelf and the attached the hook to the links.All in all this product is definitely going to serve its purpose.

I organize the clothes and the kids go to their respective organizers and grab an entire outfit to get dressed ! It's a HUGE time saver. No more chasing socks for one child, and trying to find a shirt for the other child , while trying to be on time to your outside destination. I love it! There are side compartments that can be used to store shoes or belts also, but I have another organizing system that I use for shoes.Note: It hangs via a hook on the top in the middle of the organizer.

They adopt technology quickly and it's a huge part of their culture now."},{"rating":"2","title":"What really Happened, is the question.","review":"This is an excellent presentation. What's important to remember, is that this DVD is not trying to sell another conspiracy theory. Its trying to get you as a citizen of the United States of America to use logic and reason to find out what the truth really is. If you watch this DVD with an open mind you will come to the only conclusion possible, and that is the Governments 911 Commission so called investigation does'nt even come close to what the real facts and physical evidence show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than 'Loose Change' in many ways","review":"Much more detailed and convincing on certain points than 'Loose Change'. I can't imagine anyone coming away from this film with a shred of doubt as to who's actually been promulgating 'outrageous conspiracy theories' for the last 5+ years. Why isn't Amazon selling this DVD yet?! The one copy currently listed by a third-party seller is priced at nearly double the retail price directly from the producer (which has three more titles available)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pentagon hit by airplane","review":"This video is worth purchasing and viewing. It is not too long and it is easy to understand. There is, however, one huge gaffe in it. The video shows no remnants of any airplane in the Pentagon after the September 11, 2001 attack. Undoubtedly that is correct, but the video draws the incorrect conclusion that no airplane could have hit the Pentagon. One former pilot who knows more than I do said that if a jet hit a massive building like the Pentagon at several hundred miles an hour, there wouldn't be much left of the airplane. So the fact that we can't see the remnants of any airplane in the video means nothing, because we shouldn't expect to see any remnants either. Nonetheless, this video makes some interesting observations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super","review":"The Pace Is Glacial is no match for the awesome The Problem With Me, but still a slightly-above average Seam album blows away most music I hear these days. Not every track on this album works, but when it does work, it gets it all right. Of particular note are \\"Get Higher\\", probably the most upbeat song on here, and \\"Inching Towards Juarez\\", a great quiet number that ever-so-slowly builds up its intensity. I've noticed on this album a move towards a more minimalist, quiet sound than in the past. But instead of losing their identity or getting boring, Seam is still, well, Seam. And while it often seems quite simple on the surface, there's more to it than you think. Not my favorite, but the more I play this album, the more I like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Album","review":"This is my first experience with Seam but it certainly will not be my last. The album begins and ends with a single guitar but is filled in between with sonic texturing and beautiful melodies. This and Yo La Tengo's latest are two of the best albums I've had the pleasure of listening to this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"í ám bad at titles","review":"Either you don't know them or you love them. Seam made some brilliant records, especially \\"the problem with me\\" is just near perfection. When I picked up \\"the pace is glacial\\" I had high expectations but still I feel there are left some weaknesses on this one. Personally I don't think Sooyoung Park is a good singer-he sings quite a lot on this one- but he can whisper very well. Luckily there are good, VERY very good songs on this disk (number 6 and 9) so it was worth the money. If you never heard of SEAM I suggest you buy one of the older albums first cause Seam is a very good band."},{"rating":"1","title":"DINOSAURS, CREATION AND CONFUSION!!","review":"Mr Deyoung makes the classic mistake of all people trying to use science to further their particular point of view. He looks only at what he likes and not at the totality of evidence. He throws out what doesn't match his opinion. Science and religion are oil and water, religion tries to remake the world in its image; science tries to explain the image looked at with available evidence. In science the explaination changes constantly due to new evidence. In religion, there can be no new evidence, only new ways to bend what can't be justified with the original dogmas. If you wish learn science, learn it from a scientist not a religionist."},{"rating":"2","title":"incredibly insitefull...could not put the book down","review":"As an American with immigrant Iranian parents, I find myself wanting to know more about Iran.

I congratulate the author for such a stellar depiction of life, culture, politics and society in Iran. After reading her book, I want to visit Iran again and have Mrs. Sciolino as my tour guide. The book was wriiten without a flaw.

I didn't want to put it down.My 2 complaints are that: 1)she portrays Iran's reformists as simply victims of the system and 2)all her female interviewees are connected to the Establishment and present rather a one-sided view.Nevertheless, it's a very good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage !!","review":"Extermely pro Islamic regime and Anti people.

She ignores the ordinary people who constitute the overwhelming majority of Iran and their stuggle for simple things that people take for granted in the west. What a shame !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Social - political analysis of Iran","review":"I read this book with more than passing interest. I served as a Peace Corps Volunteer in Iran, 1970-72. There is one reference to the Peace Corps on page 357. However, the index makes no mention of the Peace Corps. The bibliography is extensive; however, those books by American Peace Corps authors that served in Iran during the time that the Peace Corps was active in Iran, 1962-1976, are excluded, viz., Stephen Grummon, Michael Hillmann, Eric Hooglund, John Limbert, John Lorenz and Thomas Ricks. All of these books were authored during the last twenty years. Each of these authors had a unique cross cultural experience that resulted in their expressed opinons having a great deal of credence. It is a pity that in her twenty years of visiting Iran, Ms. Sciolino has not visited some of the towns and villages where Peace Corps Volunteers lived, e.g., Ahar, Aliabad, Boojnoord, Khoy, Tayebad, or Zabol."},{"rating":"2","title":"Persian Mirrors","review":"Elaine Sciolino has done a fine job with this book. What a lot of people tend not to realise about Iran is that the vast majority of its population is under the age of thirty, and that most of them are women, who are either highly educated or are in the process of becoming highly educated. Given this fact, I think the west needs to look beyond the chador and the hejab. A highly educated populace, even when it exists in a theocracy like Iran, can have a far greater impact on the future of any region. This one facet of Iranian demographics should give many nations, including the United States, some pause. Iran's leaders would do well to also take careful notice of its young population. In a few more years, Iran may become a power to be reckoned with in the region, and Ms. Sciolino is quite eloquent in making this fact clear. \\"Persian Mirrors\\" is easily the equal to Robin Wright's \\"The Last Revolution\\" published last year."},{"rating":"2","title":"understanding the nuance beneath the chador","review":"The reviewer who thought this was too critical of Iran missed the nuance. This is a book that explains this complex country in an authoritative and extremely accessible way, written by an American journalist who has traveled there repeatedly for the last 20 years. Her empathy, perceptiveness and even affection are on vivid display. An NPR interviewer in Seattle called it a \\"page-turner.\\" And so timely! It captures the intense drama that is playing out today in Iran--a battle between Islam and democracy--at a time when we still don't know the ending. But the best stuff is about women in Iran--the hair salons, aerobics studios, fashion design houses, kitchens, swimming pools. Written with great voice, and charm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply put it....Wonderful!!","review":"This is one of those books that i called \\"walking with a good friend book\\". What i mean is that when you read this book, it is so well written and so informative and so true that it feels that you are walking with a good friend who is talking to you about a subject in which he is an expert.The author is magnificent when explaining the political situation in Iran.Her approach is very simple but very informative since she is not in the business of predicting the conditions in Iran,just to give the reader a taste of what's going on in Iran and what the people in Iran are thinking.I truly enjoy this book as i was looking to understand and learn more about a country so difficult to understand.Truly a magnifivent work!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent blend of anecdote and history","review":"Elaine Sciolino's book is an excellent introduction to the past two decades of Iranian history. I have a profound respect for any journalist who not only reported on the revolution firsthand (you have to read how she was on Khomeini's plane!), but saw enough beauty in this country to return many more times.While I am curious as to the response of this book by Iranians still living in Iran, as an American I found this a fair treatment of the current crises faced by this nation. Sciolino tempers her reporting of some of the negative aspects of Iran today (poor economy, a generation without jobs) with many anecdotes celebrating the warmth of the people. All in all, an engaging, excellent history book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"right on target","review":"This is the most accurate reflection of the typical Iranian personality. I am a full-blooded Iranian but have lived abroad all my life, except for summers in Tehran, until the revolution. Then, for the past 5 yrs, I've resumed spending time there, along with my sister, on an annual basis. As much as I love many things about it, things such as baldfaced lying -- to a pathological level -- are exactly as Sciolino describes it, and it was a real reality check for me to read her take on it. Whether a relative, a government official or a merchant, they almost all do it. At a certain point, it becomes quite humorous. But despite these blemishes, I felt more nationalistic towards Iran after reading that book, than ever before. There are many things to be proud of from being an Iranian, and there is no such thing as a perfect nationality."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good intro to the true face of Iran","review":"This book brings to light the warmth and openness of the Iranian people despite the restrictive governmental rule they live under. You really feel for them, and the book makes you wish Iran would open up to the western world and share their culture, emotion, and diverse opinions with the rest of us. I hope someday a change occurs. I would love to visit and experience the culture. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the cultural aspect of the Middle East and Iran in particular. A great book with a true portrait of a new generation of Iranians, and of the older generations who are learning to listen to their hearts and not to political/religious rhetoric and propaganda."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"If you speak Spanish, you don't need this book. The vocabulary is so basic that the definitions wouldn't teach much to a 10-year-old. If you don't speak Spanish, then you need an English-Spanish dictionary, which this is not.My wife is from Monterrey, Mexico. She got so frustrated with the book that she finally just left it in one of my bookcases. But it didn't do me any good, either, even though I'm a native English speaker. Every word we looked up simply wasn't there.If you want a good Spanish-only dictionary, check out \\"Diccionario Larousse Del Espanol Moderno : A New Dictionary of the Spanish Language\\" by Ramon Garcia-Pelayo Y Gross.

My friend swears by his Valentine, which looks ugly, but really who cares about the looks of a radar detector."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick to alert","review":"My experiance is that the Escort Passport 9500I is a great detector. I received it as a Christmas Gift to use with my new 2008 Ford Mustang GT500. Went on a weekend trip to a small town in Illinois and noticed that a pickup truck, a 1/2 a mile ahead of me, hit his breaks after I was already alerted and had slowed down. So this proves I got the alert before he did. I've owned three Passport detectors and have loved them all. I especially like that the display shows your speed when radar is detected, and that you can mark \\"false alerts\\".

I'm very with my purchase and also happy with Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm loving it.","review":"So quiet. But, it only achieves that through the GPS that remembers where the false alert was. However, the cup holders are the same old weak found on a $30 radar detector, so you have to buy the optional single cup priced ($25 with shipping) to get the complete feel of a quality product. On the downside, the gps won't work if the car had been sitting under the sun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy through this unauthorized reseller","review":"I am not knocking the product.

These downloads will gave you the latest info. on radar traps, traffic light cameras, etc.However, after spending $500 on the detector, Escort is too cheap to provide one with a $10 USB cord or a $10 12-volt adapter to download the updates they charge you for after the 3 month trial. With Shipping & handling the accessory items will run you about $40 so you can give Escort more money to download their updates which of course will cost you even more money.Unlike GPS manufacturers which give you free updates, Escort wants to charge you for them. In addition, Escort claims a standard USB cable will work and a standard 12V adapter will work as well. Complete lies, they make them completely non-standard so you will have to buy the accessories from them.If you are looking for a much lighter wallet this is the radar for you. Otherwise stick with the V1."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless and Expensive","review":"I have owned this product over a year and used it occassionally on long drives. Last week of June I went long driving and on an isolated highway in Wyoming I got pulled over and cited for speeding. The passport 9500i was on the windshield all this time and did not even make a single sound or any indication that it picked up the radar of the trooper. I asked the trooper to validate what equipment he used and it was radar not laser. If it was laser maybe that would be an excuse for the company that makes the radar, but it's an old device and my very expensive detector did not do a darn thing to warn me. DO NOT BUY , DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE. Save your money.","review":"Waste of money and time. All the positive reviews have to be employees. This radar detector is the worst thing I have ever bought. I have had it two weeks now (unfortunately not returnable). There are soooo many false alerts, it will drive you crazy! You don't get 5 minutes of peace and quiet. Who wants a radar detector that picks up EVERY signal in the vacinity. And you can't block false alerts, after a point it just tells the device to 'mute'. then it comes back in 3 minutes, until you unplug it. I think it was invented and sold by the police dept, because there are so many false signals you just end up ignoring it, so you will never know which one was in your path. Save your money, time and peace of mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Escort Passport 9500i Radar","review":"This was a Christmas gift.

The old one was OK, did not give a ton of warning a lot of the time. Totally untrue of the 9500. Great range. I adore the lockout feature.

I was interested in setting up my Roku box to my computer and the book told me that unless I had an HD TV, which I don't, the setting wouldn't be possible!

And if the construction of the product were a little heartier then it may have worked out. I'm not sure if the manufacturer made this organizer collapsible in order to save on packaging and shipping or if they were just lazy, but it is a piece of junk. The interior organizing panels do not lock into place and the velcro used to hold the panels in place is equally worthless.This should have been constructed out of a hard sided or much firmer material. The interior organizers should have been fixed into place or should have used slots to \\"lock\\" them in, not velcro.I would NOT advise buying this product. It is a waste of money. You would do just as well buying a $5 rubbermaid container and throwing it onto the backseat.

I should have done my own research. I do believe in a higher power but this \\"God\\" based book, quoting the bible and even going as far as to tell you what to pray is just too much. I tried to read over what I found to be ramming religion, the bible and God down my throat but it was everywhere. I guess if your a hardcore christian and deeply set in your beliefs this might work for you. For me..... its headed back to Amazon.com, along with Good & Angry from the same author. Just a heads up for those of other belief systems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent textbook","review":"Despite its title, this book contains few applications to chemistry. What distinguishes it from most QM texts is the absence of physics-specific applications like solid state, and the careful, step-by-step process by which the author derives results. I'd recommend it to anyone (chemist, physicist, whatever) who wants to know nonrelativistic quantum theory. It's also a handy reference for a few subjects that have wide use outside QM, like group velocity and spherical harmonics. The style is a bit dry, and I doubt that I'll ever read it cover to cover, but as a textbook it's hard to beat."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit slow - but it really gets through","review":"We recieved the video as a gift and after the first viewing I thought it moved much too slowly, but my daughter loves it.

It was so boring that neither our 20 month old twins nor my husband and I could stand to watch all of it even one time. It does not use people, animals, or any real objects. Instead the numbers and shapes are computer generated images that fly through the air or appear like fireworks. For a child who does not yet know what numbers mean the video does not connect numbers to anything in real life. We also bought Bilingual Baby -- Spanish, which our children adore and which we can stand to watch and hear over and over."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Joyless Experience","review":"I bought this video for our 15-month old. He is moderately interested in it for about five minutes at a time. I on the other hand find it positively creepy. The repetitive chanting of the children's voices and the claustraphobic computer-generated imagery seem intended to put a child into a trance-like state. Well, at least that's the effect it has on me. There is none of the joy of visual experience so evident in the Baby Mozart series. Miracle of Mozart, \\"Numbers and Shapes\\" has nothing extraneous, nothing present simply for the delight of the eye. It's geared exclusively to stuffing numbers and shapes into the baby's head. I find this single-mindedness quite disturbing for a tape geared to infants. Is early success so important that we have to sacrifice fun ? Incidentally, it is extremely hard to imagine any child over 2 sitting through this video, even though the age range is 8 months to 5 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fabric marker","review":"Easy to use.

After only a week or two of use the vinyl started to get white lines where the bowl folds, as though it were going to crack in places.

I always take our own bowl and water, but I still want my hands free to control my dog. This travel bowl is a great idea. It's light weight and easily folds to a convenient size. It has a snap closure, so you can attach it directly to a belt, or the dog's leash. It can easily be folded and put in a pocket ... preferably prior to being used!Once home you can easily wash it, or wipe it clean.

My kid drew all over it already."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrible Things","review":"Terrible Things is based on the Holocaust and what happened during that time. Animals are used instead of people, and a forest instead of Europe. It talks about how terrible things came into the woods and took away animals by what they were or what they had for a tail or feathers. The animals talked to one another about their friends being taken away after it happened and not trying to prevent it from happening again. I think it teaches that there are times when you should get involved with business that doesn't include you and times when you shouldn't.I think the age level is maybe around 7-9 years. I think the book was interesting because it teaches history and is a story at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review Terrible Things","review":"This book tells about how the Holocaust could happen. So many times when things go wrong or don't look right, people have a tendancy to look the other way, not get involved, or \\"I better not help as I may have a problem too.\\" In this book the different animals are removed one by one by the \\"terrible things.\\" Everyone looks the other way- the only one to question why is a little rabbit and he is told not to get involved by his elders. In the end there is no one left,except the little rabbit who hid,- and the meadow is left silent and barren. Just as in the Holocaust years ago, if people had banded together, maybe this wouldn't have happened. I read this book to my LD 4th grade class. By the end of the book, outside of being able to hear a pin drop in the classroom, the kids asked \\"Why didn't anyone do anything?\\" I guess the author really got her point across!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not appropiate for younger readers","review":"This book is beautifully illustrated variant of Martin Niemöller's classic poem. It does a fine job of that. Middle school, high school and adult readers should have no problems reading the story, getting the message and understanding it. The problem arises in that the book seems to be geared towards younger children, simplifying a horrible situation into a context that they might find easier to understand while giving the message that they should stand up for people. This is done in a some what simplistic fashion, using a metaphor that does not necessarily ring true or relatable to young children in terms of connecting it to the suffering of the holocaust. There are books like Keeping the Promise: A Torah's Journey which convey the horrors but in a much more effective, less traumatic way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Discription of holocost... hollow","review":"Eve Bunting is fabulous author and I admire her work.. but she relate's rabbits and frogs to the holocost, really, think about this for a moment, can rabbits and frogs REALLY teach kids about went on during the holocost, the most aful thing that has happened, I think, cannot be put into words. But I'm older than the preferred reading level for this so maybe they are to young to know what really went on. Younger kids might rate this differently, butg as a 12 year old, I'm sticking to this."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT a children's book.","review":"There was a reviewer who was a bit critical of this book, stating that it was not an appropriate read for young children. S/he was ABSOLUTELY correct: allegories are for older children (middle school-high school) and adults. I was dismayed that s/he gave it such a low rating due to this, though, instead of rating the book itself.This book is a GREAT way to introduce the concept of allegories to your older children or students. I'm a high school teacher (I teach 9th-12th) and have used it with my freshmen to my seniors. Not only that, but it's a great introduction to discuss prejudice (and how forming prejudiced ideas can lead to bigger things such as genocide), a Holocaust unit, etc.I highly recommend this book for older students and adults. Very sobering, but it will lead to making great connections and discussion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book.","review":"This is a well crafted children's book, great for introducing the difficult topic to the holocaust.

This guy is obviously a world-class songwriter, and the way this music is put together has changed my opinion of not caring for orchestra strings in music.

He is possibly the best writer out there in the world of YA and children's literature. I love the unique characters and the way they surprise you. The story is exciting and stomach-clenchingly engaging. You wonder what will happen next, and you can't predict the next event. You can't tell if a character is good or evil by his surname and physiogamy. Characters struggle and waiver in their morality and resolve, just like real people. If the formulaic and predictable \\"Percy Jackson\\" type of novel is getting old, try anything by this author. Abhorsen is a real novel with a real story, not just the same deck of cards shuffled and re-dealt. Nix is an intelligent writer that does not coddle his reader. It is challenging and meaningful and will both entertain and elevate the reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you haven't read this book...","review":"This book is by far the best book I have ever read, and most likely the best book I will read.

Lirael, who lost hope of becoming a Clayr (one with Sight), journeys with the Disreputable Dog, Prince Sameth, and Mogget to stop Hedge- a dangerous necromancer.As the Abhorsen-in-waiting, it is Lireal's job to try and put a stop to Hedge and the joining of the hemispheres that will unleash a being powerful enough to make the earth a desert of ash. But first she must rescue Sameth's friend, Nick, who carries the being inside him, and journey though the nine gates of Death to find the how the hemispheres were created.Nix's novel leaves you plesently surprised yet in tears, wanting more of this contageous tale. But it certainly cannot compare with the novel that started it all; Sabriel, by Garth Nix."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of the Three","review":"This is my favorite of the three books(Sabriel, Lirael, Abhorsen). This fantasy isn't worth it if you haven't read the other two books, so make sure you do that first. If you have, you are about to go on an amazing adventure, getting more deep with the character's personalities, and breathing the air of the Old Kingdom. You will feel as if you were there.

As a friend and fellow Garth Nix lover said, \\"I feel like all of Abhorsen could have been put into two chapters at the end of Lirael.\\" I would have to agree with that. I mean, the characters got worse, if anything, the ending was boring and predictable, and the villian seemed nonexistant, so unreal was he. The only good thing about this book was how it delved deeper into Death. That was interesting, and made the difference between one star and two. Trust me on this: don't waste your money on this book. It's really not worth it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Unoriginal","review":"I don't know why so many people think this is such an amazing book. First off, to me it was very bleak and though it had a plot, it was a bit pathetic, and Garth Nix [used] many things from Tolkien, biggest being that the \\"companion's\\" name is Sam. They could have come up with better names (Death, Life, Disreputable Dog, Magic, Hedge) The bells/ pipes were hard to follow, and it was a slow book. It was still okay if you like fantasy, but the Necromancers were very stupid. I just didn't feel anything as I read this book. It was a dissapointment, becuase when I picked it up I expecting something exciting and mysterious, but all i got was a big flop."},{"rating":"1","title":"it was too complicated","review":"the book is way too complicated and the storyline is uninteresting. i don't know about reading that book, i believe The Giver written by Lois Lowry is a much better book, with a touching storyline. Read on Book Worms!! ^^~"},{"rating":"2","title":"READ THIS BOOK","review":"Garth Nix is truly amazing. When I first read Sabriel after having it suggested to me, I couldn't wait for the second book. It was just the same for this one. You really can't ask for a better fantasy trilogy, they're up there with the Lord of the Rings by Tolkien, the Golden Compass trilogy by Pullman, and the Harry Potter books by Rowling. Abhorsen was thrilling, exciting, scary at times, and was definately worth the read. I can't decide if I enjoyed Abhorsen as much or better than Sabriel. If you enjoy Nix as a writer you should check out Shade's Children as well. I really hope that Garth Nix continues to write outstanding novels like these."},{"rating":"2","title":"The End! Pulled Together Beautifully!","review":"I have been a large fan of Garth Nix's writings, and I have only read 3 books of his in the Seventh Tower series, but the Sabriel, Lirael, Abhorsen books were absolutely amazing! The plot thickened with each book and at the end you were left off with no other option but to jump in the car and speed over to grab the next book. After I had finished Sabriel I actually took a calender and counted the days untill the release of his next book. I deeply loved the series and how it was complicated with many things to remember and recall, how beginning charcaters, ones you would never suspect become the center of your high point in the book, I loved the way he wrote these books with such amazing dialouge and description of each and every movement. The interludes from accross the wall in Abhorsen were beautifully done and the ending made me drooling for more. Don't end the series Garth! We love it too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"'Abhorsen' by Garth Nix picks right where 'Lirael' leaves off -it is really part two of the same story, so be sure to read 'Lirael' first. It is an excellent conclusion to the story. It also answers a number of questions about the history of the old kingdom,including the nature of Moggett and the Disreputable Dog. Just an excellent series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another brilliant series by Garth Nix","review":"I read Sabriel in a weeks time...I read Lireal in three days...I read Abhorsen in two days...Nix's books always do this to me. His style is hard to ignore, and his creativity, unsurpassed- at least that's what I think.His latest book was no different. With its heart-pumping action, and a great sense of imagry and plot. This book is easily one of my favourites. Garth Nix never fails to go beyond my expectations when writing his final books -though he's only written two so far-. This MUST-READ cliff-hanger is too good to be literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not half as compelling as Sabriel","review":"To be honest, I was real disappointed with this book. I know it took a lot of work and all, but Sabriel's originality and mature theme is unmatched. It didn't have me hooked like Sabriel did. A lot of people have said that Nix has dumbed down the writing... and in all honestly I agree. Sabriel is a fantastic book though, and so is Shade's children. This book had a lot of potential, and although it had its unique qualities it didn't really move me. Check it out anyway and see for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"abhorsen","review":"I have only just discovered Garth Nix, I bought Sabriel in England last year and discovered something wonderful. Nix' characters grab you and hold you there until the last page and I couldn't wait for the release of the others. I missed much sleeping reading this and the previous two...

There is a black cord that came in the box but there are no instructions on what to do with it. I'm assuming that it is to tie the organizer to the seat but it won't fit around my seat plus I don't want an ugly black corder going around my seats!I will be returning both of these and am frustrated with the time wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just throw your crap on the backseat","review":"Because it broke on our drive and that's what happened.

The handgrips are very comfortable during use. The set comes in a little bag to make it extremely portable. The only drawback is that I normally work out with a friend, and the kit only includes one set of grips/handles, though I believe you can order an additional set of handles without ordering another complete set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great time saver","review":"These bands provide a great workout and so convenient! I love the strength and stretching exercises made possible with the bands. Plus it is so easy to do a set or two before work, after work, before bed - any time really! A door that has good clearance in front of it is a must. I like that the DVD is not in your face and it provides good direction and reminders about form. I was surprised how well I liked the book! It was a bit overwhelming when I first flipped through it, but once you do a few exercise and get use setting up the bands, the exercises become distinguishable and the illustrations helpful - though not 100% accurate in my case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for a simple workout product.","review":"My major impression of this product is that it can accomplish your fitness goals but it can be inconvenient as is. Changing the bands, handles and door anchor from one exercise to the next can be frustrating and time consuming. I helped that situation by ordering two more door anchors and another set of handles directly from Bodylastics so I'm not having to change the setup so often.The manual that comes with the set explains how to do the exercises but doesn't do much to explain the goal. Also, there is no help at all when it comes to choosing how much resistance to us for a given exercise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not strong or durable over time. For very light training only.","review":"I ordered a full package of Bodylastics bands. More than two-thirds snapped or broke over the following three years.

As with other Lewis comedies, the comedy is hit-&-miss, but it has its moments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just WHO is the \\"weaker sex\\"?","review":"Jerry Lewis runs amuck as a household gopher in a home for aspiring (and gorgeous) young actresses. A dream job for any guy, unless the guy is still recovering from a traumatic relationship that has him terrified of ANYTHING female. Some of the routines (and the cast) are way too familiar, but Lewis keeps the cat-beat hopping with new twists on some of his most classic routines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly original comedy could have been better.","review":"I enjoyed the picture upon its' release and on home video, however, this Lewis effort, like so many Lewis efforts, has much protracted and pointless mugging which detracts from some brilliantly executed scenes. Perhaps the usual criticism applies: the one-man-band Director/Writer/Actor Jerry was presumeably not able to concentrate on a tight production - indeed, the great opportunity to fully utilise the talents of Opera star Helen Traubel was lost (although Harry James, Buddy Lester, and George Raft have nice cameos). But despite all that, film students can still marvel at an amazing talent with impeccable timing."},{"rating":"1","title":"You gotta be kidding . . .","review":"How could anyone consider this funny? I enjoy (mildly) some Jerry Lewis movies. The Nutty Professor and The Big Mouth, to name a couple, get some chuckles and a few laughs out of me. But this thing--The Ladies Man--is horrible.

Don't get me wrong, I love classic Lewis films such as Nutty Prof, The Patsy and Disorderly Orderly, but this one's a stinker plain and simple! A slow and painful film, I laughed about twice. The plot is almost non-existent, and its all played out on a solitary set. Jerry was obviously churning these films out with not much thought to substance. Sorry Mr. Lewis, but even your over-the-top face contorsions couldn't save this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"the ladies man","review":"This is my favorite of all the Jerry Lewis films and it is as funny as I remeber it.

A great movie that I highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cinematic Jerry","review":"\\"The Ladies Man\\" (1961) survives as a dazzling vehicle for Jerry Lewis' filmmaking virtuosity. A decidedly thin premise (girl-shy Jerry unknowingly takes a job at an all-female boarding house) becomes a showcase for some of Lewis' most audacious camera work. The lavish interior set is a stunning creation and Jerry's sight gags are among his best. Transferred from an excellent 35mm print, the DVD edition includes plenty of extras and a commentary track by Lewis and Steve Lawrence."},{"rating":"2","title":"What can i say....its jerry lewis....","review":"Here is another Jerry Lewis production that i have'nt seen fora while, and it was another pleasant surprise....maybe not asgood as some but very viewable....hey what can i say...its Jerry!Jerry Lewis, is a top performer that worked hard to make peoplelaugh.

What were they thinking?Other than to assure the continued marketing of a consumable (the clip) and the potential for property damage liability claims, due to the damage to the housed unit when the clip fails and the unit drops to the ground, the engineers must have been out-to-lunch when the final plans were submitted to the manufacturing side of the house.I am impressed with the protection the Rhino Skin has provided when the housing has detached from the clip, sending my PDA skittering across the room or parking lot. (note: the Rhino Skin has not yet been tested under the weight of a passing vehicle, but with the current clip design - it's just a matter of time.)Perhaps reinforcing the locking ring with metal would reduce the wear and eventual failure of the belt clip.Buy two or three of these clips - you will need them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled...","review":"Okay, it looks nice.

The paint application is top-notch and the sculpt is uncanny. The toy features electronic lights and sound. This is pulled off masterfully. All the lights shine brightly and, depending on the sound, some lights will stay on while others turn off. It is an excellent toy. The paint application is sturdy and does not feel like it will rub off. The toy also features a ball-jointed display stand that allows for 360 degrees of display bliss. I absolutely love this toy.

She can be used to educate as it makes kids use their imaginations to invent new and better ways to destroy the ship in great space battles! It does however, have flaws, Its nacelles are loose, not secure at all, and fall of easily, eventually they just never stay on.

I only made 1 coating and so far the puzzle was solid. The extra \\"scrapper\\" was really helpful just be-careful with the edges as it might spill and if ever it does i recommend using a wet sponge to clean it off immediately otherwise it will stick to the surface (in this case i used wax paper).

The problem with this glue is that it dries brittle rather than rubbery and the bonds between pieces seem to snap when the puzzle is flexed at all.

Most people who live in the country earn low salaries.I mean it's far from crime of the century.What's next air?Interesting documentry."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-see for everyone who drinks water or soda","review":"Flow is a great movie that begins the story of water being sold by private countries around the world and the local sources being wiped out. It is happening in the US where the water is being stolen from the ground, bottled and sold on the shelves in cancer-causing bottles. In third-world countries, people are being throw off their land, rain barrels are outlawed and local water systems are outlawed and people are forced to buy expensive water from multi-national corporations. The next movie after this one is \\"Blue Gold\\" which goes deeper into the politics and corporate interests what will ultimately lead to wars over water."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flow: For Love of Water","review":"An outstanding film. I showed it to my Environmental Science and Ecology and Culture classes and the students thought it was the best dvd I'd shown all year. I'd call it a must for everyone to find out about the water they drink, and who \\"owns\\" it and what's in it that you don't know about. Real eye opening - we all intend to keep a much closer eye on what's happening with drinking water in our community. Clearly businesses and governments throughout the world are not working in the interests of the public and environment."},{"rating":"2","title":"water wars","review":"\\"Thousands have lived without water,\\" wrote W.H. Auden, \\"not one without water.\\" And so, every year about two million people (mainly children) die due to the lack of clean, reliable water, more than who die from AIDS or wars. This hard-hitting documentary looks at what might rightly be called the most basic of all human rights and *the* security issue of our day -- water. The film starts in the United States but moves to Bolivia, South Africa, and India. By interviewing leading activists (most notably the physicist Vandana Shiva) it hammers away at the commodification and commercialization of water by the likes of the IMF, the World Bank, Coke, and Nestle. A steady flow of facts and figures accompanies the powerful images. Best of all, the film allows the poor from all over the world, people denied this basic right, to speak for themselves and to tell their own stories. The makers of the film have proposed that the UN Declaration of Human Rights ad to its charter the right to water."},{"rating":"1","title":"99% problem, 1% solution","review":"Flow offers a good education around this issue, but the main drawback is that with the repeated onslaught of the bad and depressing realities of the water crises, they offer no more than just a couple of token minutes around reporting alternatives and solutions.I think a documentary like this should include at least 50% dedicated towards discussing alternatives and solutions. Instead, the viewer is left depressed and hopeless around this issue - so why would anyone want to be involved in finding creative solutions? Therefore, I think they're doing a disservice to the issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Concern for water but not Trees","review":"Maybe the makers of this film should have considered the trees while packaging this movie. There is more wasted paper on this movie than a regular blockbuster! A four fold out DVD holder inside a sleeve.

But what I'm wondering is \\"did this corporation steal our trees?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardcore Capcom fans only.","review":"The game has a fair storyline, the gameplay is decent, but you won't be able to ignore the polished PS1 like graphics. The game is very bland and has no depth in it's menu or character designs.

Although there are some problems with you AC getting in the way of the camera. And in one player mode, the arenas are all one on one. It would be at lot better if you could choose either to fight one two or three enemies at a time, like in a battle royal. Every man for himself. It would also be cool if you could play two player on the same team, doing missions, and such. Another good thing to do would be to make it so that you could hire people to help you, like MT's. Or if you could take on protege's. I like this game, and once i got used to it i started doing good. In three days, after I got going good i made it 60% through the game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely must have","review":"This is one of the best games I have ever played.

The engineering is as good as it can be, but the original master tapes are apparently to blame. I guess we'll never know why pieces of some songs are over-modulated...whether the mics were overpowered, if the equipment was cheap, or the original engineers simply recorded too \\"Hot\\".All that said, the newer songs sound cleaner than the older pieces. \\"Take me Back\\" sounds pretty good, but \\"Tears on My Pillow\\" will always have some distortion.

She helps her readers to understand that joys, fears, anxieties, hope, and all the aspects that make us human, are shared by others. We are not alone. While her topics are profound, her writing style is easy to read. As she writes of events in her life and how they've affected her, I found myself nodding and thinking \\"yes, I've felt that.\\" In every story in this wonderful book I felt that I was reading about myself as much as about Rev. Crafton. This book is for anyone who is middle age, has passed middle age, or expects to ever be middle age.

While yes, it provides clearly marked definitions and formulas, when giving examples, the work shown leaves out some key steps that leave the reader grasping into thin air trying to figure out the method to their madness. Some exercise questions are vaguely written, leaving the student to interpret the meaning, which may result in differing answers.If you have a teacher who uses this book, get it.

It is another thing to read it from a textbook. Although discrete mathematics is not meant to be all that numerically focused, I do not recommend using this text at all. There are very few examples to accompany the new content and the explanations are not clear. Also, the section review problems are NOTHING like the material presented. Yes, it is imperative to think like a mathematician, but the problems are worded much too differently than what is taught. Do not expect to do well in a course using this text unless you have a helpful instructor!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!!!!!","review":"Discrete math is complex enough for subjects to be explained extensively. That's not at all the case in this book. The explanations are too limited but most importantly, the wide range of expected answers REQUIRES this text to include most of, if not all, the correct answers for its exercises. This should not be a problem in this subject since having the answers would still leave you far from getting shortcuts; you'd still have to know discrete math well to pass a test.This text was created ONLY to generate profits and lacks of any interest in the student's learning.

The Pistol and Communicator look as though they're not made by the same company. They are both bland colorless shapes. Really boring. Don't make the mistake of thinking the pistol and communicator look anything like the photos they show on the web page. The web page photo shows a pistol & communicator with dynamic color.

The levels are balanced well with an occasional 'don't just kill the enemy' puzzle, where you have to manipulate the enemies to do something for you (like open a door).

She should ship this book to France."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ah, Paris...","review":"Siri Mitchell transports you to France in this novel. From her detailed descriptions of the city to her clever dialog, she creates a story that cannot be devoured. Instead, you must savor the words. I found myself enjoying the absence of active romantic pursuit by the main characters because it tantilized my imagination and left me anticipating something better and more satisfying.I really appreciated the concept that was presented about our beauty - not to excuse pride, but to appreciate who we are in the Lord. WOW! Even the page numbering and headers are charming. Boy, do I want to walk the streets of Paris for a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book!","review":"I loved this book! I am an avid reader especially of chick lit so when I saw this book I thought I would give it a try. I had not read any of Siri's books before. But I was hooked! Claire travels to France- the descriptions and fun made me want to go there! I even looked up pictures of France afterwards to see if it looked like what I had imagined. Once there she is picked up (late) by a child hood friend. And the story begins.... you will not be disappointed in this book! I have already bought another of her books and can't wait until the new one comes out in August!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Faith, Fun and France!","review":"Siri took me on the adventure of the lifetime through France with Adrien and Claire. I felt as if I was actually walking down the tree lined streets, through the museums and restaurants with them. Several times I had to stop and question my beliefs and faith as Adrien pushed Claire to examine her own. Siri has a wonderful writing style and as soon as I finished the book I wanted the next one. I want to know more, what happens now! You won't want to put this book down once you start it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and Great","review":"My daughter recommended this book for me and I loved it! It made me laugh out loud in places. What I like about Mitchell's writing is the fact that it is not only inspirational without being over preachy but that her characters are flawed but lovable. I heartily recommend this book as well as others that she has penned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining","review":"A terriffic read.

The Lost Guardian: an epic novel, marvelous in both its scope and execution. The third book in this series is entirely different. It is raw and ruthless; it takes no prisoners. It takes no stock in anyone's hangups, pretensions or prejudices. And it blasts them to pieces. It is a groundbreaking work full of chaos and it always gives you what you least expect. Read it. You'll never be the same. I think that's good.

Anyone who likes RPGs will at least like this. At first I found the lack of free movement restricting, but when I found the depth of exploration I was quickly hooked. Poeple who have played Zelda or Pokemon will probably have the most problem with the movement.But it is the games depth that makes it so superb, I have played it three times, second and third times right through and I am still discovering secrets and working through the alternatve endings, the first time you will probably get the \\"unhappy ending\\" but do not be discouraged.

He said, \\"there's nothing else like it, try in on your stainless too\\".It is one of those products that I simply cannot live without. It's also the ONLY spray can product I've come across that doesn't streak my SS appliances. It puts Stainless Steel Magic to shame. Cleaning your SS appliances with this product is just like cleaning a window and just as fast, only you go with the grain of the SS.

The star of this show is Lighthouse's \\"One Fine Morning,\\" and Rhino must be praised for offering up the full (LP) version rather than the 45-rpm edit, which was about two minutes shorter. It's a shame, in a way, that this song had lyrics; had it been an instrumental, it would have found a perfect and permanent home - on \\"Music From NFL Films\\" - it had that quality about it.

It covers the politics, the culture, the Swedish Psyche, the Rule of Shoes (you'll have to read the book to find out what that is), etc. It's written for people just like you.There's a nice mix of background information and practical, concrete tips.

I can't say enough about this game except get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A few issues, but an overall great game!","review":"The game itself is extremely fun, especially if you are a Disney fan. It's a good overall racing game for the non-Disney fan as well. There are a few issues with the controls being a little awkward in spots, but not enough to ruin the enjoyment of the game. There are also a minor issue with the graphics when you are right next to a wall, but again, not enough to take away from the overall enjoyment of the game. I agree with others that the inclusion of Mickey, Minnie, Donald, et al., would have made this game almost perfect.

There are 3 characters you cannot get at the beginning of the game, but if you get all the flags, trophies, and all the parts to the fireworks machine, and we cannot forget to get the 8 faries in each level. This will enable you to get the three characters that you couldn't get at the beginning of the game. If you pass through three blue rings in a row, it will open a secret passage.

Great \\"widescreen\\" edition and clean copy of the film. The worst part about it is the dissapointing commentary track. Here you have Lewis and singer Steve Lawrence (!?) providing the commentary...and I must admit, I could not get through it. Jerry seems to enjoy watching the film and Ed McMahon-like Lawrence seems to nothing but kiss Jerry's rear end the whole time. All he does is laugh and say..\\"Jer...that's just great...funny stuff.\\" While Lewis chuckles and gives such insight to those comments as \\"yeah.\\"Worth having at this price for the film, but do not expect too much from an \\"extra\\" that really could have made this a gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece, Underwhelming Special Features","review":"Ahh... what a film. Jerry Lewis blends tragedy and comedy so well. The recurring themes of the man/child, the bitter clown, the wellmeaning buffoon who can't help but wreck chaos. Jerry has a very complex and sad side to him, but he weaves them into such absurd, but completely human individuals. This is still a sweet-natured comedy for adults as well as children. No social satire or cynicism here. The physical humor on display is quite ingenius. Better than Buster Keaton or Chaplin easily.This is only the 2nd Jerry Lewis film I've ever seen (Guess the first) and I'm excited to discover more of this underrated comic auteur's special brand of slapstick. The commentary is a huge letdown, not even worth a listen. He just remembers how cute Donna Butterworth is and how much laughter was had on set. Its cool to see the very brief bloopers and screen tests. But you'd think he had more worthwhile material to slap on this DVD. Oh well.

The skin is tough and rubbery although it needs to be pointed out that the surface of the ball attracts dust like nothing else so it requires routine cleaning.This product can be used like any other medicine ball with the exception that this one doesn't bounce, which shouldn't be a problem since you would only bounce medicine balls off of a gym floor or other tough surfaces that most people might not have readily available anyways. On the other hand this is better than other medicine balls since this product is softer and easier to grasp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great weighted toning ball","review":"I love this toning ball.

It's likely to slip from sweaty hands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout tool","review":"I purchased this ball to use in my personal training business. I am having great success using this ball with clients. The texture is great and easy on the hands, so clients can use it for more activities than a traditional medicine ball. It's also great for things like push-ups and sit-ups. I like to use it as a partnering tool as well, and it works very well for tossing back and forth.

It Isn't. The voice feature is nice and it works but the gauge is both inaccurate and hard to use. When I checked the pressure in a tire it was 45psi on 3 different gauges, this gauge read 43psi. It is always 2psi low. Sealing the tip on my 90 degree valve stems is almost impossible. The head of the tire gauge needs to be angled for the new 90 degree valve stems, more like a car tire gauge.

I settled instead for a solid, well-built, ANALOG gauge from Amazon. It's no longer available, but this: <...>...is about the same (mine came with a rubber boot that's available separately for this one). I spent $40.00. Expensive? Yes.

I cracked it open and discovered the \\"lifetime\\" battery had died. I had to cut some plastic to change it out, but even with a new battery it would then only read \\"1.0\\" so perhaps it needs to be calibrated or something.I rate this 2 stars because they advertise it as having a \\"lifetime\\" battery when the battery obviously dies after a few years of infrequent use. It is also impossible to change the battery so you have to throw the whole unit away to buy a new one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as described","review":"I bought this to use on a BMW motorcycle because it has awkward access to the pressure valve on the rims.

Pick this up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"MLB did it again, slapped a new year on a game without alot of new improvements, I prefered Triple Play 2001 over this version, graphics never improved over last years version actually 2000 seems clearer. If you own MLB 2000 I'd wouldn't waste my $$$ on this, If you don't own ML B2000 and have nothing to compare it to then its a okay game. I'd buy Triple 2001 over this title, more options, season mode for multiple teams better perspective and angles of a ball in flight in Triple Play 2001."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre story","review":"Story had so much potential, but it's told in a disjointed way.WAY too much sex; there's more scenes of sex than anything else.

It is based in a world in which a Master Race has subdued Earth and also controls most of our galaxy. Mercenaries are hired by the Master Race, aliens and humans alike, Athol Morrison being one of them. The book centers around Athol and his adventures and personal life. I found this book simply fascinating, a rare page turner. William Barton writes with adult content and themes, so beware if you are easily offended, however, I find this writing style very refreshing and honest, in regards to true human nature and instincts that few if any other SF writers ever touch. I understand this novel is out of print, but it would be worth it to locate a used copy somewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Putting the Philosophy back into Science Fiction","review":"Barton takes a common theme, alien invasion, and reworks it with the grace of a master. Very much a book for the future of science fiction, the reader is left with the idea that what humanity suffers at the hands of alien invaders in some ways reminds them of their humanity. Top notch stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the price","review":"The wire has an awesome look to it.... The sound quality is good no problems there.

I was more than pleased by his unfettered story telling ability of a very realistic experience of life in a once middle to upper income Queens NY neighborhood. The detailed account of a young teenager from a good family, but nevertheless inexplicably involved in murder,sexual promiscuity, racial bias and a host of other threats to normal progression to adult life by many of our teenagers regardless of their surroundings. It gives the reader pause to consider the question is their anything society can do to remedy these conditions which threaten so many of our young people.

This novel, while somewhat revolting, exposes popular science fiction as poorly written, fascist literature as an alternate history version of a award-winning SF novel by Adolph Hitler. There were violent parts that I thought might've been extreme, but the comedy part of the book is in the ultra cheesy dialog, the sheer invincibility of a hero who conquers all his enemies using a phallic object without much of a challenge. Read this book, and your experience reading books by Robert Heinlein, Ayn Rand, Robert Jordan, JRR Tolkien, and the unbelievably well-received Patrick Rothfuss will never be the same. Gives you a different perspective on many main characters, dialogue, and points in popular sci fi. As a sidenote, anyone selling copies of this book for over $[...] is a devoted follower of Feric Jaggar. I lucked out and found a copy for [...] cents at a local used bookstore, hope you have the same luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle Edition: Riddled With Errors","review":"I read this book years ago and enjoyed it immensely. Call it satire, call it alternative history; whatever you call it, it's amazing. If I were reviewing the actual printed version of this novel, I'd give it four or possibly even five stars.But I give the Kindle Edition one star because it is absolutely RIDDLED with errors. I can live with a few mistakes, but this goes just too far. There is a character named \\"Waffing.\\" Literally half the time he is called \\"Waning.\\" \\"Feric,\\" the book's protagonist, is often \\"Peric.\\" Exclamation points are replaced with the number one. It's clear that no care, attention to detail, or effort was put forth in preparing the electronic version. If they were charging a buck for it, fine. But this is $8.00, a real book price. For that I expect a real book.This edition is just disgraceful. It shows no respect for the book, the author, or the readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Imaginative","review":"What would have happened if Hitler left Germany, came to the states, and wrote sci fi? The question will sound absurd, but only until you read this novel. Many people describe Iron Dream as satire, but I think it is far deeper for such a term. Rather, Spinrad forces the reader to imagine the world in the way Hitler saw it and then makes you hope his side wins (in this book they are the good guys).

Great song, but it came out in January! Put her last single, \\"Come on Over Baby\\" on it instead! And Vitamin C's \\"Graduation\\". This song is so depressing. And they put on songs that people haven't even heard of! Examples: John Michael Montgomery's \\"The Little Girl\\". For one, it's country, and for another thing, it's so sad! And Whitney Houston's \\"Fine\\", and Joy Enriquez's \\"Tell Me How You Feel\\". Who is she? I've never heard of her! And I don't know a lot of people who know Dido. But Totally Hits does put some hits on there like Pink's \\"Most Girls\\". Best song. And Madonna's \\"Music\\". Barenaked Ladies' \\"Pinch Me\\".

Half the time, it won't release them upon pressing the eject button....I've had to pull them out by a tiny corner....hence, more scratching.Also, this system was NEVER loud enough for me. I guess I need double the wattage (just a personal choice). I think it looks cheap and I prefer a drawer DVD/CD system to a slot, but at the low price....I guess I got a year of use from it.

I find that his shorter stories pack more of an emotional punch than his longer ones. His best stories are the ones that stay under twenty pages. The longer ones lose their pacing. He doesn't throw in enough smaller scares in to compell rapid page turning. Nonetheless, stay with the longer stories and enjoy the endings. They all do satisfy at their conclusions."},{"rating":"2","title":"LG 20\\" HDTV","review":"Great picture quality for both HD and SD signals.

Based on the small number of reviews, I would guess that this artist is a little less-known so I thought I would recommend it. No, not a faithful follower for a number of years, just someone who likes singer-songwriters and is constantly sifting through new artists for a real connection. I wouldn't describe this as a happy go lucky album but one that you would listen to for a little introspection. I tried to listen to it as background music but her lyrics are meaningful and catch your mind off guard. When I first heard her voice I thought \\"sounds like Sinead OConnor\\" without the angst. That is where I will I will stop the comparison. If you like a woman singer and a piano (ala Tori Amos), you might give this a try.

I even join them once in a while and it works for me as well. Be careful though not to get the PAL version as I did at first, but make sure it is the right format, NTSC. The PAL version worked on my computer but now when I have the NTSC version we have it up and running on the big screen every day. Actually my kids ask me to put it on.

I chose this one because a lot of the other choices available looked like they would be too baby-ish for him, and this one was short and inexpensive.He watched it for the first time this morning. He really got into it, which hopefully means it won't be a battle to have him do this regularly. I think the 20 minute session will be just right for us. I don't know anything about yoga, so I needed something that could take over for me and let me participate as well.Also, I was concerned that it would not go along with my Christian views. I wanted the relaxation and stretching benefits, without the spiritual aspect. This does have the spiritual aspect, but I was able to explain easily to my son how to modify it for us.I think we are off to a great start, thanks to this little dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kids didnt like it","review":"My 11 yr. old likes to do yoga.

Many times, info that I needed to know was not included and the clue bottle map is non demetional and hard to determine where the bottles are. I have actually had to get that info else where.

It has provided me all the chords I've ever needed to play including bar chords. It is easy to flip through and navigate to find the desired chord. Unlike other chord books I saw it is compact in size, so it is not a hassle to keep right in my guitar case.I have taught one guitar student and now am teaching another, all thanks to my learning from Instant Guitar Chords.

It's true that the earlier years in AOL forums and chat were an interesting time, and there are many good stories that could be told.

Although it doesn't have the flair you can get with a book written by a consultant, The authors provide much more useful information that what you usually find in a book out of the developemnt lab.

No. I was scanning printed pages from books. Apparently the DocuPen can only hold around 10 pages of normal text. The 50 page limit described in their advertising apparently refers to pages with a sentence or 2 on them, rather than actual pages in books or journals--very odd considering it's touted as a tool for students.

I would have thought that a well designed device could compensate for variations in scan speed. I may have been able to practice further and get better results, but I probably have less patience than the others extolling this product. On the plus side, the company has at long last delivered on its promise for MacOS X drivers and deserves business for this alone.What I now use in place of the Docupen is a photocopier (in the library) and and the incomparably useful Fujitsu ScanSnap (in my office).

We live and learn which items are worth spending on to get good quality. I am usually cynical of expensive products that promise but don't deliver I wish I knew that pro dryers made such a difference. I waited until my 30s to try a pro dryer and wow, what a difference. I have short, fine hair that needs volume but is also dry and brittle. I also am busy and impatient so I need a hair routine that's quick and effective.

The fourth in the Gaunt's Ghosts series, Honour Guard puts a new twist on the saga -- and that's what's so great about Dan Abnett. He could easily rest on his laurels and crank out the sort of flat sci-fi that Gibson once referred to as the \\"golden ghetto,\\" shoddy pulp that sells simply 'cause it's sci-fi, or in this case, sci-fi game fiction. But with each novel, you can tell that Abnett is stretching himself, trying to grow as a writer and to take his stories in new directions.After finishing Honour Guard, I tried to read Gav Thorpe's 13th Legion. I put it back on the shelf after about 20 pages. It was a joke compared to Abnett. I may pick it up again, when I get tired of waiting for a new Abnett, but I won't be fooled -- I'll be reading it to keep myself immersed in the 40K universe, not 'cause I'm expecting really good sci-fi. For that, I'll wait for Gaunt's Ghosts Book Five."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deus ex Dei Machina","review":"My only complaint is the climax of the story, the point to which the entire novel's plot has been building, takes about a paragraph to resolve.

Anyone who remembers the Glass Bottle's radio hit \\"I Ain't Got Time Anymore\\" will appreciate that fact.If my ears could breathe, this compilation would be a breath of fresh air."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting mix of early 70s hits","review":"Volume 4 of the \\"Have a Nice Day\\" series won't raise many musical eyebrows, but it does have a bit of a split personality.Much of the disc is MOR pop, like Mark Lindsay's \\"Silver Bird\\", Christie's \\"Yellow River\\" and Ocean's slightly folk-flavored \\"Put Your Hand in the Hand.\\"Three of the cuts aren't country-flavored, they're flat-out country. Lynn Anderson's \\"Rose Garden\\", Ray Price's \\"For the Good Times\\" and Sammi Smith's \\"Help Me Make It Through the Night\\" were all successful on the pop charts, but they're died in the wool, cry in your beer country. Another track, the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band's \\"Mr Bojangles\\" was also a major cross-over hit.Brewer and Shipley's classic \\"One Toke Over the Line\\" and Wadsworth Mansion's \\"Sweet Mary\\" add a pleasantly humorous touch and do a nice job of rounding out a slightly disjointed collection.Volume 4 isn't one of the best in the series, but it's a lot better than some.

They tell punks if you don't love this nation then leave, well, i say to ROITGUN if you don't love our punk scene then get out! The band itself is contradicting and somewhat confused. On their website they promote chaos and speak of being \\"hooligans\\" but on their CD they talk about being proud of our nation. This CD/band angered and shocked me.

Early Christianity was surrounded by a complex world of religious diversity and many times other groups tried to 'borrow' from each other to help earn converts to their religion. In reality, that's what Gospels like Thomas, Judas, etc are all about tryin to create interest in Gnosticism by using well known names of people well known to Christians. This video makes that clear--unlike some others that try to see the Gnostics as an off shoot of Christianity (instead of a seperate religious group with Greek roots).

What the hell? One shocking thing he writes is some comment about Keaton \\"may have\\" lost the tip of his finger in a clothes wringer. What's this \\"may have\\"? I don't think there's any question about it. Keaton himself said he crushed it in a clothes wringer and back then something like that was a common occurrence.

A much better book on Keaton is the one by Rudi Blesh, which is unfortunately unavailable now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed up","review":"This book has many things to recommend it, but many more not to. The oddest thing is when Dardis describes Keaton's second wife (twice he says she was a very attractive brunette - actually she was rather witchy-looking) and he goes on to say that she dumped him when she'd had enough of his drinking. Not true. She was a golddigging conniver who Keaton actually got rid of himself. He stopped drinking once he had.Many other factual mistakes, but worse than those are his take on Buster. He seems not to respect him much. Why write this bio? He talks little of the artistry of the man."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Garbage!","review":"There's a factual mistake on nearly every page of this book. Dardis is obsessed with Keaton's drinking, spending some 80 pages of the book on this subject, while cutting the last 25 years of Keaton's life to a mere 20 pages.In short, this Dardis book is uniformed, inaccurate, unbalanced, and unhinged. However, despite all this, the Dardis bio is still somethat superior on the Marion Meade book, which is even worse. A solid Keaton bio has yet to be written."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Axcellent Read","review":"This book examines the work of nine of the most influential contemporary American philosophers since the mid-twentieth century through interviews. The interviews are focused around the historical opposition between analytic and continental traditions. Other themes addressed in the book include pragmatism, hermeneutics, logical positivism, Marxism. Giovanna Borradori does a superb job as both the interviewer and editor. The resulting book provides a good glimpse not only into the work, but the lives of these philosophers. Hilary Putnam's interview, \\"Between The New Left and Judaism\\" is especially charming. This book will be an enjoyable read for philosophers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Reference!

I took it for what it was a fun book that would be perfect beach reading material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy the Book","review":"I could have written a better romance novel. Most of the book was just raw sex that evoked asolutely no emotion in the reader. The book lacked substance, creativity, amusement, sexual tension, etc. I agree with the other bad reviews - don't buy the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Enough","review":"In comparison to \\"Never Too Much\\" I was greatly dissapointed. I didn't like Grace's character at all. She seemed to me to have very low self-esteem. She spent the first half of the book whining that she was fat and didn't seem to have any issue letting a man she loved use her for nothing more than sex. Noah's character was better but not much. I thought Noah was boring, my husband is more of a bad boy than him. He was engaged to a woman that his grandmother thought he should be engaged to. The woman wrongs him and he protects her. As for the fling it was pretty much of a yawn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hackneyed","review":"Three reasons I rated this read only 2 stars:1. The primary female character wasn't nearly fleshed-out enough before she was thrown, rather unceremoniously, into bed with the primary male character. Throughout the book it was as if I was perpetually reading an introduction to Grace Jenkins--I never got a chance to get to know her.2. It seems as if the author took from something else she'd read a single theme that inspired her and turned it into a 150+ page thought, a thought that was underdeveloped (Ms. Foster tends to think faster than she types) and overdone.3. The author's attempt at a unique storyline is evident here but never quite gets its wings and flies, being bogged down in trite rhetoric--tragic.I purchased this book, and now want my money back. I highly recommend Susan Donovan's \\"Knock Me Off My Feet\\" instead of this book any day of the week and twice on Sunday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the story?","review":"The appeal of this author is lost on me. Her writing is better than many I've read but there is absolutely no substance to this story. No depth. No exploration of character beyond sexual attraction. The effort at emotions rings false because lust is always in the way. Her hero is a caveman, albeit a politically correct sensitive one, and the author went overboard emphasizing the heroine's size. I'm amazed this publisher used this book to launch a line of erotic romance - erotic <--now that's a laugh when applied to this book. It's barely simmering. Worth the price? Not on your life. It's category romance, nothing more, and should never have been published in trade paperback form."},{"rating":"1","title":"ho hum","review":"What a snoozer. I found Noah to be one of the more self-centered heroes (who obviously gets off on controlling a weak-willed, annoyingly naive woman). The heroine (what was her name again? Oh, yeah. Grace.) completely forgetable. Oh, except for her simpering virginal \\"please please please\\" can I drop to my knees for you? What, is she waiting for his permission? A strong heroine would just go for it, but with her we get \\"whatever you want, Noah. You're the big strong man and I'm just an overweight, unattractive woman (in her own thoughts, and I wasn't convinced she \\"got over it\\" by the end, either) who is greatful that you deign to sleep with me.\\" I kept waiting for something interesting to happen that would make me believe these two really were meant to be together, and by the last page, I was still waiting. Too much temptation? I'm just sorry I was even TEMPTED to buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"HATE THIS BOOK","review":"Let me start and tell you don't waste your money on this book. After reading so many good review I bought this book. It turned out to be a complete disappointment. It was so boring! Lori Foster writes like Elizabeth Lowell (writing style in which i really don't care for). They don't write anything worth reading. It was all about sex (yawn). The sex scenes were redundant and there was no chemistry between the hero and heroine. I rather read my college textbook then reading one of her book again. If you want a good book read after the night by linda howard or mirror image by Sandra Brown and forget this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very tempting story!","review":"\\"Too Much Temptation\\" by Lori Foster was a tempting story well worth the read!A story that had me anxiously flipping through the pages. Loved the storyline, love the characters, but thought the dialogue could have been a little more steamy for a story of this nature.I am one of the few guys that I know of that enjoys a good romance and take my word for it \\"Too Much Temptation\\" is one of those books that did it for me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow was this hot!","review":"I've read several of Lori Fosters Books and this one is a keeper. Very hot. The characters were realistic. I couldn't put this one down."},{"rating":"2","title":"for mature adults only...","review":"...not because of the steamy [intimate] scenes (which are good) but because the plot promotes that silly \\"Pretty Woman\\"-type fantasy: submit ...to a handsome rake, and he will fall in love with you and give you the intimacy you REALLY crave. You'd think that most readers over the age of 18 would know the difference between fantasy and reality. Some do. But plenty don't. Ignore the sexist metamessage, don't scrutinize the plot too closely, and enjoy the hot scenes featuring an \\"actual size\\" heroine."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING !","review":"I love Lori Foster books, but this came out years ago with a different cover- look at the other reveiws- they are from 2002. I hate it when a publishing house does this.But if you've never read it is a great story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch out, Dara Joy!","review":"I have been a fan of Lori Foster's for years now. But TMT and NTM are her shining accomplishments. Usually books dealing with repressed women who have weight issues just make the heroine suddenly lose fifty pounds and learn to vamp it up at her local bar. This was a touching story that combined poignant emotion, naughty sex, and lots of laughs into one novel. I can read this over and over and over.My only complain with Lori Foster is that she doesn't write enough!!PS I also love how she writes her male characters. Amazing perspective and she doesn't hold back from the sexy/tough language. You've sill got it, Ms. Foster!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking","review":"The story kept you wanting more, I couldn't stop reading. I can't wait to start reading the next book. I hope there will be more with these characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"So refreshing and absolutely steamy!","review":"I absolutely loved this book! This is the first time I've read one of Lori Foster's books. I thought it might have been a little too \\"naughty\\" but it wasn't. Grace's position in the book was refreshingly familiar and very realistic. I found myself relating to her on so many levels and Noah is just a dream. I couldn't tell which one of the brothers I found more stimulating. I would love to read about Noah's brother Ben...maybe Lori Foster will think up a romance for him as well. I really recommend this book for anyone who wants a real contemporary romance to lighten up the mood and get your heart beating. I loved the story and the characters were amazing. Can't wait to read more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The temptation is real","review":"Too much temptation is rare mix of the characters not knowing what they feel and the reader already guessing the truth. Noah Harper has just found his fiance cheating on him and now his grandmother has disowned him unless he gets back together with her. Noah just wants to have mindblowing sex for awhile.Grace Jenkins can't believe the way his grandmother is treating him. She goes to offer her support and gets much more than she bargained for. She's loved Noah forever and now is getting a chance to have a relationship with him. Even though it is only sexual. One of the things I really like about this book is the way Noah makes Grace feel about herself. It's more than sex because he wants her to feel about herself the way he sees her and when she starts to feel confident others take notice.Too Much Temptation is a great story with passion and heart. You just know the characters are meant to be together and it's fun waiting for them to figure it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I had never heard of Lori Foster before and reviews appealed to me. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. There was a great story line and some great scenes. There was enough character development to want more, to feel disappointed when the author would fall back on cliches and trite phrases. I couldn't understand why Gracie would allow her employer to abuse her verbally without walking away. When she did walk away from the job, she continued to take grief. I loved the fact that the heroine was not model thin and she did go after her dream guy. I'd like to read other books by Lori Foster as there was enough good writing in the book to make me think that she could be one of the best romance novelists. But she could benefit from a better editor as the grammatical mistakes were jarring."},{"rating":"2","title":"No One Does It Better Than Lori Foster!","review":"\\"Too Much Temptation\\" by Lori Foster was a tempting treat! I loved the story so much I didn't want to put to down until after I had finished the entire book it was that good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Complete Flop","review":"If you don't mind stories loaded with clichés and dull-witted one-dimensional characters you might like this book. As for me, it's by far the worst in the erotic romance category I've read for years. Why this book bears the subtitle \\"A Novel of Erotic Romance\\" remains a mystery to me. There are of course several sexual encounters, but these are boring, stereo-typed and without any imagination, never mind the language.What annoyed me most, however, was the heroine - a twenty-five-year-old and because of her slight overweight continuously embarrassed virgin. Her constant \\"I-am-so-fat-and-no-one-wants-to-look-at-me-whining runs like a thread through the whole story. Not that I would mind a heroine who for a change does not look like a cover-model - on the contrary. But please let it be one who wears every pound with pride and self-confidence. If you prefer a more sophisticated Erotic Romance try those by Robin Schone or Emma Holly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing - a Plus Size flop","review":"Grace had no personality, very one dimensional character. Other than a few good moments and a lot of sex, this book has very little to recommend it. Any plus size woman whose fought the mirror and others impressions would find this book very disappointing. Go watch Bridget Jones, its at least funnier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money!","review":"This has to be one of the most ridiculous books I have ever read! This was my first Lori Foster book...and it will be my last. The two main characters, Grace and Noah, were very unlikable. This book was labeled a romance but there wasn't any romance, just a lot of casual sex between two people who had nothing in common. So don't waste your money or time on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A flabby, listless love story","review":"Didn't Wally lamb wear out this concept in She's Come Undone already? I'm a Lane Bryant girl married to a Big & Tall man and I have had a loving, yes passionate, romance going for 11 years . . . and things aren't bad between my husband and I either . . . so what's the big deal about writing a Harlequin romance novel that doesn't have Fabio and Elle Mc Pherson on the cover? That said, this book was so poorly written; a bad copy of Nora Roberts style, and dialogue that was just too conversational. This was my second--- and last--- Lori Foster novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was mediocre at best.","review":"I felt that this book was not very well written at all, I honestly thought that maybe this was the first book the author had ever written! It lacked any sophistication and there was absolutely no build-up or explanation to the characters becoming involved with one another. The sex scenes are okay, but not much else to recommend it really. Save your money and check this book out at the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"May not be the worst book I've ever read...","review":"...but it is the worst one I can think of.Chubby virgin (I think her name was Gracie, but it doesn't really matter) meets sexy man with big c__k and becomes his sex slave. After that, they fall in love and live happily ever after or something (I started skimming after around page 150, just so I wouldn't have to gouge my eyes out).Basically, the story is a thin set of scenes to play out between the porn.Skip this garbage!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of sex, but not much else","review":"Too Much Temptation is the story of an overweight, inexperienced sweet young woman who enters into a sexual relationship with a gorgeous, worldly man. This story is very much a traditional romance; Grace Jenkins has been in love with Noah Harper for years and her desire is simply that he will fall in love with her. The antogonist, Noah's grandmother and Grace's boss, does everything she can to keep the two apart. However, she really doesn't provide much conflict to the story. Whatever obstacle is thrown in their path, Grace and Noah navigate with little difficulty.The book is billed as \\"A Novel of Erotic Romance,\\" and if you are looking for a straight romance with lots of rather graphic sex, then this book will meet your expectations. But don't expect much more than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Little Temptation!","review":"I guess that we've given up expecting too much from authors, because this novel is run of the mill yet highly regarded.There was no build up and no release, it just sort of laid there going thru the motions. It was caricature driven and the \\"steamy situations\\" were predictable and therefore anticlimactic in their inevtiability.This book embodies my pet peeve with the formulaic installment writers that read and write alike time after time. You could write one synopsis that could be applied to nearly everything they've written and that is a terrible syndrome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Entertainment- Sexy, Hot and lots of Fun","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Take a sexy voluptuous woman that is beautiful and smart, pair her up with a brooding, sexy alpha male, and add a little overbearing and manipulative grandmother and you have a great story. Grace is not exactly comfortable in her own skin, Noah is the man to show her just how beautiful, sexy she can be, and how much a man can want her. Norah has a past that still haunts him and does not quite believe he is worth the love of a woman, especially someone as wonderful as Grace. His quest for hot, and I mean scorching, uncomplicated sex ends up being more than he bargained for. I loved Grace's constant need to defend and stand up for Norah against anyone even against himself. There are some really funny moments as well as passionate love scenes. All in all it is a good book to cuddle with on a cold to help keep you warm."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT READ!","review":"THIS BOOK WAS A GREAT READ. I LOVE THE MAIN CHARACTERS.

I find so many of these romances have the protagonists doing really silly things all in the name of advancing the plot, but in this enjoyable novel, they actually behave rationally and the story does not suffer for it.

It was funny and adorable and had some really sexy parts too. I fell in love with all the characters, which kept me turning the pages. I finished it in a day it was so good. If I were going to change anything, I'd request more dirty stuff - but overall I was really happy with it. I usually like a little angst mixed in with my romance, but this time I was ok without it. It was primarily a fluffy happy piece of work - but still enjoyable. I laughed out loud several times. And I was pleasantly surprised that the leading lady didn't have a perfect figure. This was totally worth my money. Now I'm going to read all the other books by Lori Foster!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"The first of the three Temptation stories, and one of my favorites by Foster.There are no plot surprises here; this one is all about the characters, especially the heroine. I LOVE Grace! She has a poor self image - for which I usually have no patience in my fiction - but she is a happy person, who generally enjoys life. And she is having the time of hers, with the hero and their red hot affair. Every scene between the two is a delight.There is a strong cast of secondary characters, and plenty of brother Ben, who stars in the next book of the series. And the author has managed to make all of them likeable, in spite of themselves. For instance, in the words of another character, Kara is spoiled, selfish and weak. And yet, you still don't hate her. The same could be said for domineering Agatha and overblown Enrique.In the mood for light and FUN? Try this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful romantic escape","review":"I truly loved this book. I felt that the characters were interesting and fun. Noah and Grace held my interest and made me want to believe in their romance. I have always loved Lori Foster's books but this is one of my favorite. Maybe that is because Grace was real not some dropdead beauty. This was a fun book and I look forward to more like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pearl in a barrel of poo!","review":"Well, this one's a stinker. Oh I know all the hype about how great he was etc.etc. and how he kicked off the Band, but this is, to my jaded ears, pretty run of the mill, early rock 'n' roll. Largely forgetable. Except for \\"Bo Diddley\\". It's hard to tell it's the same band as the rest of the album. For my money it's worth the price of admission for this one song. There's a slight reprise, albeit in a different guise at the end in \\"Down In The Alley\\", that sounds almost like they're going into \\"Bo Diddley\\" part 2, but it doesn't quite make it. But the rest of the album - naa."},{"rating":"2","title":"To Read or Not to Read?","review":"In the pattern of a growing number of Catholic contemplatives since the day of Thomas Merton, John Michael Talbot's book \\"Come to the Quiet\\" melded the Christian West, the Christian East, and non Christian sources.I am not sure exactly how to fill out this review. It is a book that I am not sure I'll pass out to my friends, yet a book I've returned to over and over. It gives specific steps and exercises to help the novice grow in contemplative meditation, yet these exercises will be outgrown in time. It is thoroughly Christian, yet contains enough non Christian philosophy to make some people nervous. It does a better job than most at describing the practices of the contemplative life, yet does not go as far as Merton or John of the Cross into the mystery of the mystic.The book helped me to grow."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good guide for students","review":"I have just started reading the book, but already I feel like it was worth the purchase. I already notice a different in the way I evaluate and write my psychology papers. I also notice a difference in the way I approach psychology as a whole - focusing on the concepts more as opposed to just memorization of the material. I would recommend this book to anyone. However, I also think that you should get some other books as well as one book does not cover everything - but this is a good starting point."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is for every woman of God!!","review":"I have read and reread this book and bought for several friends.

I grew up listening to Big Band (my Dad is a BIG fan of Big Band)so I can appreciate the style. I also have the WOW 2000 with The W's Rumor Weed song on it and that is what truly prompted me to buy this tape. Since I am a Christian, I just wondered where their walk is with God. Alot of people say U2 is a Christian band and I would never think that in a million years! I like to know where exactly a group is coming from...either you're hot or youre not. Which are they?"},{"rating":"1","title":"essentually not swing","review":"The quality of the music on this and their other CD is very poor. It is highly repetetive and the lyrics do not fit the music. Swing is jazz (not some kind of alternative music like many think). And this can hardly be classified as jazz. As for swing-they have very little sense of it. The horns are out of tune and not blended. They are barely what I would call a CHRISTIAN band. They have few songs to prove themselves as that. If you are looking for good swing, go with Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, Squirrel Nut Zippers, Royal Crown Review, or classis like Basey. If you want Christian Swing-there are other Christian Swing bands who have much more sense of music. Some of the music is OK, but it is hardly something I will invest my money in. Look somewhere else this time. They seem to want to swing punk and ska more than play TRUE swing. Swing sounds good when it is SWING. Mixing it with other forms tends to delute the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd Rather Be Dead!","review":"Give me a break this is absoulutly not a christian album.

They liked this CD very much. Great find."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who is giving this one star?","review":"Alright, I'm not christian, I go by music that sounds good and I like. These people are saying it's bad because it has nothing to do with God? I think I missed something. This is a GREAT CD, it combines ska with swingish horns and great lyrics. My favorite tracks are: \\"Tip From Me\\", \\"Nothing\\" (both of which are about God BTW), \\"Staurday\\", and \\"Two More Weeks\\" My least favorite was probably the secret track, it's just some guy who is off key singing \\"Play the Game\\" with the band... it is kinda funny though.You'll have this CD in your CD player for days on end, I know I did. And not because it is a Christian band, but because it's really good music and you will really enjoy it. That's what counts right? How much you like the sound?"},{"rating":"2","title":"SWING BABY!","review":"This CD is one of the best I've owned this year. Awesome tunes, great words, and the Rumor Weed song is the best!

It took forever to cool the pot even when I ran it under cold water and wouldn't open for over 15min.

I would recommend these to anyone who has to be on their feet a lot. Plus, they are soo cute and i have gotten a lot of compliments on them. If you have a little wider foot, choose the wide size.

This game could have been written a whole lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it seems.","review":"I really did not like this game. It was very boring after a certain point the dogs can only do minimal tricks. Once you finish the few things your asked you can only play with the same dog, repeating the same things over and over.

Our seven year old daughter was crushed when her dog \\"went away\\".

I was able to recreate the same kind of dog with the same name and she was off and happy again, but this came after a very sad little girl.

You take a little quiz to see what dog you might like. You pick a dog. You might find it in one trip to the store or 9 trips to the store. I picked a beagle. And then you go home and name. Now the game gets harder. You must train your puppy to sit, stay, lie down, go to the bathroom, and more. Once you teach it about three things, it gets easier. After three weeks with the puppy, you are forced to leave your puppy. You can visit your puppy if you like. But after you're finished visiting, you are forced to do it over again.

The darker the honey, the higher the antioxidants, and some source flowers impart even more health benefits. This stuff is strong. The flavor tastes very strongly of buckwheat. If you like buckwheat (and I do) you will like it, although it bears getting used to on some things you might be accustomed to flavoring with honey. For example, I like to put honey in my coffee, but the buckwheat flavor in my coffee is not something I am sure I am going to be able to get used to, even though I do like buckwheat. However it tastes wonderful on a slice of sourdough toast. Yum! And in a cup of hot cider tea it's got other strong flavors to compete with so it's not so noticeable as it was in my coffee.

I hate to knock someone's sincere effort, but I feel compelled to save others from spending so much without fair warning.Ineffectual static graphics are heavily layered over tiny windows offering only occasional glimpses of dancers' limbs. I can envision an effective use of textures and filters applied behind the dancers' movements, but as it is, the ethereal motive of the work is almost completely obscured by heavy-handed geometries and unsophisticated symmetries harshly superimposed.I'd give the student a C+ for effort, but I certainly wouldn't pay for the video if I had it to do over."},{"rating":"2","title":"A recap of a major hadith source","review":"This is a recap of many hadith from one of the major muslim sources (Abu Muslim).

The hadith are important to understanding Islam and this is a good brief way to encounter some."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greatly misleading title by a clearly biased author","review":"A person trying to understand hadiths in particular and Islam in general are better served elsewhere. I recommend the \\"An-Nawawi's Forty Hadiths\\" - where the hadiths' authenticity are more assured and where readers can better come to their own conclusions. This book is a biased view of 'selected' hadiths (some hadith's authenticity are doubtful) by someone with an agenda and preconceived views. It is illuminating to note that Ram Swarup is a Hindu writer known for attacking Islam and Christianity in his works (you can google him or do a quick search at Wikipedia)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very misleading","review":"The title and blurb of this book are very misleading. I started reading it thinking that it would be an intellectual review and summary of the hadith. What ensued was a very offensive ranting of the author's opinions on Islam, coupled with quotes from the hadith that were altered to fit his purposes. The author obviously has negative views towards Islam, and created negative interpretations for every hadith mentioned. There were also many blunt, overarching statements about Islamic life and practices that were simply untrue. This book is very insulting to the Islamic religious traditions, and if you are looking for unbiased information on the hadith I strongly suggest that you look elsewhere. Nothing in this book reflects the true teachings of Islam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sin is doubly rewarding?","review":"\\"Sin is doubly rewarding?\\" This is a hadith? Which source?

I noticed that the book was not written by a Muslim however I believed that this would not be an issue. This definately is an issue, trust me. Instead of making this book an unbiased analysis, the author is blatantly skeptical of Islam and tries to discredit it whenever he has the chance. He even goes so far as to point out what he believes are Islam's weaknesses and Hinduism's strengths. This book is entitled Understanding the Hadith, not A Comparison of Hinduism and Islam. Along with this , the style and writing is very repetitive and at times unclear. It was difficult for me but I finished reading the book and I now wonder why Ram Swarup even bothered to write it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-Islam Book","review":"This book is an anti-Islamic work. One can tell by just reading the couple of pages available to you. The author tries to say that Muhammad tried to say he was higher than God. Which is blasphemous and what the Prophet preached against. Muhammad was against putting up to Godly status and he said so as does the Qur'an. He was like the other Prophets, but a mortal human being."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intellectual Fraud","review":"This book will provide no reliable understanding whatsoever of the Hadith or of Islam.
