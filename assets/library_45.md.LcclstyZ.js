I thought it would be nice to get the Gold since it has the handle that goes over the lid to make it easier to carry. The trade off is that the air vents are on the side.The result is that when you put the lid on, even with the lid vents all the way open, the fire chokes out. I much prefer the bottom vents of my Silver that had to get tossed.Also, the metal on this grill is substantially thinner than the metal on the Silver it replaced. Still, it gets the job done well for 5 burgers or a couple steaks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silver or Gold?","review":"I bought the Gold model. When the wind is blowing, the Gold model is fine, and the signature feature (the handle that snaps over the lid) is a good safety item when grilling is over.When the wind is not blowing, the grill does not work properly. The reason is because the vents are paradoxically situated above the coals. This problem can be alleviated by folding a medium-size piece of cardboard and standing over the grill fanning the coals for 10-15 minutes. When this is done, you will be a Smoky Joe too but at least the coals will be hot. However, do not put the grill top on when the wind is not blowing, for the coals will smoke and go out almost immediately (even with the vents open). After one use, I drilled 3 vent-holes in the bottom. It helps, but I still have to fan the coals. A common hair styling blow dryer can also be rigged to provide the necessary ventilation. I have tried this, and the low setting seems to work fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ideal for Temporary Travel companion","review":"I bought my Smokey Joe to use while on a 30 day business trip to give me and my partner an alternative to eating at the local restaurants every night. As it turned out, we only ate out two days during the entire trip. Every other night was spent grilling on the Smokey Joe. First thing the next morning, I would clean out the ash, carry it back to my room and reload it for the evening. If you are a Weber Kettle user, you will feel right at home and have no problem adjusting. You will be suprised at how much you can really put on it. I started with the recommended 30 pieces of charcoal, but soon found that to be a little lacking in heat. Found that 35 was about right for chicken and veggies, but 40 were needed to steak and pork. Plan on putting it to work from time to time at home also. Best $35 I spent in a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smokey slow","review":"As others have suggested the Gold has the vents above the coals - not sure what the weber folks were thinking. I've had many of the regular silver joes and loved them (i grill 4-5 times a week) they have high heat and even cooking. This grill was obviously designed for the occasional griller who can leave the top off for his hot dogs and burgers. best advice - avoid the gold, go for the silver - if like me you purchased the gold version either give it to a part-time griller or chuck it out - its pretty useless for serious grilling. wish i'd known before i plopped down my $35."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"First of all, the directions were followed.

I can start tender plants much earlier than usual so that my tomatoes and cucumbers are producing sooner than anyone else on the block. Mine finally wore out so I wanted to get new ones. I had read that the red ones were better for tomatoes so I ordered these. I found them to be of a thinner and more stiff plastic but otherwise the same. When filled, they stood up straight rather than colapsing in the center which meant that a greenhouse enclosure was not created. The interior did not get as warm and the seedlings were not protected as well at night from a frost. It was hard to judge this spring because of all the rain. None of my plants performed well and I can't objectively say it was the teepee's fault.

I found it very helpful and stimulating - a treasure trove of insights, principles and things you can do to create better conversations and help teams & organizations act more intelligently. Perkins lays out an elegant set of principles on the practice of intelligent action and how the most intelligent solutions emerge from people in constructive dialogue together. He shows what makes for progressive and regressive action. He hits a home run by illustrating how both people smarts and process smarts are essential for success.If you are a leader, coach, consultant or educator and really want to find new ideas on how to build a collaborative culture, buy this book, read it carefully and you will find the Holy Grail!

It also fits quite well over my Woodland Camouflage Boonie hat.Military Boonie & Jungle HatsIt's simple but well made and there is practically no place in the world (except Antarctica or the shores of the Arctic ocean) where this wouldn't be useful in season.

I just default to going out and turning my food (mostly turkey) a quarter turn every 20 minutes and everything is cool. I usually cook small turkeys, 12-14 pounds, so this only requires 5 or 6 rotations. Some of the prices for these things are outrageous!

This is very annoying. One of the better test preparation utilities. It closely mimics the real thing in the way it is presented to you, and the way it allows you to mark questions and review them. Overall, a good product, flawed, but still worth the price. Good luck on the test."},{"rating":"2","title":"The late 60s side project of the Association is perfect pop!","review":"The Millenium is a pop/rock band that was around in the late 60s, hailing from California. Their songs are catchy a la Peter and Gordon (and beatles, monkees, etc) and production is smooth like \\"pet sounds\\" or many of Phil Spectors project. The leader of the band was a one time player in the more popluar band, the Association. The songs are tightly knit 3 minute at most burst of thought out fun and edearing thoughts. They add a touch of exotica/bossa nova percusion to songs such as 5 am. For any fan of good guitar based, smooth pop music or any 60s music, this will be a great addition to your musical world. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Errors","review":"I record a LOT of CDs using several different computers and burners. The Office Depot CDs have given me the most problems.

It was genuine, and comes across that way. She parodied herself on Will&Grace; decades later, but this was the real McCoy.The Warner Archive collection of nearly-forgotten films are treasures: lovingly produced with beautiful, commercial-quality, picture and sound. Wide-screen.Definitely worth a look, if you are a dance or musical fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"The memories","review":"I guess my story with this album(s) is a lot like others; my roommate in college bought this set back in 1979 and I had the entire 3 LP collection burned into my consciousness a month later. We listened to this constantly in the 1979-80 school year; I can't count the number of times I would come back to my dorm room late at night and my roommate would be fast asleep and this record would be blaring out of the stereo speakers (perhaps blaring is not the right word...)When we parted ways in May, I made sure to hold onto my cassette tape. I've listened to it every 5 years or so since then; 25 years later, I still have that tape and it's held up well, but I can't wait to pick up the CD version- I was not aware that it was on CD until I jostled the name out of my memory recently.Few albums evoke more good memories for me than this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"great concerts","review":"These concerts take me back to my college days no one does free playing like keith jarrett"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jarrett's debut long improvisation","review":"Keith Jarrett is probably the greatest improviser of the 20th century. He can sit down and spin out original ideas from the top of his head for up to an hour (Lausanne concert).A tremendous melting pot of styles, you'll hear gospel, boogie, trance-like atmospheric passages, Romantic style melodies, atonal improvisation, contrapuntal improvisation, name a style and Keith Jarrett has absorbed it.Jarrett himself said of originality: \\"Jazz has built up this need to be unique. That's egotistical. As far as I'm concerned, the last thing you should try to be is original. If you sound like 80,000 others, as long as you don't imitate, it's still music.\\"There are many hauntingly beautiful moments on this album. They don't move me quite as deeply as the Koln Concert, but all the solo concerts I've heard by Jarrett are outstanding.

She's fascinated with the portrayal of a way of life gone by, and is genuinely moved by the discovery of the abandoned baby. The lead-in to the discovery is perfectly paced to generate suspense in a reader--she gasped and sighed in all the right places on our first reading. GrandPre's illustrations are so beautiful in their treatment of light and color, and they complement the lyrical language perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book to Share","review":"I have read this beautifully written and illustrated bookso many times I've almost memorized it.

Avoid this waste of paper and ink."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"This is a good book. As an avid 40k player and fan, it is a really good read. There is a lot that is conflicting with what you find in codexes and other sources, but it really doesn't subtract from the storyline. You really don't need to read the first book in the series to understand this one, but I'm sure it'll help.Also, who ever knew that the Great Unclean Ones of Nurgle were British?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleggh","review":"Very poorly written, I couldn't get past page 50 or so. For example, in opening pages each paragraph uses the word \\"superhuman\\" to describe space marines. Action sequences are similarly redundant. Nothing comes to life in this book. Re-read the Warhammer rulebooks, they're better written and far more entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Cleanup","review":"I purchased these with the Gold C series and they make cleanup a breeze.

I would not have purchased the book if I had reviewed a copy of the book before ordering it through Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please note that there is now a fourth edition of this book!","review":"The rating I give here is just based on a skim of the book. However, after visiting the author's website, I very quickly realized that there is a fourth edition of the text. Unless you specifically want a more historical perspective, I would recommend that you get the fourth edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical applications for Win32","review":"This book provides a thorough treatment of system programming principles for Microsoft Operating Systems. The author has a concise, to-the-point writing style and he covers the majority of relevant topics. The text also contains a number of useful and imaginative examples of the Windows programming interface. I liked the revised multithreading sections, which contain a lot of interesting new material (especially for readers with UNIX experience). Win32 System Programming is a manageable and useful reference guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive and Enjoyable Guide to Investments","review":"Burton G. Malkiel delivers on his knowledge of the market in a manner that is both concise and comical at the same time, making this a immensely enjoyable read. This is the first book on investments I have ever owned- and after reading it, it very well be my last. Malkiel does a wonderful job putting the often obscure and esoteric business jargon in plain English, giving detailed explanations of each of the four areas of investments(bonds, stocks, real estate, and treasury bills) followed by chapters and chapters of invaluable information that will guide you slowly through the chaos and disarray that is wall street."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great primer!","review":"Wonderful book that is full of great advice, I definitely recommend to anyone that I find is looking for advice on investing for personal finance reasons. The book offers much more that just investment advice, such as real estate mortgage's, life insurance (how do you really need) and saving for college programs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This is a book written by Burton Malkiel or a freshman at college? offers very basic educational tool to the world of investment. I always thought Malkiel was magnificent in his first book now I think he stole the random walk idea from his colleague. if you have one year college in business don't buy it"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful College Graduation Gift","review":"While this book is geared to novice investors, even experienced investors (successful or not) and their portfolios can benefit by reading it.The bottom line is Malkiel is a steadfast believer in index funds; not just equity, but also bond and real estate (reit index funds).Like Malkiel, I am a fan (and investor) of Vanguard's Total Market Fund. After reading this book, I will be stepping up what has been to date a gradual shifting of my investments from individual equities and a couple equity funds to VTSMX.This book is well written and very readable.I beleive that this book would make a great college graduation gift. One of the keys to having a \\"respectful\\" nest egg is to start investing early! In plain English, Malkiel demonstates the benefits of investing early and consistently.I would not hesitate to recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warning - this book will give you a headache","review":"This is, without question the best investment text I have ever read. The headache comes from realizing that the solutions for investing are not difficult and the book makes you want to kick yourself for not following the logic sooner.Malkiel is a veritable genius and his comments are like an unending rainbow of gold.This is a must read for all of us. Read it, follow it, and your opportunity for financial success OVER TIME are, in my opinion, unrivaled. WOW."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Historical Fiction!","review":"This book, India Fortunes, and the previous volume, India Treasures, are the best historical fiction I have read yet about India. These two novels cover an amazing scope of the history of India with a series of \\"short\\" stories within a main story set in the mid 1970's. These stories flow beautifully on their own, as well as, part of the whole. It is truly hard to put these books down because each story captivates you. In talking with those who know the culture of India better than I do, they agree that these stories are quite insightful. I recommend you read both volumes in order starting with India Treasures."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not Klein's best work","review":"Unfair and Unbalanced is Robert Klein's 2010 HBO stand-up special. Klein is no HBO rookie - he actually filmed the first HBO special 35 years ago. The film left me wanting more. Klein opens with a song compelling President Obama to not follow in former President Clinton's footsteps and to \\"keep it in his pants.\\" This is weird. Its like the joke is lost on me because there hasn't been any Lewinsky-esque rumors about the current President. The stand-up offers a few giggles and then more musical interludes. An ode to medical marijuana falls flat also. I'm sure Klein has some good work out there, so I recommend seeing that. Only a die-hard can appreciate this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Retire already it's pathetic","review":"UNFUNNY.How anyone could find this even the slightest bit amusing is beyond me.

She saw the In Flight pattern and loved it. It is well-made, and the colors are great. The only problem is finding the bedding set and the matching accessories. She put her name on a waiting list at Babies R Us, and I chose the option on the website to be e-mailed when the items became available. The only thing I will suggest about that is to keep checking the website (my daughter and I checked it several times a day), because I purchased several of the accessories online and never got an e-mailed that they were available. So if you choose this pattern, be vigilant about getting it; however it is well worth the trouble. My soon-to-arrive grandson has a beautiful nursery waiting on him!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very cute","review":"I was so happy to find an airplane theme. At first I was not sure about the colors, but I really like it now. I just wish it had more matching accessories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute airplanes!","review":"This set is perfect for a little boy. The colors are great-not to soft for a little boy. My husband is a pilot and we fell in love with this bedding. The bumper fit well on our sleigh crib and is very sturdy. The quilt is soft and just the right size. The only disappointment was the mobile. It is too expensive and broke easily. It is also not stimulating. I would definitely recommend this and buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Wish I was Rich!","review":"I love the airplane themed crib set. I come from a family of pilots. When I registered at B.R.U. I did not register for a crib set because I was told not to use bumber pads because of SIDS. I wish I would have registered anyway. I did get the diaper holder, mobile and the lamp shade and they are wonderful in my little boys room. Now that he is moving around I wish I had the bumper pads so he wouldn't hit his head on the wooden slats in his crib. Unfortunately I cannot bring myself to part with $200 for something he will grow out of and doesn't \\"need\\". It would have made for a great gift though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great primary history spine for Ancient Israel","review":"We use a literature approach to homeschooling, preferring actual historical texts, or such texts that have been adapted for children, when possible. We attempted to go through the actual Old Testament in a year, but it was too much. This book turned out to be the perfect solution. We still like to include actual OT readings, but we can cover far more history in detail at a faster pace when using this book as our primary spine. It also includes the later history of Israel, the time after the close of the Old Testament leading to the fall of Jerusalem. I do not know any other book for children including this later history. Anyway, this book is a great read-aloud and we have enjoyed it immensely in our homeschooling. The illustrations also, are very informative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not all Owls are equal.!","review":"I read this story years ago and it is still a haunting kind of story. The primary idea is that when you hear the owl call your name--providing you can recognize it, it is announcing the possible arrival of your death. There are many omens and signs throughout the various cultures. some are warnings and some announce the coming of good news. The variety of messengers also is relative to one culture or another. Keep your eyes and mind open. You never know when a messenger will try to get your attention. Owls are hard to ignore, especially if you live where it is easier to hear this voice --many times in the dusk and dark of night, Sort of like the owl in a Brady Bunch episode --but it had no message, just was not expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"A confusing read","review":"Some areas of the book are pretty strong, but overall I found this book to be poorly organized and written in a confusing fashion. Some sections barely skim the surface of topics, while others seem to go into great technical detail about stuff you'll likely never use. In several instances, I actually felt like I was learning in SPITE of the book -- and that's not the feeling you want out of a how-to book. Not terrible, but I'd consider a different book if you're looking to learn Final Cut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make it stop","review":"Just another cd of the awful, awful techno-crud that has infested goth/industrial clubs, while REAL artists like Cinema Strange and Knifeladder get the shaft. Worthless on every level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of Examples...but Many Are Not Valid","review":"This book has a lot more practice exams than you will find in most books. However, there are many questions on the exams that are simply not valid. For example, the book asks several questions regarding a topic called \\"L'Hopital's Rule\\". This rule is NOT a part of the AB curriculum at all. Then there are some examples that are CLEARLY calculator type problems, yet they appear in the \\"non-calculator\\" portion of the model tests. Not the worst book out there, but it may make you feel more confused after completing it. It has the potential to be a great book, but the publishing company desperately needs a new editor for a future edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Filled with errors and lack of knowledge","review":"I was shocked to find this booked riddled with simple errors and basically a lack of knowledge about the horror genre. There are plenty of comments and remarks made by the author which really shows that he doesn't know squat about the horror genre. So if you want book that gives you lots of wrong info, here you go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watered Down","review":"I received a sample of this for Christmas and when it ran out I ordered it from Amazon.

Unfortunatly from a Roleplayers point of view it's just another massive multiplayer repeating the same quests over and over, grinding, farming, ect. ect. The only thing is it does have a nice D&D \\"Feel\\" about it with all the newly trademarked monsters, it's also got solid graphics and such but in reality it's not close to an RPG and the tech support for paying a monthly subscription service is terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the worst game I played","review":"Their customer service is the worst too. Their stupid technique person can not resolve any problem. Every time I tried to contact them, they always said that their manager or technique people are not available. I usually have to wait one week to get the response."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun game at the time","review":"My brother and I ordered this game to take a break from another MMO we were playing.It was fun for a couple of months, we mostly worked through the missions with just the two of us (this became much easier when they updated the Resurrection shrines). It felt a lot like I wanted dungeons and dragons to feel, and I really enjoyed most of the missions.The combat was fun, and felt more action packed than most MMOs.I recommend it to anyone who is a fan of D&D.; For those that are not, character creation might be difficult.I heard they recently switched to a free to play method, so I'm not sure if this box is useful anymore, but the game is fun, so if this box provides a subscription, than certainly try the free mode before you buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Solo need not apply","review":"I'm going to keep this short and to the point. There is very little solo content in this game. It reminds me much more of Guild Wars than WoW, DAoC, EQ or EQ II. The only MMO going on in this game is when your waiting for a group (which you must be a part of to quest in a practical manner). I joined up for the head start preorder but after playing the game, I'll probably never pay them a dime to play once my \\"free\\" 30 days is up. Honestly I feel like I just tossed $50 plus out the window. I can only hope Vanguard is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yugoslavia!","review":"Mr. Hall presents an unbiased view of the people of late Yugoslavia, and mixes the history in with the people he has personal encounters with.

Well written, insightful, on subjects both silly and profound, with lots of insight into human nature. The one about Hemingway makes him seem like a pompous, self-inflated horse's butt and a stone alcoholic. I believe it was accurate. The one about Ricky Jay, the magician's magician, is great, too. A genius. I can't wait to read the rest. This book is good to keep around, so I always have something fun to read. These are not butt-kiss profiles, like the ones you find in Vanity Fair.

It produces a very unique, but realistic, estrus sound that is relatively \\"buzzy,\\" if you will. The regulator allows you to choose between making a loud call, or keeping it quite when a bull is close by and you don't to give away your precise location. It does take a bit of playing around with and getting used to, as if you don't have your lips pressed to it properly it will not produce a nice sound (like a woodwind instrument). Overall, in terms of matching a whiney, hyper estrus sound, this call is tough to beat."},{"rating":"2","title":"One little flaw.","review":"The whole time she shows the parts of the dances, she does so mirroring you.

The price was very good, and it's good enough quality, except that it's hard to get the lines taut enough to not sag when you hang things on them.

The 1st time I hung clothes on the line, the line tension disappeared, and the clothes were hanging down to the ground. Adjusting the tension did not work, as the umbrella would fall down after a while, and I had to insert nails into the holes to keep it up. That seemed to work ok, but then we had a heavy rain in the area, and this caused the the concrete and plastic sleeve to pop out of the ground, and the entire line to fall over into the wet grass. (I followed the instructions carefully to install it- dug the hole to the depth required, inserted the sleeve and concrete, etc.) Also, because the entire thing fell, a flimsy aluminum arm bent. This will not be repairable. I do not recommend this clothesline! I'll have to get another to replace it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This clothesline is an excellent product.

While it's not necessarily designed to spin in the wind, it does move easily, helping with drying and with hanging clothes without having to move ourselves.We installed it by first concreting the sleeve in a square concrete block, then burying and concreting the entire block in the ground.

It looked like a car had run over it. I opened it, the base was dented, but worse, some plastic piece had broken off and jammed into the lighting fixture, making it impossible to screw in a bulb and impossible to use the lamp.

As usual the metal bracket that holds the push lever in place bent away from the body of the hole punch and the punch did not work. I've had to bend it back so many times, I'm certain it's only going to take a few more before the metal bracket breaks. The action is fairly smooth but this punch does take up a lot of storage space.

I'll just get some paste and use that on the paper to help hang it. WRONG! My friend and I took 5 hours hanging a small 10x11 room. It was a nightmare. The quality of the border is aweful, it has more paperlike qualities verses a vinyl. So after you start to work it onto your wall it stretches more than 1/16th of an inch. So if you ran out in a spot and need to match the lines up it doesn't look like they are the same size. Also it seemed whether I wet it and followed the diections to the letter or I used paste it didn't stick on the tops and bottoms. I surely hope after all that money spent for a cute matching border and all the work to get it up on the wall. I hope it stays up and doesn't start falling down. What a disaster.

I did as suggested and leveled the fist size mounds to see where the active tunnels were which showed up the next day. Not one trap went off.As far as placing the trap with the trigger above the ground (as suggested by some reviewers here) this makes no sense as the tunnels are NOT RAISED and there is no way the trap will go off.

I finally got a large set of channel locks, got the trap to set, and attached the safety pin. I set everything up for a few days with no results.

THe trap is difficult to set and requires the use of special tools that come with the trap, but are not part of it. Even with the tools this trap is a pain to set compared to others. Once you get is set and placed on an active run it does the job. Another issue I have with this trap is that it's design and color make it difficult to see from a disance and impossible to tell if it is sprung. You have to remeber where you put it and check it periodically. I recommend poking the tools into the ground next to the trap so you will know where they are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Victor Mole Traps - Out of Sight","review":"These are much more difficult to set and move than the other Victor spear-type models.

It was not hard at all. Yes, the spring is very powerful, and therefore it's hard to get the jaws opened and locked. However, the provided tools and proper technique make it easy.I had a dozen or more tunnels in a 15' x 25' area of my yard. I picked one tunnel that seemed fairly straight, hoping it was one that was used over and over by the critter(s). I set the trap, (which took less than 5 minutes), placed a bucket over it, and went back inside. 2 hours later I came back out and looked under the bucket. I was surprised to see the trap was already sprung. I was even more surprised to see a mole in the jaws when I pulled it out of the ground! What more could you ask for?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Mole Trap","review":"A very well built mole trap that works great when set correctly. The safety latch is a nice feature that prevents accidental tripping while setting the trap. I don't follow the box instructions but rather set the traps on the surface. This works well with a lot less effort than trying to bury them. I've found that a person needs to be very patient. The mole may not use the tunnel for several days. In fact I've caught some after five or six days. Picking the best tunnel is the hardest part of trapping moles so spent your time there rather than moving traps around every two days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super great workout!!!

It has none of the bluesy sound from the early Whitesnake albums or the pizazz of their 1987 album. Half hearted perfomances at best. Anyone who gave this album a good review must love David Coverdale so much that they can't be objective any more. Sorry David, it's terrible, and you know it!

It's the kind of book in which the reader has trouble putting it down. I believe anyone who reads the book will be transformed subtlely in ways that can be described in three steps: 1) one begins to remember instances in which coincidences had occurred yet a feeling inside knew it was more; 2) if one pays more attention they'll begin to realize that such occurrences have always been going on, and it is society that has called them pure happenstances without explanation; and 3) fear will settle in, and one might begin to think he/she is crazy if she begins to experience some of the more paranormal stages that Judith Miller traveled through. Dr. Miller's book is probably most important to that one person who needed validation of his/her experiences and found them in Direct Connection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mesmorizing","review":"Never before has spirituality and psychology been so compatible and accessible.

We did the whole game together, and are now doing it 2 player, so she can learn to move the character also. Once we finish together, I suspect she'll be ready to go it alone.

It blinks all the time and it takes several hits on the buttons to make it work. Disney says to stand 3-8 feet from the sensor, but I tried everything, moving all around, and it made no difference.Second, the controls are hard for the target audience! You use pretty much every button on both the nunchuck and the wiimote. My 5 year old kinda got it, but still got frustrated and doesn't want to play. My 3 year old can't even get past the first scene.When they say a world is hard, it really is. Ariel and Cinderella weren't bad, but even I had problems figuring things out in Snow White and Jasmine. We have never actually 'beaten' the game because every time we (myself included!) get frustrated.I feel like this really could have been a great game, but I will be returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATE this game too","review":"My daughters, ages 4 & 6 both really loved the idea of this game. The outfits and interaction with the princesses are fun, but there are so many bugs that it makes the game unworkable. They are new to the Wii, but even I have a very difficult time getting the pointer to work and as of now we are completely stuck in the mine with the dwarves. Both girls could easily play and enjoy the game if it actually worked. Too bad. I really wanted to like this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"HATE this game!","review":"Oh, my goodness, I don't have strong enough words for how much I HATE this game! One level makes you click on two dwarves to move them and it won't let you click more than once. However, in order to actually move on with the game, you have to click on each of them multiple times! This leads to very frustrated kids and an even MORE frustrated mother! So we decided to quit and try a different level to see if we could make it work only to find out that one of the players for some reason isn't allowed to go the direction the other one can go. We would push the button to go left multiple times and it would make the player turn right back the other direction. And it's only this game, since we have no problems with any of our other Wii games. This is the most frustrating game I've ever played!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Work","review":"I thought my daughter had trouble playing this game cause she was to young (5 years) so I put it away for a year and just tried again. It wasn't her, it's the game!The pointer functions don't work, even to start the game and write her name didn't work. I switched remotes and had the same problem. I took over the game and found it so frustrating, I couldn't imagine a 6-year-old trying to learn this as her first and only video game.I now see this has happened to others and I wanted to add to the list of frustrated parents so you would trust this is a real problem and maybe move on to find another game that actually works."},{"rating":"1","title":"The remote freezes while on Octopus","review":"The remote stops working while trying to save Ariel. This is the only princess my daughter tries to navigate to. And the remote stopped working when we got to point where we fight the Octopus. May be this game is not compatible with Wii Remote Plus. I bought the Wii system just last month."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unintuitive, repetitive gameplay.","review":"This game is mostly frustrating and sloppily designed, making little obvious use of the Wiimote.You may be thinking \\"Eh, she'll like it for a little while\\" but you're wrong. The controls take a while to learn, and if anything it's WORSE at the beginning.Remove all the $20-and-under cheapo games from your shopping cart and get ONE good $50-$60 game instead, or you're just wasting your mosey and your child's time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over too soon","review":"My daughter got this for her fifth birthday.

Can't get to where she wants. Same thing over and over. I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too difficult to figure this game out!","review":"This game takes too long to figure out the plot and how to navigate and is not appropriate for young children. Even my 7 year old, who plays Star Wars, Raiders, Sport Resort and others had some trouble with it. And my three year old, who loves the game Diego and loves Princesses, is wholly uninterested."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"We bought this game so our five year old daughter would have her own game for the Wii. Boy, do I wish we'd gone with the Barbie one instead. The graphics on this are horrible. She did finally figure out how to play it some by herself, but it is tricky, even the big people couldn't figure out the right moves for some of it. It was really disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too short - otherwise good gameplay","review":"We received this game as a Christmas gift for my 5 year old. She loves Disney Princesses and we had just bought our Wii, so this is one of the first games she played on it. Together, we finished the game in roughly four 30 - 40 minute game sessions. One bonus level that is over in five minutes is available after the game is won. The Wiimote controls for waving the wand were great, but the game creators could have done much more with the unique aspects of the Wii controller. Overall, a very well done game that looks good and smaller girls (I would have trouble recommending to girls younger than 5 and older than 7) can play easily. But, the major problem was its brevity and almost zero replay value. Would not purchase if it were over 20 dollars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to play and glitchy.","review":"We are a family of gamers...and we were totally frustrated by this game.

She really wants to play the Wii like her older siblings but finds most games too complicated. The controls were easy for her to get the hang of. She really liked that she could dress her princess any way she wanted. I definitely think that this is a good game for a 4-6 year old girl."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun for a princes -- for about a day or so . . .","review":"My 6-yr-old loves the princess stuff, and she had great fun with this for a day or so. It really is a game for very young girls - its not hard at all. BUT - After you go through all the chapters, there really isn't anything left to do. You can change your princess's dress and walk around in the various princess worlds, but there isn't anything to do. My daughter got totally bored with this game after she had completed all the levels -- which only took her a couple of hours worth of playing time. When you look at some of the sophisticated games out there it is ridiculous to me that they couldn't have made there be things to do after the levels were completed. Even though she loved this game at first, she is now disappointed that there is nothing else to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice game","review":"My 4 year old daughter love this game....though she was a little afraid of the bogs at first. After a while, she learned how to beat them and was no longer afraid. My 5.5 year old plays along and helps his sister and they enjoy it. It's a nice game and helps to create a team effort. The goals are not that difficult, and some \\"levels\\" are harder than others, but the players are told which ones are easier and which ones are more difficult. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the final level was dissapointing. Otherwise, I do recommend this game.....for the ages I mentioned. I think children over 7 or 8 may not like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Princess Enchanted Journey","review":"I bought this game for my 3 yr young daughter for Christmas. She loves it. The animations are really good. The sound is excellent and everything works likes a charm.CONS: This game is only for girls under the age of 7.

Little did I realize my wife and I would have to play most of it for her. There are LONG sections where the player has to listen to background information and directions from a pixie -- in which our daughter quickly lost interest.Also, the game requires the player to direct the character's movements with the nunchuck and use the remote as her magic wand. Again, beyond our daughter's interest and skill level.She was extremely upset that she couldn't visit Belle, even after winning the game. (We recently discovered that you have to enter the secret code GASTON.)It took us 4, maybe 5 sessions to win the game (we did a chapter or two per night, based on our daughter's attention span), and haven't played it since.

Everytime we get to a part in the story line that has a mini game, we have to reset the game and start again. The pointer function of the wiimote will not work for the mini-games.

Except for the Bugs!","review":"My 4 year old loves this game, but it's got some serios problems that My 4 year old loves this game, but it's got some serious problems that prevent her from being able to play it without assistance. The most notably is the fact that if you have to use the Wii remote as a pointer it only works well if you are VERY close (with in 4 ft) of the sensor bar.This is not the case with any other Wii game that we have. This \\"bug\\" requires an adult to complete various tasks simply because the game's pointer is so finicky."},{"rating":"1","title":"too short","review":"Daughter loved the game but finished it in a couple of hours.

They loved the game play of Disney Princess: Enchanted Journey but it was over within 2 1/2 hours...and part of that included customizing their character before the game started.For $20 it might have seemed like a good purchase, but at twice the price it is a disappointment.Essentially, it would be a good game for very young children who have short attention spans, but any older than 5 or 6 and it's just not worth it.Hopefully Disney Friends for DS will provide more replay value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disaster Journey!!","review":"Like the title says, this game is a disaster!

Oh and if you need the Belle Unlock able here it is: LumiereI hope this bug would be fixed soon, as this is a wonderful game, just not too wonderful when it has bugs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Game","review":"I have a seven year old daughter and I had to pull her away from playing this game after awhile, she adores it.

I've been pushing the princess' forever and this did the trick... it was that good. It was challenging for her, but it taught her how to use the controls and she became a pro after 2 days. I went all out and bought her the smaller WII controller and it worked like a charm. The Numchuck is what puts the character in direction to walk and the actual controller is a magic wand. She dug it. Another one she can't get enough of (and we have zillions of these interactive games!) Is Michael Jackson The Experience. I'm telling you... goldmine for break time for momma.

These two are probably the only two games I am the happiest I bought the past 3 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game for a struggling kindergartner","review":"My daughter is 5, but she is a little slow to catch on sometimes(she's a little behind in kindergarten with letters, reading, etc). I read a review that said this game was way too easy for their daughter and that she had finished the game in 2 hrs. Well, it was perfect for my daughter. Some of the harder levels required my help - another great thing about the game - you can jump in as player 2 and the two of you run around together and you can help without her feeling like you're doing it for her. My daughter thought this was great fun and pretended we were best friends in the game.Each level is a story about a different princess, and once we finished that level, she was able to run around and interact with the story very easily without having to do tasks.Overall, this game is great for younger kids or kids with some learning disabilities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, but only for english princess?","review":"My little princess (5 yrs old) absolutely love this game, but i think the ntsc version should have at least, spanish and english languajes, someone have to be with her translating, not so good.

I saw it live at the Met at the premier performance and was absolutely thrilled. This very fresh, imaginative staging brings this extraordinary Mozart masterpiece to life.As an elementary school music educator, I have used this HD performance in the classroom as an introduction to the genre. We spend a few classes studying the story and discussing what opera is so that the students understand everything, and then show the film. They absolutely love it! With top-notch artistry, it is an invaluable resource.It is important to note that this is a cut version of the opera sung in English.

I saw the full German version of this production the year it debuted and it was amazing. Unfortunately, the MET has only released their holiday version in English (this item). I taped the PBS broadcast of the full-opera in German and have it saved on my DVR, but I'd like to have it on DVD.

Don't miss it!","review":"This production of The Magic Flute just plain blew me away! I've seen six others and this one is by far the best! The costumes and sets are magical, just what this fantasy opera requires. The English translation is true to the story and fits the music perfectly. Further, the diction of all the singers was clear as a bell.There are no weak links in the cast; all were superb. But, I particularly loved Nathan Gunn's athletic Papageno and Matthew Polenzani's Tamino. Erika Miklosa's Queen of the Night was likewise wonderful, including her negotiations of her elaborate costumes. The only off key notes of the opera were rather endearing, coming from the high notes of the three young boys, called \\"spirits\\" in this English production.I think Mozart would love this version. I know I'll watch this again and again. This would be a great gift for a Mozart fan. I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter disappointment!","review":"Utter disappointment! Second class singers (by own MET standards, with the exception of Pape as Zarastro), noisy and visually distracting production (although it has its moments of magic, impossible to avoid with any Magic Flute anyway...), public clapping after every single number (looks like we are in a circus presentation), and worse of all: a mutilated, harmonic disgruntled overture. OK, I agree that is interesting to produce an easy-to-listen-to opera to captivate new audiences, but why Mr. Levine has agreed to cut so drastically the overture is beyond my comphehension. One additional issue: for those who know this beloved opera by heart, listening to Tamino, Pamina and company speaking English seems quite disconcerting. In summ: if we had the complete (with due repetitions) overture I would give a second star. As it is, one star is still too much for the disappointment that this version brings to our ears, eyes and hearts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly constructed","review":"The latching mechanism is cheaply constructed.

I read it twice. Once, years ago when it was still believed to be true, and it had much more of an impact on me then. The second time it sort of left me feeling duped.

The end is a little confusing, but readers will get the idea. In the book, Kirk does not act like the adventurous Kirk we all know.

It reads like 20 chapters plucked out of the middle of a larger book. In a true trilogy, each novel stands on its own. Not so here; Mr. Shatner and his publishers are too obviously milking a \\"trilogy\\" for the profits provided by 3 books instead of the one larger book that it really is.

The story line is twisted the characters well developed, and the anticipation kept at a high level throughout. I read it in 2 1/2 hours.

A secret organization in Starfeet, a hollographic crew on a star ship, and the dark yet sensitive side of Garak are just a few of the things that disappointed me. It is really beginning to amaze me just how many people from the original series have cheated death to survive in this era of Star Fleet. The Reeves duo may have given Shatner some suggestions on the writing of this book, but they sure didn't want their names on the cover and I don't blame them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plot twists...mmm","review":"I believe this was an excellent continuation of Spectre.

Can't wait for the next one... later everyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Continuity, but no real plot","review":"I anxiously awaited this sequel to Spectre, but I was unfortunately disappointed. This book is very obviously the middle of a trilogy. At the conclusion of the book, I was left with \\"What was the point?\\" Nothing of any substance seemed to happen in the entire novel. Rather, it seemed to me to be 303 pages of pure exposition. I hope that Preserver makes up for it...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark Victory (Star Trek)","review":"I have to say that I did enjoy this book, but was very dissappointed at the lack of content as well as story line. I have read all of the Shatner books, but this one feels like a very incomplete section of a much larger story. I don't mind series books, but they should at least have somewhat of a complete story line of thier own. This one does not and leaves you feeling very much like you have just watched a movie trailer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived and pedestrian","review":"Clearly the middle book in a series, this book seemed more than a little contrived on many levels. Is it really necessary to combine characters from four different Star Trek series (the original, TNG, DS9, and Voyager)? Kate Janeway, especially, seems to be present merely to lend her name to the book. Her presence doesn't seem to impact the story in any way, and it her role really isn't well defined. Its almost like she's included merely to tie Voyager into the mixture. Maybe some of this disjointedness results from the location in the series, as the book really doesn't stand well on its own.The writing is pedestrian, and the characters feel a bit flat and predictable. While some of the dialog does recall the amusing banter of the original crew, that really is about the only highlight in an otherwise mediocre work. This certainly hasn't inspire me to go out an find the other books in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest books in the world!","review":"This book was one of the greatest books I've ever read. William Shatner has become my favorite author. I can not explain in words how good this book was. I would have given it 6 stars if it had been possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another excellant writing by William Shatner.","review":"As usual, William Shatner does credit to the ever-growing legend that is Captian Kirk. The story has alot of interesting turns and twists that will keep readers to the edge of their seats, or up in their beds till the book is finished. The reason that my rating was only four stars wasn't because of the book itself, it was because like most other fans, I immediately wanted to open up the sequel to this one and finish the story. Sigh, maybe we should mail William Shatner some candles or something like that so he can burn some midnight oil."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost but not quite","review":"Almost, but not quite perfect. Though, this is a departure from \\"Kirk, the superhero\\" as shown in the last couple of novels, we still see Kirk as the embodiment of all that makes Star Trek enjoyable. Shatner not only has a firm grasp on what makes Kirk tick, but does justice to all ST:TNG and other Star Trek incarnation characters. Unlike Paramount Pictures, he doesn't draw a line in the sand seperating the two generations, forcing fans to choose between which is the better show. Perhaps the big wigs and decision makers will take a look at the success of this and other Shatner Star Trek novels and use one of his books as a treatment for the next movie. Its starting to look like they are running out of good ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"William Shatner needs to let Kirk die!","review":"William Shatner has once again brought James T Kirk back from the dead. What was he thinking?Dark Victory had such promise to it, yet held absolutely no substance. His previous novel had tremendous intrigue and a fascinating story line, but when I began reading this one; I felt as if I was reading drivel. The characters just sat there - Does the world really have to revolve around Kirk? I think NOT!Picard, Riker, Troi, Data - WHERE WERE THEY? Mirror Janeway? She had a huge roll last time, but she was barely noticeable. And I mean no disrespect to the late DeForest Kelley (who will be sadly missed) but Bones is far to old to be running around on missions.William Shatner needs to let Kirk go!

It covers the origins of the original five X-Men (Angel, Beast, Cyclops, Iceman, and Marvel Girl) and their first missions under their wheelchair-bound leader Professor X. Although The Essentials version of this book features twice as many issues from the series, this one is a much better quality book, including the cover, the color inking, the paper itself, and even an introduction by the inventor of the X-men himself. What's more, once you're done with this one, you can follow it up with Vol. 2, which includes issues # 11-20.

The author doesn't skirt the truth about pirates and privateers, but doesn't write in such a way as to turn off the squeamish. Action abounds as the crew faces one encounter after another.

And what's great about this single is that Donna gets treated to big room anthem mixes by a variety of great remixers including Rosario, Baez, and LEX. Unfortunately, there are a few promo mixes that were left off this single, including a Richard Vission mix, which would have been more welcome than en EDIT of the LEX mix which is already included in its full version. Not to mention--why do we get an edit of the original mix, considering it's not available anywhere else???

Donna's vocals are perfection! I love her abiblity to belt out a tune as well as soften a lyric when the words and music call for it. The best mix here is the Ralphi Rosario mix by far. The Eddie Baez mix had to grow on me. Although it's slower than Rosario's, I still like it. The LEX mix does not get my attention. I'm not loving that one!

If you are using windows, make sure you disable autorun on your cdrom drive (hold down the shift key when you load your disk, or look for instructions on the web for a permanent fix through windows registry). If you fail to do this, loading the disk in your computer will automatically install scumware on your computer without your consent.The album itself is excellent, and I think anyone who enjoyed the first album will enjoy this one as well.

You can hear the influences (Echo and the Bunnymen, the Cure, etc.), but the sound is still original and fresh. \\"Love and Longing\\" is a great tune to start with and easily holds its own with all those great 80's anthems those who grew up then know and love.

Witness the huge success of The Killers and Interpol right across Europe.Unlike many other acts, they have managed to combine commercial melodies without falling into soft rock cliches, a la Robbie Williams. There is very little filler on the album and its melange of soaring guitars, synths and very 80s Brit Alternative vocals is great.

The music was nice, the speeds were good, and when they could start seeing further away, the lambs were very calming for them.But now that they are 4 and 1/2 months old, they are bored with it. The lambs floating above their heads just aren't cutting it for them. When we visited some family, my girls used a Fisher Price Flutterbye Dreams swing, and they absolutely loved it!

It does a good job of toasting two slices of bread or a split muffin or the like. It also cooks an egg, warms precooked breakfast meat and delivers the finished sandwich parts simultaneously, hot and ready to assemble. I don't have to use the stove or microwave and clean up a pan and spatters. Since my house is on the market and I need to leave it pristine each morning when I leave for work this is an extra boon."},{"rating":"2","title":"good new item","review":"Well I like a nice round egg to fit exactly on my English muffin. The egg comes out with a little practice and lots of oil or butter perfectly cooked and just the right size. The Muffin however comes a little burned on the bottom if you want to cook top and bottom slices together, but I am a purist and few toasters can do any better, except for toaster over I have that is 50 plus years old. I generally cook my bacon via the microwave, the muffin in my other toaster oven and the egg in this gadget. It also warms pre-cooked meat with the egg very nicely if you want a ham and egg, e.g., sandwich. I admire it even with the drawbacks"},{"rating":"2","title":"1-Year of good use","review":"We have this unit - loved it for the first year but now we have to hold the lever down to make it work. Thinking of buying a new one but wished I would have saved warranty information to see if is still covered but most small appliances have a short-warranty life. Egg can stick in cup but found it worked well to put olive oil in dish and then pouring it back out (to coat it evenly). Loved the top-shelf dishwasher safe pieces and wide slots that will accommodate bagels as well as bread and English muffins. Gave it a 4 only because it lasted us a year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short lived","review":"I received this toaster as a wedding shower present, I loved it at first. We could make the egg sandwiches you buy at fast food places, healthier and cheaper. It was wonderful.Problem is, the toaster one day died. Nothing on it worked, the computer was done. I tried contacting the company only to find out that the email they list on their site is no longer valid and the phone number gets you no where. We ended up throwing this thing out just under a year of owning it.I almost bought another one thinking it was a fluke but then read the reviews of some other people and found out it was a common problem. Some people had bought two and had both of them die. I will never buy this again because it didn't last long enough and the company doesn't seem to care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toaster didn't work even on the first day of use!","review":"I bought this as a gift. I was so disappointed when I found out that the toaster part didn't even work the first time they tried to use it. The egg poacher worked great, but if half of the appliance is non-functional then what's the point? It seems a lot of people had this problem. I doubt exchanging it will even result in a functional toaster based on other reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the office","review":"Just got this for the kitchen at my office. Today was the first time I used it and I am impressed. Easy to use, easy to clean. Egg cooked perfectly.

For the price, you can't beat it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It didn't last!!!!","review":"Let me start by saying I would have rated this item highly if I had reviewed it when my husband gave it to me. I loved it and it did the job. It was convenient and saved me time in the morning. However after about 4-5 months the egg portion stopped working and shortly after, the toaster stopped working as well. I called the company and they couldn't do anything for me. So I turned to amazon and was considering purchasing another one but after reading the reviews and realizing a lot of other people had the same problem I decided to go back to a regular but yet realiable toaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great while it lasts","review":"The unit is great as long as it lasts. My egg poacher lasted for around 6 months and the toaster 6 months past that. Unfortunately no other company makes a comparable product. There are two other brands but both are owned by Back to Basics. I will buy a new one and hope that a company that has a quality control department starts putting out a similar product before this unit craps out as it appears is standard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best thing in the morning","review":"This thing is great. Makes an Egg Mc Muffin almost as good as the real thing. It is fast and easy to clean. My only problems with it are the egg always has to much water on it when it is cooked, so I have to dry the cooked egg with a paper towel. Also the toast is always cold by the time the egg is fully cooked.

Made nice toast and made it easy to poach an egg. Then after less than 12 months of use, it would only make eggs. Toaster side quit. Not so sure we want to buy a new toaster every few months. Makes no sense at all. If you buy this toaster, enjoy it while it works. Take a picture of it working too. The picture will out last the toaster so you will be able to look back on the good old days when you were able to make toast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!","review":"I loved this toaster... for the 1 month it worked! We used it almost daily, although we couldn't eat at the same time. We were enamored with the novelty of it all. Then it stopped working completely!(The electric control panel on the side mediates every function and once that goes out you can't even make toast.) Leaving us with no hot toast for our homemade jam during breakfast. It was supposed to have warranty for a year, but Back to Basics is hard to contact and won't respond to emails. Amazon has no return policy that covers items that break either. I ended up buying a Cuisinart toaster from Costco, and a stove top egg poacher that works even better in the same amount of time with double the output, so we won't ever be caught toast-less again! Now I have to find a way to recycle this worthless hunk of plastic. Buy this item only if you have time and money to waste replacing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT IDEA, VERY POOR QUALITY","review":"Purchased this toaster for my new apartment in order to make quick and easy breakfast egg sandwiches. For first few months this toaster worked as promised, however, after about 4 months the egg cooker broke and is not longer functioning. I guess something \\"burned out\\" and now only the toaster works. I have read someone else had the same problem and thought it's an isolated case, I was wrong.The overall quality of this toaster is poor and I do not expect to be using it much longer. Plan to replace it with the Breville CT70XL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad toaster","review":"I'll be returning this. One side of the toast (the side facing the center of the unit) is much much darker than the other side. If it can't even make toast properly, who needs it? Also, the slots are even narrower than my Hamilton Beach, so I have to cut off even more from wide breads. If this unit really were \\"Back to Basics,\\" maybe it would just make decent toast, but it doesn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Egg-celent","review":"Take that McDonalds!!

It does what it says and poaches the egg and toasts the muffin at the same time. They both finish together too.I haven't tried hard boiling the eggs yet, but the feature looks easy enough.The poaching pan itself is a bit flimpsy so you do have to be gentle with it.The only negative I have is that the toaster openings are not adequate to fit a bakery bagel (as stated on the box). It is fine for english muffins and bread, but not bagels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for making a quick healthy breakfast","review":"I can't cook. At all. I've burned water.I've been getting tired of eating nothing but cereal for breakfast every morning, and wanted a better and more healthy solution. This Egg and Muffin toaster is a great solution, and it's easy to use. Just put in the muffin (whole grain of course,) put 2.5 tbsp water in the bottom, spray the egg pan with Crisco, put in the egg and break the yolk, put the slice of canadian bacon on top, then hit the \\"egg & toast\\" button and push it down.You'll end up with a nice \\"Egg McMuffin\\"-type sandwich, which is a great quick breakfast in the morning. I've had it for a few months and it's still working just fine.Only complaints...I wish the metal heating thing was removable, and the other parts were easier to clean. That's it though, really.I wish it were a bit cheaper as well, as the price fluctuates between $30 and $50."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fancy things do not work","review":"The product arrived on time in good packaging and was easy to open and set up. Unfortunately the egg function did not work. The toasting function worked. Maybe it was good that the poaching function did not work because if that part did heat up the plastic parts covering the poaching chamber may have had a chance to melt. The idea of the product is great but the design and construction is not. Maybe I was unlucky with the one bad piece - but I dont think the thing would last too long. Returned it and will get an pure toaster instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst toaster ever","review":"This is the worst toaster we have ever owned!

I was really pleased at a company supporting their product so easily.I have had this toaster for a few months and it is just as bad as the first one. Burnt toast at any setting. Usually only on one side of the toast but the smell lingers and I am pretty tired of scraping toast. If I stand there and set it on the lightest setting and watch it, then I can get light toast on one side and no toasting on the other side.Very disappointing. Clearly some manufacturing error continues to plague these toasters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Egg Muffins!","review":"The first one I bought did not work, toaster lever would not stay down, but the replacement ( sent overnight ) worked great.

I think we got about 10 uses out of the egg poacher before that died in September. It just turned off and wouldn't heat. Granted, we had no problems with the Teflon coating like others have complained about before it died, but perhaps that's because it didn't last long enough to cause us trouble.

It probably best to just get a scraper and scrape the whole pan clean so you won't get it in your egg. A few months ago, the egg poacher stopped working, so I had an expensive toaster - now the toaster has stopped working, so I have nothing. I would expect a product this expensive to have better durability. Most toasters last more than 5 years, never mind one year. I guess you pay a premium for the 'idea' of an egg toaster (no doubt patented so no one else can actually build it more reliably). I am considering buying a new one, (since the price went down $10 from when I bought it), but I'm not convinced it will last any longer than the old one.

Highly recommend!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy!","review":"It's a handy appliance that can multi-task. I have to agree with those that say that it's kind of cheaply made though. A lot of the pieces for the egg poaching/heating up pre-made food are made out of plastic. These are exposed to a lot of heat (from steam) and I don't know how long they'll last. So far none of it is showing signs of wear. The bottom part for the poacher where water should go is chrome plated. After one use it's already speckled with tarnish. Maybe this is normal wear and tear, but I'm very picky with my things and would like them to stay in pristine condition. For the price, I say it's worth it. It looks good and the toaster works great. But I really wish it would've been made better so it'll last longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great egg muffin sandwiches!","review":"This device is perfect if you like Egg Muffin sandwiches for breakfast... putting them together is a breeze! (I've been making them daily for my husband for 3 years!) This unit was a replacement for the first one which lasted 3 years under daily use and finally became unreliable in cooking the eggs and toasting at the same time... I had to resort to doing each stage individually. So I bought the replacement since it's a great feature that the unit can adjust how fast it toasts to have both toasting and poaching the eggs be ready at the same time.It's a reasonably priced item so I feel it's a great value, even with the replacement need.Shipping was quick, product arrived in great shape."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"Back to basics TEM599 Egg and Muffin toaster:Although this is a great idea, the produce is cheaply made and does not hold up.

But it only did it twice. Then the non-stick coating on the egg-poaching cup started to peel off. \\"Oh, that's not a big deal,\\" you say. Well, it's actually a rather big deal indeed. The teflon stuff doesn't just peel off all at once, and you can't just scrape off the \\"iffy\\" part and then be done with it. No, every time you make eggs, from now until eternity, little chunks of teflon will come off and attach themselves to your otherwise-perfect egg.This is a very serious design flaw. I tried a workaround (putting in a piece of foil in the cup) but it doesn't work (the eggs don't cook through, if you're wondering, and there's no way to adjust for it).I'm going to call the company and see if they have functional replacements.

Then the egg part stopped working - we'd probably had it a little over a year. We kept it around as a toaster - it's never been a great toaster - you always need to stick the english muffins in twice to get them brown, even at the highest setting, but it's all right. Now last weekend, the toaster quit, too. Toasters are fairly simple; it shouldn't be necessary for them to just up and die one day.

I thought the three in one was the way to go. After trying to poach eggs & toast the third time and it would not warm up, I contacted focus Electrics and they replied with a order number. I have tried to reach them over 5 times and they have never replied. Get a basic toaster and save yourself the hassle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously, they really do break","review":"I ignored the reviews saying this was defective because i was so in love with the idea. Mine worked perfect ... for about three months, then died. During that time, I bought one for a friend and it was non-functional right out of the box. When you open the box, btw, there's a notice that begs you to contact the manufacture instead of the vendor if/when the device breaks -- presumably so that places like Amazon don't stop carrying the product. Judging from the reviews, this thing has been sold defective for years. Please don't continue to reward this company with new purchases."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful acquisition","review":"We got this thing last week.It came broke from the store and doesn't work when plugged on the wall.We are returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete piece of junk","review":"I thought this appliance was great for the 10-12 times I actually used it to cook eggs and toast muffins at the same time. But most of the time I just used it as a toaster. I have only had it for about a year maybe, and it will still cook eggs, but the toaster no longer works. So it no longer serves its purpose of being able to do both at once when you want to, so it is going to the dumpster. And unfortunately I didn't mail in my warranty card so it was a waste of money. I will never buy a back to basics product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sizzling","review":"We received this product for our wedding about a year ago. Yesterday I put in a piece of toast, as I always do, and went to get ready for work. Several minutes later the fire alarm was sounding and the kitchen was filled with smoke. The toaster had short circuited or something and never released the piece of toast. It worked fine for the year we used it, but it was not worth the awful smell in our house and the cost of having to replace it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over Hyped","review":"Honestly, this product is definitely overhyped. The egg tray is difficult to clean if it gets dirty, and the design just isn't very seamless. The extra pieces are stored oddly. I'd prefer a traditional toaster. Also, when I have used the egg feature, even using the proper measurements the eggs have been under-cooked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great....until \\"Eggstinction\\" struck!","review":"Everything worked great on this interesting little device for about a year, then the egg cooker just stopped working. It's like the heating element in that part went out. And I only used that part of the machine about 10 times. Bummer.I kept it simply for the toaster because that part still worked, but that kind of defeats the purpose of buying it in the first place. No more egg sandwiches for me!I thought about replacing it with another, but why? I think I will just buy a regular toaster next time because that's all this device ended up being. It's still on my kitchen counter now, and it stands as a constant reminder of a great idea that didn't really pan out. lolNot worth re-purchasing.Happy hunting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love this","review":"Great invention, bought this for my dad who's 67 and can't boil water... I know he can not live only on what this makes, but I feel good knowing he can now make himself a little something.I spray the small tray with \\"I can't believe it's not butter\\" spray for the no after taste of pam and he can now have something when he's starving.Great idea I'll probably get one for home, for my boys..."},{"rating":"1","title":"About 5 wonderful uses before it broke","review":"For $29.99 at the time, I was very happy with the toaster. I used an demo'ed it a couple times, with toast, poached eggs, hardboiled eggs, and bfast sausage. All came out great and even.However, tried to turn it on this morning and, like many other reviews noted, the egg portion wouldn't heat up any more.I read some horror stories about replacement issues, but I must say the customer service (the number is in the book) was wonderful. I spoke with Maggie and she had me setup with a replacement in under 3 minutes flat.I'll come back and update this review after I get some use out of the replacement hopefully."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disposable","review":"Great product while it lasts. I've had two of these and both conked out short of one year--egg doesn't cook right, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Product","review":"This is a great product that really works and is surprisingly well made. One thing I will say is that the toast adjustment is a little on the lighter side so if you like your toast really dark, you may have to run it through twice. Making each feature operate independently or together was a smart move too. Great item!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast and easy","review":"This is an easy way to make a decent, hot breakfast instead of my usual cold cereal. The toaster doesn't burn the bread no matter how high I turn up the settings, which is great. The egg poacher doesn't make the most appetizing-looking egg (which is why it gets 4 stars), but it tastes better than it looks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tasty, easy to prepare breakfast sandwich!","review":"We needed a new toaster so thought we would give this toaster/breakfast sandwich maker a try. It did take us few times to get the consistency of the egg correct. I then marked the line on the water cup so I can make a sandwich without trying to read the cup everytime I use it. The sandwich comes out perfectly. Very tasty, english muffin, egg and ham are all done at the same time. Makes breakfast preparation easy..This product was a great choice for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent toaster","review":"This is such a great toaster.

When it worked, I used it all the time. I should have taken it back, but thought, \\"What's the use?\\" I can only give it one star, because I wasn't through eating those great poached eggs on English muffins."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good buy, breat toaster","review":"Because I value the opinions of those who take the time to share reviews, I want to give a positive review for this toaster.It does well on all sizes and thicknesses of bread or bagels. It browns well. And the egg-poaching feature works quite well!It's not the best looking toaster I have ever seen (because of the poacher) but I would buy it again. I find the poacher a handy gadget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this toaster !","review":"I bought this toaster and use it quite often.

It was very easy to use and make perfect breakfast sandwiches. However, the teflon is a serious health concern, and as others have mentioned, will flake off. For my family's health, this is unacceptable. Please re-manufacture with safe materials (I know easier said that done - just like all the Made in China complaints)!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful quality toaster","review":"Received this toaster as a christmas gift last year. Within the first thirty days it had completely failed. Now, to give credit to the manufacturer, they shipped us a new one and we didn't even have to ship the old one in. They just sent the new one. But this should have been the indication that all wasn't well. The second one only cooked three or four eggs before the egg cooking portion quit working. We didn't try to warranty it again because we decided it wasn't worth it. Just last week, however, it also quit making toast and went in the trash. Be aware -- you aren't getting a good device here."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was great...until it died.","review":"I bought this toaster a few years ago based on the great reviews. It toasted bread really well (didn't really care for the egg poacher) for about a year and a half until it suddenly stopped working. I'm still not really sure what happened since I only used it about once a week at most. I ended up getting rid of it, unfortunately."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Good Toaster But Doesn't Last","review":"This is handy to have for a quick breakfast but honestly it will only last a year tops.

It did a fantastic job. However, the next morning, I went to use it and only the toaster part would work. I did nothing rough to this appliance-- and it seems sturdy enough. Yet it no longer works. I am rather disappointed. Oh well, it still toasts bread... which I guess is what a toaster is really supposed to do anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWESOME....then it will break.","review":"I really enjoyed this product... while it lasted. Sadly the old adage \\"you get what you pay for\\" applies. It lasted for 7 glorious egg mc muffin-like months THEN it just stopped working. The warranty had expired and I could no longer enjoy the egg goodness. I thought it was unusual and possibly a fluke but after some research I found out that this products failure is quite common. I contacted the company to no avail they did/would not reply. SO in conclusion, great idea, terrible implementation. Oh and USE NON-STICK SPRAY! The low price clearly does not allow for teflon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Toaster + Egg Poacher Stopped Working","review":"The toaster is bad because it toasts one side more than the other, the slots are too shallow for most bread (even sideways) and too narrow for bagels (so basically it is only good for English muffins).Also, right on cue after the 30 Amazon warranty expired, the egg poacher stopped working completely, so I'm SOL.Very cheaply made, poor design, and poor execution.Do yourself a favor and just toast your English muffins to your desired darkness while frying an egg in a pan or poaching it however you do it. Instead of something that does both this product does neither."},{"rating":"1","title":"Down with this toaster and egg poacher!!!","review":"the unit worked fine for the first month....then, out of nowhere, the egg poacher part just stopped working.....i only used the unit 3 times before it broke...it was fine until that point..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Close but no cigar","review":"We are now preparing to send the second Egg N' Muffin Toaster back to Amazon. The first one stopped poaching eggs after just 5 days. Amazon replaced it quickly with no questions asked. The replacement arrived in three days by FedEx. Right out of the box, the egg portion of the machine once again did not work... not even once. After going through the accompanying manual thoroughly to make sure it was not \\"operator error\\", I'm preparing to box this up and get a refund, not a replacement.

The eggs came out perfect, either boiled or poached. It worked well while it lasted. After about one year, the toaster part broke after I turned it over to dumped the crumbs out. I kept it for a while longer to use the egg part of it. I decided to get another one since I still needed a toaster. Worked great for another year and it failed on me again.

Then the egg poacher died completely. Then it became just a toaster with a useless appendage. Then about a week after that, the toaster decided that no one deserves brown toast; it only liked the \\"lightly toasted\\" setting and no matter how high I pushed the lever, to get the toast to be even a little brown I had to toast it 2 to 3 times. Finally, yesterday it started making a wierd high whining noise when it was plugged in. My advice: poach your eggs the old-fashioned way and buy another toaster. Which I am just about to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twice burned","review":"My husband loves his egg and muffins, they are easy to make and a good weekend treat. The egg part only gets used on weekends, the toaster a little more often.When our first egg poacher burned out after about eighteen months, we decided it was worth replacing.

I used it right away. No more going to McDonalds if I want an Egg McMuffin as I can do it myself in less than 5 minutes. Not only that but now I can also make Hard Boiled eggs in about 5 minutes and that just makes it quicker as well if I want to make Egg Salad. Not sure if it says it in the description but you can make Egg Muffin sandwiches, Boiled Eggs, poached eggs and even a solid scrambled egg as well.

No, they aren't perfect: the eggs are a bit rubbery. But I love that I can prepare an organic, whole grain muffin with an egg rich in omega-three fatty acids with so little hassle.

The only downside of the machine is it only makes one at a time if it made two at a time would be even better!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dont worry, McDonalds wont go out of business","review":"I got this nifty egg/toaster for Christmas and have used it for exactly 4 hard boiled eggs and 7 egg sandwiches on english muffins. It works well and as described. Once you master the amount of water to be added, its very simple. I also found that I can use the meat warming tray to separate the yolk from the egg whites and it works pretty well. I have moved the toaster function to medium so the machine may toast on the light side. Only a factor if you like your toast burned to \\"cancer\\" black.As stated before, its not exactly like McDonalds, but you can use your own recipes and get things tasting how you like them. All in all I think its a great invention and am looking forward to breakfast tomorrow. If you really like Egg Macmuffins, think of the money youll save with this thing. It pays for itself very quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works great - for less than a year.","review":"Any review on here that was written before this toaster was owned for at least one year is irrelevant. We got this toaster for ourselves and loved it so much we got ones for my in laws and my brother in law too. For my brother in law, his stopped cooking eggs within a year. For my in laws - same thing. For us, it lasted a little over a year. Today, a little more than 3 years since we've been using this thing, it has now stopped toasting as well. No word on how my in laws' and brother in law's toasters are holding up. I anticipate that theirs will stop toasting some day soon. Seems to be a trend with this toaster.

I have a really hard time keeping the toast lever down to actually toast the bread, and when it does stay down, it pops up shortly after, not even browning the bread. (and yes i did adjust the toast level, yet nothing happened). As for the egg poacher, it does do a good job at cooking a scrambled egg, but thats it...it doesnt hard boil the eggs very well, and sadly, over all, i would not recommend this product. its too bad, because it would really help out alot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable","review":"This is a great design and a very useful appliance - when it is working.I like it so much, that I have purchased four of them in the last year or so, in hopes that the manufacturer will be able to build one that is reliable.No such luck; my latest worked three times before failing.

Unfortunately it lasted about three weeks before the toaster portion stopped working. I returned it for an even exchange, and still raved about it to other customers in the store. But the second one was no different. It may have lasted a week or two longer... but the same thing happened. The toaster just stops heating.I thought this product was the greatest thing in the world. It made english muffins a snap to prepare. I just wish it could have lasted longer. I considered trying a third, but the store had completely removed this product from its shelf. Not a good sign... so I opted for a basic model instead.If they ever figure out the problem... I would definitely try it again. But for now it's a no go.

The egg portion works fine, but one morning it just wouldn't toast. I also wasn't impressed w/ the hard boiled egg function. Even though I pierced the eggs according to the instructions, they still cracked and oozed outside of the shell. Boiling the eggs the old fashioned way would be much cleaner. I would NOT recommend this toaster unless you want to replace it right away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, just one flaw I've found","review":"I have used this toaster at least three times a week for over a month now and really love it. The egg always comes out perfectly cooked, the Canadian bacon is always piping hot and I even put the cheese directly on the bacon and this unit makes it perfectly melted and gooey. The only issue I have is after every use some brown, nasty water seeps to the metal pan at the very bottom and this piece isn't removable, making it difficult to clean. I've found that using the scrubby side immediately after use is best. The preparation takes 60 seconds, everyone has that time in the morning, I set it up, wrap it in a paper towel and roll. If you like egg mcmuffins, do yourself a favor and get this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"WORKS GREAT!","review":"I bought one of these for myself about 6 months ago and I love it. I was looking to create the equivalent of egg/muffin sandwiches offered at the local fast food restaurants but without so much fat content. I use lowfat english muffin, egg, pre-cooked breakfast turkey sausage patties, and low fat cheese. This works so well and so fast I bought 2 more as Christmas gifts for my sons. The only draw back I had is it doesn't cook egg substitute well, I had to put it in a custard cup and stick it in the microwave to finish cooking it, so I only use real eggs in it now. I highly recommend it, if you have 2 or more people you may want to buy the one that cooks two at a time, it's a litlle more money but faster than cooking one at a time"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really wondered if this would work---cooking the egg and the toast at the same time---and it does!","review":"Follow the directions and you will have a perfect poached egg and toasted bread.

If it takes much more time to make than a bowl of cereal, it's out. He's just a no-fuss kind of guy. When I saw this item, I figured it would be right up his alley. It's very easy to use. We've had it for almost 2 months now and used it with no problems. The toaster side does lock in place so it prevents you from getting things ready for the egg, but that's not a huge deal. The item works as advertised, and I'd definitely recommend it to anybody who thinks they'd get a lot of use out of it. If I didn't have egg allergies, I'd use it all the time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool idea","review":"I don't like the fact that this is made out of plastic. The funny thing is that my egg tray is made out of plastic, which means that my poached eggs are cooking in all the chemicals and odors you smell when you open the box. I read a review that indicates the tray that holds the egg itself is made of metal, but mine is made out of plastic. Does anyone have more information about this? I wonder if there are different models/versions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works for 3 to 6 months then fails","review":"The toaster keeps working but the egg cooker fails due to poor electronic components.

Had I written a review right away, I would have given it 5 stars. Fact is, when it works, it works beautifully...perfect poached eggs, even though the timer is a little weird and the toast never seems to be done with the eggs. Problem is that only one short day after the return date, the egg poacher completely quit working for no reason! I took very good care of this appliance! I enjoyed a nice breakfast from it just the day before and the next day....no eggs!

We were disappointed when it arrived and the egg cooker didn't work. I called the company and then sent another one, no questions asked, without having to send the first in.Now we use it everyday to make delicious and healthy sandwiches. The only complaint is that the toaster doesn't make toast very dark, even on the highest setting, but it isn't bad, and you can put the toast in twice if it really bothers you. I would recommend this to everyone to make simple and delicious sandwiches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent results!","review":"You end up with a Mickey-D's-quality sandwich in about 10 minutes, including set-up and clean-up. I haven't tried the 4-egg boiler, but I imagine it would be quicker than preparing a pan, etc. The toaster works well for bread, bagels, what-have-you, and lets you get creative over and above the usual recipe. The little pans are a bit awkward to position, and it needs a holder for the little measuring cup, not to mention a cover/guard for the little spike designed to pierce the boiled eggs! Despite these tiny complaints, I love this piece!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You want a good breakfast?","review":"I really love the concept of this toaster. I can make eggs and toast at the same time, with little hassle at all! This product is so easy to use! I got this as a gift for one of my friend's mom because her toaster had recently broken. I know they like to have a hearty breakfast and eat eggs frequently. They prefer poached, while a prefer scrambled. But you can do both in this toaster! And hard boil them! And thaw meat! It is a cute and convenient size and works like a charm and is super quick! Thanks for the product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love, love, love it!","review":"With any food making product, you have to try it a few times to get your settings the way you want it. I was able to make the fluffiest egg mcmuffin ever. The toaster works perfect. For the egg, I used both a scrambled jumbo egg and egg beaters. Both come out perfect. The egg can be a tad wet because of the steam but I just place it on a paper towel to take that away. I took away a star for the hard boiled egg function. While it worked, it just wasn't comparable to boiling an egg on the stove. Maybe I'll try a few more times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective","review":"I purchased this item about 6 months ago. From day one the egg poacher did not work. It would not get hot. Too much of a pain to try to send back. So I had to use it just as a toaster. The toaster worked fine up until about a week ago when I tried to toast some bread and the lever would not stay down. It kept popping back up. If I kept trying it would finally stay down and toast my bread. I threw it away today because no matter how much I kept trying, the lever would not stay down. This toaster only lasted for about 6 months if you do not count the egg poacher which never worked at all. I would not recommend this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice hot breakfast at home","review":"This is a great product. We have used it almost every day since we got it a month ago. The only complant I have is I wish the toaster setting could go higher. It is fine for toast. But for english muffins on the highest setting it does not get brown enough for us, so we have to cook it a little bit longer after the egg is done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Changed my mind","review":"I loved this little appliance when I first got it.

My husband who is a consummate pessimist loves the machine. A little advice: a) don't bother to 'cut' the yolk b) if you like your eggs a litte runnier add less water and pull the pan earlier. c) use Pam or some spray for the egg pan and hand wash (you can even wipe it clean)to avoid the noted peeling of the Teflon. Don't get me wrong, there are flaws. The toast finishes before the egg sometimes and that can bother some but all in all, this is a great machine. Don't bother with the Paula Deen model either. My friend bought it, being the southern woman she is, yo support Paula and we noticed the only thing different between our models was the color and a signature. I respect Paula but not enough to pay $10 more for a toaster!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So glad I purchased this item","review":"After reading some of the reviews, I decided to purchase this item, and I am so glad I did. Makes the best eggs I ever tasted. I mainly use the egg substitutes, so if it can make those taste good, imagine what it does to a regular egg. It takes some getting used to how long to cook the eggs, but that depends on whether you are cooking 1 or 2 servings at a time. The toaster portion actually holds the toast down to keep warm until your egg is done."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed in Amazon.com","review":"We ordered 3 of these items for Christmas presents, 6 WEEKS AHEAD OF TIME, just to find that they NEVER SHOWED UP!!

Hard boiled eggs without having to dirty a pot and keep a constant eye on the stove. My family loves it as well. Have had the in-laws down several times and they have breakfast sandwiches every morning.Definitely worth $30. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it doesn't have a bagel toasting feature which only toasts one side. Other than that it is a perfect addition to the kitchen. Also, make sure you put cooking spray in the egg pan. If you don't then the eggs will stick a bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best","review":"THIS IS MY SECOND ONE AND THERE THE BEST.

Having read both 'Lethal Marriage' by Nick Pron and 'Invisible Darkness' by Stephen Williams I think that this book paints the broadest picture of the whole case and is the most emotionally involving. I almost felt sorry for Karla after reading 'Deadly Innocence' until I read 'Invisible Darkness'. It's less trashy tabloid in style than 'Lethal Marriage' and less rigidlly centred on Karla's guilt than the Stephen Williams book (and I do think that she is dead guilty). It also helped to project an image of the victims as the likeable people they were, especially in the case of the third one, Kristen French.

After reading it several years ago I was stunned into silence for almost 10 days. I could barely speak... unable to understand how anyone could possibly sink as very low as Karly-Curls did.

It seemed like the manuscript was given to a monkey to type in for the digital version and then was quickly run through a spell checker.In addition, the overall organization of the book was poor.

Most of the puzzles have answers that made no sense whatsoever. For example, there was one where two robbers broke into a jewelry store. Despite the fact that no alarm went off and no police cars could be heard, one of the robbers turned to the other in the middle of the job told him that the police were coming. The other robber nodded his head and they both left. So how did Robber #1 know something was amiss? The answer: he was wearing his Walkman and was monitoring radio transmissions from the police station! Of course! It makes perfect sense! How could anyone not have gotten this?!? What a joke.

There are also some fairly easy ones here too, mixed in with the others. Unfortunately, there are also quite a few bad puzzles. By bad, I mean that either there is more then one solution that works (a good lateral thinking puzzle should have one obviously best answer), or the answers are so convoluted that no one but the author could ever possibly guess them. These answers required the addition of a lot of new information, neither stated nor hinted at in the puzzle.Like Sloane's lateral thinking puzzle books, this is a good book for reading in groups, with one person knowing the answer, and leading the others along."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse Puzzle Book Ever","review":"This is a very bad puzzle book.

This is certainly the best for its time and it would take a lot of improvements to make be buy another. I've bought a palm on avg. every 6 mos. But to the facts. The metal casing is a plus and adds to durability. The buttons are quite small and not really user friendly but thank god for the jog wheel. The screens is not the best but, the imaging is excellent none the less. One feature is the 20 ft range of the IR which makes the Clie remote its most unique feature and lots of fun at friends houses as well as you own especially if the wife keeps hiding the remote. I'm keeping this short due not being redunant."},{"rating":"2","title":"great, but one caveat","review":"I used a palm vx for about four years before upgrading to this sony. I first bought a toshiba e310 though to try out pocket pc. It was pretty, lots of features, and cheaper, but a few things were off. There handwriting recognition was good, but too sensitive, and too many steps to input a todo or an appointment. So, I went with this sony cause I wanted color and mp3 playing. So far, I love this thing. It is pretty, my photos appear beautifully on its screen. The battery hasn't been too bad for me. I might not use it as much as others, but I think i am normal and it lasts about four days. (but I haven't been playing mp3s) One thing to watch out for is that you need to buy a sony magic gate memory stick to play mp3s. I have a sandisk one which was significantly cheaper, and it won't play mp3s off of it. It will do everything else, but that. So, great display, great design, useful jog dial, but need to buy sony memory stick (needs to be magic gate)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning!","review":"After owning 3 Palms and one Pocket PC (... I kept dropping them), I bought but deeply regret buying a Clie. If you are a heavy user of \\"tasks\\" as I am, Clie's performance is so bad the PDA is unusable. When one makes any change in the task (...change date to \\"tomorrow\\"), there is about a 5 second delay. For all the Palms this was instantaneous. Change \\"priority\\"... same thing. Etc. This renders the Clie unusable.I will not complain about the fact the machine just flat stopped working after a month of use because I sent it in and they fixed it for free and quickly.

What is missing is that with Ellison's 'shadow management team', that was very devious from from start, they effectively destroyed one of the most successful management teams of the 90's and replaced it with the most inexperienced people possible. Additionally, Ellison continued to support Wohl even though he delivered some of the worst quality products in the industry and Ellison shipped them anyway. The most obvious statement that is way off target is when Ellison said he only lied once!! He consistently shipped products knowing there were major holes. The reality is that customers and employees do not trust or support the leadership of Oracle. A very bad sign for the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"No info about his early years","review":"I was very disappointed by this book because it has absolutely nothing about his early years. I wanted to read about what he was like growing up. Most of all I wanted to read about his early years in business and his rise to the top. Instead the author only describes Larry's business dealings around the year 2000. I didn't learn anything of value from this. I thought this book was a complete biography but it's not even a biography. I wanted to learn how a man can go from nothing to having one of the world's biggest yachts and billions of dollars. I got nothing from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Softwar","review":"In my opinion this book is poorly written. Compare the style to Walter tssacson's book on Steve Jobs.

What is troublesome is the poor editing - repeats of entire sections, stories, calling people by pronouns before mentioning their actual names, just a lot of confusion. The book didn't flow at all, which made it difficult to get into, let alone gain an understanding of Mr. Ellison.My takeawy is that Mr. Ellison is an ass, a tough guy, a soft heart, sensual, emotional...I think you get the idea. The author seems to focus on the firing of top execs, Mr. Ellison's wealth, and his boat racing. Somehow the author completely forgets to provide an \\"intimate portrait of\\" BOTH Larry Ellison and Oracle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not impartial...","review":"A pretty good book for Larry Ellison!! The book heaps praises on Ellison even when it is ridiculing his short sighted approach.Everybody nowadays tries to say that they saw the internet coming. The only people who probably saw it coming were those that never wanted to make money off it. Anyway, the book gives a background on how Oracle came about and is pretty candid in some areas about how it nearly broke apart. The book certainly fires up a readers imagination and takes them back to the heady internet boom times. Some parts of the book however read more like a script."},{"rating":"2","title":"Merry X'mas Larry","review":"I particularly enjoyed the pictures in this book -- especially the one when Larry was little holding his good brother. He continues to hold various things and people that are dear to his heart. I also like the fact that Larry starts to think about philanthropy, not just as competition to Bill Gates, but as something he wishes to take active control of. It is about time. Melanie Craft is beautiful, although I prefer her sleepy-eyed look in the past over her eyes-wide-open look nowadays.

OK, so disco-flavored dance music comes off as a little corny (as does the playboy association) but when it's done right with such style and thoughtfulness, it can be as irresistible as a fancy french pastry. this is a great collection for those of us who can't go clubbing every week any more, but want to stay in touch with the best new tunes. yah-boo to the nay-sayers. this guy is on top of his game."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"This CD is horrible.

The parents in the book fly away to a tropical location to bring home their baby, but the story works for any \\"we had to travel far to get you\\" type of adoption. It's a simple and sweet story that my 4 year-old daughter loves. It's even prompted her to ask questions about her birth.

The sights and sounds in this book will stay with me a long time.The story, Gorillas and Banana Beer, is a tale of hope in the face of no possible reason to hope, of a young man's discovery of a reason to live and give back when he found no life in our culture, of the bravery and strength and endurance of those who are trying to protect the children and gorillas.

It's more of a political thriller than a military study, so don't look for the rich battle scenes so prominent in the author's other book \\"Eagle in the Snow.\\" Both books are outstanding in their own way, however, and the initial \\"one-star\\" review seems way off the mark to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Historical Fiction","review":"The above reviewer is insane.

We are treated to a recitation of the ills of the client system, the problems of the protagonist in meeting his own minimal living requirements in Rome, and his failed friend. The brightest part of this elaborate introduction (8 chapters long) is the protagonist\\"s decision to take action to fix a failing aquaduct which gets him fired from his job in the water bureau. We also get a long description of his sexual reputation which blights his future.I had trouble reading this book in that I found my intrest wandering frequently. The outcome is no suprise and I must say I would not recommend it to anyone.

All the masterpieces of this great artist are illustrated and explained, following a clear chronology and putting them in the historical and social context in which they were created. High-quality texts (especially the analysis of Beckmann's influence on contemporary artists like P.Guston, or the recurrent presence and meaning of the mirror in his paintings) make this an indispensable work. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot album - Hot band!","review":"\\"Tango Fango\\" (1976). I have waited years for this to come out on CD. This is what was called in the 70's ACID JAZZ. This guys jam hard with jazz- rock -fusion. I have been a drummer since 1974 and Mani Neumeier is one of the best drummers ever-period! This talented band in all of it's different line-ups has always entertained for 30+years. They are still making new music today. Exellent guitar players throughout their history including Sepp Jandrisis and Ax Gernrich. Multi-talented Roland Schaeffer plays a mean soprano sax on this CD. Great guitar riffs and even a great pop-type song \\"Tomorrow\\" with some of the best vocals they ever recorded. They have loads of fun in the studio, and no other band in the world sounds like them. Check this CD out, and earlier ones for much heavier jams.-Jon"},{"rating":"2","title":"A definate for any Oz fan","review":"This book is great.

Having previously read Flatland, I was not keen on the idea of reading the sequel. My grade-conscious self got the better of me and I started to read the book. From the first chapter I was enthralled! Ian Stewart knew how to write and keep my attention. My parents had to threaten me so I would put it down so I could eat. (Imagine: a high schooler entranced in a MATH book!) I so totally recommend this book because I would have NEVER understood Mandelblot (er... Mandelbrot) nor would I have read on to discover a plethora of new dimensions (one and a quarter). I would recommend any person, avid mathematician or high schooler, to read this. It was easily understood and Ian Stewart is a fantastic writer! Too bad they didn't have ten stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable sequel","review":"This book is a sequel to Edwin Abbott's \\"Flatland\\" and makes its heroine a granddaughter of the hero of Abbott's book. Some people may find his playing with words excessive (his heroine is named \\"Victoria Line,\\" combining the fact that she is literally a geometric \\"line\\" with the name of a subway line in London) but the book manages to cover a lot of territory in an amusing manner. I can't say I _learned_ a lot from the book, because I already knew most of its subject matter, but I'd certainly encourage someone who wanted to learn about curved spaces and higher dimensions to read it. The ultimate accolade: _After_ I had read it from cover to cover, I bought a copy, just so I'd have it in my own library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flatterland, a remarkable sequel to a remarkable book.","review":"When I first read Flatland (the original) I was deeply inspired and fasinated by the 4th dimensional ideas it brought up. When I picked up a copy of Flatterland, I had hoped for an interesting read with maybe a few new concepts at best, but I certainly got more than I bargained for. Flatterland takes you on a journey through much more than just the 4th dimension (which is interesting enough already.) He takes you through non-Eucludean dimensions, the world of 1.25 dimensions, theoretical dimensions, and even a world of infinite dimension. Ian Stewart brilliantly plays on words and makes you laugh at every step of the way. The ideas brought up are so fasinating and cutting edge, that it definately deserves more than one reading, and better still, they are explained in detail so that even the most complex concepts are easily understood. This book is clever, amusing, and perhaps even brilliant. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended for light reading","review":"\\"Flatterland\\" would have been a fairly good read had it not been for the heavy-handed treatment of mathematics. That's saying a lot considering I was a physics/astronomy major in college. Don't get into this book unless you intend to spend some time with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Literature that makes me grind my teeth","review":"In this book agonizingly simple theories and bits of logic are spun into a web of mixed metaphors and frustrating wordplay that is tedious, confusing, incessant, and causes the reader to fixate and break his or her reading 'stride' every other sentance to translate into \\"Planiturthian\\".Entire chapters are devoted to simple mathmatical theories I recall from high-school algebra, which could be described to conclusion over the course of a brief paragraph (such as tacking an extra dimension onto a geometrical equation). After reading the first paragraph of any section and translating all the gibberish, your mind will leap to the logical conclusion about seven pages before the author does.This book offers little educational or entertaining rewards. Reading it is more of a test of determination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coat tails","review":"Abbott's Flatland is a work of genius. It's short, to the point and endlessly clever. I've probably reread it four or five times in my life and each time it astounds me. Flatterland is a case of \\"more is not better\\" and \\"cute\\" is not clever. Get an original idea Stewert."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"Like totally. It is so bizarre to have to deal with Stewart giving voice to a adolescent girl's diary. Kind of distrubing actually. INteresting math, but the format here is painful to read. Try Jeff Weeks' \\"the sahpe of space\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Flatterland: Like Flatland Only Pompous","review":"Please do not judge the classic \\"Flatland\\" by the bland \\"Flatterland\\". While \\"Flatland\\" was creative and alegorical, \\"Flatterland\\" is just an exercise in cutesy phrasing.I suppose that Stewart does a decent job of explaining multidimensional geometry to the layman, but is there a need to do it so condescendingly? And what is there of a message beyond the mathematical analogies? Abbott's original is a classic because it is socially relevant. Stewart even references this, but he makes no effort to provide a current relevance to his story other than to reference current culture.This book is an insult to the original classic. Those looking for a better understanding of multidimensional mathematics and physics are better off looking elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"should have handed his ideas to a better writer","review":"Stewart has some interesting math to give to the common person, however he isn't very good at setting it down. His jokes are horrible, and his narrative is slow. It is written as if he is giving a lecture in tag-team mode between the protagonist Vicky and her guide the Space Hopper.After reading Flatland, I had hoped this sequel would live up to the sort of lofty ideals and imagination of Abbott's work. However, just as the people in Victorian England, Stewart immediately shrugs off the possibility of any higher spatial dimension than 3, and proceeds to merely give lectures on topology and geometry through bad puns and tiring dialogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bride of Flatland","review":"\\"Flatterland\\" is billed as the sequel to the book \\"Flatland\\" and like most Hollywood sequels, \\"Flatterland\\" doesn't measure up to the original. On the subjects that I do know something about (e.g. Doppler shifts) there are minor technical errors, but not of any significance. However, in my opinion, the book fails because it is too much like a Hollywood production. In an attempt to appease everyone, the book performs a \\"Dante like tour\\" (the book's author's words, not mine) of the huge realm of mathematics and beyond while not attempting to explain anything in any detail. To my mind this attempt at \\"drive by learning\\" simply does not work. The book would be better served by addressing fewer subjects at a slightly more detailed level. Also, (like a Hollywood production) I could have done without the author interjecting his political views throughout the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a great paperweight!","review":"Absolutely horrible. Assembly is easy until you try to get the guard on and then good luck. Cutting area is next to nothing and the spool lock will not stay in place. It is already unusable after just 30 minutes because it came unlocked for the 15th time, shot off the spool and shot out the spring to lands unknown. Construction is shoddy and overall I'm VERY disappointed in my purchase. It is light and easy to maneuver but this is pointless if you cant even cut the grass. Great paperweight however, you could hold down 5 or 6 stacks."},{"rating":"2","title":"the Matthew Shepard Story","review":"This is a great movie, gave me wet eyes. Too bad bad that the quality of the dvd is not that great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"Matthew Shepard should be a household name... His tragic story is one that has sparked many Gay Rights groups, and brought the hatred in America to light. This story allows us to see what he and his family went through, not just hear about it, and try to put ourselves in their shoes. Granted, this is still a movie, and is probably elaborated in parts, but I think it aids in showing the real pain and suffering that they went through. I was able to watch this movie on Lifetime, and I cried in a couple of parts... I wish Amazon currently had it available cause if so, I would buy it. If you can find it, it is a must watch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicely done","review":"This DVD was purchased because I decided to revisit the story of Matthew Shepard and had never seen the movie. I found it dramatic and well done, although as always I thought there was a bit more liberty taken with some of the details of the story than I would have wanted. One significant place where I believe there was unnecessary overemphasis was the conflict between Judy and Dennis concerning whether or not to demand the death penalty for the second defendant. In Judy's own account, there really wasn't that much conflict between them, and when the details of the eventual plea bargain were presented, logic indeed indicated that it would be far preferable to avoid the long appeal process and attendant publicity that death penalty sentences involve."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful movie.. poor DVD","review":"This is a terrific movie - well deserving of five stars! I really enjoyed watching it and cried a few times. I was just frustrated that it was a Pan & Scan instead of the original widescreen, meaning you lose a good portion of the picture, which took away from the experience. I was aware of this before purchasing and bought it anyway because it seemed to be the only way to get the movie. However, I certainly didn't buy an HDTV just to have the sides of my movies chopped off and stare at black lines. When will the era of Pan & Scan come to and end?

The three individuals interviewed appeared to be in fairly contemporary and progressive church communities and seemed to be doing just fine fine for themselves. This documentary fails to get a feel for those who are marginalized because of their sexuality. The first interviewee touched on this a little bit, but it was more of a side note. If I had watched this not knowing the reality of how non-heterosexuals are treated in most church communities, I would think everything was just fine and there wasn't any issue. It was nice to hear these three tell their stories, but it's not representational of most churches as a whole and never really got to the issues at hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately, a zero star rating is not possible...","review":"...Office Depot CD-Rs seem to be of the lowest quality.

The author painted such a real picture of this scene and so many others that I could feel and see the trials that Hura faced. This story of one woman's struggle in a society where women are not to think or speak independently serves as an engrossing metaphor for the plight of many women in this part of the world both then and now. As the book neared its end I savored every word and didn't want the story to close, whatever the outcome. The characters have stayed with me even though I have finished reading it.This is a book I would highly recommend for women AND men to read.

It will routinely take only about four or five pages at a time without jamming (it depends on paper thickness), and once jammed it is sometimes hard to get the paper out of the punch without ripping. A second problem is that of chads. Until the 2000 election, I didn't know what the little partially detached pieces of paper not cut by the punch were called, but now I am unhappy to report that, thanks to this punch, I too have problems with hanging chads!Swingline makes a lot of great office products, but if I had to do it over again, I would buy a better grade of punch.

A number of the traps need a little bending of the plastic in order for the doors to snap all the way closed - the friction created by the locking mechanism is enough to prevent the door from dropping completely.

I don't mean that I think they're innocent and she disagrees with me; I mean the facts about the boys and the case are hardly presented while we get the back story of the victim's entire family tree.

This book was so much more than that. The author clearly spent an enormous amount of time researching and taking the time to understand all of the dimensions of this complicated, troubled family. She humanized every person - helping me to understand their thoughts. Each person flawed and human, struggling through the circumstances they were born into- each making poor decisions that ultimately lead to a murder. This was a psychological profile that answered the question \\"How could this happen\\" which is always what I am most interested in learning.

They seem durable as they are a little thicker than I expected. They are matte so they don't glare which I like. Buying them through Amazon is cheaper than in the stores."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pay attention to the size","review":"These sheet protectors have worked very well. They're sturdy and should last longer than their need. The main reason for my review is to help someone avoid the mistake I made with these. I paid attention to the fact that they work for 8 1/2 x 11 sheets but I neglected to factor in the size of the three ring strip on the side. These require an extra wide binder to prevent the sheets poking out of the side. With the right binder you should be very happy with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun game.","review":"My kids really like playing this game. They say it is a lot of fun!

It really helps my back when I work and I have to lift stuff around. I would definitely recommend it for people who have back problems of hip joints disfunction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works like a charm","review":"These traps work like a charm with the right bait. I've tried everything from cheese to peanut butter. What I have found to work best is dried shrimp or the asian prawn/shrimp chips. You have to wedge it well into the bait holder so they can't slip it out through the side and if they do try to do that, it activates the trap. Using the prawn chips works every time and usually within a few hours while the smell is still strong. I've had this work as fast as five minutes upon set up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very efficient","review":"I used these before but the hardware store I used to get them from had closed. I tried going cheap and buying the first trap i saw only to find that it often didn't snap at all, and when it did, the mouse would often be left staring at me when I checked the trap. Not to humane in my eyes. These traps always go off (i never find one still set but missing the peanut butter). When it does, the end appears to be very swift for the little vermin. I've used two of the more than 20 time in the past before they break. That's a pretty good return for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlike the old ones","review":"These traps are NOT like the ones we are used too.

Each entry is clear and concise and includes a small photograph. Information regarding the general composition, formation type, crystal system, and Berzelian grouping are included and may be expanded upon by using this book as an extension of his other work (Crystal Power, Crystal Healing).Many diverse minerals and rocks are included, as well as many different morphologies of the quartz crystal. This is a lovely shopping guide, especially since it includes a small checkbox for marking those pieces which are part of your collection. As always, Gienger includes the most traditional stones, as well as those which are much more exotic and interesting. In addition to all of the mineralogical and spiritual values of the stones, Gienger also approximates a current availability of each entry (i.e.: common, readily available, not readily available, scarce, rare, etc.)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible buy","review":"I bought ths book based on the good rating. After looking at it for 20 seconds it was clear that I had just thrown away $5 good dollars.There is barely any information on any given stone. I bought this book because I have a few new exceptionally powerful stones in my collection and I wanted to know as much as possible about them, stibnite, in particular. It was not even in the book.Firstly, this is a kindle book. Therefore physical size is not a factor. It was written as a pocket guide so the entries are miniscule and do not even cover the real, detaled spiritual benefits of an given stone. Second, there is no way to get directly to your entry so you are forced to flip through each miserably pathetic page looking for a less than adequate description.Anyone serious about crystals or even anyone who is not serious should avoid the kindle version of this book. If you want a terrible pocket book buy the physical version. Otherwise, it is a complete waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great resource","review":"I really like this little book. It has a small picture of each stone next to the description for its uses. If anything is lacking, it would be maybe a little explanation as to how to use the stone best, such as, set in the corner of your house or carry with you etc. But a really excellent resource to carry along with you when you go shopping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Desarae j","review":"A handy little book covering most of the crystals. Does not provide much detailed information, but useful to take with you when crystal shopping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative","review":"I like the book. It is well written and structured and informative and the photo are really good too. I recommend it to those interested in working with crystals and learning more about how to use them to do healing work or just to have a greater ability to recognize crystals when you come across them in nature or in stores."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pocket Guide","review":"This book is great as a pocket guide, though not as a hard-core reference book. What the book lacks in detail it makes up for in pictures and the amount of stones that are covered. I would not recommend this book for beginners."},{"rating":"1","title":"It does not remove fingerprints","review":"This product does not remove fingerprints which really dissapoints me because my screen has some on it, and I didn't want to use chemicals to clean it, but I had no choice.

Cleans lenses, monitors, surfaces, etc. with no scratches. It really holds on to dust and dirt. Wash it every once in a while, especially if you clean up particularly abrasive dust for some reason. Shaking it out outside works fairly well for regular dust, too, and lets you know how effective the thing is."},{"rating":"2","title":"An essential tool for so many things","review":"I have more than one of these and I use it for prescription glasses, LCD monitors, notebook computers, and HDTV televisions. It does a superb job of cleaning these items without harm or scratching these sensitive surfaces."},{"rating":"2","title":"it does the job very well","review":"I use this cloth to clean my eyeglasses ever since I needed new lenses that are quite strong; using a soft cloth always left a type of residue that made it look as if my lenses had fogged up! The cloth is indeed washable many times over; it doesn't fall to pieces in the wash; and I really like that I can use this same cloth to clean my LCD monitor and my digital camera lens. Amazingly enough, there's no need for this cloth to be moistened before you use it--it really does the job as it is, dry and with a gentle swipe across the surface that you wish to clean.My only caveat is that when you use this to clean anything you might want to first blow or gently brush off heavier particles of dirt or dust. That way you avoid making any marks on the lens after you use this cloth to clean something. Another reviewer notes that if you have a water spot you may need to apply a little bit of cleaner before using this cloth.I recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I've got this cloth for my ipad but started using it for everything.

I just ached for *something*. A death, an accident... ANYTHING. I felt like I was in a bad soap opera: Knowing that what I was watching was possibly complete hogwash but I was too hooked to give it up. It's not that anything in it was enthralling. No spell *on me* was cast; it was just boring, but I needed to finish it to make a fair evaluation and I was searching for something in the book that would make it worth the money I spent on it (having bought it as a used book I only paid $1, by the way.) It's a mean trap, this book. It caught me with its mundandities, but in the end, you're in Nowhere Land.

But in fact, as this book shows, those very disorders are what makes the best movies so engaging and, well, entertaining! When you watch a film, you can't help but try to put yourself in a character's mind, attempting to understand what motivates them to act as they do. But when that character has a personality disorder, he or she does things that defy understanding - at least without a deeper understanding of the psychosis itself. This book takes you through the gamut of the classic personality disorders, and shows how they affect many of our best-loved characters from the silver screen, making them even more fascinating as a result."},{"rating":"1","title":"NetLingo","review":"Not what I was looking for.

Though some have redefined it as blisspop or dreampop, this emperor isn't fooled. Manual have eschewed the vocals (save some occasional hushed whispers), sticking with reverb-drenched guitars and keyboards to get their mellifluous point across. The 6 songs on Azure Vista stretch to over 45 minutes in combined length, mating the sonic sensibility of a Darla release with the breadth of a Kranky offering. If you recognize the references above and wish your Slowdive albums didn't have all that singing, then you already know songs like \\"Neon Reverie\\" and \\"Clear Skies Across The Coastline\\" are for you. Those who are familiar with Manual's previous works may find this one to be a bit of a departure, but it my mind it's just a step away from the electronics and more towards dreamy guitar soundscapes."},{"rating":"1","title":"RIP OFF!","review":"I bought this item at a local store (same color, maker etc) and returned it the same day.

In other words, I watched the BBC series \\"Paddington\\" as a kid. I didn't like it. I'm not sure why not. I think Paddington was too grumpy and completely obsessed with marmalade. I probably didn't like marmalade as a kid. Also, he sounded silly when he talked! Finally, the series was very strangely animated.Years ago, one could still purchase the BBC version of Paddington. It seems he is no longer available, so if you are a Paddington fan, you will have to buy this more colourful version instead.

I was a bit dubious about my trivia skills but was willing to give it a try when friends brought the game over. Instructions were clear and took mere minutes to comprehend. Once you start playing the game, no problem. The premise of the game is that you have a finite number of seconds to identify 10 of something: 10 most popular dog breeds, 10 highest paid basketball players, 10 things you'd find at the beach. You get rewarded for the items you've identified and written down on your list and extra points for those items you've identified that no one else had.

The others require that you agree as a group on whether an answer is appropriate. The 5th category on every card is make up your own question, and again the group judges the answers. This means that the majority of game play time would be scoring. I am annoyed that I spent so much on a game I wouldn't want to play, but we did have fun just going through the cards and using the first two categories to try and guess aloud what the answers would be.

The game can of course get extremely repetetive but at the same time addicting. You can obtain quite a few weapons and level them up to become stronger. The only problem with the game is the enemy A.I. Its as if they attack you whenever they feel(which isn't very often.)

This game had so much potential but Square-Enix killed it. Im not going to put the ending up on the board but if anyone wants to save hours of their life not looking for all the weapons then they can send me an e-mail.

However, it provides good comparisons between DHTML and IIS WebClass applications, which you'll need to know! Also, it has a good explanation of Dynamic Load Balancing, n-tier application development, and other theoretical concepts. These are *very* important topics on the exam. It provides an excellent roadmap for ADO, which you'll get a lot of in 70-175 (unlike 70-176). I would recommend this book as a guide, while using the product and MSDN as a secondary source. Take the sample at the end of the book (which is a bit easier than the actual exam, but definitely representative of what you'll see), and if you score 85% or higher, you're probably in good shape for the test.

He's semi-kept by a gay man who he no longer sleeps with, and it's not at all clear why the other guy tolerates him since they so openly despise each other. He's constantly spending massive amounts of money on a co-worker he's obsessed with, who is a class-A tease. Why he's so into her and why she leads him on is never convincingly explained. Ditto the sexual relationships he has. There are a few good scenes, but too much is unexplained--and it feels as if Taylor has left it all unexplained because he's unable to come up with anything plausible. There are a lot of better books that portray a soul tormented by obsession, anger and fantasy spiraling toward self-destruction--try Duncan McLean's \\"Bunker Man\\" for example."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of waste!","review":"The roll is perforated every 12 inches, but it does not tear at these spots.

We haven't even started elsewhere :-)Even when these dumb traps are triggered, they don't catch anything! I have tried placing the bait in all sorts of positions...on the trigger, under the trigger, on the inside top of the trap, behind the trigger, even all of those places at once (which was the only time the darned thing even got triggered.)These are useless. I am soooo disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can work, but only on small rodents.","review":"This trap can actually catch mice, but if they aren't small, will only injure them. It also leaves a wiggling tempting snack for other animals to eat, who then take the mouse AND trap to locations unknown. Trap is not selective and will kill or injure anything that trips it. The most selective and humane way to trap is to use a Havahart trap, then euthanize only the problem animals with ether (found as \\"starting fluid\\" in automotive stores).

We bought two of these and put them in an area of the garage where we knew a mouse lived.He was very happy for the peanut butter treats, but those traps sat empty for 3 days, even though the missing bait proved that our mouse visited both traps frequently. We finally gave up and I let my kids set them off for fun. Armed with plastic forks they lightly tapped the triggers. Nothing. They whacked the triggers with the plastic fork handles. Nothing. Finally they pressed down on the forks hard enough to cause them to bend, and the traps finally went off.I'm not sure what kind of mutant mice these traps were designed to catch, but if it's big and strong enough to set off this trap then it's too big and strong for a mouse trap to kill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible.","review":"Got the two pack, set peanut butter on the ceiling of the inside of the trap as recommended.

Third day, I reset the trap with the PB deep inside the trap on the top of back rail that holds the metal prong out, so mouse would have to press weight on the prong to get PB. I heard a snap, and that finally worked.Or so I thought. To my horror the mouse was still plenty alive and kicking, with it's head caught in the trap. It was actually flipping around for over five minutes so I had to use my own method to put it out of it's misery. What I had to do was not a desirable way to get rid of this mouse.

The first time I lasted 20 mins before I gave up and finished the job myself. The second time, I did so as soon as I realized what the noise was.The problem is that the jaws don't snap together - there's about a 1/8 to 1/16th inch gap, which for these guys, is just enough to keep them alive.

The poor creature didn't look so good so I went to grab a shovel and do what I had to do. When I came back it still didn't look so good but was able to jump away from me. Even if the mouse were fine it still seems rather awful to let anything be squeezed in half for hours, and I have this awful feeling that more likely the mouse will die a slow death somewhere under the porch where he escaped to.

This type of trap can be reused. The bait is set in a well with the trigger around the well, and the trigger is very sensitive.

There's the mature structure of \\"Not what i wanna do\\" and suprisingly low-class \\"Lo zee rose\\" (obviously choruses uplift the song) or insightful but sometimes confusing \\"Impossible\\".

Without overly romanticizing his subjects, he shows these boatbuilders and boat owners as they are. At times the structure of the book seems to imitate the way life is approached Down East: things wander off sometimes, but eventually whatever is supposed to happen, does happen. I envy that Whynott got to go sailing on some of the most beautiful boats sailing those waters.

Millicent Bell's literary biography fills the bill in spades. I came away with a much greater understanding of John P. Marquand, and how his life intersected with his characters, plot and theme of the book I had read. In addition, the biography offers analysis and commentary of the author's novels, which gave me a fuller critical perspective. The fact of Marquand's own unfulfilled life can be fruitfully read into the analysis of \\"Point of No Return\\" and his other novels, as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good-bye, Rabbi Small?","review":"I own the entire Rabbi Small series and have enjoyed every book. It was fun to see how small ideas changed from book 1 to book 11 - having been written over a twenty-five year span of time. There is no Deus ex Machina - all the characters are there, didn't you notice? There is misdirection but only if you're not paying attention. Having grown up in decidedly Jewish Brooklyn, New York I still learned a great deal that I was not privy to in my formative years. I am certain that I still haven't gotten the cadence correct for the Talmudic chant and I am probably no more adept at a pilpul. This final (?) story is as tightly knit as ever.

Instant classics like \\"Millennium\\", \\"Hard Wired\\", and the mighty \\"Implode\\" come to mind. But ever since \\"Implode\\", FLA has stagnated, releasing substandard albums that don't quite merit a purchase. Unfortunately, \\"Artificial Soldier\\" is such a release.Prior to \\"Artificial Soldier\\", there was \\"Epitaph\\" and \\"Civilization\\". \\"Epitaph\\" seemed like it could have been Disc-2 to \\"Implode\\". While a good album, it wasn't exciting enough to gardner many listens. \\"Civilization\\" was a boring and meandering release, that had maybe 3 good songs with the rest being filler. \\"Artificial Soldier\\" continues this trend.Do yourself a favor, and stick with the previously mentioned FLA albums. They are much better. Start with \\"Implode\\".

But skimming it, I noticed that that author Wilson doesn't know the difference between the \\"First Marine Division\\" and the \\"1st Marines\\". The \\"1st Marines\\" applies to the 1st Marine Regiment, one of the 4 regiments that comprised (i.e., and also today comprise the 1st Marine Division)- the other regiments being the 5th and the 7th Marines (infantry), and the 11th Marines (artillery). It is evident that Wilson wasn't a Marine. It is clear that when he says \\"1st Marines\\", he means \\"First Marine Division\\", which was the Marine unit that distinguished itself in the famous Chosin campaign in Korea in 1950. As a former Marine myself, I think that I'd find this error disconcerting during the read. Who knows... there might be other errors, omissions, etc.; not just nomenclature but also events, etc. And if Wilson paid someone to edit his book, he should ask for his money back. Shoddy research."},{"rating":"1","title":"not too bad","review":"Wilson wasn't in the Marines so there seems to be a resultant lack of overblown USMC rhetoric, which is refreshing. He gives a tepid overview of the campaign, but admittedly this is very difficult to do. There could have been more focus on the US Army units involved, but what little he does provide is even-handed and not bogus unlike a couple of other books on Chosin. The title, though, regurgitates the old fable of \\"Retreat, Hell! We're simply attacking in another direction\\", which Marine General O.P. Smith admits he never uttered (He was much too understated and professional)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Games workshop want's more $ $ $","review":"I am a long time fan of WarHammer 40K, and this book is an insult to me, and all the fans.

But it is so nice waking up to the sounds of nature rather than a loud obnoxious buzzing. My favorite nature sound to wake up to is the first one (it has 4). It is the sounds of birds chirping in the forrest. The other three sounds include frogs, running water, and the ocean. I haven't really tried the other three yet. This alarm clock also looks very good. It has a large display so you can easily see the time. It has two differnt alarms you can set with two different times.

It has happened a couple more times since.It may just be this particular clock I have has something loose in it, but I can not recommend it because it can not be trusted to stay on.

MySQL has been garnering prominent wins recently, whereas Firebird has been steadily chugging along with relatively little publicity. But the book shows that if you are considering a free database, you should seriously look at Firebird. The book describes a very highly fleshed out database, that supports much standard SQL querying. Plus Firebird has had stored procedures and foreign keys for some time. The book goes into detail on these. Whereas MySQL has only its latest version incorporating them. Not as mature as Firebird's.The core of the book is its Part 5, with several chapters talking about Firebird's SQL variant. The good news is that you should recognise much of it already.

The first problem I had with the game is that the color doesn't seem to work - I'm playing in black and white! Second, and more important, the game play is terrible.

Sometimes I spray and simply scrunch up with fingers, and other times I put a few curlers in the top to give it a fuller look. Either way, it picks out nicely and holds the curl for about 2-3 days.

For a start, Shapiro, at the time of writing this book, hadn't mastered the English verb. Regularly throughout the book, his use of verb tenses is bad enough to be confusing. Where was his editor? Secondly, it's shot through with his unsubstantiated or unexplained personal opinions - about George's spiritual practice, his personality, and his substance-taking. He didn't leave me assured that his opinons could be relied on as being well-researched."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb performance by a great musician","review":"The Brasilian master Gismonti is arguably the finest guitarist on the planet, but technical display isn't his bag.

He draws deeply on the folk and classical traditions of his own country, which are considreable. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST","review":"This book is so good.

The authors have done an excellent job. Though dialects may vary, and certain regions may have their own ways of describing a food, this is a very helpful little resource.It is literally the size of a passport, and thus perfect for travel. It is English based with translations for French, German, Spanish, and Italian. The phrases address various situations (from conversing with waiters to describing symptoms to a doctor) and the food translations cover the \\"top eight\\" food allergens (milk, wheat, eggs, soy, fish, shellfish, peanuts, and tree nuts) plus gluten and corn. I highly recommend this phrase book for anyone who is traveling with food allergies, intolerances, or a special diet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential for 4th year clerkships","review":"This is a concise, complete, relatively in-depth, portable and essential little book to have with you if you are interested in becoming knowledgeable in common urological topics.

They are just the right width for a traditional string of mini-lights; you can decorate for Halloween, Christmas, Mardi Gras, Easter or whatever without tapping nails into your door frames and running an electrical risk. You can leave them up all the time and they aren't noticeable. I only wish I could find them at the larger local retailers without ordering online."},{"rating":"1","title":"broke","review":"I was really excited about getting this for my grandson, I even made sure they all had safety glasses because it was SUPPOSED to shoot plastic bb's, and ordered extra bb's along with a loader. That was all a waste of money. The tank ran fine and was fun with the exception of the gun, it would not shoot the first bb. My grandson was very disappointed, how do you explain that you have to send a toy back that Santa was supposed to have given to them. I should know better to order anything online, and from out of town that has moving parts. I won't be doing that again.

Reading the directions you really can't use it outside on the grass but cement should be fine.

A friend referred me to this book, and it was exactly what I needed.The book walks you through the WAP technology step-by-step. It began by explaining what could be done from WAP phones, explained the infrastructure I would need, and how it all fits together.The heart of the book is its detailed discussion of WML and WMLScript. It is full of useful sample code, and the book's web site offers more sample code. After I understood how to write WML, the book explained how to really use it -- to write usable content.Finally, I learned about the emerging WAP standards (push, WTA, ...) which are helping me to plan how I will use WAP in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"All you need in WAP","review":"Whether you love it or hate it - WAP is here to stay. For many it is a necessary engineering pothole to fill. This book is a clearly written guide and reference. Of all my WAP books, this sits in easiest reach. The writing is solid, the topics up to date, and the subject is comprehensive. It is also a cohesive engineering view of WAP elements. I would strongly recommend this as a teaching text as well. The book takes you from the very beginning and moves cohesively into the advanced subjects of WML and WAP. A true resource for those of us that need to support the web phone market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some information not grounded in reality","review":"This book does an excellent job of describing things from the perspective of the standards, but does not always acurately articulate reality. There are many things in the specifications that are not yet implemented, and are likely to be dropped or re-worked in the future before they appear as features in real handsets, WTA in particular. No device manufacturer has implemented, nor has plans to implement WTA features which this book states \\"can almost be guaranteed to work and behave consistently across current and future networks and across a wide range of mobile clients\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book about useless technologie","review":"Hi, fellows !

Dear fellows, WAP is out, and there is no back for this technologie.

This duster doesnt work, which was a selling feature for me, it just spreads it around or sends it in the air to resettle. I hate the filter in the canister, it is so hard to clean out, unless you wash it and then you have to wait for it to dry. It clogs alot and the stupid belt to spin the brushes has come off so many times I lost count. Just very frustrating, it was a cheaper vacuum but I hate that I already have to buy another one. Guess I will spend more this time and hope to get a better vacuum. I wouldnt recommend this vacuum, look somewhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"One-year warranty is good for the company","review":"After the first week I owned this vacuum, the problems started adding up. First, the belt kept slipping off, and two belts broke within the first month. Then, the bearing on the brush roller gave out, not once, but twice. Spent close to 100 extra dollars fixing this vacuum when it broke, and now it's totally useless and the warranty has run out.

While it was a decent price, this vacuum stinks! It has terrible suction and mostly pushes everything around. It works horribly on bare floors as well. The directions are inadequate and frustrating. Overall, this was a complete waste of money. I could have used my hand to pick things up and it would have worked better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"I liked the books honesty but it also was a bit dramatic. Things are probably not quite as bad as it says at times yet at other times I am sure it is for some people. The key to nursing is finding the area to go into that best fits your personality.

Taking a perfectly ordinary yet very stark photo, Garbarek wrote several pieces based on components of the photo that will hold your attention quite easily. He also deserves extra kudos for putting together an ace band to pull it off, and ESPECIALLY for getting Bill Connors to play electric guitar again (his playing here has a very mercurial and silvery texture to it that fits the music perfectly!)!Put this on and let it transport you to another world!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Intellectual, Not Helpful","review":"This book is written by psychologists and is very dry and unengaging. You probably already know it is an old emotional issue behind your troublesome behavior at work. For actual helpful tips, try reading \\"The Power of Letting Go\\" by Vredevelt instead. It is right to the point, unlike this old-school freudian book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do right and wrong matter?","review":"I found the anecdotes and analyses of the habits that hold people back to be very helpful, and it was fun to read. What troubled me was the low priority given to right and wrong. This came out especially in the description of the meritocrat (but in some others as well). In essence, their suggestion seemed to be that focusing on what's good, right or true can be detrimental in situations, and that this 'bad' habit should be overcome. It seemed a small step from something like: 'Your unwillingness to cheat will hold you back, so whatever it is that hinders your ability to cheat is something you need to get over'.I imagine the authors would say 'We're trying to give you objective advice on advancing your career, not to be your conscience.' But that doesn't sit well with me.The Jungian analysis at the end was not helpful.Again, I found the book entertaining and enlightening in many ways, but that conscience thing bothered me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A hard read!","review":"Although this book has many gems hidden inside.

The interplay &imrovisation between these 3 musicians is almost scary.

If you bought only 1 record with them on it, thisshould be it. It is now 30 years since I first heard this & I stillconsider it a favorite despite having a sizable jazz library.

Put it on the motor and fired up the lathe only to have the vibration create chatter on the workpiece. After some serious checking, and about 30 minutes of run time, the belt began to show heavy wear. The casting on this pulley is so poor that the seam between the tow halves has sharp edges that eat up the belt. Additionally I noticed about a 1/16 of an inch wobble. Thought it was my motor shaft. Took the pulley off and put in on a different motor with the same results. The pulley is not even close to being true. This is a total piece of junk!

We had just remodeled our office and could no longer use the over the door hangers we'd been using for years. We were hesitant to use these hooks because we did not know if they would mar the new finishes in our newly remodeled office...we had no choice, so we risked it. And I am happy to tell you that two of these hooks mounted three inches apart held a holiday wreath up for five weeks on both a finely-finished, walnut plank mounted on marble and also on brick veneer mounted above a fireplace.

I've been listening to all of the Doobie Brothers excellent older releases and this one sounds so watered down in comparison. Another reviewer said they were ready to break up after completing this album, and you can see why. Although \\"What a Fool Believes\\" is a masterpiece, nothing else here comes close. McDonald's songs on Takin' It To The Streets and Livin' On The Fault Line were so much more inspired (see There's A Light, Losin' End, Nothin' But A Heartache) and the collaborations sounded so much more inspired. He sounds bored here, as does everyone else. The drums sound so flat and what little guitars there are, too restrained. It's \\"Doobies Lite,\\" the aural equivalent of Light Beer. So sad..."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like older doobies, stay away","review":"There are only four doobie's cd's worth anything. Toulouse St., Captain&Me, Vices & Habits and Stampede. I don't know what happened to the doobies after these cd's but in my opinion it wasn't good. I could enjoy all cuts from all of the above. Each one is a musical masterpiece, demonstrating the musical expertise of the whole band. There is nothing in this cd that even resembles the quality of the above. If that's the doobies you like, don't waste you time on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emasculated Doobies","review":"Here, Michael McDonald continues the emasculation of the Doobie Brothers. Apart from What a Fool Believes (and possibly the instrumental Steamer Lane Breakdown, which sounds like the Marshall Tucker Band), there's precious little here. Hard to believe this is the same group that recorded Toulouse Street, The Captain and Me, and What Were Once Vices Are Now Habits."},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT ALBUM, BUT YOU'RE BUYING THE WRONG VERSION!","review":"The Japanese imports of the Doobie catalog are remastered.Warner Brothers here in the U.S. is still selling the old LP-EQ'd, terrible-sounding masters they released on CD in 1990.If you love these albums, get a set of the Japanese editions.

But it can get very boring.This is NOT the case with this book!! These solos have many of the rudiments being played over the barline and starting on other weird rhythmic positions. I just got this book last week, and even though I read through it the first day, I am now going back and focusing on 2 solos at a time.

Eberhard's bass tone is so pure and perfect, and the compositions are just amazing. For me, the tune \\"Silent Feet\\" can bring me to tears it's so beautiful. After an extended introduction section the rythem starts to form as the piano lays out the chords. Then the soprano sax comes in with a bouncing little repeating phrase that comes out of nowhere and yet fits so perfectly. Under it all Eberhard plays a bass counter point that changes every time they play the phrase. It's just amazing.This is an album you've probably not heard of, but if you take the risk and get it you'll discover music that goes way beyond what you've heard before. And yet, it's still very accessable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique Pleasure","review":"If you liked Yellow Fields, you'll like this one more. Eberhard entered into his peak period with this project. Each of his compositions are like facinating journeys taking you to various different places. Rainier Bruninghaus was playing more acoustic piano in this album than he did in the earlier albums by Weber and it really revealed what a wonderful pianist he was at that time. His electric piano work was always good too, but had a tendency to get lost in the other sounds. Here it really showcased his artistry quite well. Charlie Mariano wails throughout the album and John Marshall (known from Soft Machine) was excellent as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased.","review":"Reading this book was very torturous in some ways. Naomi Wolf presents extremely biased viewpoints based on one-sided facts. She completely disregards the role the other sciences (biology, etc) play in beauty with only a few paragraphs. I suggest taking her statistics and facts with a large grain of salt. She tends to focus on the superficial parts of a research that fits her support then disregard the general conclusions.This book, however, does address real issues that we face today. I recommend doing your own research and reading other books to provide a more well-rounded prespective. Survival of the Prettiest, The masculine mystique, etc"},{"rating":"1","title":"muddy, unoriginal, and unreadable","review":"For the life of me, I can't figure out why this book ever took off. I've tried to read it twice now and still cannot slog through the bad writing, lack of logical structure, and Ms. Wolf's seeming inability to successfully support any argument. Considering that most of her arguments are extremely shopworn, that's a pretty sad comment. We all know all this stuff anyway--the media gives us impossible images to live up to, beauty carries too much weight in our society, anorexia and bulimia are on the rise. Skip this one and try her other books instead--like Promiscuities and Fire with Fire. Did she learn to write, or find an excellent editor for those ones? Whichever, at least they're real and original books, not a mishmash of random thoughts."},{"rating":"2","title":"A life-changing, eye-opening book","review":"This book really opened my eyes to American culture and our obsession with beauty and thinness. The ideas and concepts presented have shown me a whole new way to look at the world around me as well as given me a new appreciation for the body and face that I was born with. I don't think I will ever look at magazine and television advertisements the same again. I truly recommend this book to any woman who is sick of the \\" she who dies thinnest and with the fewest wrinkles, wins \\" mentality that has been forced upon us for decades. However, be prepared for one thing. The book does read a bit like a high school text book which can be a little daunting at times but, the education and self-esteem boost you will get makes it worth the time to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Angry Tone Prevails","review":"Frankly, this book ranks well below the author's other works I have read. In fact, I never did finish this work, as the angry tone of the writing turned me off. Since this was an earlier work, it is clear that the author has matured and has a better grasp of her emotional responses to complex issues facing women in her subsequent works. Naomi Wolf is a valuable social commentator, and while this book certainly makes some valid observations, it is not up to her later standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book distinguishes real vs. ideal.","review":"The Beauty Myth is an extrodianrily rare book. It focuses on how images of beauty are used against women by examining the figment all women measure themselves, and eachother, against - the Iron Maiden. The author, Naomi Wolf connects women's feelings of inferiority to the evidence they are dominated in religion, culture, and the workplace. Images of beauty in advertising and pornography contribute to the rise in cosmetic surgery and our society's obsession with thinness and perfection. The book attempts to illustrate how women are divided, as competetors for the scarce beauty there is that is recognized. Wolf presents a few great points and lots of supporting evidence. She lacks an interesting writing style, however, and hashes out the same point 200 pages too long. The Beauty Myth would make a moving essay, but as a book, beats a dead horse."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book to read very carefully","review":"Naomi Wolf is of course famous for being a very pretty affluent white woman who went to Yale and married a wealthy magazine publisher. And so I was surprised that this is often an intelligent and even thoughtful book, not at all as silly as you might think (even though Wolf is infamous for claiming that 150,000 women starve themselves to death every year in this country). Much more than Susan Faludi, another commentator on women's issues and famous for 'Backlash', Wolf looks at the ways this society makes women dislike their own bodies to the extent that they sometimes dislike themselves. I can't help but think that, after seeing Wolf throw her beautiful hair around and poke her bosom out at reporters, she was practically pinching herself with pleasure to have written a book on the 'beauty myth' which so many women have bought, but she's actually pretty intelligent too. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"not flawless but an incredible read, be you woman or man who respects them.

I found this to be a very interesting read, though quite a bit of it bordered on the unpleasant and the disturbing--rape, violence, surgical violation of the body. It also treads the line between the scholarly and the general interest book, although it's probably much closer to the latter. Very well written, it felt a bit tragic, poetic, philosophical, and almost Freudian in style. A general criticism: could it be that some women seek to beautify themselves, even in an extreme manner, somewhat independent of modern societal, or patriarchical, influences? An evolutionary biologist might argue that some if not most women might have an emphasis on beauty that is hardwired into their brains, and we are simply observing a manifestation of that inherent nature in the modern environment.

The author appears to be just letting out all her anger agianst the world. She maks many wery broad and damning accusations however she does not back any of these accusations up with any evidence. Also, she says the same thing over and over throughout the book. Mrs.Wolf beleives that there is a conspiracy of sorts agianst all women. This conspiracy has led to the stall that has occurred in the feminest movement. She beleives that corporations and men of the world are trying to make women bekeive that they are not pretty or that if they are that they are stupid. by doing this they are insuring that society will continue to be make dominated and that corportions will be able to continue to make a great deal of money from women.

From a modern feminist perspective, she makes statements and generalizations about men and women (even as she tries to debunk other generalizations and myths) that aren't exactly progressive or feminist.This book does not hold up to the test of time, and even then it has serious flaws."},{"rating":"2","title":"So true","review":"This is a good book for any person that is upset with the media and the values that society upholds.

The only reason people paid attention to this idiotic book was because Naomi was young and hot-looking. It drove Camille Paglia insane that Naomi was being treated like she knew anything about life. Naomi has done a lot of growing up since then, and I imagine she must be pretty humiliated that people are still reading this deeply awful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misunderstanding of anorexia and bulimia","review":"Given recent research that indicates that anorexia and other eating disorders are the result of obsessive-compulsive disorder, there is no reason to condemn fashion magazines or the ad industry as \\"causing\\" this disease.

I read the chapter on religion and threw it aside.I was rather disgusted by the whole feel of the book. The overly feministic view puts one on the warpath with men and that to me is just as harmful as any other type of war. Blaming scripture for making women inferior is a longshot and ludicrious at best. Do we really have to reach this far to find someone to blame? Cant find anyone?

However if you really want to understand it, or if your relationship has gone a little outside the bounds of traditional, you need this book. It's not an easy read and I think Ms Wolf overextends on some of her arguments. However, if you think that line like \\"I don't understand women\\" are a cop-out and you're willing to make the effort, this book will reward you enormously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well intentioned and intriguing, but deeply flawed","review":"I was deeply disappointed in this book. While it was obviously well-intentioned (and brought up challenging and intriguing ideas), it was so ill written that I could hardly bring myself to finish it. Wolf overgeneralized to such a degree that I couldn't take her seriously. Though the central idea is interesting, I had a hard time finding it at first. The writing was disappointing -- full of illogical leaps and implied causality. (I have to wonder if Wolf has ever taken a critical writing course. It would certainly be of use to her.) To be honest, this book looked like a very promising first rough draft that accidentally made it into print. In my opinion, this book could have used some serious editing and re-writing before it ever saw print. I would reccommend this book only on the condition that one reads for concepts (which Wolf has in abundance) and not for proof or argumentation (which this book utterly lacks)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading and badly written","review":"Naomi Wolf sets herself a very ambitious project: a cultural analysis of beauty. Unfortunately she falls at the first fence, since her book contains glaring factual errors and omissions. The kind of laziness that has caused her to rely on dubious research also pervades her lengthy analyses, which amount to little more than unsubstantiated diatribe.Overall I'd say that this book deals with a complicated subject, and unfortunately its author was not prepared to put in the scholarly effort that the topic required. You'd be far better off with a more conventional sociological approach to the problem of self-image by Barthes or perhaps Adorno."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ladies, here's some food for thought!","review":"I like in particular one point she makes: We as women judge each other harshly based on looks.

The author, Mr. Stanley Park, used to be the press officer for 'The worst international football team in the world.' His story is the funniest I have ever read on the subject of football. My brother played for Brunei and the story is true. It is a fantastic book and very important to read because it shows that the players who represent their countries are often treated like rubbish. Brazil and Brunei are both members of Fifa. The story of Brunei can teach REAL football fans a lot about what happens behind the scenes.

The plastic trigger was too slipery or something.If you do happen to get it set, you still need to put some bait on the trap. The plastic cheeze looking trigger is not meant to fool the mouse (like some people seem to think).Place them along a wall - mice seem to like to walk along a wall or edge of something.

This book takes place before the last book did, and is a lot more exiteing than the other book. In this story, a town where a boy named Kernal is living is visited by a murderous demon. This demon comes through a window opened from his own universe and quickly starts tearing apart the gathered townsfolk. When this demon lays eyes on Kernal's baby brother, something odd happens. The demon runs up, grabs the baby, and runs back through the window. Willing to die to get his brother back, Kernal runs through the window after the demon and ends up in a whole different universe full of strange things and aweful horrors. Kernal finds a group of out of the ordinary people, teams up with them, and attempts to find the demon and get his brother back. He has no idea what he is getting into, otherwise he would have gone right back through the window into his own world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!!","review":"Wow, after reading the amazing \\"Lord Loss\\" I thought 'no way is Darren Shan going to be able to top with with his next book' - but he did!!

It is a Ukrainian film, but the dialogue is in Russian (just about all educated Ukrainians speak fluent Russian). I found it to be a jewel, full of intense dramatic irony and pathos, with a haunting soundtrack that consisted of a flute accompanied by a piano. On my way out of our local art cinema, I bumped into the film critic for the major newspaper in our state - it was his 4th viewing that week, the only week the film was to run. This guy can count on one hand the number of times he has been driven to view a new release more than twice in a week. I could say much more, but I'll close with my recollection that this film, which involves a planned suicide, is about as powerful an affirmation of life as I have seen in cinema."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made in China!","review":"Made in China.I purchased two of these as Christmas gifts.

Don't be fooled by the blurb, this isn't a cute story about a cozy, friendly town, but has darker undertones. The characters struggle to deal with intolerance, and indifference; Hassler really makes you care about all the characters, and the story.

Mr. De Mente does an excellent job of capturing the flavor of a culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly and Biased","review":"I recently purchased this book with the idea that it would hopefully provide an introduction to aspects of Mexican culture. Unfortunately, it seems to me to be a re-hash of usual stereotypes about Mexico and Mexicans, perhaps written from a more high-brow level than usual, but no more illuminating for all that.It is true that writing about another culture in an attempt to \\"explain\\" it is perennially popular as well as politically suspect in some circles. Personally, I do believe that it is possible to write a book about another culture that can be illuminating, but this book probably says more about gringos and their lack of perspective than it does about Mexico. If you must read a book about Mexico written by a norteamericano, try Carl Franz' \\"People's Guide to Mexico.\\" When you get past the hippie falderal it is an extremely good book and the only one that ever taught me anything about Mexico that I found useful on the ground there."},{"rating":"2","title":"The lady doth protest too much, methinks","review":"An excellent resource and worth every penny.

An added bonus is the funny commentary and musings that the author adds (Bill Bixby is a \\"low-rent Alan Alda\\" etc.,A shortcoming though is the little analysis of big sitcoms like the Jeffersons and Seinfeld.

Hierarchical outline topics, subtopics, and detail items are often not distinguishable throughout the book. For example, on page 123 it even lists the term COM component within a table labeled COM components. This ridiculousness continues throughout the book, resulting in one big chaotic nightmare.

The exam I wrote did not have any questions on DHTML. Although, as mentioned, neither did this book.I give this book 2 stars only because it was written to be an MCSD Exam Preperation book.

Tehillim is a beautiful, breathtaking, and altogether must-have work... just not from this CD. Buy the ECM version instead.Why is the recording of Tehillim on this CD so bad? Like the other reviewer below, I honestly can't say. It isn't performed with any of the raw charisma and energy of the ECM recording. It comes off flat and lifeless.One other thing: Three Movements is really only interesting to people who know all of Reich's works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reich at his worst","review":"I believe that Three Movements was the last symphonic piece that Reich has written, and this comes as no surprise. He himself once said that when composing to an orchestra and not to his own ensemble he feels like he hass one hand tied behind his back. The piece is dull, Reich is falling to Glass's habit of recycling his cliches and the result can be used as an elevator muzak. Tehilim is a classic Reich piece, the only problem is that the original ECM recording is much superior: both technically and musically. It seems that there is more to this music than hitting the marimba at the exact time, although I cannot put my finger on what makes the ECM recording exiting and this one just accurate. Conclusion: This CD is only for Reich's hardcore fans. New to Reich ? Buy the Bang-on-a-Can CD: a wonderful introduction to the music of one of the pioneers of our time."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 MOVEMENTS is fine quality entertainment","review":"Congratulations to Reich for his painfully dull titles. Title-wise, THREE MOVEMENTS is right up there with Bartok's MUSIC FOR STRINGS BLAH-BLAH-BLAH. The first movement is pretty boring. But I was impressed by Movement #2 and Movement #3. A lot of interesting harmonic tension is created by the 2 antiphonal orchestral sections. Unfortunately, I still haven't gotten around to listening to TEHILLIM."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product description is inadequate","review":"As another reviewer states, this DVD is a PAL DVD, and will not play in many US DVD players.

I cannot believe it!! This is a wonderful film - identical twin boys, neither aware of the other, meeting and switching identities only to have the inevitable happen. It's an update on the old story, but a very well done update. Sean Bean plays the father of one of the boys, in a rare good-guy role that he does well. The twin boys are charming, impish, and loyal to each other.

This is better than the pouf since it unfolds into a 3X1 piece that can be used to scrub the back. This also makes soaps/ shower gels and creams lather up easily so you use less product. It exfoliates well without being too abrasive. The first time you get this, if you feel it's too stiff, try rinsing it in warm water (it softens more with use.)

George Raft turns in his usual solid and amusing performance as a detective trying to discover who killed a song writer. While the plot is like those of so many other noirs, it distinguishes itself in being circuitous enough to keep you guessing at the denouement until the end. I especially liked it also for its street scenes and interiors which really evoke that era ('40's). Also, toward the end there are some wonderfully eerie and surreal sequences which is really what gives noirs their unique appeal. I only wish this picture would be released on DVD!

The only thing I have found to work is a switch between Doxysuccunate, and Diphenhydramine, or mixed together.

There isn't any druggy after effects I get from Tylenol PM or Unisom. Don't confuse this product as Clorophorm, it won't make you go to sleep instantly if your active or even watching TV.

Pure gold and probably one of the most underrated 60s act, which is just plain incomprehensible considering the consistant qualities of the singles that the Zombies produced during their brief carrier. I guess they might have seemed a bit too nice at a time when other bands were busy adding Sex and Drugs to Rock 'n Roll (nothing wrong with that either), and competing for public attention with the Beatles, Stones, Kinks, Yardbirds, etc. just can't have been easy.

The CD suffers because of this. Whereas the original Garlands was appropriately flat - this one sounds like the album was recorded in a tin can. I'm very glad I held onto my original import edition of this - which also is sadly out of print due to this monstrosity.

There's nothing here that even mentions the war time record of the red cross, the partnership with the St John organization or the contribution the red cross has made in the social fabric of the western world - in fact the author condemns the St John Ambulance with weak and inexcusable exhortations about \\"who's better\\" (shame shame).

What I found instead was a rehash of all the material I had previously read linked together with lame \\"psychological insights\\" and platitudes.Another thing that bothered me was her considerable reliance on the published diaries without taking into account that they were edited for publication, and by Charles at that, who saw them as a way to refurbish his public image, using his wife's popularity following the publication of Gift from the Sea.In short, there is no depth to this book at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing treatment of a fascinating subject","review":"By reading the notes in the back of the book, it's obvious that Susan Hertog painstakingly researched her subject, and presented her story sincerely.

Bought some new ones to replace frayed and beaten older ones. New product has been changed to save a few pennies in cost and increase profits without thought as to how it effects perfomance.

The straps on the newer version have been shortened, presumably to reduce cost and all velcro fasteners are now on the main body. Velcro does not stretch so neither does the elastic body. Very uncomfortable and must be worn loosely to keep circulation going. When worn loosely support not very good.

Primarily their older lines (Kappa, Crescendo) with the Emit-R tweeters. One issue with the center channels of that era is that they don't get real low / bassy. The Beta 360 is way more of a \\"large\\" speaker. It gets down in the low HZ range so, you can really hear dialogue \\"growl\\" without having to rely on a subwoofer. But, the speaker is really big. It's not a low profile and not something you can easily squeeze below your TV. But, the size is necessary, I'm guessing for that dynamic range.Sadly, Infinity is getting more and more away from good speaker design. This center is really more of a throwback, large boxes, heavy drivers, solid sound. While their newer designs look cool and slim, they aren't as meaty sounding. So, this is sort of the last of the great Infinity designs, even as these get phased out."},{"rating":"1","title":"No door, no good","review":"Took me wayyy longer than it should to cook one slab of ribs, since I kept having to take them out, take the grill out, take the water pan out (which resulted in disaster on my first try), and re-light charcoal. Do not buy a smoker without a door on the side for adding more coals or wood. I could not keep the temp up at all. I used the minion method to get coals lit, and I'm pretty sure I did it all properly. I got so frustrated by the end that I just finished cooking my ribs in the oven. I've never had buyer's remorse so bad before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little smoker","review":"We've been using a Brinkmann charcoal smoker for years and have loved the results. But it's rusting and needed to be replaced. We took a chance with this electric one and are glad we did. It's so much easier. It would take quite a while to get the charcoal started. Then, placing the water pan and racks of food over hot charcoals was a chore. Now, we place the water pan, wood chunks and food racks and just plug it in. While the salmon we usually make tasted a little different without the charcoal, the wood helped and it was still delicious. It's also faster, easier to clean up and, of course, no fumes from charcoal starter. When I say Great little smoker, I'm noting the overall size- it's much shorter than the old charcoal smoker. But the cooking area is the same. Overall, I would recommend this smoker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smoke N Grill","review":"Used it the day I received it. Worked well.

Didn't have to fill my water pan, I smoked for almost 7 hours and only used an inch of waterCons- No temperature gauge.If your like me and just kicking around the idea of smoking your own meat but don't want to commit to one that has the bells and whistles and costs 10x more i would highly suggest this smoker it does what it needs to!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kid-tested and Mother-approved!!","review":"My kids love this story about a grandma with a big heart.

And why are the short people in the back? You can see the little short lady trying to peer around the tall lady in front of her so she can see Leslie. Who's idea was that? And Leslie really needs to do a better job of executing the moves. And finally...for this to be a walk and kick exercise (with emphasis on kick)...I don't think there was enough kicking.

This as all of Leslie's tapes, are just enough to get my heart rate up and I do sweat. I love the fact she is so real. Sounds like a rags to riches story and she deserves all the kudos. Yes she isn't too organized, but who cares, that is what makes it fun. I could do without Mary Kaye, she is probably a good person, but her head is getting much bigger.

The workout consists of side steps, knee lifts, front and back kicks, walk forward and back. She also does a few upper body movements of side and front punches and arms up over the head.

Sansone videos and I found this one to be fairly light intensity. It's a combination of her standard walking workout plus some kickboxing moves. But it's only 30 minutes and whenever she transitions into some of the kickboxing moves, she slows the tempo way down. So if you're used to working harder/at a higher intensity for 30-45 minutes, you'll probably find this too easy. But if you're just starting out and want to try something else besides just walking, then this is a good choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout!","review":"I just got this DVD this past week and I love it! I've never done any kickboxing before and have wanted to try it. I have WATP 1,2,3 and 4 mile videos and love them so knew this one had to be great. It is a fast workout that really makes you move. It's only 30 min. and by the end you are sweating like crazy. I love the fact that the walkers and Leslie herself are sweating in this one. In all the walks I have I've never seen Leslie even shine a little bit from sweat. The kickboxing moves are awesome and workout some new muscles than just the walking. I only wish it was longer and with more kickboxing. It makes me want to get a full kickboxing workout. Maybe Leslie will come out with one?!?!?! She is such a motivating person and I'm so happy to have found her videos!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kick Your Way To Better Health","review":"This is another great workout and what makes it unique are the intervals of walking and kick boxing.

That was until I put it on and actually did it. I didn't even get my heart rate up. It last only about 30 mins. so by the time she really gets going, she goes into the cool down.

Shankar's work, solos as well as work with different styles of music. This cd is what got me completely hooked. Shankar has a tendency to experiment when playing traditional Carnatic ragas. It doesn't always work (espcecially when he sings). This recording is different. He demonstrates his mastery of the violin AND his mastery of Carnatic music. While many listeners have trouble understanding/appreciating Carnatic music, L. Shankar makes it accessible to all. He uses subtle outside influences in his melodies and rhythms that compliment his Carnatic base, making it fantastic for all. The second track in raga Savithri is exceptional. I am a Carnatic/fusion violinist in NYC and this track is hands down the best 25 minutes of music I've ever heard. I've never heard anyone play ragamalika swaras like this. It's something special. Get this album. Let L. Shankar take you for a ride..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite a ride","review":"Shankar turns out gems as well as garbage. This is one of his best efforts. It blew me away when I heard it a decade ago, and it has aged it well. It is spiritual and intense, sonically superb, and compositionally dynamic. From a quiet beginning, it rages to a thunderous climax.I'd have to agree with one of the reviewers that Shankar isn't a purist, although he draws his inspiration from the ancient Carnatic classical tradition. Like his brother L. Subramanium, Shankar has defined a brand new way of interpreting a centuries-old genre. And we need more of that.For another Shankar gem, check out Song for Everyone. Of course, the Shakti recordings (especially Handful of Beauty) and some of his excursions with Bill Laswell are excellent too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stereotypical","review":"The trouble with Shankar's music is that it masquerades under the name of Carnatic. It is anything but. The lack of imagination is so plain in his Hemavathi piece. Repeating the same set of chords on different octaves does not constitute a Alapanai. Havin played solo all his life, he has missed the guidance of some of the leading vocalists of his time back in India and that shows in his repetition of notes. He definitely has an unerring control over the instrument but....Also the recording is excellent which is one of the main reasons his CD's sell well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blatant misinformation","review":"I admit to not having read this book, but the blantantly mis-statement that \\"Many software projects fail because their leaders don't know how to estimate, schedule, or measure them accurately\\" means that I have no intention of ever doing so."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Modernaire's favorite album","review":"HERE COME THE MODERNAIRES was the album that Fran Scott of the Modernaires felt was one of their best, if not the best LP that they had ever recorded.....and I agree.Fran is on the left hand side of the group on the cover.

My normal genre is romantic/erotic, I have read all Suzanne Brockmann's navy seal books. I surprisingly loved this book and couldn't put it down. The love story was different between navy widow Kelly and her late husbands best friend. I also have never a Christian love story with so much about God and the church, its not really what I like to read but this was an exception. The military action and missions the seal team went on was so easy to read it was like I was watching a movie (it didn't hurt i just watched Navy Seal movie Act of Valor) the action was great, and I felt like I was on the mission with them. The suspense to the book about who Raider was kept me on edge not wanting to put the book down. Even though I do wish there was more passion than just a few kisses between Kelly and Joe I still am giving it 5 stars because the rest of the story was so good. One of the best kindle freebies I have read in awhile. I highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to get into","review":"Could not follow story.

The combination of romance, suspense, and inspiration worked in this book.

The choice to try to follow God's ethics while working in the arena of the military is a difficult one, and I enjoyed watching Kelly and Joe struggle with that issue. Can't wait for the next book in this series and in the O'Malley series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great start to the series","review":"I liked this book. I was instantly interested in these people's lives. How will Joe react to Kelly's declaration of love? Like any woman, I am also a sucker for a man in uniform, and Joe doesn't disappoint.

Different versions of STONE FREE, EZY RIDER, and NIGHT BIRD FLYING are also great listening. The packaging is superior to all other box sets out there with a beautiful purple velvet covered box with gold lettering. The Lps are 180 gram vinyl with individual covers and protective sleeves.

The Silent World has too much animal cruelty and Voyage to the Edge of the World is kinda dull and sad. Although Cousteau gives his trademark dry narration, he is hardly seen in this one (and no Calypso!), instead we follow Albert Falco and the Oceanauts. There is some interesting and beautiful wildlife footage, but what really carries this is the novelty of an underwater laboratory and its old school charm (underwater smoking, color coded diving suits, lame attempts at staged humor, etc.)The picture and sound quality are good and its original full frame aspect ratio is preserved. If you're like me, you were wondering if this product is legit. It is. It was released by A&E; and works just fine, but there are no special features."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent Charcoal Smoker","review":"I have had this smoker for over 3 years now. This is a good intro to smoking and will give you an idea of smoking without spending a ton of money. Kingsford has a new high heat charcoal that works great in this smoker. Otherwise, I tended to have temperature problems, tended to be on the low side. The charcoal pan does not have any holes in it so the ash builds up and chokes out the charcoal. I used the new Kingsford charcoal with better results. One tip, don't take the lid off until you are done cooking. Otherwise, all the heat leaves the smoker and takes time to build up again. Adding new coals and water is kind of a pain because of the size and location of the door. Otherwise, I have had really good results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent value","review":"Basic smoker, but an outstanding value for the price.

The exterior of the smoke chamber is marred in several places; so I will have to buy some high temp paint to touch up the surface of a brand new grill. I am shocked that the surface isn't pre-cured (maybe the exterior wouldn't be damaged if properly treated before packing and shipping), so know that if you purchase this smoker you have to protect the surface until you've burned charcoal for 2hrs (sufficient to keep the temp in the ideal range which will require adding some dry hardwood chuncks)and then protected the surface until cooled. And like another review the lid doesn't fit, neither the lid nor smoke chamber are round, sort of irregular unmatched ovals. There is just no quality control in the manufacturing nor packing of this grill."},{"rating":"1","title":"hmmm...frustration","review":"I will admit...I am writing this review in a great deal of anger.

So, tomorrow the defective piece goes back to Farm and Home and I'm going down the street to the Tractor Supply Company to buy a Phoenix steel drive pulley (about three times the cost, but I'll bet it doesn't shatter after about a month's actual use).

While the story was kind of kiddy, I found that the game was just more FUN to play that Vagrant Story. Now the game did have some bothersome issues attached to it but thankfully Level-5 fixed all of them and added some more polish to the game in this sequel. The first game took me about 40 hours to complete and i did a lot of the sidequests. This one took me around 70 hours and doing almost none of the sidequests.

It just seems easy at the start that way. I do like the weapon upgrade but not when that is the only thing can you upgrade. Your defense is upgraded in the lamest way possible by finding littlt chests with pie in it. The game is 50 hours long but not worth it. The dungens as I am sure you heard are repetive bu the only thing worse than that is the battle music. It may be good with at the most 20 hours but not a second more.

There's no way to dodge anything. Try jumping to the side of a rolling turtle and it follows you. Same goes for fireballs, both of which are just stupidly unbelievable. I've died at least 7 times on just the third level of the first dungeon, because of fireballs. You also can't block fireballs and even if you do block other things they cause half damage.Also, when I first turned on the game, I was thrown into a battle against 5 or 6 robots and just told the button commands.

When I called the dealer, they told me that the policy on battery warranties changed for all mfgs. and that for me to trade it in under warranty, it would actually cost me more than just buying a new battery. So you really don't get credit for remaining life as normally has been battery warranties. Still not clear to me but what's the point in buying and paying for a 75 mo battery if the warranty is only good for 36 months. The dealer (which I really like) did tell me the break even point is 36 months so if it dies before that you get a free one but if it's after that, you get zippo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Long last I have found this CD","review":"the CD played great with no skips or noise and it has helped me closer to finding all of the albums I need to replace with CDs.Thanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Dealer","review":"Glad I read the reviews before hand.

Although I would strongly recommend one if you intend on doing long shots during limited lighting conditions.The price of this lens is a little higher than I would like to pay.

I recently decided to check out some of his work, and came across this little gem. All I can say is that if you like hip-hop (as opposed to gangster rap), you'll like this album. During the first listen, I wasn't too impressed because he often employs spacey, sparse beats that were a little hard to digest. After a few more listens though, they actually grew on me and they really contribute to the overall sound of the album. Needless to say, the lyrics are nothing short of ill, and his delivery is spot on. The content of the songs vary widely, from boastin' to storytelling, and even a song about his struggles with trying to lead a life God would want him to. Something for everyone.

It was a misbegotten idea to begin with; a morose, lifeless series that ultimately insults everyone who has fond memories of Kimba. Pioneer tried to Americanize the series and soften it down to a \\"3 and up\\" rating. They were somewhat successful because they only dealt with the earliest episodes of this series, which sank further into insanity and depression as it went along.

Why bother?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the original the movie","review":"I keep hoping that they will release the original Main theme (Stalkwalk) from the movie. While this version is good and funky the one from the movie has a much bigger horn section sound, strings and a slower groove. There must be something up with copyrights since I have been searching for this for years and cannot find it. Overall the rest of the cd is good except for a few of the vocal selections that were even out of place in the movie.

Some subwoofer's have mechanical on/off switches (such as the flat Yamaha's), so it can be controlled from the Denon amp. The power outlet may have been included for the companion tape deck stacking unit, not subwoofers per se.Fine sound for a mini system, but of course the fullest hi fi requires a high powered amplifier and large speakers, or specialized electronics such as Bose costing twice as much. This is clearly a cut above the lower priced book case systems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great looking but could function better","review":"This little stereo looks great on the shelf but the sound is just OK.

The version of \\"Beating My Head\\" is absolutely horrible, which is a shame, because the original track had some mad drums/bass syncopation going on. And a note to quality control - the MP3 of \\"Hold Yourself Down\\" is another version of \\"Spinning Round\\" - and \\"Regenerate\\" is actually \\"Hold Yourself Down\\".

Because most of my dishes and glasses go into the dishwasher I wanted a large open dish rack for pots and plastic bowls and containers. I don't find the \\"wave\\" design holds up these items very well, but there's plenty of room to stack them; the utensil basket isn't really deep enough to keep cooking utensils from flopping over, but I can live with these issues. My biggest complaint is that the stainless steel wires have rust on them! Each juncture where two wires meet has rust around it, but there's also rust at the ends of each wire. Even some of the wires have rust along the lengths with more on the underside than above. I have aluminum pots so they aren't the cause of the rust.

However, the sides are clip on plastic pieces which broke within 2 months of use. The plastic parts hold your glasses and silverware. They clip into the stainless steel rack.

If I'm gonna spend 50-60 bucks, I expect that it be rust-proof!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthwhile purchase","review":"This was the only larger-type stainless dish drainer I could find.

This unit did not clear the lip of my sink, but I can work around that. Every time we touched the drain, the plastic, clip-on sides fell off. I kept re-attaching them, but the flimsy little clips could not hold the end on, even when they were empty. The little drainage spout was curved up, so the water didn't easily drain and the racks to hold the dished in the unit are poorly designed and do not hold the dishes well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"I normally love OXO products, but this was a real disappointment. If you are using mostly for pots, large serving platters, and other items you don't want to put in the dishwasher, the flimsy design will eventually make the parts separate. The plastic cup holders started breaking off within 6 months of purchase. It also falls apart when you try to move it to clean underneath the tray. Expensive for a product that did not last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your usual Oxo quality","review":"Usually I give Oxo products top ratings. This expensive dish drainer has been a disappointment. While the size was great for draining our many pots and pans, the plastic things that are supposed to hold glasses have all broken off. Also, it is hard to keep the plastic clean.To followup on the review above, I contacted Oxo via email to let them know about the product failure. It turns out that the drainer has a wonderful warranty and a person called to followup on the details of my email. When you consider that most company website emails go into some sort of black hole, this was a pleasant surprise! Replacement parts were sent to me with no charge for the parts or shipping, and I am once again enjoying this drainer.

I feel sorry for Margery, but then again she was a dimwit to marry the guy in the first place. Nelly is isolated from civilization, and she seems to despise everyone, except for critters. She's so bitter because she's never been in a different environment other than the wilderness, where the law of nature says only the strongest survive. Which results in her turning mean, selfish, and bitter, in order to scramble over and trample everyone and everything to reach the top of the doggie pile.The end of the book didn't seem like an end, it needed at least five more chapters, or a sequel.I found the book to be incomplete, the characters shallow and bitter and the plot to be nonexsistent.

Instead of any insight into writing or communication, the classroom scenes focus on things that you should have learned in high school English (like a basic story arc) or that you can learn by reading one comic (pages are laid out into panels, panels should have backgrounds, comic book scripts are like movie scripts, etc). As for learning about the comics industry you find out that if you go to a comics convention you can have a professional artist critque your work, which I believe I learned in the letters section of Robin when I was 12.

Bell attempts to influence readers to adopt miandrists beliefs, albeit she does so subtly. Males do have emotions although perhaps we often don't see that, and Hook's insensitivity to the male gender is subtle, but still ubiquidous throughout the book.

Usually, I can reading her cover to cover in a day and a half, but this time I find myself just barely picking through this. It's odd that her book \\"Salvation\\" on blacks and love was more interesting and only half the size of this tome. bell prides herself on bringing up race, class, and gender issues simultaneously, yet race and class drop to the wayside here. (To her credit, age and sexual orientation is brought up often.) I think readers unfamiliar with her work are going to be put off by her constant pointing to patriarchy and her continual assessment of feminism as a key aspect in women's search for love. Usually, bell has something brilliant to say in every chapter, and this time, I can't quote much that made me say, \\"Ahh!

This is not a vampire movie that is a slasher movie so if you are into horror like Saw this really isn't for you. Also the dub quality is kind of like I see in 1970's movies, but the story line is what matters. And the story line is FANTASTIC! Most times vampire movies are from the point of view of the humans, this is from the point of view of the vampires. There is a funny part of the movie where the lead vampire says \\"How did they find us?\\" and the main charter vampire says \\"You kill someone every damn night, how do you think they found us?\\". If you have watched enough vampire movies you you get around to asking that your self.

It was not a thrill. The last book was horrid and this is little better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Disappointment from Anne McCaffrey","review":"The Pern series gets worse and worse. Once again Anne destroys the continuity of her previous works with incorrect references to past events and differences in the very science of her world. The actual style of the writing is very different too, leaving me wondering if Ms. McCaffrey actually wrote this one. I loved the Harper Hall Trilogy, once again I was hoping to find that kind of magic...but it's just not here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some great elements but overall \\"rushed\\" feeling","review":"I was ecstatic to see a new Pern book coming out and started reading the minute I got it. While I loved the development of some familiar characters I got the feeling that the book was written in a rush (possibly due to the overwhelming demand of fans like me). I enjoyed following the progression of the dragonriders from hold-beholden to more independence and would like to have had the entire book explore that. While I realize that humanity (even on Pern) has it's negative elements, the nightly news gives me enough of that - I'd rather focus on more positive aspects, or at least the human response to natural catastrophies.All-in-all, a good book and a great addition to the Pern series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review by Carol, an avid fan of Dragons of Pern Books","review":"Another fantastic book by Anne McCaffrey. This book brings new life to the Dragons and Dragon riders of Pern as they are needed again to protect Pern against a new and bigger threat than Thread. Thread - the deadly, silvery rain is not the only threat in the skies of Pern, and Dragon Riders are faced with defending Hall and Hold against something that cannot be flamed out of the skies by their fire breathing Dragons, and threatens thousands of lives on both continents in a very short space of time.This book gives the answers to what we asked after 'All the Weyrs of Pern' \\"What are Dragon riders going to do after the last Pass of Thread?\\"I absolutely enjoyed every word of this novel, and was delightfully surprised at the depths of Anne McCaffreys imagination, as she brings to life once more, the beloved characters of Pern.

Only arthur that I can read and makes me feel good about myself and humanity. Love dragons!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Before Pern were Jack Vance and Michael Moorcock, both of whom wrote about sentient dragons working in harness with humans. Neither author sentimentalized their subject. This stuff seems like pony books dressed up as science fiction. Maybe if I hadn't read the Great Originals first I might have gotten more out of this, but these don't strike me as adult books at all. Maybe there are more substantial books in the series but I kinda doubt it. If you want great dragons try Vance or Moorcock's latest Dreamthief's Daughter. This is soft-core fantasy. The best you get from it is a sugar high. This girl prefers her romance full-blooded!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If There Were A Mark Less Than One Star I Would Pick It...","review":"How to describe how truly bad this book was? I kept on reading in the mistaken but optimistic belief that it would sudden;y get better. Thirty pages before the end I realise that no, it really wasn't, and gave up.Look, I like HUMAN characters. Not black and white but all the pretty grey shades between. People just don't come in Good or Bad flavours.And the plot [wasn't good]. Sorry, but there's no other word for it.*twitch* I won't be reading more Pern books. Burn this one. The world will be a better place for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Skies of Pern","review":"Thirty years or more have past since the hatching of Ruth, the White Dragon, and the Lost Colony of Pern is experiencing what most hope is the last Threadfall ever. The new problem facing the dragon and their riders is what will they do if there is no more thread. The dragons and their riders have protected Pern for thousands of years but now they need to start thinking of what other skills they have to offer. The innovations from AVAIS are changing traditional ways of life and some are not happy about the changes. They try to sabotage the new inventions. Many of the familiar characters reappear in this novel including Weyrleader F'lar, now in his 60's, and his Weyrwoman Lessa. ). The maim story is about F'lessan, son of F'lar and Lessa, and on Tai, who proves to have been severely psychologically impacted by her dragon's previous mating flights. This is a good read for any fan of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intresting story","review":"The Skies of Pern begins where The Dolphins of Pern leaves off. The Red Star's course has been altered and now the Dragonriders must find a craft that they can call thier own.When a metoroid falls to Pern and causes untold damage the Weyr Leaders decide that someone must always watch the sky so that if another metor falls they can keep people from dying.I won't tell the rest of the story because that would ruin the ending for those who haven't read it yet.McCaffrey is an excellent story teller though I thought that her lastest book was a bit slow.DO NOT READ THIS BOOK FIRST!!! If you are thinking to start reading about Pern I recomend that you start with Dragonsdawn and go from there. This not a book you can read on its own. The characters and pot stem somewhat from what has happened in other books.This is a great book if you know just what is going on in Pern but if you haven't read any of her other Pern books you won't understand a thing that's going on."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best.","review":"Wow I sure miss this series. It was nice to have some sort of conclusion and with the next generation as the main characters ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly disappointed","review":"This is not a review as such for it is the first McCaffrey book that I refused to finish reading. As a tried and true fan of the Dragonriders series-especially the earlier books, I looked forward to returning to the world of the dragonriders, although I have found the more recent novels lacking in full character development and cohesive plots. I checked this novel out from the library, and after less than fifty pages was grateful I hadn't purchased it. Think I'll go back and reread my copies of the earliest novels in the series, you know, the ones with the straightforward and consistent storylines, focused on just a few well-fleshed out and engaging characters. On attempting to read this offering I found myself not even caring about Lessa and F'lar. I regret the downfall of a once enchanting and engrossing series."},{"rating":"2","title":"To be continued","review":"Overall a very good book. It does a very good job of portraying the transition as a society faces a major upheaval.However, I was very disappointed with the \\"to be continued\\" near the end of the book. All of her other Dragonrider books had closure but left room for sequels without being so overt as in this one.On the other hand even though they played relatively minor rolls in this book it was still nice to meet some of my favorite characters again, Flar, Lessa, Jaxom, as well as learn more about some of the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lot's of people we know and love!","review":"I realy liked this book! It was not as good as the frist three, but just as good as the following novels. Basically if you would like to know a little about what happens to the crew as they get older, plus the younger charecters as they are in their mid to late 30's, then this book is worth reading! There are a few odd things though, such as the importance of Green riders and a guild we have not read much about in the past. As far as I am conserned, those are things that can be resolved in the next novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anne McCaffrey gets an A plus from me","review":"Wether it be dragons or dinosaurs, I can really get into the McCaffrey books. They are all great reads and not one should be missed and this is no exception. I think everything has a time and a place and in this book, there is a time and place for everything. Anne McCaffrey has lead me into many new worlds and into many adventures, my favorites of the characters are Moretta, Menoly, Acorna and others. If you loved some of her characters as much as I do this is a book for you. Follow up on the world of Pern and begin a new adventure. Try not to miss out on the fun and exciting world of Anne McCaffrey by reading all of her books as I have an extended collection and all are my favorites and I enjoy rereading them and listening to them on tape.

My fav tracks on \\"The Calling\\" are Butta Fly Love & Soul Assassinator! My fav tracks on \\"Rebel Soul Music\\" are Rise and Daily Bread.

The Truth or Dare interlude is extra spicy for me, because I can actually picture that entire situation in tantalizing detail!! Great job Martin!This one has a song for vastly different, yet relatable situations, put to great guitar riffs!! If you like Jimmy Hendrix, Lenny Kravitz, and Price, then you'll LOVE MARTIN LUTHER!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't get any better","review":"I first heard Martin Luther at a Roots concert and for the brief time when he performed, he stole the show. I finally bought his CD a couple of days ago and every track is a gem. He has got to be one of the most slept on brothers in the industry. To try to categorize his music would do him an injustice. His originalitry is above and beyond. Unfortunately, the public seems to be content with a lot of the mediocrity, empty hooks and formulaic artists of today, whether it be rap, R & B, or almost every music genre. Tracks such as \\"Daily Bread\\", \\"Growing Pains\\", \\"Ms. America\\" and the title track are standouts, but you can tell he put \\"his heart and soul into this y'all\\". A true masterpiece that should not be overlooked by anyone who appreciates GOOD MUSIC.

He urges us to dissect every period of our life from childhood on, to zero in on the activities that made us the happiest; those pursuits that made time stand still, and which we would do whether or not we were being paid. God has provided us continuous clues throughout life that lead us to the unique work that will enable us to praise Him fully, in the optimum way we designed for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feeling stuck in day-to-day life?

He introduces some interesting perpectives: for example, that we each come to Earth with tools in the \\"bag God packed for us\\" to fulfill our destinies. While that may not be a new concept, he explains it so beautifully, as a tool to help me in my life's journey. The whole point in life is to use our time, talents, and every other gift we're given to help others, like Christ Himself did and continues to do -- rather than to focus on ourselves, which brings misery only.Though this book is quite well-written and by a very religious man, some of the points are not scripture, nor doctrine. It's a great book, a great tool -- but please do not neglect your regular scripture study when reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I second the DAH","review":"I am not a Christian. I describe myself as a Spiritual Nomad. However, I thoroughly enjoy Max Lucado's writing.

The book helps the reader explore their past to determine their sweet spot so that they can make informed choices about doing what they are good at and what they enjoy. I've read books like this, but none that take the approach offered here. What I most enjoyed was the solid Biblical references the book uses to help the reader explore their unique gifts and talents given by the Lord. It quotes many Bible verses which has caused me to go back to my Bible to read and think about their personal meaning to me.

After returning the basket that broke I got the one from Creative, which was now available, and have had no trouble with it. That said, it looks exactly like the one that broke on me-EXACTLY, down to the clips on the chain that hold the basket.Perhaps this one has not broken because I have been more careful not to over pack it, or perhaps this one actually is stronger than the others.

And those of you who don't speak Spanish will be happy to know that the English subtitles are well-done, and translate colloquially and with the correct amount of vulgarity.The bad news: the region 1 (US) DVD is missing a lot of things that were on the region 2 (Europe) version. They get deleted scenes, outtakes, making-of segments, TV commercials, and a picture gallery; all we get is the theatrical trailer.

Who else you know of could write a really jazzy song about a 29-year-old woman who lost her fingers in an accident and thus cannot get a husband?And \\"Margie the Midget?\\" Don't get me started.You won't get this quality of entertainment for your dollar anywhere else.Or, as he says on \\"Miami,\\" make that five dollars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A milestone,classic recording","review":"I have listened to this record for many years and have always been amazed by it. While some of the synth sounds may sound dated, the way he uses them is still fresh even after 3 decades. The sophistication of the music and of the arrangements makes his playing of all of the parts eminently forgivable. Mr. Towner's superb and impeccable musicianship is on full display here making this a \\"Must Have\\" out of his discography. While I understand his reasons for never wanting to make another recording like this again I am always left wondering what \\"might have been\\" due to the scope and range of his abilities he applied to this outing. There are those that may be keen to pick at this gem but there is nothing that can take away from the fact that after 30 years people are still mesmerized by this work and that I am so moved by it, all these years later, to write this review.

The serious poems, many of which are about the aftermath of 9/11, are poignant and moving, without being sentimental. In \\"Anniversary\\" the poet expresses beautifully the horror, shock, and subsequent numbness of that day, and in \\"Twins\\" and \\"The Nice Young Girl\\" he reminds us that we will never be able to forget the enormity of it.These solemn poems are interspersed with a number of light-hearted poems, in which the poet excercizes his sardonic gift for Satire. Anyone at all familiar with Irish Language poetry will find them refreshingly irreverant and comical.This is a book that I am inclined to pick up on a regular basis, and each new reading adds new insight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miracle product","review":"After my cats walked in fresh roof tar and tracked it all over my floors I searched for something to remove it.

That's where Amazon comes into the picture. This size is an excellent deal, given the free shipping.We are using this mostly to eliminate stains from clothing. It works pretty well if 'used as directed' - rub the stained area, give it a few minutes, rub it with clean cloth, drop it in the washer with extra detergents. If threated this way, MOST stains will either disappear or fade a little or a lot.To conclude, this is a more than decent cleaner. This petroleum-based cleaner is not as loudly promoted as the peroxide-based OxiClean but it does at least as good a job if not better. Probably better. We will continue to use it.___________________Note: we decided to go with the 'economy' size, still free shipping -Homax #GZ92 32OZ Goo Gone"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money!!","review":"Goo Gone should be renamed \\"Money Gone\\" since it does NOT WORK as advertised.

Doesn't matter if you leave it on for 3 minutes or 30 minutes, the sticky residue remains (no matter how hard you scrub).Also, this product contains petroleum distillate which is extremely dangerous to ingest through your skin, respiratory system or worse, in your eyes (in case you happened to rub your eyes while using the product...I seriously doubt anyone would be stupid enough to spray the product in their eyes).Oh, another issue: the sprayer does not spray!

Overall a wonderful story in and of itself, it takes the listener from their beginnings through today and even adds a couple of new tunes. The one thing that disappointed me though is when you hear all their hits, one after another, you begin to realize they tend to \\"cookie-cut\\" their songs for maximun appeal. Alabama rarely seems to take chances and you really can't blame them based on the success they've had. Being more of a rocker than a twanger I like the upbeat songs like Reckless and I'm in a Hurry.

Therefore I chose this because of all the high reviews. If you are taking the ANCC FNP exam, I suggest you purchase other resources. Many of the review books, including this one, don't cover professional roles & policies, NP/pt relationship & research. It is very difficult to find a review book that has all topics thoroughly covered. Even ANCC's review manual does not completely cover what is on their test. Don't be misled into thinking this one review book will do it all for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"great resource","review":"A great resource, I used this book, combined with the fitzgerald CD review set and the workbook that comes with the CDs, and passed my AANP FNP exam on the first try! So many of the questions from the review material were present almost word-for-word on the exam, especially in the hemology, women's health and pediatric sections, I felt so well prepared! My only complaint with this book is that sometimes it gives TOO much info relating to particular areas, and sometimes too little, to the point where a few questions were confusing until I used other resources to answer my doubts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"Gold Standard\\" for the AANP Exam","review":"I love her mnemonics!

I was able to pass because of a combination of some of the exact same info being in this book as was on the exam and the fact that this book along with Fitzgerald's Adult NP Review CDs taught me how to read the question to get a better understanding of exactly what the question was asking. Would highly recommend this study guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"How did they cram the whole Bible into such a tiny book?","review":"I used to carry a pocket New Testament.

I think the company probably set up a dozen accounts to promote this terrible hot water bottle. I filled it up with hot water and the plastic left a residue on my hand! It's definitely not high quality at all even though it's advertised to be \\"Made in Germany.\\" The shipping was also $10 which is pricey especially for how little this product weights.

Four stars because they are not the rubber ones of my youth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"This purchase was annoying. This water bottle is overpriced because it is no different than the 2 others I bought for much less, which I have used for years from the local drugstore. It stays warm for maybe 2 hours. The only thing that was nice about it is that there is very little plastic odor. It was a waste of money. I used it seven times and every night it was the same. I kept it fully covered under the blankets and made sure the water was piping hot - never boiled. I always prep the bottle with hot water a few times to warm the rubber before giving it the last fill. This hot water bottle is cheap and quite disappointing. I don't understand why there are so many positive reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best hot water bottle I've had","review":"This was the first hot water bottle I've purchased - since then, I've bought another (of a different brand) on Amazon, and got another at a garage sale. I have to say that this brand (Fashy) has been the one of highest quality, the texture of the rubber is thick, has no scent/smell, it's easy to fill and the cross-hatched texture works well to dissipate heat to whatever it is in contact with, while maintaining heat for at least 3-4 hours (sometimes longer when insulated by a blanket). It costs a bit more than other brands, but is well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keren Ann in Wonderland","review":"\\"Nolita,\\" Keren Ann's fourth full-length, is finally garnering the French artist the attention she deserves. That said, I like \\"Lady & Bird,\\" a collaboration with Iceland's Bardi Johansen (Gang Bang), almost as much. It has the soft and gentle vocals one would expect combined with some appealing weirdness, like a cross between \\"Alice in Wonderland,\\" \\"Night of the Hunter, and Air's \\"Virgin Suicides\\" soundtrack--both musically and thematically. That said, I don't quite \\"get\\" the concept; something about two lost children named Lady (Keren Ann) and Bird (Bardi), but the tunes are great and the covers, the Velvet Underground's \\"Stephanie Says\\" and \\"Suicide is Painless\\" (the theme from \\"M*A*S*H\\"), seal the deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Cheeky","review":"Two of my all time favorite albums are Keren Ann's \\"Not Going Anywhere\\" and \\"Nolita.\\" Everything after Nolita has been a BIG disappointment. Sorry, that's just the way I hear it.Lady & Bird has no soul, no rhythm, and is just bland and repetitive. It's weird too as others have mentioned, not that I don't like weird stuff, but this weird in a bad way. Too much special effects and not enough music. Not enough Keren Ann. Too cute and cheeky. I don't like it!!!Though it's non of my business, I think Lady should dump Bird and get back to her roots. I still think I'll risk ordering her \\"Keren Ann 101\\" that just came out.

Two of the routines were identical as in the same routine under two separate subheadings. The warmup and cool down were idnetical on at least three of the workouts. The stretches were well explained.

I am a long term yoga practicioner and truly found this tape to be awful. The quality of the sound and the amateuristic editing techniques were both annoying and distracting.The web description implied a different level of yoga therapy and did not come near living up to the promise. I literally did one 17 min segment and could not wait to send it back. The 17min is probably equal to more like 10 min of poses and instruction. It is a truly hyped product and I returned it.

I have spinal injuries & was very excited that there was a video made especially for that. This video is seperated into several different 'workouts' but the truth is, she taped each move once & justs cuts the same video clips in different orders into the session... feels like more time is spent transitioning video clips than actually stretching. There's really only about 3 moves in each 15 minutes.

If you have a top-of-line Shure VR-series cartridge and bend or break the tiny elliptical stylus, you're not simply out a couple of hundred bucks for a replacement. Shure no longer makes the stylus, claiming the elements are in such short supply the cost would be prohibitive. Other manufacturers' phonograph cartridges can be purchased for $2000 and up, but the biggest part of the investment is in the stylus. Lesson: treat it with respect if not reverence. The Stanton fluid seems relatively effective at keeping the stylus free of build-up and debris and is actually a small fraction of the cost of some of the truly tony brands used by the connoisseurs. It's not on the level of some of the rarest single-malt Scotches; but if you're not too good to drink Johnny Walker Red or Dewar's White Label, this is your poison."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needles need to be clean","review":"A friend sent me a stack of dirty vinyl records.

It would appear that if you are one of the fortunate(?) ones who purchase and actually receive this light you may be very disappointed if you ever need to replace or repair one based on the experience I've had. That's why I came to THIS site. To purchase a light from a company that will actually send it to me after I pay for it.

The trigger could also be locked for continuous use. With this one, momentary use is really not possible.The unit I received does not look like the picture. The one I received has one moveable support on the bottom, which can be placed in four positions to allow various upwards angles when the light is placed on the ground. It also has a \\"pistol\\" grip which swings up from the carry handle. This is supposed to allow you to use \\"pinpoint aiming\\" when holding the unit upside-down with the grip. Big deal.

Jacko's principle source of support is his older half-sister, Marie. She'll will fight anyone in defense of her brother, even to the pint of neglecting her own need for love and tenderness.

Even though it was expensive, I believe it was worth it. It was a different item kids would never get at a party. The ice cream itself came well wrapped and sealed.

Oddly enough, I like it best of all flavors of Astronaut Ice cream. Each of the three flavors has its own unique appeal and the three together make a good very combination. I like the smooth textures more than any of the flavors that have crunchy or chewy bits added to them although in real ice cream the only ones I really like are Ben and Jerry's which I refer to as cookies (or candy) in cream sauce. Still, food is such an individual thing that writing a meaningful review is difficult. I've met people who absolutely cannot stand any of the freeze dried ice cream flavors and I am an unusual person; I don't like ice cream for the most part."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm an Astronaut Ice Cream Addict","review":"I have been hooked on this ice cream since I first tasted it at the a Science Museum. It is delicious! It's a great novelty-type gift for anyone who loves ice cream or candy. It has an interesting texture, it melts in your mouth and it's very tasty. It's not very filling, so don't worry about that. You might as well buy it by the lot and/or case b/c it's THAT good. It also makes a great stocking stuffer for adults and kids alike! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"great birthday treat!","review":"This is a fun, unique birthday treat that my five year old daughter shared with her class.

The size of each treat isn't very large, but definitely enough to enjoy. Each bar is individually wrapped. It is also lots of fun to give to anyone who hasn't had it before.If you don't know what freeze dried ice cream is, it is pretty straight forward. All of the water is removed from normal ice cream in a special way. First the ice cream is kept frozen while a vacuum is applied to it. The vacuum causes water to slowly sublimate and vaporize. The vaporized water is eventually all sucked out and you are left with a chunk of ice cream that has everything in it but water. Note, it doesn't melt. The process brings water straight from the solid to gas. This technique is used for lots of foods because it makes the food last forever -- without water most bacteria and molds simply can't grow. If you are a hippie, feel safe. The process doesn't use any crazy chemical science that'll kill your mojo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Melts in your mouth","review":"I don't know how many people have had \\"Astronaut Ice Cream\\" but it is sooo good. Seriously, it is something you have to try. I've had it since I was a little girl because I grew up in TX where NASA was close by.

The best thing about the ice cream is that it really packs more flavor than you would expect and when it melts in your mouth you'll be glad you tried it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I expected","review":"I bought this out of curiosity, after hearing the buzz about it on the internet. I took my chances and bought 10 packages of these.They are fantastic! It came in a box, with 10 individual wrapped packages.These freeze dried ice creams are broken into pieces (Stop blaming packaging!) for a reason, so they are more easier to bite into, and because they crumble after being freeze dried at -40 degrees!I love these, and I am definitely planning to buy more, just in different flavors (this flavor is great, I just don't like vanilla. Strawberry is very enjoyable). Very light and compact, and you can bring it with you in a bag or a purse when you're craving ice cream but it's raining, or whatever.Highly recommended!

There are flaws to this game with are rediculous! First of all, if you hit a rotting wood crate going 52MHP it will not cause you to go flying 400 yards, it will break. Second of all, you get a pixel off the track and this annoying screen comes up and tells you to get back on the track in 5 seconds. It will distract you, it will tick you off.

It has all the same racing modes plus .... jumping through red or green targets, combo jump contests, and 4 cool mini games of tag, hockey, king of the hills, and treasure hunt. Two draw-backs are ----- Annoying \\"autosave\\" of your game info when you don't really want to save it and not enough tracks and ATVs unlocked at the begining of the game. Only two tracks in each catagory. Most people would probably like to run a lot of the tracks right away in the game instead of spending days of trying to openthem.

You don't know how they got there and once the show gets going you don't care. It is very fast paced there is hardly any pause between action or something funny. The first episode on the video dosn't explain much but the second one explains why they have to strip all the elves in the land. It is very humerous. I highly recomend it.

The parts of a spell have been scattered and are now on the bodies of elves across the planet.You can see where this is heading, right?Hunt for elf, find elf, strip elf. Yep, that's about the size of it. Sure, it seems as though there might be hope on the horizon, but the premise itself, along with simplistic animation and less-than-interesting stories give one little reason to dish out the cash for the second tape when the first one was so lackluster.Put simply, \\"Those Who Hunt Elves\\" is for a specific kind of audience only.

Occasionally this book perverts science in completely infuriating ways. No one ever reviewing this book ever comments specifically on the ideas contained in the book because they either can't figure out what the hell Massumi is saying, or they have pieced together what Massumi is rambling on about and think it must be deeper and more intelligent than they think.

It was her debut novel. I have read it many times and enjoyed it. HOWEVER, I would not recommend paying the cost of this \\"Illustrated\\" edition in order to read it or own a copy. There are only about four illustrations in it, and all show typical Georgian clothing, two men's outfits and two women's. If you were hoping to get pictures or sketches actually illustrating the novel, you will be disappointed. Overpriced!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a typographical horror","review":"The publisher, \\"Lits\\" in Las Vegas, must be the world's worst book designer and producer! First, it is 7-1/2 x 9-3/4 -- a most ungainly size. There is no title on the spine. On the back it says, \\"This book is the story of her younger brother\\" which leaves you to wonder if it was written about her brother or by her brother. No help on the copyright page which shows \\"Herbert Georgette Heyer\\" -- okay, male or female? But the real horror is the typography. The lines of type are 6\\" long/wide, which is awkward for fast reading (you get lost getting back to the next line), but the weirdest part is that there is not a single paragraph indent in the whole book! There is extra space dropped in between paragraphs, but they are often missed, and since so much of the story is dialogue the line spacing often goes haywire. Who the heck is Lits anyway -- is this POD at its worst or just a sloppy beginner? Poor Georgette is probably rolling over in her grave."},{"rating":"2","title":"An artistic slice of history","review":"These photographs provide a unique view of Hollywood in the late 1930's.

Yes, I agree, though, it is frustrating to have to play the same game over and over again until you beat it, but in multi-player mode, you can play any game you want, regardless of what you have beaten in single player mode. I think My Street may not interest people who prefer James Bond-like video games, but it will definitely be of interest of people who like arcade-like games like Pac Man. I would definitely recommend it. 5 STARS!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One word.....Lame","review":"I had the chance to play My Street for the PS2,and for an older gamer I would have to say its pretty lame.The games look like mediocre computer games,and they are all basically the same.For a kindergardener that has to play online,maybe ok,but a big downside is there is hardly ever anyone online playing it.Probabbly busy watching mold grow."},{"rating":"2","title":"okay..... but missing something's","review":"My street seems like a good idea for a game, create a charecter, run around doing cool things like RC racing, playing marbles and preety much every thing you can do as a kid, even take it online. how ever- voice overs, though sometimes funny, got reaaaally annoying at times. you would be playing something like \\"dodge ball\\" or \\"marbles\\" and you would hear something like \\"haha! i got the skills to pay the Bills\\" which is stupid.and you should be able to explore the world more, and not haveing your mom yelling at you from across town (somehow) when you get passed the school yard. overall though, i liked the concept and the gameplay was fun but i still wished those problems werent there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst game ive ever played","review":"This game is so bad, it accuatly gave me diahhirah.

I've owned it for about a year and even though it looks fun on the back don't get it. The idea of the game is to have enough money at the start of school to pay the bully. What you have to do to get the money is by helping them on all of the kids problems. You then have to do their challenges like winning games of marbles, dodgeball or volleyball. The big problem is you have to play marbles at the start and can't play any other games!

He spent a lot of space as describing the topics with many tables, and it made me boring to read this book continuously. What is a practical guide? It might be different from a reader to a reader, but what I am thinking is that he should have provided more practical examples instead of providing tables of describing menus or options.

That has saved me lots of money - you know, the dozens of recipe books with only one or two good recipes each. But this cookbook has cost me more in overdue fees than any other book I've checked out! I kept checking it out until now it's overdue again, so I'm buying it. It's wonderful.Overall, the first 200 pages are breads - muffins, crepes, popovers, loaves, waffles, pancakes, biscuits, and cakes. The last 75 pages are soups and stews. Many are staple recipes, like cornbread, but then there is cornmeal-wholewheat bread (wonderful), buttermilk kernel cornbread, and about 10 other variations - can't wait to try Mexican cornbread!

Phil's verbal intros are as much a memorable a feature of this album. His songs shift perspective and tone and reveals his awesome capacity for shifting from picturesque observation to savage observation (as in Bracero).

We put them in insulated lunch bags. The freezer ring is pretty easy to use and clean. The food is still cold when the kids get home. I have put different selections of fruits (fresh and dried) and pretzels or crackers with yogurt or peanut butter. So many different fun options to keep them excited about eating healthy. I always pack too much in their lunches (on purpose) so that there will be something to snack on when they get home or while driving home. This saves me time in the afternoons. I like to include them in the lunch making process. Kids from 5 and up are able to make good choices when given the chance. Great product!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great product by Fit & Fresh!","review":"Not much to say except that it serves the purpose intended.

It takes a lot of time to cut up all those fruits and veggies and I thought this could provide a good storage place. If you're looking for something for just an afternoon snack this could be for you. If you want something for more than a meal or two you won't like this. The compartments are very small and you'd have to cut your fruit/veggies up so small to fit into the compartments. I don't need anything making more work for me. To give you an idea, you'd have to cut a stick of celery at least in 4ths maybe 5ths to get it to fit. Good for a kids lunch or a toddler or younger child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor workmanship","review":"I've had this for about a month, and I've used it less than 6 times.Even though I've carefully handwashed it, and merely wiped off the ice ring, the ice ring has sprung a leak (ewww, blue liquid on my celery!!).The lid is difficult to snap on/remove.The center container/lid is really too tall for its diameter, which makes using it for dipping rather awkward."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for lunches or storing food in the fridge","review":"Although the compartments seem small, you can fit lots of food into this bowl. It's divided into about 4 or 5 sections, so you can separate your veggies, meat, etc. The only thing that bummed me out was the ice pack - the frozen gel expanded on the inside and caused the container to break :( So, I use it to store food in the fridge. I have all of the other Fit & Fresh containers and none of the ice packs on those have broken."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well for me!","review":"This item was definitely a good find. It saves me from using several smaller containers. The ice ring is okay - I really have no use for it as I keep the container in a fridge until my lunch time. It could come in handy for summer use - traveling or such. The container is a bit big, though. It won't fit in your standard lunch bag, unfortunately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kane's tone and skill on the guitar stand the test of time.","review":"Ray Kane's virtuosity and clarity on the guitar arrested my attention from the very first notes. Reading about his life in the CD insert just confirmed my impression from the music that he is a loving person as well as a superb musician. He simply plays his heart out and keeps me listening and swaying to the music day after day.His failing health and faltering voice make the vocals difficult to hear. Now, I wish I had heard him sing some years ago.Kane's five instrumentals, however, make the CD a cherished first in my new collection of slack key guitar music."},{"rating":"2","title":"truely one of the best","review":"i rented this movie from netflix love it. haven't seen a good kung fu flick in a while. plus it was a blue ray dubbed version.

The story was a little disjointed which made for a downgraded review but the acting was good for this kind of flick, the action was amazing (which if it wasn't for the action the movie would not be good), and visuals (which enhanced the action and overall feel of the movie) made this a must see for those enthusiasts of martial arts and foreign films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing!","review":"I'm a big martial arts and HK cinema fan, but man was this depressing!!

We have tried out several other umbrella strollers in stores, and we couldn't find one that fit the bill - we either kicked the wheels when we pushed them, or they didn't recline at all, which was something we were looking for in an umbrella stroller. This one is very sturdy, steers very easily, is tall enough for both my husband and me (we're 6' and 5'9\\" respectively), reclines to 4 different settings, and the colors are beautiful in person. It's quick and easy to fold up while holding my 1-year old - which is a nice bonus!

Beard's pieces are mostly republished from various style mags (mostly i-D and Arena) he wrote for over the course of the '90s. For me, he's probably at his best extolling various sci-fi writers like William Gibson, Bruce Sterling, or J. G. Ballard or specific topics as opposed to the pieces where he's making broader assertions or bringing together bits and pieces of his vast reading. Likely to appeal to a fairly limited audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"e-mail NOT from God","review":"The problem with these types of books is that they are not authentically inspired by God. This book contains a lot of sentimentalism packaged in a contemporary commercial form. The authors have a lot of good stuff to say, but when they present it as a message from God they are not telling the truth. This is a dangerous thing to present to teens especially, as it teaches them to think of God as an imaginary friend that helps them cope with life. They know the e-mails in the book aren't really from God, but the book presents the pretense anyway. This lays the foundation for an inauthentic and shallow faith that gravitates toward false spirituality. If that's what you're looking for, enjoy the book. Shame on the authors for using God's name on the by-line to peddle e-mails they themselves have written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"I read this book years ago and it left me cold. It contained far too many inaccuracies for me to really enjoy it. If you HAVE to collect Forrester's work, go for it, but serious students should pass it by."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharpe Fan","review":"Bernard Cornwell cited this book as his inspiration for the Sharpe's Rifles series dealing with Wellington's Peninsular Campaign. In this novel, Dodd is cut off from his unit while on picket duty. Ney's army advances toward the Tagus River, behind which Wellington is prepared to make his stand until the French die through battle or starvation. Dodd finds himself on the French side of the river and continues to wreak havoc on the starving soldiers. He's not a hero, he's just an elite warrior doing what comes naturally, and he does it well."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent read","review":"When I first read this book, I went through it very quickly and enjoyed it very thoroughly. It's an easy read, and not too long a book. Sometimes Forester gets a little carried away with his constant praise of the common foot soldier, but the detailed action sequences and insights into Dodd's thinking more than make up for that. I can't say that this book would interest everyone, but I know that I enjoy reading it every time I pick it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rifleman Dodd, hidden treasure","review":"If you know Hornblower, you need to know more. this is a classic simple tale of one man during the Napoleonic wars. A man who did his duty with no interest in personal glory. A very nice readable book by a very good author. We used to say a book was a \\"good read\\" when we liked it. This is a good read. C. S.

I, too, thought they were colored pencils -- at least that's what it says. No, they're colored barrels. So I bought them AND a set of Bic mechanical pencils, HB or No. 2 lead. Nice pencils, these, but not \\"colored pencils.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful pencils, great price!","review":"These are not what most people think of as \\"colored pencils\\" for drawing, map-making or designing; they contain conventional black lead in a plastic barrel that's one of many different colors. This particular #2 lead (all #2 leads are not created equal by any stretch of the imagination) is the perfect softness/hardness for drawing or writing. Unlike most of the inexpensive 7 mm pencils I've used in the past, the lead doesn't shift or shimmer, so you can write, draw, or mathematize almost as small as you'd like.

The lead is held in the pencil by the eraser and the eraser isn't properly secured, so you lose both eraser and leads. The leads must be made of a second-rate material because they break far too easily. Between the broken leads, lost leads and lost erasers, these pencils lasted a fraction of the time they should have. I promptly went back to Bic mechanical pencils, which were also available via Amazon and are better in every respect."},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong product","review":"The company sent a different product instead of the one depicted here.

The majority of the book relates to Window boxes. You'd think the web would be more non-platform specific. Also seemed patronizing towards Apple and Sun with no mention of Linnux . I was required to buy the text for a class otherwise I'd try to send it back. If the author(s) were really interested they could edit the book to leave out and add in material but I guess not.

I have been interested in The looper guitar thing for awhile. This music seems very re-hashed stuff. Some of the drum and bass lines are good, but Torn should lose the whammy bar!

The soft, outer plastic has the same exact hardness as a 2-liter soda bottle. What kind of protection is that? The thick, bulky, styrofoam padding inside does not compensate for the outer shells' lack of scuff and impact absorption. Also, the 21 tiny vents do not cool very well either.

(It was on our son's Xmas wish list.) Sadly, the book is not nearly as satisfying. While the writing is capable the story is weak, the characters poorly drawn (pun intended) and the language, while not overly strong, comes across as inappropriate for the age group.

The writing is good but that's about it. The stories are only okay, the characters are totally forgettable and the dragons are just cowardly little flying rodents. This is one of those instances where the movie is way better. In the movie the characters and dragons have a nobility that comes through in the end, but it's almost completely absent in the book. I also thought the meanness of some of the characters in the book might send the wrong message to its target audience.

He mostly read the books to himself. He asked me to read a chapter to him from book 6 and I was appalled to read about a character named \\"Big Boobied Bertha\\" and the word \\"breasts\\" were actually used. My chin hit the floor upon reading this. I don't know if this character is in book one, but she is in book 6. I just wanted to warn future buyers of this book series what their innocent little children will be reading. I understand that there is some other language used that I definitely don't want my children repeating, and if they read it in a book, they will repeat it.I don't recommend this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not entertaining at all","review":"I didn't like this book. I read it because I liked How to Train Your Dragon the movie and I thought, \\"Oh I'd like to check out the book\\". Thankfully I got it from the library rather than purchased it. Honestly this is the first time I've ever said the movie was better than the book because the book is just awful. There's no real depth, you don't care either way about the characters and even the dragons are boring. The illustrations are sub par but I don't really need those but I do need a good entertaining story. If this had been told by a 5 yr old I would have said \\"well done!\\" but for a real writer to have come up with this drivel is just agonizing. I kept hoping it would get better. Now some say because I'm an adult I can't understand it but really if someone had given this book to me when I was a kid I would have felt the same way. I still read kids books for entertainment and this had nothing to offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUH?","review":"People say this book rocks. It doesn't.

When I went to the web site it said I had to buy a 50 dollar cable.(and the copyright date was 2008, so they by now could of make it say something like \\"This piece of crap wont work with your ipod, unless you shell out anothe 50 bucks\\") Apple or Sonic Image should offer a free cable or something to atleast make it work but no. It's practically robbery I have a $300 piece of crap that wont do anything unless I buy a $50 piece of rubber and copper. Dont buy this- even if you are getting it for something else dont buy it anyway, I would LOVE to see this company go under."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Sound and Picture","review":"Great picture and sound. I did push the sound to the highest setting and it started to \\"rattle\\". Who needs it that loud anyhow? Overall I am very happy with the price and quality of this product. It was great for our road trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkable little box.","review":"The Sonic Impact Video 55 gets a lot of performance out of a small, sleek package. Pleasant sound, reasonable video (movies and slides) at a scroll and touch from any of thousands of tracks. Current pricing has brought the Video 55 into the realm of real cost effectiveness. My only problem is in consistently achieving just the right touch on the pressure sensitive keys. Sonic Impact responded positively to a couple of my emailed questions in minutes: once by phone, once by email!"},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap piece of @$%#","review":"when i first got this i thought it was awesome. you can view your movies from your ipod, and even hook it up to a tv. after a few times i started hating the video and audio quality, very poor. but i said oh well it cant be as good as dvd quality, but then it stoped working if it was not pluged in to the power. then one day it stared making a loud noise that could not be stopped unless the battery was removed. over all it feels cheap, i cant imagine it lasting long for anybody. dont bother get a name brand or nothing at all"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sonic Impact Video","review":"Works very well with the IPod Video. Screen is clear, sound is good, easy to use and good battery life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound for a small package.","review":"I gave this a four because the video is somewhat distorted and I found the directions for the player a little difficult to read due to small print."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I purchased mine for $89.00 and I'm very happy with it. I would recommend it to a friend. Great picture, good sound. One downfall, it doesn't work with my new 80 gig classic, but I'll just hang on to my old 30 gig and mate it with the Sonic Impact Video 55. Match made in heaven."},{"rating":"2","title":"Has Some Quirks, but is a great start for ipod video players","review":"I've owned this player for about 3 months and I love it, so far. Most movies play very well, except a lot of old itunes videos don't look so well. Also, for some reason i found no matter how I converted it, Advent Children just looks alwful on it. Other then that everything looks beautiful. Now i've heard of the battery issue some people are having, and if you read the manual, it says to take the battery out of the system if its not going to be used for an extended time.So other then the battery issue, this player is an awesome foundation for what I hope are going to be some great products in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aspect ratio problem, it's true, it's true","review":"I bought a refurb from another vendor for forty bucks. I'd read about the aspect-ration problems , and had taken heart in reports that the problem had been fixed. Perhaps it has, but not, alas, for my unit. The output's incorrect for 16:9 videos. Turn fullscreen (widescreen) on in your iPod, and it letterboxes the output, flattening the picture terribly. Turn fullscreen off, and the image fills the screen, but it's STILL squished vertically, and cut off at the side, too, I think.Do I want to rerip my videos to work with this idiotic machine? I doubt it. I'll either put up with it, send the unit back whence it came, or, most likely, toss it in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware...","review":"I bought one of these yesterday. It is the new version that has a 4:3 selection. That works just fine. BUT the bigger issue is that this box will not play ANY 16:9 standard Apple formatted file properly. You cannot download an iTunes wide screen video (wide screen TV, for example) and fill the screen. The unit really wants a 4:3 anamorphic file which is not an Apple standard. So whether you hack a movie with Handbrake or download one from iTUnes, if it is widescreen it will not play properly. Every widescreen movie will be smashed with black bars above and below.This is to be expected for movies with a 2.35 aspect ratio. But for movies with a 1.85 aspect ratio, they should fill this screen. They will not. I am returning my unit since Sonic is apparently not going to warrant this engineering flaw under their 1 year warranty."},{"rating":"2","title":"All I wanted and More......","review":"This product is amazing. I expected it to be able to take the video from my ipod and put it on a larger screen but I never expected it to be able to go through a tv as well with no loss of picture quality. The sound is extraordinarly clear. When I was watching a downloaded program, I thought I was watching the original broadcast due to the sound and video being so clear. The size is easily transported. It comes with a bonus of a car adapter so I can use it for car trips. I think the battery will be sufficient for plane rides. The ipod is secure in the player and I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to have a larger picture than the ipod screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE if you have iPod Classic (160gb)","review":"The V55 seems to be a slick device. I just got mine. I like it, with one major exception: I have an iPod Classic 160gb. Guess what! Apple blocks \\"TV Out\\" unless you have an \\"auth chip\\" from Apple and the V55 does not. I knew I risked that problem when I ordered it, I was just hoping it would work. The curse of Apple has been biting me for a while now with my iPod.Still, v55 looks very nice (shows fingerprints badly) and sounds really good playing music. Wish I could play videos on it. Not Sonic Impact's fault though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome Sound Quality","review":"While the screen is super nice too, what I was amazed by is the sound quality of the small speakers! You can turn it all the way up with no distortion, close the top and use it as an ipod boom box. Really nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great on the essentials...","review":"Cover to cover, this books is filled with great insight and useful information, especially for entrepreneurs and small business owners who cannot afford to hire agencies or PR consultants. That said, however, before entering the visibility fray, a few notes of caution: (1) Have a clear understanding of who you are and what you want people to know about you and your company; (2) Recognize the importance of evaluating how and where to get the right publicity for the right reasons; and (3) Remember that you only get one chance to make a first impression!

Gold, author of \\"The Personal Publicity Planner: A Guide to Marketing YOU\\" and \\"TOP COPS: Profiles of Women in Command.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Informative -- Much Better Books Out There","review":"I bought this book after reading many of the great editorial reviews, quotes, and customer reviews. It sounded like a complete guide that would step up my public relations tactics. However, after reading the book I realize it was just good PR. If you've been in the PR business for even a short while, this text won't teach you much. It covers the basics, which is nice if you don't know them, but it's more suitable for an introductory course on public relations than anything else.If you really want to learn a lot about public relations, I would recommend Complete Publicity Plans by Sandra Beckwith. It's nearly 1/3 the cost of this book, yet worth much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pushing time away","review":"Excellent book if you are interested in the Jewish population before and during the war years in Austria. I found it great as this is where my grandparents were at that particular time. This particular issue hd smallish print. I would have prefered larger print as it is easier on the eye to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Missing Element","review":"An excellent and important story that needs to be told over and over again. But for those of us who use non-fiction books such as this for research as well, this book lacks a crucial element--an index. I could not recommend this book to someone researching information on the Holocaust because there is no way for someone to retrieve important information without laboriously searching page by page through the book. When will publishers learn what researchers and librarians know, a non-fiction book without an index is not complete?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Odd and did not like.","review":"The movie is set during WWII, which is my favorite era.

Now I think I'll read some Christopher Isherwood books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Resource","review":"Excellent resource for the study of historical interior design and decoration. I have used this textbook for over 20 years, first as a student who studied interior design and again and an instructor at a community college for historical design studies. It is a comprehensive text that reflects on all aspects of design from architecture to the decorative items found in the interior of buildings and domestic residences. The information is laid out in a clear format and covers all design periods from antiquity to modern design. Design vocabulary is presented in each chapter educating the reader with the correct terms used most often in the field. In addition to excellent research material the text includes a wonderful collection of images that provides the reader with visual examples relating to the subject.I would highly recommend this text for anyone who is interested in interior design or decoration."},{"rating":"1","title":"697 pages instead of 784 and wrong photo cover","review":"I have to complain with the seller: I paid $ 143,81 to get the book in Italy and now I received a book of 697 pages instead 784 pages as indicated by the publisher.

The whole story is kindof slow and boring. The main characters are Brandon and Gramdpa. They are both Navajo. Everything else about them wasn't well described. The plots and story events are long and boring. It takes about 60 pgs to get to the first problem. For example: Brandon's parents are arguing about weather gramdpa should stay with them. The message in this book is never forget your lost ones. I would recomend this book to anyone who likes slow and long books.ByBrendan"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Book!","review":"This is a great book for students of any cultural background. Brandon learning to see things a different way, and forming new and valued relationships while still retaining what is important to him is a great message for any middle grade reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good book","review":"12 year-old Brandon Rogers' grandpa has to move in with him. At first, what he does is annoying to Brandon but then he starts liking it. Brandon didn't know much about his culture until his grandpa came but then he learned how to race the sun.I didn't like this book because there wasn't any action until the end and there wasn't any suspense.I wouldnt' recommend this book because it was one of the worst books I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expo Cleans As Promised","review":"We go through plenty of Expo cleaner at our learning center, using it to clean white boards or plastic protector sheets.
