The album concept is different than anything I've heard before, but the music isn't so much, if that makes sense. Pray for me, Tomorrow, Girl with golden eyes, Life is Beautiful, and Courtesy Call are favorites of mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not usually my style...","review":"I usually like my music A LOT heavier and faster, but I dabble in some rock every now and then. It takes something unique to catch my ear though - the songwriting has to really stand out. Sixx:A.M. has done that. VERY catchy songs with great melodies and riffs. The vocalist shows a lot of different variations on his singing and does a great job relating emotion in the songs. I was surprised at how much I like this cd and hope they keep writing songs together. I even gave the new Motley Crue a try, but it bored me."},{"rating":"2","title":"An addictive soudtrack","review":"The entire cd is amazing. From the haunting opening track X-mas and all the way though it is a journey in itself. What the amazon review says couldn't be more off."},{"rating":"2","title":"A walk in the life of addiction and insanity","review":"I have been a huge fan of Nikki and the Crue since back in the day. I have to say this album is an incredible experience. The music and the lyrics bind so tightly, they pull you in to Nikki's life (and death) in 1986-87. When you listen to the album you almost feel dirty and by the end, you are resurrected as Nikki was. I recommend this album without any hesitation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Soundtrack!","review":"I have listened to A LOT of music in my life and I have rarely heard anything that grabbed my attention as quickly as this soundtrack did. There isn't anything about it that is lacking. The lyrics are amazing and are supported by some incredible music. There is a curious mix of rock, classical and carnival that totally works! Thanks to Sixx:A.M. for putting this soundtrack together and intense blessings to Nikki Sixx! If he didn't have a Life After Death none of us would be able to share this experience with him! If you haven't done it yet, check out 'The Heroin Diaries: A Year in the Life of a Shattered Rock Star'. Reading that will bring more clarity to the music and the sales of both benefit and awesome charity - Running Wild in the Night."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome cd, great book too!","review":"This cd is just as good as the book.

It's depressing, but it's real."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping, strong, and passionate!","review":"Just like the book, I can't describe how powerful this soundtrack is.

If you've ever struggled with addiction or wonder what it's like, listen to this soundtrack and read the book...."},{"rating":"2","title":"#1 CD in my collection!","review":"The Heroin Diaries soundtrack is the best damn cd I've heard in years! I first learned of Sixx AM at the Crue Fest this summer. Great in concert and the cd takes me back to the live show! I recommend, recommend, recommend it to anyone who likes to rock. Terrific lyrics - really listen to the words - it relates to anyone (even if you are not or never were an addict). A must have for your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good rock album","review":"Good rock album from one of rock music's greats.

A must have set for fans of Rock, sometimes a disturbing tale with a light at the end of the tunnel.. What a talented group of artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give me more, Nikki!!!","review":"I have never been too excited about any past band members going out on their own to do solo projects UNTIL NOW! this cd is awesome from beginning to end and Nikki Sixx did a fantastic job! I can't wait to hear more of his work.After each song is over I couldn't wait to hear the next one. I have read the book \\"The Heroin Diaries\\" and this is a great addition. I most definitely recommend this to any of Nikki's fans, Sixx A.M fans or even those who have never heard of either...if that's possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Journey","review":"This soundtrack is absolutely incredible. It has a very theatrical sound which puts the listener completely in tune with Nikki's addiction and diary thoughts. Extremely powerful and moving. I've owned the CD for 8 hours now and have already listened to it several times. Once you begin with Track #1, you need to complete the journey all the way through Track 13. Now that I've heard the soundtrack, I can't wait for the book to arrive next month."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would of gave it Sixx Stars if possible","review":"Nikki's Sixx:A.M. band includes guitarist DJ Ashba who co-founded the band Beautiful Creatures. Vocalist James Michael who is a producer who produced many artist such as Motley Crue, Alanis Morissette, Saliva, Scorpions and Meatloaf to name a few.This is one amazing CD as Nikki speaks in between a few tracks as he reads from his diary.Some of the standout songs are \\"Life Is Beautiful\\", \\"Pray For Me\\" \\"Girl With Golden Eyes\\" This CD is a favorite of mine. Sixx AM doesn't sound like any Motley Crue album. I would love to hear more from Sixx AM."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Soundtrack","review":"I bought the soundtrack after I heard the song 'Life is beautiful' online on 99.3 The Fox in Vancouver, BC. And I have to say: I can't stop listen to the song. They are so addictive but in a good way. I can strongly recomment the soundtrack. Nikki Sixx, DJ Ashba and James Michael have done a great job with the music and the lyrics base on the book 'The Herion Diaries'."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm proud of DJ...","review":"I went to high school with DJ Ashba in central Illinois and was in band with him and it is so great to hear his potential realized. It's not often you get to brag up someone who you saw work so hard and they finally realize their dream. The fact that he has hooked up on this and other projects with Nikki Sixx of the Crue just makes it that much better. What a stunning portrayal of addiction and (hopefully) redemption the Heroin Diaries presents. This is a message that needs to get more airplay on major rock radio!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely AMAZING!!","review":"I've been a Crue fan since Too Fast For Love and I've always had a soft spot for Nikki. All I can say is.......WOW! I have owned this CD for a week now and can't get the songs out of my head - I'm still blown away!! There's such range of emotions that you feel when listing to this. The powerful lyrics draw you into Nikki's journey and James Michael is, without a doubt, the best choice to bring the lyrics to life. Needless to say, I am eagerly awaiting the release of the book! I wish Nikki, James & D.J. much deserved success and thank them for creating this masterpiece! You guys rock!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SIXX A.M. The Herion Diaries sound track","review":"I absolutly love this cd.It rocks so hard.I would tell everyone this is a must have cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Title","review":"The title \\"Gothic Cathedrals\\" is misleading. Only the fist 10-15 minutes are spent on explaining the architecture and some of the (theological) meaning. However, only very few minutes are spent, for instance, on the Cathedral in Chartres - one of the most significant cathedrals. The main part (some 30+ minutes) deals with the National Cathedral in Washington DC, built in a \\"neogothic\\" style in the 20th century. If you seek information on gothic cathedrals in general, this video/dvd is a waste of time. Of you seek information on the National Cathedral it might be worth the while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misguided, limited, one-sided","review":"The only relatively well done part is a limited version of the Cathedral (1985) [Hosted by David Macaulay] documentary also available on DVD; the rest is just a misguided, limited, and one-sided propaganda film about the National Cathedral in Washington, DC."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing for the Expense","review":"This attractively packaged and extremely expensive set contains the six previously released \\"Inspector Morse\\" collections plus a book full of episode-by-episode details. It should be a pleasure to own, watch, and read. However, the book is rife with egregious typographical errors and mistakes of fact (wrong air dates, for example) and contains almost no episode cast or other production information. It's full of detail on the show's Oxford locations, and if that's all you're interested in then you'll probably be satisfied. As for the DVDs themselves, on my 46\\" 1080p tv most episodes look like they were shot off a bedsheet in someone's basement direct to a home DVD burner. Definitely NOT a bargain at $430. (Additionally, my set contained two badly mastered/damaged discs, causing me to return it for a refund.) Given this show's enduring popularity, I presume that eventually they'll remaster the original films for a new, improved DVD release. I'll wait."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid sharp practices (Morse is great, pricing is obscene)","review":"I recently purchased a region free DVD player online for about $80 and purchased the Morse series at Amazon.uk for $93 incl. shipping (arrived in 5 days). The Brit version contains 33 fully remastered episodes. The multi region DVD player was a great investment, since I have enjoyed other great Brit programming Lewis, Sherlock Holmes, Poldark, Sharpe, Jewel in the Crown at bargain prices. Often the Brit versions are remastered and of much better quality than the third rate American licensed versions. Also, it's been alleged that PBS video chopped up the Lewis series, leaving 10 minutes off each episode. I refuse to purchase excellent British programming that is the victim of sharp practices on this side of the pond."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent!!!","review":"I got all the INSPECTOR MORSE long before discovering amazon.com, but i needed to give my 2 cents!!John Thaw and cast, writers, just everything in this series is top notch.Do yourselves a favor and find other John Thaw stuff \\"A Year in Provence\\" comes to mind. Totally different, but just as captivating.Do not miss the MORSE series!Sadly we do not have John Thaw anymore to entertain us, a man of his stature comes along very seldom!!!My husband and I still rewatch all of Morse and other DVD's of his."},{"rating":"2","title":"This UK boxed set is the one to get","review":"This UK region 2 box set comes in a maroon, heavy stock cardboard flip open box, with two large DVD cases inside. This is the complete UK version and it is digitally remastered with subtitles/closed captioning. The early episodes do look very grainy, but this improves as you get to the later episodes. The remastering seems to have improved the colors and clarity, but it's still a show that started in the late 80's so you can't expect HD quality viewing, even with the remastering.The two large clamshell plastic cases that house all the discs, keep all 18 discs securely in place. The outer cardboard case is made of a very thick stock, and it's much more solid than the thin cardboard that holds most DVD boxed sets.You really can't go wrong with this set if you have the capability to play region 2 PAL DVD's. The 18th disc has bonus features and interviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not play on US equipment","review":"These DVDs would not play on either my BlueRay DVR or my older DVD player. I believe that is because they have too much material on each disk. They did seem to play on my computer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely boring for all age groups","review":"I can not believe the lack of creativity regarding this product. $15 down the drain for something like this? 4 DVD-s with 30 minutes each. Take the ABC-DVD as an example: First, you get to watch a simplistic crane take the letters of the alphabet from a barrel and place them on a train. If your kid keeps his/her attention for 4-5 minutes, next they'll get to see boats and ships with letters with or without spelling of the letters. If you're not bored yet, you get to see how letters are painted in different colors. In the end, after just 4 different settings, your kid will be 30 minutes older.Image quality is not great, but OK since the cartoons are quite simplistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't stand up","review":"This product is cute as can be but the poles provided have no place to be put, meaning we can not get it to prop open.

Imagine early Pink Floyd jamming with some obscure japanese artist (Kan Mikami?) produced by Brian Wilson at his most unhinged. Not wanting to categorise this in retro terms, but there's something about this group's unhinged vision that makes me hark back to the golden era of psychedelia. Tori Kudo and his various cohorts have put together a collection of music which bridges the folk-rock-psychedelic-improv divide in ways that few others (if any) have before them. This is a beatiful, at times irritating but overall stiumulating and compelling collection of songs. If YaHoWah 13, Sun Ra, Daniel Johnson mean anything to you, then you will levitate to this mystical groove..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What It Looks Like","review":"We watched the trailer for this movie and it looked interesting, kind of like The Ring.

It was terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing","review":"The director relies too much on shock, gore and camera tricks to create a sense of tension. However these effects as used in this move act as a distraction. The movies that are successful in creating a tension leave a lot to the imagination which is far scarier than fake blood poured all over the place. If this movie is in fact made by teen agers, koodos to them a very good effort.

Unfortunately, it is the latter:The author resources to the trite narrative trick of presenting the early Christians first as eccentric, and ending up being seduced by them.The narrative is for the most part fluid, but the character development flat and unconvincing.There seems to be an intention of parading as many historical characters of the period in question as possible through personal acquaintance with the protagonist, but that, instead of adding historical interest, strains the plot verisimilitude."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unusable","review":"This is a collection of very rough outlines from Youth Specialties celebrities.

The rest is just utterly boring and of that pseudo-profundity & pretentiousness you display when you're about 14 and really really lonely. For chrissakes, about half of the stories deal with that loss of innocence (or whatever) you experience when you find out that your parents are not omniscient after all - do we really need this? What's worse, the other half just plods along for a handful of pages, going nowhere.

(A Pierrot Ensemble consists of clarinet, flute, violin, cello, piano.) On this disc their playing soars and much of the music on this disc is excellent, all of it eminently worthwhile. The piece by Festinger is a wonderful as is the Robert Morris work. While I'm not a fan of Feldman, I understand where he's coming from and this performance has to be the best performance of this work. Wuorinen's piece is, as I've come to expect, mind-blowing in the very best sense of that expression.When's the next New Millenium disc coming out?!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lively modern compilation, well performed","review":"I got this CD because it includes Feldman's excellent \\"I Met Heine...\\", but am happy with all of the lively performances. The Wuorinen and Cage pieces are also noteworthy. I'm less familiar with Festinger and Morris, but their pieces are quite good, and much more than just \\"filler\\". The disc is recommendable, but only to confirmed fans of contemporary music, since it's either \\"New York School\\" (Feldman, Cage), or 12-tone (Wuorinen, Festinger, Morris)."},{"rating":"1","title":"the review below this one is by a self-serving composer","review":"the music on this CD is abominably bad. the reviewer below is a composer who is delighted that such a CD is recorded and distributed, no doubt because this composer most likely writes in a similarly degraded and talentless manner.

When the reviewer asks him to speculate about how gamma ray bursts could destroy Earth, he sensibly responds that this has not been a problem in Earth's 4.5 billion year history. Earth is in far greater danger from human actions, he says. Indeed.Unfortunately, Neil deGrasse Tyson continues the alarmist drumbeat uninterrupted, ignoring Hawking's wise words.

Many of the explanations are weak, but some of the them make no sense. Also, some of the logic games problems work only if you make implications that aren't there (example: when they say n comes before p, they want you to assume that n comes IMMEDIATELY before p instead of at some point before p). I wrote to Kaplan three times pointing out various mistakes, and haven't gotten the slightest response. The message seems to be that Kaplan doesn't give care as long as they've already gotten you to shell out money for a poorly written and ineffective book. If you want a beginner LSAT prep book, the Princeton Review is infinitely better edited and much more effective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typos Typos Typos!","review":"This past week I've been using Kaplan's LSAT 2006, Premier Program to do some practice tests and section-specific practice problems. This book is completely riddled with errors in the answer keys, explanation numbering, as well as the explanations themselves. Luckily I've only done one full practice test in here a while ago and now I do not trust the score it gave me. I've wasted a lot of time cross referencing answers to see that I was actually correct. There are probably plenty of problems I got wrong and did not know about too. Furthermore their online program which accompanies the book has bugs in it and does not keep track of your progress like it is intended to do.From my experience and others' I've heard of, it's a good idea to stick to the LSAC's \\"10 Actual, Official LSAT Preptests\\" and consult the Kaplan material only for advice on strategies (which themselves are not terribly useful)."},{"rating":"1","title":"lots of errors, not the best explanation for the logic games section","review":"I bought this book when I was having problems with the logic games section. I also bought the LSAT logic games bible. The Kaplan book was much less helpful. It's explanations were much less in depth and sometimes incorrect. There were a number of errors on the answer section were some answers were incorrect or the answer in the list didn't match the answer in the explanation. If you are having problems with the logic game section, I would definetly recommend against the Kaplan book, but would recommend the other book highly.I haven't read the other sections of the Kaplan book yet, but I did notice that over half the book is solely practice exams. If you already have the offical past exams, half of this book will be nearly useless for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate to beat a dead horse","review":"I hate to beat a dead horse, but when that's what you have... My study partner and I both bought this book, among others. Mine is riddled with errors in the second practice set, so we've been correcting it using his. Well, HIS is riddled with errors after the second practice set--DIFFERENT errors than mine! Both books are exactly the same in terms of print years and copyright, etc., etc., etc. How could that happen if the errors are not intentional? I will never, ever buy another Kaplan product, nor will I ever fail to tell everyone I know who's looking for test material about this horror.

This book is waaay expensive for what kind of material you may think it will deliver. Firstly, the CD that comes with it doesn't offer much. You'd think the CD will give you in-depth explanations on logic games. NOPE. It just contains few tests, nothing more. Why spend so much when you can invest your money on something else that has more real tests instead of this. Secondly, the material in the book itself didn't hold my attention for long, especially after reading about how this book contains errors. I actually went ahead and purchased other LSAT Test prep books, leaving this book aside."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I still cannot believe that I did so incredibly well on the LSAT, a necessity for me to get into the schools I am aiming at. What I found most helpful about this book was the personalized study program that gave me the focus and organization to accomplish my study goals throughout my preparation for this test. The online companion, book, and CD all work well together and helped me to structure my study sessions.

In fact, I think it still stands as the only half-hour Looney Tune to this day.I'll admit that it's not Jones's best, because he clearly has some trouble with the pacing of a half-hour show (the beginning of the second act drags a bit), but it's still a lot of fun, and it deserves to get aired more often than it is. The Ray Bradbury in-joke at the beginning is particularly funny if you go into it knowing that Jones and Bradbury were longtime friends-but the joke works anyway, because Mel Blanc's enunciation makes \\"Ray Bradbury\\" come off as a really goofy-sounding name."},{"rating":"1","title":"An example of post-classic Jones","review":"The Looney Tunes gang takes on Mark Twain's \\"A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur's Court\\" in this awkward, tedious Chuck Jones offering.

It is also the story of the rebirth of the railroad from an abandoned line with only a name to a fully operating tourist line in Nevada.The book is well written and split into two parts. The beginning is a fairly short summary of the original railroad; where it went, how it started, and how it died. The second part chronicles the work of one individual as he worked to rebuild a ghost railroad into a going tourist operation.The book is filled with photos from the original line and the now tourist short line. It's a nice, quick read and is designed as a book to be sold to tourists who take the train. While not a detailed study or history of the line, it is a good book for some quick history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Performances of Music That Should Be Better Known","review":"It is a shame that Dvorak's music for violin and piano is not often played or recorded. Czech violinist Ivan Zenaty and Czech-Canadian Antonin Kubalek, who emigrated to Canada when the Russian tanks crushed 1968's Prague spring, make a grand case for this music with their expansive, romantic performances. Every piece is a gem; the Op. 100 sonatina is a neglected masterpiece. I cannot recommend this disc highly enough; it's a real find."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sparkling performances of underappreciated pieces","review":"The mere fact that one CD can contain Dvorak's complete music for violin & piano is a shame. For some reason, Dvorak's violin music (exluding the Romanze & the Humoresque) seems to fall between the cracks. His violin concerto, for example, is a fabulous piece which is amazingly under-performed, considering Dvorak's prominence as a composer.However, this collection more than makes the case for these pieces being performed more regularly. The Sonatina is relatively well-known, but I cannot say I had ever heard the Ballad or the Mazurek ever before. Zenaty & Kubalek do a splendid job on all pieces. If you are not familiar with Antonin Kubalek's performances, you should check out his other recordings on the Dorian label. He is a marvelous pianist, and is a wonderful interpreter of Czech music (and also Brahms).This is a worthy addition in any classical collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Antonin twice","review":"The famous Antons (Dvorak and Kubalek) makes together with Zenaty the union of century.

However, to get it sturdy you have to make sure it is flush with floor and ceiling, and nice and tight. The downside to this is it can cause little ring marks on the ceiling of car, however a dog drooling onto the back seat/jumping onto the back seat is worse then a ring mark on ceiling of car.

The product seems well made and was fairly easy to install. I have a 2006 Nissan XTerra and a couple of problems came up installing it in this vehicle:1. You must install the panel behind the second row of seats (because of the way the seats fold, you cannot install it behind the front seats, as I would have preferred). This means the dog has a very small compartment at the back. My dog is 40 lb & it's OK for her, but larger animals or more than one would have a tough time fitting. Also be aware that if you have a dog in the back seat it can very easily push the barrier toward the back.2. The left roof support lands exactly on the shoulder harness recess, making the two supports uneven in height. I found this disconcerting when I looked through the rearview mirror, so made a pad from a foam block that mostly leveled it up.All in all, a good deal for the price"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!","review":"Easy to assemble and install.

This tragedy is brought to life and made poignant by the perspective a remarkable little girl, Loung Ung.While I enjoyed (strange word in this case) the book immensely, I have given it four stars as it perhaps fails to transcend the genre of auto-biographical history and become litrature. Where FTKMF does succeed, is in its attention to detail (I can't imagine how she remembers so much), and the authors dream-like memories that give us a window into events she was not witness to. At times the book indeed becomes literary when she escapes into her imagination. Perhaps most worthy of admiration is the pluck and courage of the author herself.First They Killed My Father is among the most important books I've ever read. This title should be considered as equivalent for Hiroshima and Diary of Anne Frank for High School readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally captivating","review":"Non fiction, written in the first person documenting families tragic history and the horror of the Cambodian civil war and atrocities committed be the Khmer Rouge Government."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book I've Ever Read!","review":"First They Killed My Father, written by Loung Ung is an autobiography. It's about a young Khmer girl, Loung who survived through the genocide that happened in Cambodia. She writes about everything that happened to her from the beginning when she was a small girl in Cambodia to an adult living in the U.S. Loung also describes the things she saw happening to her people as they were tortured and executed for just being and intellectual and just disliking the Angkar."},{"rating":"2","title":"DON'T BUY THIS BOOK - If you hate the truth","review":"I was just reading that a PBS special Bill Moyers did, called \\"EVIL\\", failed to mention Stalin, Mao Tse-Tung or Pol Pot. So if, like Moyers, you hate truth, you'll hate this book. Here you will read in riveting detail about an eight-year-old girl's experiences in the \\"Killing Fields\\" of Cambodia as a victim and survivor. Moyers and his cronies on the Left don't want you to know about this book. You see, to them, all the millions murdered under communists regimes were just the victims of excesses on the road to utoptia."},{"rating":"1","title":"My thought","review":"the book was about a girl and her family had to move out of there home.Because of a war was about to happen in there country. loung had a hard life in between her childhood. when i read the book the first time i didnt like it at all but when i read it again it was good. it was a hard book to understand. i would say that othe rpeople should read the book from my point."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Place to Start","review":"Loung Ung writes with lucidity and passion, not only the history of a childhood damaged by war, but of the very real consequences of totalitarian regimes on human life itself. While Ung talks quite a bit about the political climate of her native Cambodia, the focus of the book is definetly the day to day realities of the people of Cambodia during the Pol Pot regime. For anyone interested in learning more about Cambodia and its trials in the modern era and the impact of war on its amazing culture, this book is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredible story written incredibly well","review":"I've had a low-level interest in Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge since I saw \\"The Killing Fields\\" a few years ago. I've read a few things and was basically familiar with the history. However, I had no real appreciation for the brutality the Cambodian people endured for those 4 years until I read this book.As somebody stated in an earlier review, I wondered (at first) how a 5 year old child could remember all of this. As I got further into the story, it occurred to me that no one could ever forget this sort of thing. In addition, Ung gives one of her older brothers credit for filling in some gaps. This book is VERY believable.Ung writes about horrific events in a matter-of-fact style. She occaisionaly changes the point of view of the narration, which can be a bit confusing. But, overall, it's easy to follow the story. It's even easier to become drawn in to the story.I put another book aside to read this. I'm glad I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Harrowing Account of Survival","review":"My daughter recommended this to me. It tells the horrific tale of the survival of a young Cambodian girl whose middle class educated family members are targetted by the Pol Pot regime as enemies of the state. It's a harrowing first-person account of one of the worst incidences of genocide from that most bloodthirsty of centuries - the 20th."},{"rating":"2","title":"First They killed My Father","review":"it was very good i liked how she should how everything was in her words that she used"},{"rating":"1","title":"Liar....Visit before you buy [...]","review":"This is the first book I ever read on the Khmer Rouge. The second was When Broken Glass Floats. When I compared the books (not of facts) When Broken Glass Floats was much more vivid and Mrs. Ungs Book was boring and slow.Many Cambodians that have reviewed the book are offended because she lied for her and her husbands gain.Visit the website below before you waste your money on this exploitation book. I wish I HAD.[..]"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"My beautiful girl\\" he says to me as his lips quiver into a small smile, \\"I have to go away with these two men for awhile\\"...","review":"Sadly, Loung's father never returned.It's really hard to intellectualize, and even harder to internalize the kind of cruelty war heaps upon families. It is incomprehensible when such unspeakable horrors happen to children. One thing rings loud and clear... God or the Universe, or whatever you wish to call it, has provided the human spirit with an incredible will to survive, regardless of circumstances.This book is about the overthrow of the Cambodian Government in 1975 by Communist forces, and the capture of Phnom Penh in April of that year. It's a true story, as remembered by a small and very precocious child whose world was turned upside down. Although heartbreaking and difficult to read, you won't be able to put it down. Ms. Ung's parents would be very proud of her.Highly Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome writing","review":"This book was a good piece of work. But I wonder if it's all a true story. I hope so at least, not beacuse they suffered but beacuse she seems to have so much passion and memory from that time of her life"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye-opening","review":"I purchased this book in the airport at Siem Reap- I had no clue about the country's past- and I was horrified and embarrassed that I had never heard about it in school- high school OR college- where my minor was Asian Studies! Another reviewer says it's a terrible book and that it's media hype- and that it's dishonest... That may be true, but it certainly opened my eyes to what happened and made me want to learn more... It blows my mind that this happened when I was ALIVE... It's an ignorant stance- but I think many people feel these atrocities only happen in the past- in text books... Anyway- I thought it was a sad but beautiful story- and the author is incredibly strong to have gone through what she did."},{"rating":"2","title":"A strikingly emotional novel from an extremely strong individual.... a modern-day classic!","review":"In this book, Loung Ung did an excelent job in paralleling the stories of herself and her sister in Cambodia. The sharp contrast between the fast paced American culture and the agrarian based Cambodian culture ensures an interesting read for many fan bases. Indeed, it is her stylistic abilities which really bring Cambodia to the imagination of the reader. All of Loung Ung's books are sure to strike a cord with even the most stoic readers.I myself was touched by the author's strength and in her ability to find herself in today's day and age. This book inspired me to to be true to my own sense of self and to never take for granted all that I, as an American and as a college student, am truely blessed to have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read","review":"Long Ung's book stays with you long after you put it down. The horror of the events that transpire are surpassed only by the realization that her story was an example of not just ones suffering but millions during this time, and throughout history. This book is very much worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Gettysburg Address of The Killing Fields","review":"Loung Ung tells an absolutely horrible story. And she tells it wonderfully! I was affected by Angela's Ashes. First They Killed My Father has overwhelmed me. It's the story of the strength of a family's love through unimaginable circumstances. You must read this book. But you must know first that you will not be able ever again to utter the phrase \\"I'm starving,\\" without thinking of Keav and Geak. You will not be able to remember the joy of your childhood on a playground without thinking of Loung. I have thought continually of Loung, her brothers, sisters, and parents since picking up the book. I have put down the book, but I cannot put away the story. You are tougher than I if you can read even the closing \\"Acknowledgments\\" page with dry eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Disappointing","review":"After hearing Scott Simon's interview with Ms. Luong on one of his PBS Saturday morning programs, I couldn't get to the bookstore fast enough.........and I wasn't disappointed. For an inside look at Cambodia during the Khmer Rouge regime and how its cruelty changed and challenged a family, I encourage you to read her book. Astute and worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"awe inspiring","review":"I chose this rating for this coragous fighter. This wonderful girl who never gave up despite the horror that was against her. She lost her beloved father, mother, and sister. She had to fight the odds through starvation alone. And still throughout other terrible misfortunes, she won. People should never complain again hearing stories from Loung Ung and of the Killing Fields and other similliar stories of that war."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping, well written, but may not be entirely historically accurate","review":"I found this book gripping and well written. I stayed up to 2 AM reading it on two consecutive evenings because I needed to know what would happen next. My initial rating right after finishing the book would have been five stars. However, after reading the book, I became aware of information indicating that the book might not be entirely historically accurate: [...].

I sprayed my hair, then styled it and it frizzed up big time! The product is like spraying your hair with water. I mean it's not creamy, it's not like a serum, it's not like silicone / silky, it feels like water. I didn't like the smell either. And the worst part is that once dry, it left my hair feeling frizzy and dried up. And I must say my hair is pretty cute.. but after this it looked like a broom, seriously. I washed and returned it.

Not working any miracles, but I'm glad I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Just OK","review":"I wouldn't buy this one again, it takes way too long to see any form of results on your hair. It has a nice scent, but the scent does not last, and my hair was still plagued with breaks and splits even after using this one for over a month.The only thing I liked about it was that after a shower, if I sprayed it in my hair, my hair would dry a lot faster than it normally does. I am talking time being cut in half, literally. Should be re-named- wet hair fast dry spray, because for me that is all it does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"My hair has really improved since using this product.

If you can use a film camera you can use this digital. You might even be able to use this one if you cant figure out a film camera.

There is a small sheet of clear plastic covering the actual lens, but if you were to carry the camera around in your pocket, or bag, this plastic cover would get scratched quickly.Because of this, the C530 would probably be good to keep in the house, and take out for indoor pictures on special occasions or something.

The flash produces very uneven lighting, with a very obvious shadow around the edge of pictures. In normal indoor lighting situations with the flash off (to eliminate the shadows), the pictures are very noisy/grainy. I have a webcam that takes better still pictures than this camera. Avoid this camera at all costs! Spend another $50-80 for a Canon A540 (6 megapixel) if you want a simple point-and-shoot camera that takes awesome pictures.

The 4 MP has better resolution than the new 5MP C530, which is not what you'd expect. Kodak unfortunately seems to have taken a step backwards with this camera, and is advertising this as a higher quality camera than the old 4 MP EasyShare.

By comparison, I had my previous shredder for seven years of near-perfect operation (had to leave it behind in a move). Strongly recommend that Fellowes simply take this product off the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Safety feature is very good!","review":"I like the safety features in this. As a paper shredder it may not impress any one. Not worth the money. Cannot handle even four sheets of 22lb paper. 5 sheets had jammed it. Usable with a maximum of TWO sheets, even though it gets cosiderably slower!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfect junk","review":"This shredder managed to make it thru the warranty period before a total crash. Even with light usage, the shredder struggled -- but when it broke, you could see why -- this is garbage. The cutting blades are housed in a lightweight plastic housing that obvioiusly couldn't handle any load for more than a few months use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Performance - I'm Returning It","review":"The performance of this machine is terrible. Just opened it up, plugged it in, and after attempting to shred a few sheets (one at a time) experienced a colossal paper jam. Put it back in the box to return tomorrow. It would be more efficient and gratifying to scissor documents with pinking shears."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's always jammed!!!","review":"This shredder performs terribly! It's supposed to have a 6 sheet capacity but it's really only 2 (or less). Put more than 2 sheets and it'll get jammed so that you have to set it in reverse and back about 5 times. And using only 1 sheet doesn't even prevent the jams. Sad to say it's a terrible product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage - DANGEROUS- No support","review":"I was given this as a gift and used it once for less than an hour then unplugged and stored it. Second time I had it plugged in, shredded about 5 minutes and went to the store and returned to find it running with no paper in it, very hot to the touch. Opened it to see if there was something stuck (though it stopped by itself before I left) and found the detedtion light had burned out. Contacted Fellowes and they claim this is not a defect.Fine - I'd love to have a machine just start running by itself when no one is around. My kids don't need their fingers for much and I DO have fire insurance."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is piece of junk and expensive","review":"I used this shredder for about a year and now it is broke (the inside plastic guide disintegrated). None of the advertised specs are accurate. It will not shred more than 2 psc of paper. It jams often & it is noisy. During this period I cut approximately 1000 pages, and paid for the shredder $60. This results in a cost of 6 cents per page!! This is the worst product, relative to it spec, I ever bought!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want one, mine is in the dumpster","review":"I hate this thing. One of the worst purchases I've ever made. Can't even handle ONE peice of paper without jamming.

I'll never buy a Fellowes product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your Money","review":"This product is not worth the plastic it is made of.

It has always chewed up 6 sheets without difficulty. But now, even with just one sheet, the shredder does not turn off automatically."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware","review":"I paid top dollar for this shredder at Office Depot. It jammed after the first three sheets of paper. I went back to the store, and I was told I had to add cutting oil while it was working. I stood over the top of this machine pouring oil onto the cutters to get the junk mail shredded for one day. It would not even cut one page of newspaper. I continued to stuff newspaper in it until the top bulged and the room filled with smoke. Now it is in the trash, which is where I should have put the first time it jammed up. I will never buy another Fellowes product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Rubbish","review":"Had this for less than a year. In the first six months it jammed constantly and wouldn't take more than one page of paper without problems. Then the problems really began. Crunching and clicking sounds were followed by it stopping working entirely. The motor still went, but the shredder blades stopped turning. It was taken apart to see what was wrong and it was discovered that almost all the internal cogs are made of plastic. One of these cogs had broken. Parts are not available so the entire shredder had to thrown away. This fault is very common, leading to it appearing to be a deliberate design flaw. In other words these things are designed to crap out.I will never by another Fellowes shredder, they are absolute rubbish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy.","review":"This is a terrible product.

It struggles with two sheets of paper. It gets hot and stops during use. It no longer wants to shut off. The supplied bin is small and fills up after a few sheets of paper (which doesn't happen too quickly due to the shredder's pathetic abilities). I owned a Fellowes strip shredder for approximately 20 years without incident. It was made in USA. I'm guessing the Chinese manufacturing \\"partners\\" of Fellowes have a hearty laugh each time they load up the export container full of these truly awful shredders.

We bought it for our small office. You are lucky if you can shred one piece of paper let alone 6 that it claims. And if you do get that piece of paper shredded, it jams up with paper. We have tried oiling it and everything. It works better for a little bit, but then goes back to jamming."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!","review":"1st of all its really had to clean up the crinkled paper this thing produces. just leaves paper flakes flying all over the place and it gets stuck in the teeth.

Its expensive too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre product... poor quality.","review":"I had this shredder for a little over a year, with occasional use (some bills, papers with SSN, etc). It was OK, with many safety features. It shredded fine for a while but it started making clicking noises and getting stuck (needed to reverse in order to 'set it loose'. Its supposed to do 6-8 sheets at a time but it had trouble with 3. Eventually it stopped working and after opening it up, I saw that many of the plastic components inside had cracked and fell into the shredding blades.

My only complaint is that it does not contain the notes and annotations that a version such as the New American Bible does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good version. RSV is most accurate.","review":"The RSV is the most accurate English translation available for Christians.

As with most cheap sifters, the screen cannot practically be removed for cleaning, but what makes this sifter worse is the unreliable design, materials, and poor metalurgy and finishing in the mechanism. In the example I received, the axle jammed and broke after just a few uses. In attempting to repair the mechanism, I cut my finger (minor) on the unfinished edge of the stamped sheet metal. I cannot be bothered to return this piece of junk, so I just threw it away.

Therefore I spent over $300 for the DVDs, relying on the opinions offered to Amazon.I have played three of them and have been very dissapointed. The productions have bastardised the novels. The acting becomes laborious, the plots rediculous,the low-cost production obvious, and most of all boring. I cannot stand to look at the rest of the serious and have not done so.I will gladly ship the lot off to anyone who will pay the shipping from South Africa.

The set was well priced and delivery came quickly. The problem came when I tryed to view them. 60% of the videos would simply stop somewhere in the show, causing me to go back to menue and fast forward past the \\"bad\\" spot. Depending on the video they would stop once, twice, three times or more. One was so bad that it could not be viewed at all. In an attempt to solve this problem, I asked my neighbors to come over and try. After some effort they gave up in disgust. We tryed it on the neighbor's player with the same results. I even went out and purchased a new DVD player and met with the same results. The last three in the series played just fine - big deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ty 3 The Tasmanian Tiger","review":"I picked up this game for like 15 bucks at a retail store just to try something new, and it was surprisingly fun to play.

The reviews that say the PS40 dosnt have any torque, must be talking about something else. I just got done helping my brother in law put a roof on their barn and i used this thing on 3 1/2 inch and 2 1/2 inch screws all day (1 battery change). I was putting screws straight into nots in the wood which were very stiff and it just pushed them in. I also used it to fasten sheet metal to the roof and using self tapping screws it was so easy. I picked up my dewalt 18v drill/driver and tried it out for comparison but the bosch impact driver is just so much handier, the dewalt went back in the box. Great ergonomics, good power, and style make this my favorite tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"great design, but","review":"Bosch PS40-2 10.8V Impact DriverTerific design.

The battery charge last a long time and I'm very impressed with the life of the battery. It is easy to take on a roof or hold above your head when I am putting up supply grills.The light on the drill is genius, Seems I'm always in a place that is dark so the light lights up the area of the screw.This drill is not for boring holes in wood, You would need a larger capacity drill for that. But for most jobs this drill is a must tool.It has taken a beating for a year and still runs perfect. One of my buddies was so impressed he had to get one too."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment - too weak to be useful","review":"Although the design and construction of the PS40 is very good, mine did not produce much torque. Bosch claims 800 in-lbs of torque, but I doubt it. For example, I attached a 1/2\\" socket and tried to remove a 5/16\\" machine bolt. The PS40 couldn't do it - not enough torque. I then used a hand wrench to remove the bolt, and it only required a moderate amount of effort to do so. My old Milwaukee impact driver had no problem removing bolts of that size. As another test I held the socket with my hand as I pulled the trigger all the way back. I was easily able to prevent the socket from turning. And this was with a fully charged battery.It might be good for hobby use, but not in an industrial setting. I returned mine to Amazon for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I paid $199 for this driver at lowes, I broke my makita 14.4 2.6ah ( my bad, not the drivers) I was in the middle of building a deck. so I read the reviews and need something right away, This bosch PS40 driver does not have any guts at all You cannot and will not be able to do anything bigger than hang small doors, I just order the makita combo kit from amazon for the same money, Even at the new lower price. There are lot better choices out there"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"Reading the other reviews it seems like you get either a weak one or a powerful one, I got a weak one.

The PS-20 pocket driver is awesome and while far from perfect the I-driver has it's uses but this thing is worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"whoa","review":"This is not a bad tool. It is an overpriced (though sexy) toy. It costs as much as their 14.4 impact (which is the best on the market in it's class) with nowhere near 1/2 the power or run time. It is lighter and slightly smaller, but disappointing in terms of performance. I would reconsider its merits if it were sold as a bare tool. As it is, I have the 3 drivers 6 batteries, and 3 chargers. Once in a while, it is convenient to have a small driver. The I-driver does what no other tool can do. I wish the PS20 had a regular keyless chuck. Having to carry all 3 bags around is ridiculous, and I wish I could get my money back on the PS40."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bosch PS40-2 10.8V Impact Driver Hobby grade at best","review":"This tool does not perform up to the claims made by Bosch. The impact has no torque or speed. With a full charge the batteries only lasted for about 25 3\\" screws in 2x4 soft pine. This would be a great tool for hobbyist, or if you needed to put some screws into styrofoam. Any one that makes a living with their tools will be very dissapointed in this impact driver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bosch PS40-2 Impact Driver","review":"Of several impact drivers I own, this is the one I try first, if it is too puny for the job, I go up the scale, 12v, 18v. The light weight is nice and the compact size fits many small jobs. One place that the impact drivers are really handy is taking stuff apart. I had to dismantle some deck benches, the galvanized screws were pretty well seated and coroded, the impact was the secret weapon to get that initial twist to back out screws without ripping up the screw heads. Also, the LI battery is always ready to go, they do not go dead on the shelf. One downside is the placement of the Fwd/Rev switch, I would rather have it on top of the tool, too easily bumped as it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compact, Lightweight, and Handy Impact Gun","review":"AWESOME, this a a VERY handy impact gun, no electric chords, etc.IS lightweight.Has neat led's that light up when you pull the trigger to allow you to see what you are doing, this becomes handy all the time.The batterys (comes with two) charge quickly, are light, compact, and just plain neat!The impact features a quick attach system, which is good and bad, depending on your intended use.Impact could use some more power, but works for most tasks.This is VERY durable, one time I did not have a hammer handy, so i took the impact and slightly banged the back of the imopactor into a big ol' steel screw, and the impact thus proved itself to be exceptionally durable! Suprisingly!This is an absolutly wonderfull product and I couldn't see doing without it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Have lots of tools but didn't have a small impact driver","review":"I got tired of using a huge impact because of the weight and mostly because it was just too much on anything medium sized or smaller.

Also, considering Gussow's Schaum's Outline of Basic Electricity was last published in 1983, age might also have been a factor. However, the regular Schaum's on this subject just came out in December 2006, and it has been extensively updated and covers the material this book covers and much more, plus it is just as easy to follow as this book is. You get an extra 300 pages of material for an extra two dollars.

While her work is excellent, her records tend to go out of print after a few years.

It would fit in quite well in the general jazz market, and I would rate it five stars.Her earlier albums, \\"In the Evening\\" and \\"Wisdom of a Child\\" are unfortunately long gone.

ALthough a non-fiction, this book is very evocative of the hard-scrabble lives that made up Market Street in its heyday.

Herold gets credit for the music which igores Rossini's (Barber...) and Donizetti's (L'Elisir...) contributions - so I mention them here.

Carl Funks music is reminiscent of Cat Stevens and other popular artist of the 70's. His music is fresh, with creative sounds, that have been superbly mixed to go with his vocals. When I listen to this CD I play it in a rotation with BARENAKED LADIES, MATCHBOX 20, MEATLOAF, AND BLUES TRAVELER. When one of Funks songs plays into to the rotation I always find it refreshing and full of energy. From what I hear he's from Seattle and has several other CD's.

It is this diversity that is it's strength. While all the music is done by different artists it still maintains it's underlying theme of moodiness, grit and blues. Stand outs by the Stone's and Sinatra really set the tone. I found myself enjoying not only songs by artists I had never heard before but also in a language I wasn't familiar with. I still feel that the first soundtrack was better and more cohesive but this is a worthy successor."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can't have everything.","review":"Of course there were selections I wanted to hear that weren't on it, but still a very good collection. No \\"When this battle is over, who will wear the crown?\\" (I wish I knew the artist), and some others. Very worthwhile. Late-breaking news flash: \\"When this battle is over...\\" can be found on an old album (still available) \\"Delaney and Bonnie and Friends\\". It's from the 60's. I believe Delaney and Bonnie were mostly backup singers who were very well-liked by many musical notables of the period, hence their friends helped them with this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome collection for a Sopranos follower","review":"If you've followed the series, and felt a compelling association with the characters and their charisma, you'll relive that joy and connection with the songs in this collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like Being there","review":"I bought this collection for one song only but have ended up enjoying the entire CD.

We are planning on purchasing Rough Guides for all of our trips, to make the most of the maps, trip, and restaurant suggestions.

I had seen the flags outside our house marking the gas line and it dawned on me why not use flags. I got the hot pink ones so they cannot be confused with the water, gas, and other \\"official\\" flags. They work great! When there is a sea of pink flags in the backyard it's time for my son to go clean 'em up. It goes so much faster & he doesn't complain as much. My neighbor even likes them because she can see where the messes are and knows not to park the car to close to them so her kids won't step in them. I am hoping they will make cleanup in the winter snow easier & faster too. Only problems I have had are they rusted with all the rain and are easy to bend if the ground is too hard. But for the price, amount of flags, & not having to hear my son complain it's to hard & takes to long they are worth the money & I will most likely buy more in the spring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yard Flags","review":"I bought these to mark my dog's poo in the yard.

She writes some many negative things that it was hard to read. Often saying things like 'nothing works.' and 'it's dilapitated'.Is was also patronising in many parts for example when she says 'Nigerians are dumbfounded to see foreigners on the street.' Nigeria has many expatriates and nobody bats an eyelid when a non Nigerian walks past.Terrible book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good analysis","review":"This book is an excellent brief analysis of elites in America.

The issue of the American Elite--the way they vote, the way the shop, what they think--is one that will not go away any time soon. The issues raised here violate the standard neo-Marxian parable about a united and naturally politicized elites that act, within their own self interest, to violate the rights of the proletariat; the wealthy and the elite in fact have no such comprehensive interests, and vote like much of the country, based on the way their parents voted. Other revelations come, naturally, but one must purchase the book to fully gather the analytic power of the book.It is a wonderful, interesting book, that does very interesting things with somewhat aged numbers. Definitely worth a purchase if you have any interest in the American Elite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning Printing Error Page Missing From Brand New Book","review":"I bought the book and set a few months ago(Brand new and factory sealed).

Having been in this field for 18 years (many languages and platforms), I expected a lot from this book. Maybe too much. The first part, where the author tells about story after story of misery, is easily shared by anyone in the field long enough. I expected a follow-up showing how to fix it. It looked promising in the discussion about looking at things from other points-of-view. However, it never got in any depth. Instead, it jumped off into simple project management that might be handy for a first-time project or technical lead -- not going in-depth like I expected. I guess I would still buy it again, but maybe not. Hence, four stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A realistic view of the world of programming as an occupational choice","review":"Not a typical book from Apress but definitely appropriate for their audience, The Career Programmer teaches the highly skilled programmer the non-technical skills involved in getting a job or starting a career as a contract programmer. Contained within the pages of the book is a distillation of the stuff you did not learn in college but need to know to work in the real world. Some of the problems the author examines include working in an imperfect world with unrealistic deadlines and expectations, dealing with changing expectations, estimating techniques, keeping the project under control, getting a job versus flying solo, and how to do either. In the real world good coding skills are simply not enough to survive. You have to learn to deal with corporate politics. The Career Programmer, Second Edition is highly recommended to those who are or want to become programmers for a living."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fact book, an eye opener for software development","review":"This is not a how to book. There is no simple recipe on how to improve our business. Although all companies seems alike they all have small differences. But software releases are often overdue and over budget.As a programmer in the field, I had decided a while ago I had enough of all the politics and problems related to software development. My solution was to do my master degree in project management. Going to school part-time openened my eyes and my mind to the corporate America and how management is viewing the programmers. The book will do the same thing: it will opened your eyes and your mind about upper management.Just like the commentary given by John Robbins on the back cover:\\"An extremely important message for the software business\\".Enjoy reading it and relate your own story as you go along."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this book","review":"The author provides desillusioned and cynic guidelines on how to survive in a Dilbert world, where everybody who is not a developer is assumed incompetent until the opposite is proven. Make your managers sign things in blood, or they will cheat you, keep your back free, and deceive your management in order to trick them to do the right thing.The book is supposed to have been printed in 2006, but it seems more like a manuscript picked up from the 80's. The author seems to live in a world where waterfall processes are the only option, and completely ignores modern development process structures that address some of the frustrations he experiences. It may also go to history as the last book to recommend Hungarian notation.To be fair, the author makes some accurate observations on project dynamics, but they are not worth all the bitterness.Do not read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of vapor, little substance...","review":"You'd get more & better advice out of 2 panels of Dilbert than from this messy compilation of uninsightful bromides.

Firstly, these type of journeys through baseball history should not be in books the size of a CD case. Secondly, the information is amazingly disjointed with no discernable pattern and thirdly the book looks like it's been put together by the folks at the Monty Python Animation Department.Don't waste your money, there are many books out there that cover the information this one does but in a nicer, more comprehensive way.

If you are looking for a suspenseful, true story, this is it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Puncture","review":"Not long after his turn as Captain America, Chris Evans hit theaters again, but this time in a very small, very limited release called Puncture. Based on true events, the film focuses on a pair of Houston lawyers who agree to defend an ER nurse who's been pricked by a contaminated needle. As the attorneys delve deeper into the case, they uncover a web of conspiracy that involves a widespread medical issue and the shady underbelly of the pharmaceutical industry. I was willing to go with the story, which I found compelling, but I was a little reluctant to buy into the formulaic plotting that drove the narrative along. Puncture isn't quite the equivalent of The Insider, but it should get the job done for those looking for a passable potboiler featuring a rising star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoot me!","review":"This was the worst movie I have watched in two years.

I will definitely \\"obstain\\" from reading Savage's other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"~~~AWESOME~~~","review":"A great book....if you have read Savage before, you will recognize his crazy humor.

This included 3 crying-breaks and numrous occasions of laughing out loud. A very entertaining read.For those interested in detailed mechanics of various adoption options, however, this is not a \\"how-to\\" book. For example, only passing mention of the \\"international route\\" is made and the only two options really discussed and compared are domestic open vs. closed adoptions. The case for the open route is soundly made."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book!","review":"I can't recommend this book enough, unless you are homophobic or have a problem with gays adopting children. This was a well-written heartwarming read that actually changed some of my views on the topic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Book!","review":"I have always admired Dan Savage for his cynicism and bold truth-telling as a sex-columnist.

Humor and a great story of support for all going through adoption process!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stayed up all night to finish","review":"Usually I can only say that about whodunits. This book is so engaging. I am already familiar with Dan from his columns and find his frankness and common sense to be a great relief from the usual columnist panderings. In case it matters, I'm a straight female, middle aged and widowed. I haven't always been open minded about homosexuality, but am very glad that I evolved out of that state of ignorance. I hope our country does too. I recommend this book highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Both thoughtful and enjoyable","review":"Dan Savage, a parent? THE Dan Savage, gay sex-column adviser, whose sarcastic take on sex and outrageous writing style have made him a cult figure in \\"alternative\\" publications around the country?Well, yup. In this entertaining book, Savage details the decisions and processes involved when his partner Terry and him decided to adopt, using the Portland \\"open adoption\\" method. Emotional without being sentimental, Savage describes his supportive family and friends (as well as the non-supportive ones), and makes no apologies for his choices. Far more than a simple \\"gay couple wants baby\\" polemic, this book describes the trials and tribulations of adoption faced by ALL parents; indeed, what makes it so startling is its matter-of-factness. In the end, Dan and Terry come off as no better or worse than any other prospective parents, and it is this which is probably most revolutionary. An entertaining, yet intellectual, read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Dan Savage is not the warm-fuzzy type of gay man that I typically think of as wanting to start a family. He's a grungy, urban, sex advice columnist who tells it like it is. He's extremely likable and this book is fabulous. I couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big deal, so you're gay and adopting!","review":"So what? Dan Savage is gay and adopting, does he have to write a book about that? Just because he's a writer and has means to find a publisher to pubish his otherwise mediocre book? Don't be mistaken, I'm gay and we're going through the adoption process too but I just think he's being too melodramatic about this. I don't like the way he writes, too lengthy and long-winded. He also tends to go into the smallest details abou their lives. This is an OK book, nothing too exciting, might have more meaning if you are adopting but otehrwise, stay away from it. p/s I like his columns though..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A poignant, engrossing memoir of an adoption","review":"I read this book in one day-- it's that good. It speaks directly to the experience of big-city gay men in the late nineties: the combination of near-total societal tolerance (if not complete acceptance) and the unprecedented possibilities we have to live a \\"virtually normal\\" (to use the words of another recent author) life, one that might even include adoption and child-raising. I had assumed this book would be written in the same super-jaded, outrageous style of Dan's \\"Savage Love\\" sex-advice column, but instead this is a moving true story of hope and possibility, written by a man who has been humbled by an experience too many gay people have assumed we'll never be able to have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabuluos Book, also a life changing book","review":"I brought this book home and had my sister, that was still uneasy about me being gay, read the book. She enjoyed the book and totally changed her view about homosexuality. She now can see how homosexuals are reagular people and she wants me to learn more from Dan Savage. Oh by the way, she is 15 and this is the second English book she ever read. Anyway, buy this book for your family, your friends. It could make them understand what being gay is all about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most honest adoption book I've ever read","review":"I've read numerous books on this topic, from a variety of different perspectives: adoptive parents, birth parents, adopted children, adoption counselors, etc. But this is by far the best I've come across. It is refreshingly honest in its perspective of an adoptive parent (although sometimes heartbreakingly so). While I am an admitted fan of the author (both his column and other books), I really can't recommend this book strongly enough to anyone who has adopted, is in the process of adopting or is considering doing so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious and Touching!","review":"I had a great time reading this book.

I'm a straight female mother. I read Dan's book non-stop...it is hilarious. It's a wonderful look at a committed gay relationship...so very much like any straight committed relationship. Here's a glimpse of what it's like to be an openly gay couple, and then to be gay parents in a society which is starting to rid itself of homophobic prejudices. To the publisher: PLEASE have Dan Savage write another book about his son D.J.'s early years!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarassing, offensive and shallow-TYPICAL SAVAGE","review":"I read this book before I ever read his column which I found to be extremely stupid in its quippy sarcastic humor. Basically he makes it sound like he and his boyfriend didnt want to do the stereotypical gay couple things so then decided to adopt. His perception of the process to becoming a parent really sounds like they were getting a new accesory. In his favor, I've seen Savage on Bill Maher and enjoyed him, I just cant stand his column or this stupid book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I pity the child","review":"Its not because he's gay, cause I am as gay as he is, but this guy is a crass, insensitive and rude and I pity the child who has to live under that influence.

Ironically (and tragically), it comes from the author: \\"Having children is no longer about propagating the species . . . [it is] something for grownups to do, a pasttime, a hobby. So why not kids? Gay men need hobbies, too.\\"Raising a child a hobby? How can anyone consider himself \\"grownup\\" when he sees raising a child as nothing more than a hobby?Unfortunately for the gay community, this book provides rich fodder for those who oppose it and who oppose gay adoption.

John Davis researched the Georgia slave and possibly savaunt musical prodigy of the mid 1800s, and came up with as many as 100 compositions this blind man wrote. Mr. Davis played a few pieces on the show and I knew I had to have the CD. Since I enjoy semi to classical music on the order of Chopin, Mozart, Offenbach and Ragtime music by Scott Joplin, and others, I had goose bumps when I heard the whole CD. You want to hum, tap your feet, and just take in this mans' melodic music. There is a little bit of Chopin and Joplin intermixed and I thought the sound of the piano and pianist were excellent. One should know the story of this composer and realize what he went through; but there's also a happy ending of sorts. I am just a consumer, but I recommend this CD highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Undiscovered gems","review":"This album is a revelation.

It contains 120 sample hands including the bidding and cards for each player shown on a different page. Each sample hand is told as a story that is readable and often funny as well as instructive. For example, there is the \\"Devil of the Deal\\" played between Lucifer and a fourth from the land of Nod against Adam and Eve sitting North-South. There is \\"A Spicy Deal\\" that describes play among Cumin, Rosemary, Ginger and Margaret. There is the \\"Pessimism Pays\\" deal that describes how finesses are avoided by expert players in favor of end-game squeezes.

The photographs are detailed to show specifically what not to do and what we should all be working toward as a solid position. This book will not go into depth on the mental aspect and serious training issues dealing with competition. That is destined for a second book. This book will provide enough thought to review and diagnose a variety of situations with positions, equipment, trigger control, and breathing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harold Adams is one of my favorites!","review":"Any Harold Adams mystery is worth reading.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Another reviewer praised this scanner because it scanned photos well. I would concur, but other than that this scanner is a bust. It is clumsy to use and the controls are not user friendly. Despite claiming to make use of USB 2.0 technology it is excruciatingly slow, even with plain B&W low res text. It is virtually useless for scanning multiple pages of text into, for example, a .pdf file because after each page you have to tell it what you want it to scan again. And whose idea was the black background on the lid? Since it is difficult and time consuming to set up and scan you often end up with scans that are bordered with black rather than white. Endless pixels of waste that have to be cropped and also sacrafice some of the quality of the scan. I plan on donating the scanner to the Goodwill and I kick myself for not returning it while I had the chance"},{"rating":"1","title":"reveiws are great ,product for me not great","review":"I was in need of a scanner and after reading reviews in pcworld,pc mag and others decided on the s400. bought it locally and followed the install instructions that came with the product. First install software,then connect scanner to power and usb it to computer. I was ready for my first scan. Unfortunatly the driver for the scanner that is included did not recognize the scanner. So i called support up on my dime and was on the phone with them for over 30 minutes and they told me to download the updated driver which is on the web site. I did,uninstalled the driver that came with it and installed the new driver. It worked for about 20 min and then the scanner would not activate. So unstead of calling support again i returned it. To pay for support during the installation process is not for me. I am sure this is a fine unit,but for me it did not work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hunk of garbage","review":"I wish I could give this heap of trash 0 stars. The software is buggy, it installs applications that run every time you log in (Mac OS X) and they took extra time to make it unbelievably difficult to disable.The documentation is written in Chinglish, and fails to cover common problems. And get a load of their support web site's \\"knowledge base\\"I suffered with this waste of time for a couple of months, but it just stopped bothering to show up on my USB bus. What a mistake I made buying this loser.Since this scanner died, I've replaced it with a Canon CanoScan 8400F, which is much faster and is bundled with software of much better quality. The documentation for the 8400F also seems to be written by people who speak English. The image quality from the CanoScan is also fantastic, much nicer than I'd been able to get out of the S400 (while it worked)."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a POS No Mac OSX Support***Company going under***","review":"I gave it one star because there was no other option.

Works well except for the software, which crashes often, and their tech support is a waist of time. Does not support Leopard 10.5, which has determined the rating of zero. Makes me wonder how many more scanners will not be supported. Their website is often down and other reviews state the same issues as I have. I now have an anchor for my boat. Do not purchase a Microtek product. Go with Epson or Canon, both with excellent user reviews.Update 6/21/08Microtek website (US) non functioning.

I'm a network administrator and I work on computers day in and day out. I have endless patience for these things but this one tested my limits. After serious digging I've found a couple others that said to ditch their software/driver package entirely and use something else. Either Silverfast ($50) or Vue Scan.

Wanted to see if a repair was feasible...but to my unpleasant surprise, discovered that Microtek has shut down North American operations. No repair facilities, no over-the-phone technical support.So I would advise against buying this product despite its quality.

Schenker has a knack for finding the worst possible vocalists with the stupidest most banal 'we're gonna rock, yeah, come on, girl, tonight!' lyrics possible. And here he writes crotch brained riffs in Am to match. The worst. Blame it on the medication?This was a major letdown after his two very good and very strong instrumental efforts.

Of course, his tone and the marvellous sounds he can take from his Gibson are still there, majestic, catchy, wonderful. But the songs, as a whole, are weak. It became clear that Michael's (as MSG) best work is now profoundly buried in the past...The songs could make an impression of being \\"laid back\\" (therefore the title of my review), but they are just weak.If you wanna hear Michael in top form, stick to his recent solo albums, \\"ADVENTURES OF THE IMAGINATION\\" and \\"DREAMS AND EXPRESSIONS\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"rock elevator music","review":"This CD is just plain boring and unimaginative.

But she makes friends with Sarah and Smita, who help her adjust. I think this is one of the best BSC books. I don't want to give away the ending.

Ax is, of course, a wonderful pianist as well - these two playing together are probably one of the best balanced duos of all the ones that have been listed in other reviews - certainly for a piece like this one. They work very well together, and know how to express most everything that this piece has to offer, without any extras - just Rachmaninov.

I was curious of what the song maybe like, so I surfed the net and found that the song is just GREAT! For some reason I found that there's some similarity to Rachmaninoff's concertos.

I have heard wonderful Prokofiev, Ibert and Stravinsky from this pairing.I cannot extend that admiration to this justifiably withdrawn production, however. To state it as simply as possible, the approach Maestro Mata adopted to the monumental \\"Leningrad\\" symphony is just too pretty. He tries to make beautiful music out of a score that represents the heroism of Russians under attack by both Hitler and Stalin.There is little reason for you to approach this CD unless you want to hear an inappropriate performance of this music.

About the best thing I can say about it is that the descriptions of Venice are evocative, and the author does a good job of having the main character - Cassandra - act as tour guide. On the negative side, I was disappointed in both the characters and the mystery. The characters are unlikable and unsympathetic - including Cassandra. She also does some very stupid things; if she's developing a reputation for solving mysteries, it must be pure dumb luck. The ending - when everything is all tied up neatly - felt rushed. Ignore the beautiful book cover, and avoid The Case of the Orphaned Bassoonists. If you want to read GOOD mysteries set in Venice, look for Donna Leon's novels. Each one is better than the last, and the very first one, \\"Death at La Fenice,\\" is 10 times better than this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vegetable Mix vs Soup Greens","review":"I would give Soup Greens, which I can no longer seem to find, five stars.

This one, however, is negligible. both the Scythian Suite and Le sacre du printemps receive cautious, at times awkward readings. Mata, who died in a plane crash in 1995 at the age of 52, had brought prominence to the Dallas SO when it always ran second place to Houston. The playing is good here, but Mata doessn't stretch his musicians, and frankly, he seems rather blank as an interpreter. Being Mexican, he was characterized by reviewers as some kind of fiery Latin, but in reality his instincts were moderate - in this case, too moderate to successfully lead these two revolutionary works.The only real plus here is Dorian's excellent sound, an example of a boutique label outshining the major labels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I am an Esthetician and was looking for a DVD to take my facial massage to the next level, this was not it.

Their most recent effort, Temple of Shadows has also become one of my top ten favorite albums of all time. A curious thing about prog metal bands is that they seem to get better with each successive album. In my opinion, Angra is no exception. Although Rebirth is a good album, particularly the opening tracks, In Excelisis/Nova Era, it doesn't quite live up their latest work. The CD starts off with a bang but, unlike Shadows, never really reaches the crescendo you hope for. If you're new to Angra, I'd recommend starting off with Temple of Shadows and working backward from there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Rebirth","review":"This album can't hold a candle to all previous Angra albums: Angels Cry, Holy Land (their masterpiece) and even Fireworks.Even if they got rid of that annoying screaming singer by the name Andre Matos, that was not enough to save this album. Angra gave up the idea of being original and went for a generic \\"melodic-European-power metal\\", aping acts like Rhapsody and Stratovarius. The result was a disgrace. The drumming is annoying, double kick all the way. The new singer has a good voice, but all he do is be a metal screamer with no personal touch in his tone.I just hated this album, to the point that I gave it for free to a friend of mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"REBIRTH ????","review":"If ANGRA really wanted to make a \\"Rebirth\\", they should not have hired a singer that sounds exactly like a copy of Andre Matos, nor go to a German studio to record a CD that sounds exactly the same as hundreds of other European symphonic / power metal bands !!!

Based on the description on Amazon and on the manufacturer's website, I thought this case was going to be top notch. I was disappointed, to say the least. The case looks fine (thus the two stars), but it is almost impossible to type a message with the Blackberry in the case because the cover is so stiff. Maybe it will soften up in time, but until then, you will have to take your device out of the case to use the keyboard. Additionally, the case muffled the ring tone to a degree that it was almost impossible to hear the device even at the highest ringer volume. The swivel clip is also not up to expectations. It's cheaply designed and swings freely while on your belt. I expected a notched swivel that would allow for a fixed position, much like those found on the majority of cell phone cases today.Back to the hunt for an efficiently designed and functional Blackberry case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I made the mistake of ignoring the first review and purchasing this item anyway because of the price.

There is distortion whenever one of the featured sopranos--especially Sutherland--enters the high register, and the hissing background sound that persists throughout the recording is utterly distracting.

Sutherland's arias in \\"Semiramide\\" are nothing compared to the bravura arias that Sills sings in \\"Giulio Cesare\\". If Sutherland were to sing those arias using Sills' extremely difficult embellishments, she would choke! Sills' coloratura technique sees her through all kinds of coloratura arias, whether Baroque, bel canto, Mozartian, or Straussian.By the way, Baroque coloratura is more difficult than bel canto coloratura due to its even more complicated fioratura."},{"rating":"2","title":"cheese spreaders/Easter","review":"These are great!

Since then this is the single most often listened to CDs I have. It is so great! Her voice reminds me of Tanita Tikaram, Sophie B. Hawkins and a bit Joan Osborne - it's strong with a vibrato; the songs are absolutely the latest of our times, with special sounds in the background. There are two video clips on the CD too. I am so glad that I've found her music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"~It will give you Ghost Bumps~","review":"This disc is the greatest debut record since Chris Whitley's \\"Living With The Law\\" (1991). The two records are very different but they share the same ingredient - monumental talent. Amanda Ghost penned all the lyrics and co-wrote every song. A great musical poetess is born! Her songs are seemingly autobiographical yet plumb so far into the realm of universal emotion that everyone will be left thinking, \\"Wow! That's how I feel too.\\" The musical flavors are diverse and consist of rock, hip-hop, Indian (she's half Eastern Indian), orchestral pop, and folk. There are two videos included on the disc that can be viewed in QuickTime. ... Rolling Stone gave \\"Ghost Stories\\" 3 1/2 stars but I have a feeling they will be forced to revise their rating upwards when this disc becomes a rock classic.

I heard her first on my James Hardway CD, A Positive Sweat, where she did the vocals for 4 of his songs. Her voice is well suited to jazz-infused drum'n'bass, and she also charmed me with the way she harmonized with herself on overlapping tracks... The Grow single from James' album, [is] where she really shines. Also, I'm not a big Madonna fan, but I know on some tribute album, Amanda sings a cover of \\"Bad Girl\\", with James remixing the tune.

If you think about it, there's not really much that you can object to -- the flaky characters are likable, the plot is helped along by various humorous/embarassing/poignant incidents, and the writing is quite good. Lipman's books are well-packaged reflections of real life, suitable for a bit of entertainment and escapism. After all, it's much more fun to read about the dating woes of someone else than to dwell on your own. The Way Men Act falls into this category as well. It's a fun book, full of quick-paced dialogue, interesting characters, and humorous observations."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Contemporary Novel of Manners","review":"What happens when three \\"townies\\" return to a college town to open trendy stores, is the subject of \\"The Way Men Act\\".

There is no discussion of the GRE Chem test in particular, though there is a long-winded, painfully out-of-date section on the GRE General test. The practice test appears to date from a time when test-takers wrote in their answers to the questions by hand. The only study material is some (again, very dated) notes at the end of the book. They are not tailored at all to the GRE, and they are not at the right level. They seem like notes from a high-school or intro college chemistry class.Do anything at all to prep for the GRE, as long as it isn't buying this book. Get something from Kaplan or Princeton Review.

Well, they stop and give our traveling murderer a ride, and become his captives. The rest of the movie concerns the trio's journey through the desert of mexico. How can two normal joes possibly escape from a maniac, who not only has a gun, but sleeps with one eye open? How can they even hope to survive a man who has already killed everyone else he's come in contact with? I liked this one. It would make a great double feature with THE SADIST. They both have that nerve racking \\"if only we'd never met this guy\\" sort of vibe. Not bad..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Pick Up Hitch-hikers!!","review":"Frank Lovejoy and Edmond O'Brien go on a fishing trip, but end up the hostages of William Talman, a hitch-hiker who has already killed other drivers, on a trip to Mexico where Talman wants to escape the authorities. The film is short, at seventy minutes, but that keeps the action moving right along. It's tightly edited, and the viewer gets a very real sense of the confinement of the two men. A lot of credit goes to director Ida Lupino, who establishes a mood of tension and desperation, as well as to the fine trio of actors who are all memorable in their roles. It's a smart thriller that will grab your attention and keep it to the very end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Empty Highways","review":"This is a review of THE HITCH- HIKER (1954) directed by Ida Lupino.The storyconcerns two average Joes, played by Frank Lovejoy and Edmund O'Brien, who go on a fishing trip near the Mexican border and happen to pick up a hitch-hiker who turns out to be highway serial killer Emmitt Myers played by William Talman. THE HITCH-HIKER is a suspenseful film noir played to the hilt for all the tension that can be wrung out of the based on truth story written by Collier Young.Ms. Lupino got wonderful performances out of all of the actors, especially star turns from Edmund O'Brien and the usually overlooked Frank Lovejoy.An excellent, look at what can befall the average character once he steps into the world of film noir.

The book takes different stories and weaves them together in a most clever fashion. Makes me wonder if it wasn't composed as separate books - then combined - Ha! Caught Ya! That's the secret! I certainly didn't guess what was coming next and that made the ride even more enjoyable. The characters had depth - no broding overwrought fatalists - and they were living very real lives.

The 3 parts it is missing are the S2, T15, and T20 bits that i would not use anyways. To me it was not a deal at all. I honestly wont use any of the bits aside from the phillips screwdriver bits. Maybe for somebody that is a big deal.I gave it 5 stars since i got what i wanted and the tools seem to be of solid quality. Other people complained about the zipper, but i haven't had it long enough to have a real say in the matter. If you need a quality socket set with some other things tossed in, this is a great deal.

I paid a lot less than the publisher's list price from an Amazon seller and a lot less than the college bookstore price. The color information is all in black and white -- go figure.

When a 2 lane road was the beginning of the interstate. On Route 66 at least there was lots of different things to see and do. The interstate is the high speed bullet train in the U.S. for cars and trucks. I'll will still remember when life was a little less hectic and more enjoyable. More of a trip of exploration and enjoyment to see what was around the next bend.

The author chose to structure the book's five chapters around such things as tourist traps, filling stations, places to eat, motor hotels, and \\"memories\\". While, of course, these are interesting things along a road, the salient characteristic of a road is that it goes from one place to another. What are those places? What sequence of states/towns/views do you encounter as you travel this road? This book provides no geographical context for its pictures and disjointed text about the Mother Road.A road also has a temporal dimension. This book fails to provide a sense of how this great road has changed over time. Although there are pictures from various dates, there is no organization, and old photos are indiscriminantly intermixed with new ones.It is interesting to thumb through the book, but the Route 66 Remembered is only a random collection of scenes with no direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a high quality product","review":"Within the first 2 weeks after I got this fan, it developed this annoying rattling sound, which made it unusable to me. For as much as this fan costs, it is not constructed out of high quality materials. As mentioned in the other reviews, the LEDs are really bright and will bother you if you are sensitive to light while you are trying to sleep. My other major compliant is the remote control. You have to point the remote directly at the little receiver on the fan for it to pick up the signal. I ended up have to push the buttons on the remote about 10 times before the fan responds. If this fan is in your price range, I would recommend looking for a higher quality fan. My fan is going back to the store!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't usually write reviews, so you know I must really hate it to be warning you now","review":"I suggest not buying this fan. It rattles so bad that we can't even watch TV with it running. The LEDs are too bright and distracting as well. I took the whole piece of junk apart and determined that it's the motor and not something simple. From what I've seen from the reviews, I'm not the only one experiencing these problems.

The cleanliness of my teeth felt like I had just returned from the dentist. My new dentist did tell me that he could see that I take good care of my teeth.

I brush and floss regulary, but despite getting rave reviews at my dentist for my teeth, my gums were always inflammed or having problems. I wasn't sure what to do. A new hygienist recommended a water pik for me. I saw this on amazon, and the idea seemed very convenient, and the price was good. I received the package within 3 days. It took about 15 minutes to hookup (just because my old faucet was on tight). At first, figuring out the water pressure took 1-2 tries, but now I can usually get a comfortable pressure in about 15-20 seconds. It works great...the water doesn't pulse, but your teeth and gums get massaged and cleaned just as well. I usually run it for about 60-90 seconds before showering. Well worth the money...I hope this is a product that endures, because I will always be a customer as long as they are in business."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea - disappointing product","review":"I bought this after reading negative reviews of Waterpik products. I had used the Waterpick for years and liked it but it finally broke. The company shipped the product quickly and everything was very good quality. The problem is it just doesn't work. It is more like holding a water hose to your mouth. The water stream is not fine and directed enough to really remove particles and plaque. The oscillation feature of the Waterpick cleans much more quickly and deeply. I sent it back after trying it and nearly drowning a few times. I rate the company highly as they were very helpful about returning it and getting my money back. Maybe they can improve the design so it really does what it is supposed to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"it really works","review":"I was really skeptical when I started to install this. It looked like a piece of junk. It is not, it works great. The holder for the picks is a piece of junk that was meant for something else. I use one of the snap clips you can buy anywhere and it works perfect holding the pick. As with any water pick, you have to figure out how to adjust it for your personal needs. The one we had in the bathroom was such a mess to use that we didn't. A water pick is suppose to be better then flossing and we all know flossing is a real pain.Installs in minutes with a CD video explaining how to.

In contrast, the ShowerBreeze is always out of sight but never out-of-mind since you'll be reminded to use it each and every time you jump into the shower.

I was not excited about adding another appliance to the bathroom countertop. This is so much better! I was not even aware of the shower model but it certainly makes more sense to me. The Shower Breeze offers easy installation though I did wind up buying the 6' hose after trying the 3' first. No mess or appliances at the sink and no worries about mis-spraying in the shower! You will be pleased. You can feel the stream of water working.

No filling of reservoir and no motor noise.However, I noticed right away that the jet is very spread out. So while it give perception of a lot of water, the actual peak force is less. Also, it's more difficult to aim at the right direction.After using it for 2 weeks, I had a gum infection. I switched back to my old $25 interplak, and cleaned out a bunch of stuck debris, and some black blood. For the next few days, I would use the showerbreeze first, then shows my old interplak can clean out additional debris.After not having any dental problem in last 5 years, I think I have something that needs fixing right away, thanks to the showerbreeze."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Shower pressure","review":"No Shower pressure but the product works as advertised.

After only one year of use, the PLASTIC lever that turns it on and off would no longer work because the PLASTIC hole became too big for the allen screw that tightens it down. I believe the inventor made this lever out of PLASTIC instead of metal so he could make MORE money off unsuspecting customers. When I called to get a replacement LEVER, he said they didn't have any, but I could buy another system at a reduced cost. UNBELIEVABLE! I've never heard of ANY OTHER place or product that doesn't have replacement parts. This part couldn't cost him more than 25 cents since it is made from CHEAP PLASTIC and mass produced, yet he SAYS they don't have any. So now, I'm going to go to Lowe's or Home Depot and try to find a lever that will fit on the shower head. This is the WORST company I've ever dealt with as far as customer service goes.

In other words, the opening is too large; it's like sticking a small hose in your mouth. If the opening was a little smaller and more concentrated I think it would be more effective, better utilize the water pressure, and definitely be more comfortable. Also, while it doesn't leak and the quality seems good, aside for the tips that sell separately for $4.95 it's just a rubber hose and inexpensive water valve one could buy at the hardware store. Also, the description says no tools required, but you will need a wrench and some thread seal tape if you don't want it to leak.

It also comes with a companion CD that has a slapped-on label by one of those cheapy home lable kits.

Rooney Lee was the middle son, and was never called Mr. Boo. That honor belonged to the oldest son, George Washington Custis Lee, who would have been 31 in December, 1863, not 21. If this author didn't care enough to get these simple facts right, why would I believe that the rest of his research which he used to weave his fictional story with could be anything like correct. and what enjoyment would I find in reading a story in which I have to check every historical reference to see if it is factual or not.

Ther ar good sized maps, lots of units and great controls. The space missions are cool but could get to be tedious. Too bad they couldn't of made the space battles more diverse like X Wing vs Tie Fighter, that could be a wish list item for Battlefront III. I will say that landing your ship on an enemies capital ship and walking around is pretty cool.My kids have the PS2 version and I started off playing that and got hooked then decided to get the XBox version for myself. The difference is amazing, the XBox version has sharper graphics, the colors pop out more and the lighting effects are better. The game play is the same on both consoles, great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Play as jedis Yoda, Obi Wan, Darth Vader, General Grevious, and Ki-Adi-Mundi?!","review":"In this first person shooter you battle through the Star Wars battles through all episodes, fighting as soldiers on the Republic's side.

That is where you choose a battlefield and pick a side to fight as. Also, you can choose to conquer a galaxy, but it's really boring.

Mostly played CIS. Everything about the graphics and physics of the BF1 look great. BUT I can't say that about BF2!! In BF2 the lasers effects look totally weak on the AAT and they don't do as much damage! You have to actually hit a person to kill them instead of just the shear force of one hitting the ground near them like in BF1.The wrist rockets on SBDs don't do as much damage either. They're weak! The physics of the game have been totally compromised when compared to BF1. Things look blurry and detail looks totally different. Things look really squirrelly in BF2 and it's hard for me to follow everything.I love BF2 - it's great - it's just that it has a totally different look and feel when looking at game play movement.The lasers are totally weak and who's the purple idiot with the crappy laser gun?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Things just got worse","review":"The Biggest problem in this game is the AI there all freakin Idiots they have no brains there not strategic like they were in the first in the first one they were so much smarter and harder to take out.Every now and then you might find one of your allies running into a wall or theyll forget to fire there weopons there that stupidNot only that but all the great levels are gone Bespin is gone completly Rhen Var doesnt exist and the Kasyk level sucks all the new levels suck corascant sucks Dagobah is a stinker the new Geonousis which is were the clone wars took place is now a boring desert.Each team starts off with only 150 guys in the first it was 200 soOver All crappy maps retarded AI and shorter battlesSpace Battles arnt as good as they look.Being a Jedi is alright but a bit stupid.So if you want big maps smarter enemys and Bigger Battles get the first cause the seconds not real great"},{"rating":"2","title":"Battlefront 2","review":"There is a reason this game is 5 years old and still cost so much. There is no game out there like this game. If they were to make Battlefront 3, I would buy whatever platform it comes on. I would recommend this game to anyone who loves starwars. The only two draw backs are if you get up close and with an enemy you must still shoot them. No melee combat for non-hero characters. The other slight problem is if you upgrade a sniper rifle to legendary it is no longer a sniping weapon it is a medium range beam rifle that shoots through multiple targets. It takes a very long time to do this anyway and I am not a sniper so that's ok. This game has unlimited replay value. If you buy this game you will be very satisfied.

Most of your favorite Star Wars characters are available for play. There is a small, but interesting, story line behind the campaign.Pros:Play as Heroes from the 6 Star Wars movies.Improved graphics, sound, and AI from the original Battlefront.Narrative story line from the eyes of the 501st.Cons:While the sound has improved it can be a bit flaky.There are a few new maps, but several of the original Battlefront maps have been removed.If you can find the game for a fair price it is worth it.

More soldier classes, more planets, you can have dogfights in space and you can play as a jedi knight. This is a hard game to put down. Limitless scenarios and game play will keep you occupied for hours on end. I picked up this game back in November and I still play it on occasion. The only down side is the lack od squad control. This sequel limits you to the basic \\"follow me\\" or \\"break off\\" commands. Maybe for lack of memory or just simply to distiguish itself from \\"Republic Command\\". Aside from this very minor gripe, the game itself is flawless. So pick it up today and have fun fight the evil empire or \\"rebel scum\\"!

Very fast paced and complex - sometimes a bit too much so: you can't miss a word or you'll miss something. A short synopsis of the previous 2 books would have been nice, as it's (probably) been a while since the reader has read the first 2 (which are happily back in print in the omnibus edition Dark of the Gods). Also a short glossary would be good too - lots of place names, gods, etc which aren't explained and you have to skip or figure out by context (the list of dramatis personae is useful though).

The following letters are totally gone - e, o, g, l, c, b, n, m., with the rest on their way. I have never had a keyboard where this has happened. The other problem is that the mouse's batteries need to be replaced every 2-3 weeks, and on the keyboard, about every six months. It has been this way since the beginning. Comparatively, on my home set, used as frequently, the batteries are changed about every four or five months on the mouse, and have only been changed twice on the keyboard in three years.

He emits more emotion in some of these songs than the original artists. The sound is a little darker and louder than Blackberry Belle, which is just fine. I was particularly blown away by his rendition of Strange Fruit which was popularized by Billie Holiday. The cover of Black Is The Color made popular by Nina Simone is also equally compelling. I am usually not a fan of covers unless Dulli is involved because most covers are just emotionless derivatives of the original. Once again, Greg Dulli delivers the goods."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I wanted.","review":"I just sold this back through Amazon, I was so disapointed with it. It's an all cover record, and while Greg Duhli does add an interesting twist to the covers, all of the music feels too subdued, too flat.Duhli is lacking the usual passion he brought to the Whigs and the first Twilight Singers recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dawn Power Dissolver","review":"This is the BEST product since sliced bread!

Your cookie sheets will look like new.I bought some used muffin tins that were pretty clean and shiny but you could tell they were used. There was just a little line of brown around a few seams. I sprayed them with my Dawn Power Dissolver, a few passes with a toothbrush and those pans looked brand new.I had trouble finding this locally so when I found it at Ace I bought a case of it. I have a few bottles left but will be looking to buy another case soon.

I am working on that still, so I'll update with info on how well the product works for that purpose. I didn't shop around much since I saw many reviews that said this was not widely available in stores. This is more of a review of the seller. Shipping took longer than average. I was surprised when the item arrived in a Walmart.com box/label. It appears from the shipping labels this seller actually marks up and resells the item & it's shipped from walmart.com. Now, I understand some people may just prefer buying from amazon and don't mind the mark up. But for me, I'm all for capitalism, but blatant mark ups by amazon sellers just seems sleazy. So, skip the middle man and consider buying directly from the walmart site for $2.83 plus 97cent shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"misleading pack","review":"The discription of the product states pack of 10, but only one bottle is included in the shipment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing Power Dissolver","review":"I have used this product extensively, but can no longer find it available at any retail facility in the town where I live.

There is nothing on the market like it that comes close to keeping your range looking new! No scratch marks at all! I must say that this product is very difficult to find. I can't find it in any supermarket near where I leve. I also checked in every supermarket I went in up and down the West Coast of California when we visted a couple of months ago.

It does indeed serve as an LCD cover/protector but at $30, that's pretty expensive. It does not, however, reduce LCD glare at all. I recently purchased one of these for my Rebel XT and took it to the Caribbean during my recent vacation. I couldn't see a thing on the LCD when out in the sun. I always had to find some sort of shade i.e. trees, buildings in order to view the pictures and/or settings on my camera. In a nutshell, this product is a lemon and should be avoided."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best novel ever written","review":"I was given this book in the 80's for consideration as a movie.

His girl is (to me) irritating. But that makes the whole thing a good read. After all, if we wanted happy, we'd read something else.Some call Willeford's writing dry, but I find it clean, refreshing and subtle at times without being dry or dull.If you like any type of noir, I would definitely give this a shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good writing, offbeat fiction, BUT NOT A MYSTERY","review":"This is a fun book but it is not a mystery. I think it is classified as a mystery because so much of Willeford's work is mystery genre.

A must read if you are looking to brush up on recent Cuban history and politics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Facts vs fiction","review":"A book written in 1993 forecasts the immediate downfall of the Castro regime. Twelve years later, Castro remains. The book? Barely there... just a compilation of old Cuban exiles and Dept of State cliches. It's amazing this guy still finds newspapers willing to buy his stuff and people willing to believe him. I guess the reader's short attention span issues are more acute than we thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old Same old","review":"For someone who portrays himself as the expert on the reality of Latin America, Openheimer once again displays his ignorance of the facts.My advice to Openheimer is to write about something which he knows better.

All thinking adults should see this movie and think about the philosophy espoused in the story. My husband and I read the book years ago and my husband is a huge supporter of Ayn Rand's anti-socialism philosophy. The movie makers were wise to use actors and actresses without high name recognition so you identified with their roles instead of their names. The actress playing Dagney Taggert and actor playing Reardon were exceptional in their portrayals. I wish every adult could see this movie before voting in the upcoming election. It would clarify the choice between what happens when socialism overthrows capitalism.

Kahaner takes a closely held secret of some of the top international corporations and exposes it for what it is -- a highly effective marketing tool. Competitive intelligence isn't business spying. It's a process of turning raw information from any number of sources into valuable intelligence. Kahaner is at his best when he's describing the Japanese kiretsu and their powerful use of business intelligence to command international markets. This book completely changed the way I look at business and what it takes to succeed. Now I know the difference between information and intelligence. It's a difference that can mean life and death in today's competitive markets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!! Highly Recommended","review":"This book covers a lot of ground and does it well. Kahaner makes the sometimes hard to understand world of CI easy and attainable. I was able to turn his concepts into real positive change for my company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I learned of this book while reading the \\"Ask Annie\\" column in Fortune (Jan. 7, 2002). I've been in Marketing for 10 years and was looking forward to a good book on competitive intelligence gathering. This covers only the most basic of topics: the plan, do, check, act cycle; annual reports; 10-Qs; government permits; etc. If you don't have a clue where to start in CI you may find this book helpful. If you've done even cursory competitive intelligence gathering before you will not likely find anything new here.I should have paid attention to the reviewer that said, \\"If this is the FIRST book you read on Competitive Intelligence - it is not that bad...\\" I'll add not only if this is the first book, but also your first exposure, otherwise skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want to know more about CI - buy other books!","review":"If this is the FIRST book you read on Competitive Intelligence - it is not that bad; It covers much ground at a fast pace. However, if you have read any of the other books out on CI (Fuld's CI Blue Monster, or even Michael Porter's On Competition) this book is rehashed material that is too elementary to gain any sort of knowledge to furtherer your CI knowledge base. I commend the authors for a good start - but was hoping for much more detail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Journalists take on CI","review":"This is a basic treatment of the field that adds the journalistic element that has been lacking in many other treatments. That has its good and bad points. The good points is that it is likely to drum up interest in the field by those outside of it. The bad point is that it somewhat sensationalizes it for those of us who do it on a day to day basis. Nevetheless, it is a comprehensive overview of CI and provides for interesting anectdotes and stories to share to the general public. I just got this a few weeks ago and it is also now appearing a bit dated but that is understandable as it was likely written several years ago. Overall, a fairly interesting book that will be of some value to individuals who need to understand why CI might be a desirable career pursuit."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is THE book on competitive intelligence","review":"Competitive Intelligence is not just the latest management fad; it's THE business discipline of the next century -- because it offers a systematic method for turning raw information into actionable intelligence. I've read several books on the subject and this is the best. It's for all managers who must make the right decision. As Kahaner says: If a manager makes the right decision he (or she) is a hero. If not, he's a bum! This book will keep you from making foolish decisions."},{"rating":"2","title":"mmmmm, Honeylocust","review":"I dont have the cd because i havent found it in my town, but i've heard them on a couple compalation discs, and i liked them.

She uses a food scale for portion control and wanted to have a scale while we were on a cruise. (A time for portion control if ever there was one...) We found that the scale was too sensitive for use on the ship, as the ship movement caused the readings to jump all over and not settle down. At home in the kitchen, it works well, though for a food scale one needs to consider if they need hundredths of an ounce. Also, if one is at home in the kitchen, this may not be the scale that you reach for.All, in all, it is a solid piece of equipment that works as advertised and is handy and discreet for use when away from home.

The Customer Service personnel told me that it was corporate policy despite the fact that the software is bound to the digital device.This immoral policy violating the norm of digital appliance industries and should not be encouraged.

The headband is made of plastic, and so cannot be banned or otherwise adjusted. I wear an average hat size, so I know my head is not that big, but this thing really hurt to wear. As others have noted, the padding is very thin and not very soft. Also, the padding rests on the ear itself, rather than forming a seal around it. The result is a tight fitting headset with minimal padding crushing your ears. The only redeeming quality of this product is that the microphone worked pretty well with my voice recognition software. It didn't matter though, as I couldn't manage to wear it for any length of time that made it worth keeping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Good","review":"I originally bought this product for the microphone, as I needed it to be able to use Skype and Voice (SecondLife) But the microphone didn't work.

I noticed that switching the position of the microphone seemed to change performance significantly. After 4 months, only certain frequencies could be heard. I finally got fed up with them and decided to see what the problem was.Sure enough, the microphone hinge is held by a screw and nut that fray the wires that run through that portion of the unit. Further up that side of the unit, I noticed that the fit adjustment groove also frays the wire that runs through it. With these design flaws, I don't expect anyone to get more than six months of normal use out these headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable and not durable","review":"I've had these headphones for about 13 months now.

The volume from the microphone is very very very low, even when it is set to high. Also, when it arrived, one of the ears of the headphones did not work.

And therefore it hurts cause it bends your ear. You can wear it for no longer than 5 min.I bought this mainly to use for internet chat. But the mic is weirdly placed and as mentioned before you have to speak loudly for the other person to hear you.

However, this Logitech headset has been a disappointment for the following reasons:a) Uncomfortable and bulkyb) When chatting in SkyPe, I can barely hear, and the person I'm talking to can barely hear me.c) When listening to music, the music sounds very muffled.I'm not sure whether this headset is good for gaming since I've not used it with any games but as far as SkyPe and music are concerned, it is useless. It's even worse (by a magnitude of at least 200%) than the 5-year old Labtec that it was supposed to replace"},{"rating":"2","title":"It was OK.. but not what I was expacting.","review":"I thought I was getting an USB head set but this was like any other headsets and not an USB.

I couldn't afford to purchase another one, so I had to stop using it as much and would only put it on when I absolutely had to.As of January 20th, the sound on the left side of the headset has gone out completely, after two days of fading in and out... The left side worked as long as I tilted my head to the left side constantly, but as you can imagine, this ended up hurting my neck...

The pressure will hurt your ears and press your glasses ear pieces up against your head causing you even more discomfort.2.) The boom mic and overall plastic used on this headset is very weak.

The pressure in the head is not wearable for more than 10 minutes. After that you feel like your brain is going to explode like a grenade. Your ears feel like stamps absolutely flat.

You'll have to continue this until you find a \\"sweet spot\\" such that you'll get sound from the right channel that is equal in volume to the left channel.I managed to get this replace from logitech and the brand new replacement had the same issue. I've given up on logitech products.I'm guessing this was a known design issue from logitech and they still sold the item. It's probably an issue with the wiring on volume control.

You can fiddle with the on-the-wire controls and get it working, but the slightest nudge of the volume and it goes out again.Loose mute button that can slide on and off against cloths, desk, or anything else controls rub against.So why 1 star? A headset is two things: a microphone and a pair of headphones. While the microphone has worked, the left headphone going in an out is unacceptable.

Then i tried to adjust the wire because sometime both ears will work sometimes one ear will work. So i got it working finally after 3 weeks of one ear. Then after 2 months of two ears working, the left ear finally died meaning NO MORE signal to it, AT ALL.I love logitech stuff, i have their keyboard speakers and bought my boyfriend their G9 mouse and he loves it.

I'm on my second pair of these in 1.5 years and it's already time for a new pair.

The sound itself, when it decides to work, is alright. Nothing terrible, but nothing special either.I wear these for long periods of time (mainly for use with Ventrilo or Skype), up to 3 or 4 hours, and after about an hour they become quite uncomfortable. The thing foam padding on the inside of the earpiece falls out after about a month, and the hard plastic digs into your ear.

I liked it at first even though it did not fit my head very comfortably. The sound quality is great and I did not have any problems with the mic.The best thing about it is that the cable is ridiculously long, like about 2 meters. That is perfect for hooking it up to the TV while playing xbox and not disturbing anyone.Over time the sound quality declines and only one of the sides work unless you fiddle around with the plug or volume wheel. These fall off your head pretty easily so it is not really good for listening to music while your walking or moving around too much. It also gives me a headache on top of my head where the middle of the band is and I have to shift it around ocassionally.These overall are not that great, I don't like them or hate them, but it does the job.

If you're a serious gamer and require sound for footsteps etc., I suggest you look elsewhere. I was aware of these causing discomfort from previous reviews and can confirm it.

However this headset's sound quality is pretty good and the bass is solid but I returned this headset for Altec Lansing AHS302i. Altec's driver is only 36mm and has less bass than this Logitech headset but I would trade in headaches for super comfort anytime."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product doesn't deliver.","review":"I ordered two sets of these and both have the same issues. I can only assume these aren't manufacturing defects, but are working as designed.These headphones have very poor audio quality--treble and bass frequencies are muffled. The package advertises that these are suitable for listening to music, but unless they were referring to AM radio, they couldn't be more wrong.The microphone barely picks up speech, regardless of positioning. You have to manually press the mic to get it near enough to your mouth to get any response, even with the recording volume and microphone boost on the sound card turned all the way up. I think the noise cancellation may be working too well. *note: I do not have this issue with other microphone headsets, so I can only assume that again, this is by design."},{"rating":"1","title":"sorry","review":"Just got it today.I should have listened to the reviews listed here.

And had I read the reviews before ordering it, I would've never bought it but I decided to read after I bought it and felt the pain to make sure I wasnt the only one with this complain.People complain that they cant hear me well, the mic quality is really bad.Its not even worth my time to return it for what its worth.If you really hate someone, gift it to them. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great headset for the price!","review":"My wife and I both use this mic and headset.

But, there are a few great things about this head set. The cord is very long! which is essential to reach the connections on the back of the computer. There is an onboard volume adjustment, and an on-off switch for the mic, which I think are nice to have.Now, back to the issue of comfort. When worn directly on the ears, I have found these to be very uncomfortable, like others. The band is too small for my head, and presses the cups onto my ears, which quickly causes discomfort. TIP: I found that wearing the phones lower helped. I have the tops of me ears sticking out, and the phones press onto the center (and below) of my ear, rather than the rim.EDIT: Ok, here is another solution for the comfort problem: tear off all the standard issue padding (the fake leather junk and foam), grab a few cotton balls, and stick them in there instead. Careful, there maybe no returning, but I don't care. The cotton is allot more comfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Microphone did not work","review":"The microphone did not work in the unit I was sent.

So, while these are *ok*, they are not that comfortable (though better than the Audio 80's or any other totally unpadded headset), and no where near that of the Audio 90's, or other total around the ear constructions.Not bad at all for the price, until you compare them to the Plantronics alternative."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Powerbook Users","review":"Although the label indicates that this headset is Mac-compatible, the microphone did not work with my Powerbook.

The second ones mike went dead in about 3 months, and the third one which surprised me the most's, its top wiring came a loose and fell apart the second day and while it worked fine once I taped it back together I think it was highly unacceptable that it fell apart so quickly.

NEVER TOO LATE FOR LOVE shows that is if the feeling is real and cultivated between two people, it truly can conquer all that baggage, and create new beginnings.

Gameplay-wise, it's an exact replica of the first, with the addition, and quickly vanishing novelty, of playing villain characters. The music, sound effects, and mixing also come across as extremely amateur, which you will notice almost immediately. It's a simple game without much of a learning curve, and the first half hour of the game will give you an accurate idea of how the rest of it will feel.All in all, a C quality game, and a decent way to burn a few hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Microsoft does it again!","review":"Microsoft strikes again!

The pleasure in reading the book does not carry to the plot, characters, or message Shy Girl was trying to convey. Erotically, this book rate about 3 stars and those who share the characters lifestyles will enjoy the sensuality. The only drag is that Alta's love for Sasha (Shy Girl) didn't ring true for me. What could have been an excellent story about a gay woman being in love with bisexual or straight friend was overlooked. Unrequitted love of an out lesbian for a girl who might have tried it, liked it, and then lost interest in it, is more of an interesting story and given the resentment that lesbians/gays have for bisexuals or women who are in straight relationships, would have held my interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's really \\"fascinating\\" if you're not queer.","review":"Fine example of trying to make a buck and a name in the mainstream lit world off the voyeuristic \\"glamor\\" of our little subculture/s.

Two things I didnt enjoy were that it was based in Canada so its different from the US healthcare system and the time period that it was written. Even though the book is from a differnt time period of nursing (one that people were still allowed to smoke in hospitals) it still gives off the important and stressfull areas of nursing."},{"rating":"2","title":"I look forward to more books by this author","review":"It was like reading a novel that you just can't put down.

To someone who is not a nurse, or who doesn't work with critically ill patients, this book may have a lot of informational value - however, being familiar with the setting, I found it more repetitive than anything else.

The life of a nurse is very much as she depicted in her book. I reveled in every word and could barely put it down, except when absolutely necessary. The story lines were so true to life, some of which I experienced in my practice. I worked in the NICU so faced many of her situations.

After a few dozen pages, I realized the author had little understanding of the basics of logic, and his arguments were more opinion and religious rhetoric than logical proof of any god. This is just another attempt by religionists to use rational thought to justify their beliefs, but having studied logic and philosophy, I see them all as logically unsound and based mainly on scripture or faith-two weak sources of evidence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atheism is the default, Xtianity is an unproven assertion.","review":"Zacharias is confused. Atheism is merely the lack of theism, like a-SantaClausism is the lack of a belief in Santa Claus.

This is like a Flat Earther attacking the spherical Earth instead of proving why the Earth is indeed flat.Instead, Christianity or theism in general lies on the examination table, since IT is a mere unfounded assertion. Weakly attempting to put the default, atheism, on the defensive is a transparent ruse to hide Xtianity from scrutiny.This tactic dos not work in the lab, nor should it work here.Dan Burke"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophistry","review":"Without a doubt, this is the most sophist attack on atheism I've ever seen. The author provides few logical arguments in general, and he never tries to refute atheist arguments against God or shore up theist arguments; instead, he resorts to personal attacks and dubious literary references (such as one claiming that Kantian ethics is inherently evil). The author is a low-grade hack of a philosopher.

Zacharias does little more than substitute vitriol and unsupported assertion for arguement. He blames atheism for everything from the Holocaust to contermporary troubles in Centeral America and almost never bothers to bring even the smallest shred of evidence into his absurd rant.

Perhaps somewhere in the future we can expect a better \\"argued\\" refutation of atheism.

I say 'some' because I will address only the most salient errors.

Described as fitting 22\\" deep pockets, I ordered it and am using it constantly. It truly doesn't snap off of the mattress after sleeping on it. It tucks around and under each corner well.

However, she time and time again watches this one and sings the songs.

I had swam with it many times before so this was a surprise.I liked the hands that were readable at night as well as the snooze alarm. The face of the watch scratched way too easily however, and that made it difficult to read the numbers sometimes. The watch gained time so that at the end of each month I'd be five minutes fast.

The light is easy to read and can even be set to turn on automatically when you twist your wrist to look at the watch face. The digital second hand is fun, if not practical.The analog is easy to read without blocking the digital content. Importantly, setting the digital content won't reset the hour or minute, but it will fine tune the minute hand movement to sync with the digital.The construction of the watch is fairly cheap - the 'metal bezel' is really coated plastic. But for the price, that's to be expected.The only drawback, cited by others, is the watchband is small - I don't have particularly large wrists and I have to use the third or second to last notch.Overall, a lot of fun and functionality for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"watch","review":"this is a good product, the face is nice and bright I consider this good for an everyday use watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"good looking, great value","review":"Got my watch yesterday and like all other reviewers posted, it's a very nice looking watch. setting the time really wasn't a big deal. the size of the watch is fine for me (5'9\\", 170lbs).

The size is given online so this is probably fault of my own, but it seems rather small.Third, the band seems very low quality and is smaller than other rubber bands i have seen. The clasp seems very cheap almost like a cheap plastic and the band feels fragile and inadequate.The fit on my wrist was less than appealing.

It is very simple to read and it has the seconds \\"pie\\" counter right in the middle.

It's also not too big or bulky. The features work, aren't too gimmicky, and the price is great. I travel a lot, and this is just what I was looking for (without dropping $300+) to get similar features.CONS: The face is easily scratched. In the first week, with light use, the face already had scratches, and since then it has gained more. I can still read the face, but it is annoying at times to see the scratches. I cannot understand how there is not a G-shock version of this. Casio should at the very least make the black plastic face surround rise above the surface to protect against scratching.

The other thing I like about this watch is how light it is, other watches that I have owned in this style have been very heavy.

I wore it for 1 week and then one day it simply fell off my wrist. The point on the watch casing where the pin holding the wristband is inserted had snapped off. It appears that the hole for the pin had weakened the structural integrity of the watch casing at this point. Mind you, I'm not wearing this watch on a construction site or exposing it to any undue abuse or stress - I'm sitting in front of a computer most of the day. Anyway, I sent the broken watch off to Casio for repair, figuring it must be under warranty. Unfortunately the repair estimate came back from Casio for $46.00 - the watch casing is NOT covered under the warranty. My week-old watch had cost me $29.99 on Amazon, so it'd be cheaper to buy a new one, which I will NOT do, after this experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken band anchor!","review":"The watch itself is excellent, but the design of the anchor where the wrist band attaches to the watch is poor.

Controls are well laid out. Operation is easy and intuitive. Display is easy to read and night illumination works great.

I wore it a handful of times whenever I would go on a hike or do something outdoorsy. It received very little wear for two years--very little. Two weeks ago I went to put it on and as I pulled the strap around my wrist it broke. The little \\"ear\\" on the face of the watch--where the hinge of the strap connects to the watch--broke off. This is a plastic piece that is a molded part of the watch and cannot be replaced. My Amazon warranty covered my second year of ownership so they quickly reimbursed me the price of the watch, at which point I immediately bought a replacement (the same exact watch). I wore this second watch for exactly ONE DAY before it broke in the same exact place. So yeah, plastic piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"broke after 2 months","review":"Will never by a Casio watch again, the part where the band attaches to the case broke and there's no way to fix it.

Unless this aspect of the watch is fixed, I warn all buyers to AVOID PURCHASING."},{"rating":"1","title":"Face is easily scratched","review":"Yes, this watch tells the time and does all the other stuff it's supposed to do, but it has one major problem. The face is made of plastic and it's soft. Really soft. My life is not overly active (I work in an office) but the face of this watch is just scratching up badly. I keep checking to make sure there isn't a soft plastic layer that peels off after shipping, but there isn't.I know they're making to a price, but I'd have gladly paid a bit more and got something that was a bit better built."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the watch but resin band is junk","review":"I love the features of the watch (the easily settable countdown timer in particular - great for timing foods on the grill!) but the resin part of the case holding the band broke after just 3 months. The one year warranty doesn't help because it doesn't cover the band (or the crystal - which got scratched pretty easily).The warranty repair process is painful: register online, send in your watch (at your cost), Casio sends you an email either saying the repair is covered under warranty and they'll fix or replace it, or they send you an email with the cost to fix the watch. In my case the the cost to fix it was $35 while the watch itself cost $27! Plus there's no option to just have them send back the original watch - you either pay up or let Casio \\"recycle\\" it.

Lo único malo es que el pulso no le duró mucho (claro que esto es una característica de TODOS los CASIO, ya que el pulso no les dura mucho a todos los CASIO y tengo varios!! pero el cambio no cuesta mucho y por algún motivo los nuevos si duran mucho tiempo!). Tiene lo básico de un reloj digital mas el backlight. Es muy económico y liviano."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but with one minor flaw","review":"Let me start by saying I love this watch. It's one of the nicest looking sports watches I've seen, and far more elegant looking in person than in the online pictures. Plus, it's easy to set and use and accomplishes (nearly) all the features I want and need in a sports watch.However, one thing I use constantly is a countdown timer for various exercises. While this watch has a countdown timer, it can only be set in 1-minute increments. So, if you want to time an activity for 30 seconds, or 2 minutes 15 seconds, or whatever, you can't do it with this watch.I like the watch otherwise too much to return it, but this countdown timer limitation is, to me, a rather serious design flaw that could have and should have been easily corrected by Casio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Casio watch","review":"The watch arrived on time and is really attractive. The only thing is the band is a lot thinner and slightly effeminate and/or cheapy. The watch features however make up for this minor shortcoming. All in all a great buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for Goodwill","review":"Lured by the positive reviews on Amazon I ordered this watch, but it's for people with better eyesight and more patience than me. It is also extremely fat and bulky on the wrist. The instructions are printed in a teeny tiny manual and I found them confusing and badly written (the online PDF manual makes the text more legible but not more readable). As for the functions.... I really have no idea, as I just couldn't get that far. Mine will soon be appearing at our local Goodwill store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good. Not comfortable to wear.","review":"Good looking watch, with decent features but not comfortable to wear. First it has an exceptionally high face. 16mm compared to 10mm for most watches, which makes it rise very high off the wrist, and prone to hitting things and scratching the surface.The strap is also uncomfortable, but the biggest annoyance for me was the strap constantly slipping out of the loop.A minor thing, but when it keeps happening and you keep tucking it back in, you want to get rid of the watch or change the strap.I would have changed out the strap since it's a good watch, but it's built flush with the body so can't be replaced with a generic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Product, Good Price","review":"I love this watch. I love how it has different functions such as world time etc. It has a nice, unique design. I just wish that the wristband was a little thicker, I hope mine lasts a long time, we'll see.

This is the best watch I have ever owned. It is sporty, yet elegant. I got comments about it when I first bought it. It has a number of different functions, including a stop watch, 4 alarms, 30min countdown, and alternative country times. The watch fits my wrist like a glove. The band is durable, hardly ever leaves any impression marks on my skin, and does not itch or make my wrist sweat. For the price, you absolutely can't find a better watch anywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost as expected","review":"I believe that the price fits the watch (or the other way around). What I didn't like is that you can't set the digital display to show the date. It always shows the time, which is a little annoying since that's what the handles are for. You can only show the day of the week or the date (mm-dd) but not both on the top portion of the display.One last negative point is the wristband. Not very durable in my opinion.Besides that, it's ok and I give it 4 stars.

Students of the subject would be well advised to read it cover to cover. The most noteworthy content is the peek behind the veil at former Soviet accidents (which may have been the impetus for the writing of the book in the first place).Where Gero falls short is in his failure to mention a number of well-documented, high-profile accidents with significant implications to public safety. For example, the June 1995 crash of a B-52 at Fairchild Air Force Base, Washington made international news, but is not discussed in this book. A 2002 update of both this book and his equally readable \\"Air Disasters\\", perhaps combined in a single volume, would be welcome to both add to the current content and bring attention to the final rulings on a number of high-profile accidents that occurred in the late 1990s."},{"rating":"1","title":"cranky reader with attitude","review":"I was intensely irked by this book.

There are many books on separate topics from this book - cloth dolls are admirably covered by Eloise Piper and Susanna Oroyan, art dolls are all in Susanna Oroyan's several books, play dolls are in Miriam Gourley and Jodie Davis' various books.Skip this one, and check out some other books that actually cover the topic better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I bought this book with high expectations, but was very disappointed.

Ghiarov is something enormous here and Corellis Don Carlo is among the best I ever heard. There is so much passion in it! Verrett is superb and so is also Wächter.But it has some weak points, this performance. First of all, it is a very short version and Janowitz creates a sweet Elisabetta, but you can hear she gets tired in ending of the opera. Her vibrato becomes too dominating and therefor she also sometimes sounds a little bit out of pitch. I may be too hard now... After all she is very sweet.This recording is absolute worth having!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth it for the performances of Corelli and Verret","review":"This performance features some unusual casting: neither Gundala Janowitz nor Eberhard Wechter are the names generally associated with Verdi singing. However both handle their roles competently. The real stars here are Franco Corelli in the title role (I find Corelli's live recording to be preferable to his studio work) and Shirley Verrett who nearly steals the show as Eboli."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Discovery of Hidden Treasures","review":"I've bought this CD from a mere curiosity when I didn't know about this opera.

This is such a great collection, and I have not stopped since he has passed to play this in my car.Listening to all his music all over again, is like discovering MJ all over, I grew up and is the same age as what he would have been, so I was familiar with his talents.He was so misunderstood, I personaly always knew of his innosence, I could feel it in his music that he was here way before his time. The US was not ready for him, he made a difference we all know that and he will go down in the history for changing the music industry.Glad Amazon is putting all of his music out again.They need to also re-print his Bio 'Moonwalk\\" so we can all buy it.Blessing and love to all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"michael jackson number ones","review":"the cd arrived in record time. love the CD.

I saved my money back in my high school days to buy the lps -- a 2-record set on Vanguard that also included Kondrashin conducting the 1st Symphony. To me, this is how the 'Leningrad' should sound: often harsh, never pretty, ultimately heart-rending by virtue of the great adagio's whispered poetry.I give it four stars to warn of the dated sonics -- mono, of course, and more constricted than the Ancerl/Czech Phil. recording that was released a few years later. But Mravinsky was the conductor who brought his orchestra closest to the heart of the music, by Shostakovich's own admission.Hear, and believe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Despite Mravinsky's mastery in Shostakovich, his 7th recording is painfully poor. It sounds anemic in performance and recorded sound and i think the russian conductor was never stay tuned with the work, indeed. Furthermore, it\`s really notorious he recorded the symphony just once, while he has a wide variety of 5th\`s, 8th\`s and 10th\`s. I suspect that Mravinsky was never in real sympathy with this work. For really great \\"Leningrads\\", go for Bernstein (DG), Haitink (DECCA) and powerful Herbert Kegel (Weitblick)."},{"rating":"1","title":"No thanks!","review":"As an avid Mravinsky/Shostakovich fan, it pains me to give this one the thumbs down - main problem is the digital remastering: SONY Super Bit Mapping, it claims on the inlay, but this is unlike any other SBM resissue I've heard - all life has been successfully (surgically?) removed and everything damped down to a deadly dull soundscape that quickly stops one caring what Mravinsky, Shostakovich and the music are about.

This book so far seems an ok overview, but you have to take everything you read with a grain of salt. I'm not so competent in other parts, but I know math, and some things stated in the book are plain illiterate, for example \\"between every integer is a fraction\\", \\"draw 2 concentric circles to illustrate the intersecting sets\\" (when the diagram shows, naturally, non-concentric circles), etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Earth has two moons??","review":"The really glaring errors in this book make me wary of the entire thing.

I understand that one person writing an entire content knowledge book is bound to make some mistakes, but these mistakes should have been pretty easy to avoid.Though after working through the book I feel like I have a better understanding of what I'll need to know for the test, I do wish I had purchased a different book.

If you read technicalities that you don't understand just to show that the writer knows too many things that you really don't care, there goes down the other half. When you finish this book you'll know how to build a rocket. How to make more powerful fuel for it. How to make drugs heavier, and many other things. Of course to do all that you'll need a very special paraphernalia. So I rather start watching TV than read another like this.If you like to read about TV series read \\"24 Declassified: Veto Power\\" by John Whitman.

Eager to read another CSI: Miami book, I decided to give Donn Cortez a try. This author clearly does not have the feel for the characters and smooth storylines of the TV show. The book was filled with too many technicalities on rocket-building, etc., and is just bogged down with excessively detailed explanations.

For me, there just wasn't enough to it.It does have a lot of history and so on, so for that it's good. But I found the star charts poor. The main ones are too large-scale to be of much help, and the finder charts don't include enough stars to get you oriented.For each object, there is a lot of space spent on Messier's original notes. Mostly, they turn out to be boring. There is also a short \\"Facts\\" section, which has only very basic data.The photographs are interesting. On the one hand, they're all at the same scale, so that you get an idea of the relative sizes of Messier objects. On the other hand, they show the objects in far more detail than you'll ever see in even an 8\\" telescope.Finally, the observing notes are fairly dry; that is, they don't inspire much interest, let alone wonder.I returned the book, and I'll keep looking for a Messier book that delivers more."},{"rating":"2","title":"COULD BE GREAT.......but","review":"An outstanding, informative reference.

I had thought about skipping this section, but found it to be quite entertaining and informative. The rest of the book is a catalog of \\"M\\" objects, with PHOTOS of the Messier object RELATIVE TO THE SURROUNDING SKY through 'reasonable' amateur telescopes (read: \\"non mega $10000-plus, super dark sky 30\\" observatory scopes), along with observing tips and facts.And I should mention that it is VERY reasonably priced given that it is hardback and partially in color.This book is gonna get some use...Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A handy reference.","review":"As a fairly new astronomer to the community, I purchased this book looking for a good reference to the Messier objects.

A description of the object as viewed through the eyepiece is provided and ranked on it's difficulty to locate (East / Hard). A good quality B/W photo is also provided so that you can get an idea of what to look for.The book included a nice introductory paragraph on who Mr. Messier was and his history, a comprehensive glossary and a reproducable observing log for each object.This is exactly what I was looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for Seattle","review":"Great jacket for cold mornings and light rain. it is more comfortable than a raincoat and looks great.

The fuser alone sells for $350, the transfer roller around $60, the imaging unit $330, and the 4 cartridges around $100 each.

For example, one reviewer said that the player didn't remember where it was when the stop button was pushed. I didn't find that to be so. However, if one pushes the play button too quickly, it will go to the scenes. READ the MANUAL! Pause, and it will go to where the movie left off.

DVDs spin too fast for a brush motor, the vibration from spinning the unbalanced discs gets dust from the magnets on the brushes and bearings causing premature failure, Panasonic should have known this. You can buy a new motor for about $30.00 if you are brave enough to try to replace it, not a very easy task, even if you do replace the motor it is still the same cheap brush motor subject to the same problems.

Had to fall back to a DVD player. The only problem is DVD players playback in chapters, thus when playing an MP3 CD, you could hear a distinct 'blank' in the music when song went to next chapter. (each song would last over 3 - 5 chapters). A problem with the video portion of this unit is not being able to hook up to a TV via coax."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT [stinks]!!","review":"Where were all the bad reviews of this product when I had bought it??!!??

It died in about 6 months because \\"the drive motor\\" went. I then purchased another Panasonic, the RV31. Panasonic had a good rating on Amazon and maybe I got a lemon before with the A-120. 3 months later, the RV31 failed as well. The \\"H2O\\" came up on the DVD player and never went away. The repair shop said it needed a \\"new drive mechanism\\". Panasonic said \\"were very sorry. Send it to us and we will fix it\\".... along with $90 and shipping cost's. Another reviewer put it best when they said this unit has a serious design flaw. Read all of these reviews on Amazon before you purchase! \\"H2O\\" is a serious problem.

The Panasonic is everything I wanted and although I am sure there are bigger and more complex devices on the market, for normal at-home viewing without hassles or headaches, this more than meets the bill. I gave it only four stars because I have no real basis of comparison but for me it is a five star winner.

At the time, I was rushed for a birthday gift for my wife and obviously didn't do enough research on this boat anchor. First of all, the special features such as \\"dialogue enhancer\\" do nothing for the dialogue - there is a tendency for the background music to drown everything out regardless. The shortcomings of the mp3 functions have already been listed, so I'll move on to the players worst feature - the fact that after any sort of serious use, the player begins freezing up and eventually dies completely with an HO2 error (yes, mine is now dead too, after 11 months). Panasonic should be petitioned to issue a factory recall of this obviously defective unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for the first year...then it [poops] out","review":"I, too have fallen victim to the dreaded \\"H02\\" error.

Procedure: Took off the cover and gently spun the mechanism. Plugged in; NOTHING. Spun the mechanism while plugged in; NOTHING. Then I just gently tapped on the \\"white circle\\" about three times and BOOM its all working again.I had to go to 2 stars though because I have gotten about 5k hours out of this player. With four kids, who refuse to turn the thing off when they leave 5 minutes into the movie, it has done some serious work for my family.

And of course they asked me to get it checked thru a repair centre. ( which as you all know is not free.)

Like DVD it uses the MPEG-2 format.Nero Burn program has this capability.Watch your video production on DVD players that support the SVCD format. I tried several DVD players (Sony, Apex, Phillips, Panasonic). The Panasonic models I tried (the RV31 and RP56)supports this SVCD very well including the regular DVD.

I've decided to purchase a different brand instead.Bottom line: there are an inordinate number of people in this forum outlining this same problem with this player after a few months of use.

Yet I have seen all the episodes at least four times and I found something new to laugh about every time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My kids didn't like it...","review":"My kids (ages 2 & 4) were bored with this dvd. They enjoy doing my yoga tapes much more. The feel of the dvd was like--\\"okay get on with it!\\". I agree with a previous review about the handstand. That's the last thing I need my kids trying when I turn my back or leave the room for a second. I think the dvd in general is just okay, but definitely not for my family."},{"rating":"1","title":"did not flow","review":"I was very disappointed in this dvd. I bought it for my four year who was very excited to do yoga and this was not what I expected. It was broken up into different segments for each pose with too much talking and scenery. It did not flow. I wouldn't buy another in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Super Disappointed","review":"I just received the DVD two days ago. What a bummer! Yes, I probably should have read the reviews!The reason I don't like the DVD is because I was expecting a fun way for my child to be interested in yoga. What I got was cheesy songs and yoga poses interspersed with longer segments of the animal/tree in the wild. I was hoping that at some point they would put the yoga poses all together to form a cohesive routine, but no such luck. There is just too much video with no poses - certainly more than half!My child liked watching the DVD, but did not participate (perhaps at a later time?). However, my child, who does not watch much t.v., would watch the news if I let him.I am not interested in trying any other in the series. But, wow, I am disappointed; there's got to be a good yoga DVD for children somewhere, no?!?"},{"rating":"1","title":"light on yoga, heavy on boring messages","review":"I bought this DVD for my 3 year old and I to do yoga together. I was very disappointed--so much of the program is little vignettes about nature, animals, etc., with just little snippets of actual yoga poses. Would have loved to have seen more fun/direction about the poses themselves than the environmental messaging. Don't get me wrong, I'm a tree hugger, but it was a bit much. Also, you can tell it was produced at least ten years ago. Everything's pretty dated..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, but too fast","review":"My kids really like the *idea* of this video, but the transitions between poses are so fast they can't even begin to keep up (and I can't either!)I suppose it is a good introduction to the poses, but in terms of a video you can follow to build a practice for little ones, it's not very helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Yoga????","review":"I must admit, my 2 year old daughter enjoys watching this video. But mostly she just wants to watch it. Everyone's description is accurate with the ABC descriptions but I figured there would be a \\"Cat Stretch,\\" \\"Down Dog\\" or \\"Warrior\\" or something to do with yoga. Instead she acts like they are driving a car, hot air balloon or a worm. They don't even keep the letter on the screen, so it's not helping with learning the alphabet either. I think there's one pose that's an actual yoga pose. I was hoping to do yoga with my daughter. This is NOT it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"Too much talking, not enough yoga. I think it was actually hard for my 3yr daughter to keep interested because the flow kept stopping. It only teaches a few moves but it only does each of them once and spends most of the time showing the kids in the back yard or at the beach, petting goats or looking at the ocean. I will try to find a better DVD for my daughter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even good for a 2 year old","review":"I was looking for a way to introduce yoga, which I practice, to my 2 year old in a fun way. This is a great DVD. My 2 year old loves it - although there are some slower spots in the dialogue where I fill in and keep her interest but she is excited to do all of the poses all the way through. It will definitiely keep us doing yoga together for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Blessing","review":"I am a certified Yoga instructor and I bought this for a kid in the family.I think anyone who has kids, will find this to be a blessing ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only gives demonstration of pose","review":"I bought this video to help my hyper 3 year old learn how to slow down and relax. This video has the children do a pose while the narrator, Mrs. Yoga discusses the specific pose. The pose last only a minute then the video moves on to fast moving, very distracting scene or animal to introduce the next pose.My child started out doing well and then...the fast pace and variety of animals got him going again and apparently it is more entertaining to run around like a lion than to keep switching gears and slow back down for the next pose. We've tried to watch it several times and have not made it past the fourth pose.I would not recommend this video"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of fluff, little yoga","review":"I bought this for my 5 year old daughter with ADHD. A lot of the video she looked at me and asked \\"What now?\\". We learned about animals and heard songs that were made in the 80s. Overall, not a lot of yoga, mostly wasted time. The poses that were done were appropriate except for the head stand. I don't see her wanting to watch this one again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and enjoyable","review":"My daughter is only 3 so her attention span doesn't hold out for the whole show but she is enjoying some of the moves and I catch her doing some when we're not even watching it. I think once she's a bit older she'll be able to do the whole show. She enjoys watching other kids and the animals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a disappointment","review":"I was expecting this DVD to have an actual yoga routine, albeit a simple one. My 3 year old daughter and I were both disappointed. There is absolutely no routine and the few yoga poses that are practiced are interspersed with dated songs and video clips. The video quality is poor, the routine is nonexistant, and the overall vibe is very dated. Coming from Gaiam, I assumed this would be a quality DVD. Unfortunately I was wrong. I wish I had paid more attention to the negative reviews and not gone with it just because of the brand. I'd recommend doing more research and finding a more quality DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my money back!","review":"I bought this at my local book store, looking to help my son with his balance and coordination. The song held his attention at the beginning. The actual video itself...is BORING!!! It was too much focus on explaining the pose, versus doing the pose. Definitely, not for a 3year old. I wish I could get my money back! Such a waste..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Little Long....But fun!","review":"I got this DVD as part of a set of 3 by the same makers. I think all of them are a little long for my 3 1/2 year old but he loves them! He asks to do Yoga Kids. He doesn't do all the poses and rarely stays in the same room the whole time (roughly 30 minutes per DVD.) His favorite is volume 2 the ABC's of yoga where the kids act like animals and cars among other things. Overall we are happy with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yoga Kids: For Ages 3-6","review":"we were so excited for the kids to do yoga. Unfortunately the DVD we bought through Amazon skipped.It was such a disappointment"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite overall \\"yoga kids\\" dvd","review":"My kids and I like this one the best. It does not concentrate on poses as much as having fun moving your body. My 4 1/2 year old and my 2 1/2 year old can do this easily, and request this DVD frequently."},{"rating":"2","title":"yoga mom","review":"We love this dvd! I have 5 and 8 year old girls. The eight year old had been doing this since she was one and we don't even do it on a really regular basis (as we should). Marsha produced a yoga video some years ago and it was terrific, too. I wish she would put that one out as a dvd. We lent it out and used it until is was scratchy. It is also worth having. This new one has more poses, though. Even my husband does this with the kids! A great buy! Get your kids their own yoga mat and blocks and they will really get into it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get the kids moving!","review":"This is a nice yoga video for children, as are the others in this series. Ms. Wenig does a nice job of presenting the movements to the children (some other presenters use such a sing-song-y or overly mature manner). One thing that is really nice about this particular video is the educational information it offers to the children during each pose or movement; to my recollection all are science-based. I use these videos with my own children as well as my Kindergarten students. While they all enjoy this video; evident by the regurgitation of the educational pieces offered to them; their favorite as a whole is really the ABC's Yoga Kids Video. That one always earns cheers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the Vol 2 & 3 Bundle Instead","review":"I bought the second and third volumes as a set, and we love them. Therefore, I thought the first would be equally as good, but I was disappointed. There is little interaction from Marsha (aka Mrs. Yoga) and the order is kind of random. Most of the poses are in the other two volumes as well. This one does have more songs; that was the only benefit for us. This DVD seemed more like a rough draft. The next two are a much better, finished product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yoga kids","review":"I found this video to be disappointing. It mainly just goes from pose to pose without much ease in transition. Also, the music isn't very inspiring for children.Although it did spark the interest for my children they weren't ga-ga over it. They prefer my grown up yoga video's to this kid's one(my children are 4 & 7)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow Moving.....","review":"I bought this DVD for my 3 year old hoping she would take an interest in yoga early on. I was very disappointed. It is very slow moving so it does not hold her attention. The references back to nature are helpful, but I just wish it moved at a little bit of a faster pace. She has other exercise videos that she follows well, but this one appears to just make her sleepy and bored."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good beginning for kids doing yoga","review":"I have three kids...a girl who is 5, boy who is almost 3 and a 6 month old. I bought this a year ago but they weren't into it. Just tried it again and they LOVE it. It's the perfect intro for them to yoga. The baby loves watching the other 2 do the poses with this video, so it's good for all of us. The 3 year old just quit taking naps but I want to encourage quiet time, so...YOGA! Good simple poses, some silly stuff and they are learning about yoga. I will get another DVD to switch up so they don't get bored, but for now this is a great way for them to have quiet time and hopefully get hooked on yoga like their mom. Once they learn these poses I will try to help them learn that they can work on perfecting them to get more out of it. Now I will look into those kids yoga mats!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not fast paced enough","review":"I bought this for my son who is almost three and he can definitely do many of the poses and follow along with the video however it is not fast paced enough for his age and he loses interest after about 15 minutes. There is a lot of talking between poses about the practice of yoga and the environment, etc none of which an almost three year old cares about. I would not really recommend this video for very young children- it is definitely better for a 5 and 6 year old. I am hoping to find a better one out there for him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good Yoga Video","review":"I am a Health/Physical Education teacher and I use this for my elementary students Pre School through 5th grade. Some 5th graders act like they are too cool to do it. But by the end of the video they were all enjoying it.I show this video first the next lesson I play the \\"Silly to Calm\\" one. This one kept everyone's attention and worked very well during testing week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yoga Bust","review":"My toddler wouldn't give it a second glance. She is a three year old that has sat through an entire three hour concert but didn't make it through the opening of this video. I liked it. However, I have no intention of roaring through yoga excercises without her. It may be good for older children. It just doesn't have that umph that catches younger children's attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly an educational dvd.","review":"If your kids have never seen yoga, this is a good intro dvd, there is no sequence of moves, just an intro DVD that lasts about 30 minutes. My kids watched it once and then never again. I'm sure that are lots of better choices to invest it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"yoga is fun!","review":"i'm a child care provider for mostly 2-3 year olds. i bought this dvd to give us something fun and different to do as a group, and the kids love it! several parents told me that when the kids went home, they were making their parents do yoga, too!my one dislike about this dvd is it seems to be a bit too slow-paced for my kids... tho it is geared for 3-6 year olds, so maybe they'll have a better attention span in the future.all in all, a great and fun way to be active with kids. i will definitely buy more in the YogaKids series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective dvd...poor pressing?","review":"I ordered two copies of this dvd-- one for our daughter, and one for a gift for a friend's child. Our copy was unwatchable and actually stopped playing. This prompted me to check the second copy, which was also defective, and began skipping at around the same point in the recording. After returning both dvds, I'm going to order the Yogakids A-Z dvds instead and will hopefully have better luck this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not recommend","review":"Wow I was very unimpressed with the whole DVD.

Didn't even watch past the intros. It was nice of them to give each kid's name, but one brown child from India and the rest so very, very white rated instant turn off in my house. Ridiculous and unacceptable racial mix and lack of awareness for Yoga, a disicpline that is multi-cultural by definition, but often too upper class white in the US. There is a racism of exclusion and this video exemplifies it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is REAL Meliodic Death Metal","review":"Dark Tranquility, In Flames, and Children of the Bodom are all Gothenberg Metal and have more in common with thrash, power, and black metal. Fragments of Unbecoming however are true Meliodic Deathmetal. This CD, while not heavy in Death Metal standards is good in the fact that it is played very well. I definately recomend this album, even though I can't really write a very helpful review this evening. Check some samples to see if you like what you hear. If you do then buy this along with another band called Mentation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Disappointment","review":"One has to worry about quality when setting up the unit (easy) when the various warning stickers are askew and the top part that lifts and rotates into place is almost 1/4\\" lower on one side than the other, along with the crooked control panel and an ill-fitting control panel cover.When put into use, the concerns are confirmed. Usable heat is about a 2 or 3 ft radius, not the advertised 10 ft, and that's with no wind. A 5mph breeze renders the unit entirely worthless.

We've always used a BBQ lighter You can only feel the heat from this thing if you are within 2 feet of it. Of course your face burns but your feet freeze. All this happened last year. This year it doesn't work. According to Bernzomatic, it is a bad Thermo-coupler. They recommend taking it to a gas supplies place and have it fixed. Total garbage, don't buy this piece of junk. If the place I purchased it from will not take it back, I will dump it in their parking lot after they close. I don't want to go through the hassle of taking to the landfill.

The book is elegantly written and persuasively argued. But in its extended meditations on Cicero's life, it is also utterly engrossing, as all great stories are. This is the best book that I have read about Cicero or about ancient rhetoric, aesthetics, and law in the last five years.

ECM's decision not to produce the Quartet's three recordings is odd. This is understated music for sure, but Abercrombie's playing and writing is superb on all three.

They did not fit properly, but I figured being leather they would stretch and eventually form to my hands.As I first began wearing these gloves, they stained my palms black (yes, stain. It required 2-3 hand washings). The fit was too tight in the area between the base of the forefinger and the wrist, but was too lose between the pinky and the wrist. Additionally the fingers were very loose (I could fit two fingers in a single finger whole). I'm not sure if these gloves were made with real leather. After sitting, they would harden and felt like plastic. Once warming to body temperature they did soften up, but after a few months began to smell likeSilly Putty.These gloves were finally \\"retired\\" when they wore through the palm and the stitched seems burst at the base of the forefinger.

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the tape/recording is very bad. The room is very dark, with strange lights that glow beneath the fellow \\"exercisers.\\" They will jump to different, strange angles that sometimes make it hard to follow what's going on. The one thing I really loved about the way they taped this is that they had a separate person (not stepping) that told you what to do. So you don't have to rely on the instructor to explain things and try to remember to tell you to switch feet - she's working out just like you are, and gives hand gestures to indicate the moves she's doing next as the person interprets them for you to hear. The only drawback of this is that sometimes the camera focuses on the TV screen that shows the woman talking, instead of the people working out.So, it's a little hard to follow and hard to see, but once you get the hang of it, it's a workout you won't quickly forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Video","review":"If you really want to get your heart rate up, this video is excellent.

He is a guitar god, and is one of the best bluesmen I have ever heard. He and \\"Lucille\\" both are unbeatble together.And I was disgusted when I borrowed this from my library. I thought it would include all of his best loved classics on one CD, and I really wanted to have 'Sweet Sixteen' on CD again.And I still call myself stupid for borrowing this. The sound quality is just terrible! It sounds like it was recorded from a mini tape recorder in some guy's pants pockets or in a bathroom stall at a concert venue.My advice: Just avoid this cruddy release and buy B.B.'s installment in the '20th Century Masters' series or 'Great Moments With B.B. King,' released on MCA in 1981.But do not buy this. A TERRIBLE RELEASE. A DISGRACE TO B.B.

Even if you never plan to act or write, this well-written little book will enhance your appreciation of good story-telling.

I am a guy with short hair. I think that's what makes all the difference. If you have short hair and want that separated yet natural look that movie, music, tv stars often have than this is the product to do it. It can recover you from a bad haircut. They say to use an amount the size of a pea or a dime or something like that. If you have so much hair that you need to glob the stuff on it will not work well. You should use just a little right after a shower while your hair is damp (not soaked, but not yet dry). Give it a good toweling then apply immediately. Have fun with it.. it can shape your hair anyways you want yet when it dries it looks like it was supposed to be shaped that way. Not like some pomades that leave you looking like a greased weasel.

Chapters are a bite sized 2-5 pages.Silver's storeyline for this work of fiction is a corporate chef''s gift of advice to his son. I'll have to admit, I was initially turned off by a presentation that seemed too basic to even skim.

If an investor requires this sort of dumbed-down, story-book style to learn about the various methods companies employ to mislead investors, he would be better served letting a pro invest his money via a mutual fund.

Here's a man, who, along with a few other peers, literally created hundreds of thousands of hours of TV comdedy that spans the earliest days of TV until the present. His book is mearly a glorified list of comdedies he directed, instead of a more insightful look at HOW they were created. For example, he could tell us what made the original Dick Van Dyke show a classic while subsequent attempts by Van Dyke fell flat. Instead, he provides a few examples of why this actor or actress was nice/tough to work with. Rafkin was there when so much of our video culture was created, but we never get a feel for it. If his book was a TV script, he would have demanded a rewrite. Perhaps Rafkin can write a sequel with more insight than his present attempt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Paul Mazurky's Book Instead","review":"Some of the other reviews posted very deftly critiqued the weaknesses of this book.

But few.I must tell you though...the feeling I walked away with after reading this book was pity. I felt sorry for him. He has almost no close interpersonal relationships with other human beings.Yes, he got to be present at the dawn of the TV sitcom era and contribute to it, but at the price of maturing developmentally as a human being. Decades of a workaholic pace has left him with a killer reel and many award statuettes but no intimate connections with people.The Mazursky book (Show Me The Magic) is warm, introspective, captivating, and revealing and offers much insight into Hollywood and the directorial process."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very humorous and informative!","review":"I am very excited to begin playing this game.

And its got 2 good covers, but I still wouldn't recommend it to anyone, unless you want to complete your Pretty Boy Floyd Collection as I do, and the new tracks on it are pretty sweet too.

I mean they were on point lyrically, they had some dope guest appearances, the production was dope, they spoke about God, the beats were bumpin! What more can you ask for? I could bump this with my mom in the car and not feel guilty about listening to garbage with her in there.

I remove and replace my flashight from the holder at least 10 times a day. I bought the holder and quickly removed the rubber retainer strap. I am usually wearing goves which makes it hard to quickly unbuckle and remove the flashlight. The resistance the holder itself applies to the flashlight is more than adequate. I am climbing in and out of tight places and jumping up and down constantly. I have yet to have my flash light fall out. I like the fact that this holder doesn't use any type of nylon or velcro. Those types of holders only last me about 6 months, if I'm lucky. It also gives you the option to use it on a 2\\" LEO tactical belt or a smaller dress belt.

This is the first book by her that I haven't really liked. It wasn't horrible, but it moved so slow for such a short book. Basically the book is about Mae who needs to hire a PI to find her uncle's missing diary. She ends up hiring Mitch who isn't really a PI, but a stockbroker who took the PI job as a bet. Finding the diary was supposed to be one of the big mysteries of the book, but I actually didn't really care if they found it. While there were funny parts, it almost felt like it was forced in the writing to make the book funny. Mitch was an all right character, but lacked a thrill about him and Mae was boring at time. For some reason the book seemed flat without the usual spark Crusie's other books have."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Hilarious Whodunnit from Crusie!","review":"I love Jennifer Crusie! Although this book didn't captivate me quite as much as her more recent releases, it still sparked with imagination, romance, and Crusie's wonderful humor!Mae Sullivan is in need of a slow and stupid private eye to send on a wild goose chase for a non-existent murderer. Mitch Peatwick is about ready to pull out from his floundering detective agency, when his dream client walks through the door. He knows she's lying, but he's intrigued by the case. And by her. Then he finds out about Mae's mob relations, her uncle's floozy mistress, and millions of dollars that have disappeared into thin air. Suddenly, a murder doesn't seem quite as improbable.Written in the form of a typical detective story, Crusie keeps us in the dark until the very end. Will Mitch solve the mystery? Will Mae get what she wants? Find out in this Crusie classic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Maltese Falcon Redux....","review":"Funny, funny spoof of The Maltese Falcon, only with a lot more passion. Crusie's characters are memorable, and her sense of humor is infectious. One of the better writers in category fiction---in fact, she is better than category and should be writing mainstream women's (funny) fiction.(And, boy, could she write some hilarious movie scripts!) In the same class as Janet Evanovich (the Stephanie Plum mystery series), Susan Elizabeth Phillips (bestselling contemporary romances), and Marian Keys (Irish author of Watermelon)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, quick read!","review":"I am a confirmed Jennifer Crusie fan and will read ANYTHING with her name on it.

At the same time the folks as Blizzard have managed to also keep the game simple in the sense that it is easy to learn and use, yet always challenging.Some of the scenarious are very tricky and challenging.I've rate it a 4 only because the scenarios sometimes feel a little too scripted. I can play one scenario a few times, learn it, and then play to beat it too easily.

To me, that was the most influential part of the book - how a character that I wouldn't like is make likeable because of the addition of depth and years and loyalty.I highly recommend this book, and though I haven't read it in years, I can still recall most of the characters and many of the things that happened, despite reading countless books in the meantime, enjoying their plots, and promptly forgetting them a week or two after I've finished.

This book had- no character developement- non-logical villian developement- a let down endingand the writing style was atypical of Salvatore. His usual in depth descriptions were just glossed over intimations of what he meant.I'll freely admit that I'm not a huge fan of the dwarven characters in his novel. They are slap stick comedy relief and make a mockery of dwarven values and characteristics. The concept of a dwarven druid is great, but he is basically portrayed as a mentally challenged dwarven druid.Take my word on this one.

OK as a black professional women whose child is at one of New York City's Independent schools I keenly felt the portrayal of the black woman in the story as a babysitter.

Also, it's a little weird that in this \\"let's all accept each other!\\" book many of the other characters have jobs which are just a bit stereotypical of their origins.There are better choices for young children. If you want to speak just about diversity, I suggest you focus on having a broad library rather than the same old standbys (with mostly white characters) and a few Let's Be Friends books. It can be more difficult to get books with non-white protagonists, but it is not impossible.

If you are a child who consequently begins to wish you were white (a problem that is all too common amongst black children) you would appreciate a book that celebrates diversity in skin colour. When you look at a person, what you see first is their physical appearance, including their skin colour, and, unfortunately, if it is black/brown all to often it elicits a negative reaction. Therefore, there is a place for books about skin colour. Stereotypes are not helpful, however."},{"rating":"1","title":"JVC lamp + housing","review":"I'm another disappointed buyer.

I guess the old bulbs must slowly die versus just \\"popping\\" out like incandescent bulbs do. I may not wait for the message to pop up the next time I replace it, as the original was in use for almost 5 years before I was prompted to replace it.

Also there are spots and horizontal lines which look like cheap silvering process on the reflector. I would send the bulb back for a replacement but there was no option for that from the seller, instead I will ship back.Other reviews say to not waste your time with these bulbs, but I did get a whole year out of a previous one. You will just have to go through some defective ones first. At this point getting the new JVC bulb is tough due to the set being older.

I have been on other sites selling these replacement lamps and they come with a 1 year warranty. They are supposed to last 2000 to 3000 hours so why would they only give a 90 day warranty?

Very intuitive and brining some fun things the FPS games. The second eeeeehhhhh not so much. The game can get really REAllY choppy at times and can lag pretty bad. And the space battles are raelly hard. It's not like in the first one where you could fly around for three hours. You have to get your business done and fast or risk being blown out of the sky. (which isn't bad but it can get frustration if you just start playing it) Overall i ahve to say the PC version was much better. Everything was smooth and there was none of the bugs that plagued the last version. Online play is MUCH easier to do.In over if possible get this for the PC but if not its still a decent game to pick up."},{"rating":"2","title":"This game is great","review":"This from a 36 year old Star Wars geek.

My name is Darth_Tater."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, not as good as the first","review":"Absolutely loved BF1, so I went out and bought this on the first day for PS2. I think they tried too hard, the graphics are too overwhelming therefore jittery and not anywhere close to seamless. The missions seem too complicated and you really have no control on the outcome. Initially I'm thinking this was a waste of $50. It's not nearly as fun to play as BF1."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nostalgiac","review":"Very time consuming and fun. I had very fun times with this game 7 years ago. The graphics are okay but the gameplay makes up for that. The introduction of Space combat is a big step up from the first. Galactic Conquest has a very good feel to it. There is strategy involved so a person must use his or her wits. The Campaign is very immersive and epic. Watching the Empire rise through the eyes of a 501st clone is amazing. Instant action offers lots of replay value allowing you to create a map rotation. Choose your own map, gametype, and era. Just ordered a PS2 so I could play it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner from Pandemic and Lucasarts","review":"I have had the first Battlefront since the day it came out, and have yet to stop playing it.

So much expectation and publicity fot this piece of TRASH! They say it was going to be much better, but it isn't.

The resolution it's terrible, a child can make them much better. The missions are easy and the AI isn't as good as they say. I don't care if there are new planets and troopers and if you can control Jedis, the game is boring and repetitive. The sequel is the end for this game.

Playable Jedi:New Planets:Space Battles:New Troops:Story Mode:ETC. Still, some of the gamers of Battlefront 1 will probably think this game is the same as the orginal, because it's sooooooooo simalar to Battlefront 1 that it's funny, but has been improved on soooooooooo many levels. Lets put it this way,It's Battlefront 1 on steroids. LITERALLY!!! The gameplay is quite alot like the firt, but to me, it never really gets old!

That would be awesome! It would be awesome to be a Yuzzhan Vong. Sorry about being caught up like that. Anyways, BF2 had surpassed my expectations.It's a game where you can fight in space, play as heroes or villains, and travel around new BF locations such as The Jedi Temple, The Death Star, Tantive IV, Utapau, Mustafar, Mygeeto, a new and improved Kasshyyk, Jabba's Palace, Polis Massa, and older maps that are more large scale!

The gameplay is the biggest hit. The shooting isn't as good as Halos shooting, but the shooting is still awesome. In addition, you can zoom in with all guns now making the game much easier. The jedi modes are also fun. If you get boared of keep getting points to unlock jedis, then just go to Mos Eisly Assualt. That levels awesome. The graphics are good but the character models are bad looking. The sound is incredible. The sound of blasters, lightsabers, voiceacting, and music help bring the Star Wars feel to life. However I hate the annoying commander who keeps saying, \\"We've captured a command post.\\" That guy is so annoying. The game is long and the menus are good as well.

Space battles are cool, jedi are cool(go to instant action, Mos Eisley and assault and youll get to play either as heroes or villians), rise of the empire is really cool but some missions are hard.Yes its a good game but there is a problem... dont play it for more than 2 hours a day(at least withought letting it cool down for 1/2 hour) or it may have the chance that youll experience HUGE GLITCHES like not being able to spawn, music repetition, or other technical problems i've heard of( just go to gamespot and youll see).I recomend you get it if you are a star wars fan since its the best star wars game i've ever played in my life(also the most chaotic and explosive)or even if your not, its a cool game to own.

There are a plethora of new features, and it is a very fun game, but the reason I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it isn't that big of a leap from Battlefront 1. You also are a lot more controlled in story mode, but there are so many other things that you can do if you running the show yourself.

The graphics and environments are often dark with key objects more obscure than the original. The weapons selection and targeting huds are overly informative to the point of distraction. The mapping display actually seems to be less accurate than the original. The \\"space\\" missions have poor grahics compared to most air/space combat games. More importantly, the flight simulation itself is choppy and not quite up to par when you compare it to much older games such as jedi starfighter. This was a very ambitious effort, but it falls very short. It has been one of the more disappointing star wars sequals. Not a complete loss, but could have been better given the time and effort given to the project."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW the next step to the oringinal Battlefront","review":"Son really wanted this game.

Easily navigable environments.That stuff isn't in this game. Minimaps are miniaturized to the point where you'll need a big-screen tv just to understand them. Fonts are garbled or tiny. The enemy AI is jacked way up, but you can't give orders to your troops to lead them. Even playing as a Sith or Jedi isn't that entertaining.

I guess I'm spoiled by Navy Seals where you are in control of your team and can meticulously call the shots. In this game, you are on your own.

So, it's safe to say that the A.I. for your team is not all that great.What happened with the squad-based commands where you can tell your team to defend, attack, get in, etc. I think they allow that in the first battle front.I love the fact that you can pilot a ship!!!

You can play on the usual planets like Hoth and Endor, but this game has new planets to fight on from Revenge of the Sith! Suck as Mygeeto, Felucia, Courascant etc. Also you can play as the Jedi! For the light side, there is Mace Windu, Yoda, Luke Skywalker, Ki-Adi Mundi, Aalya Secura, Obi-wan, and then you can play as Minor heroes such as Han Solo, Princess Leia, and others. For the Dark side you have Darth Maul, Vader, Sidious, Dooku, Jango and Boba Fett. You can also play in space! For example, you can play as the clones and pilot an Arc 170 Starfighter, Jedi starfighter, And a V-Wing fighter. the Really cool thing is that you can playCapture the flag Star Wars version!

I prefer this set of Kyocera ceramic knives to my other Kyocera knives because these have a nice smooth plastic handle so I don't have extra demand to clean out the divets or keep wood handles sanitary.

Last week I used the point of the paring knife to remove the paper from the top of a catsup bottle. To my dismay, the entire point broke off. My thought was that I must have put too much pressure on it. Tonight I was using the larger knife to cut a spaghetti squash in half. I pulled the knife out and in the middle of the blade a chip was missing. I pulled the squash apart and inside, sure enough, was the missing chip. I am so disappointed. So I do have to give a negative review."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated by Oprah","review":"My husband likes to do a lot of cooking, I bought these for him for Christmas.

I first saw the set when opening gifts Chrismas, I expected the knives to be larger especially the Santoku knife, the paring knife was just a smaller version of the Santoku knife, not really formed right for being a paring knife.

A good high carbon steel knife will hold a better edge. The instructions that come with the knives say do NOT use on anything but a wood or plastic cutting surface. It also states that you should not put any pressure on the knife or the edge might break. I find it extremely silly to use a good steel knife to do the major cutting then get one of these to cut the items they are able to. Why use 2 knives when one works and you dont have to worry about it breaking. I also own some of the Henckel twin star series and they are a superior set in every way (also cheaper) and I dont have to worry about forgetting and cutting something on a plate or in a pan and possibly breaking the edge!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A delight to use!!","review":"If you like to cook, buy these knives!!!

I bought this knife and liked it so well I bought a smaller version from a different manufacturer (name brand manufacturer) that was on sale. Wow was the other brand a dissappointment!

And not just into the 3 sections, but into the 3 panels and then easily 5 or 6 additional rods and whatnot. It's not well-made and not worth the $30 we paid for it. We tried everything to make it work and it just didn't. Ended up going to WalMart and buying a $15 screen that is easily 5x the weight and a much better product. Now I just wish we hadn't waited so long since we missed the window to return this to Amazon. Piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds fake","review":"I tried not to get my hopes up when I bought this box set, but was still disappointed by the quality of the piano CDs. They are definitely not played on a piano, most likely on a keyboard, so the pieces all sound very electronic. I did not enjoy the piano CDs for this reason, although the guitar CDs are of decent sound and have a wonderful variety of styles and composers. All in all, the entire collection is a pretty thorough overview of composers, with names popping up that aren't usually found in these popular classical music collections (i.e. Satie, Faure). I found that refreshing, but since I probably won't ever listen to the half of the collection that is piano, I'm not sure it was good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"The epitome of elevator music","review":"I agree wholeheartedly with the reviewer below. I prefer orchestral or \\"tet\\" performances, but I wanted something a little less complex for those quieter moments.Honestly, I didn't have high expectations either, considering the price and the fact that there was no mention of who performed the pieces anywere on the box. But even with low expectations in hand, I still found this set to be extremely disappointing.As the reviewer below eluded to, the piano pieces sound like MIDI music. Very hollow and discrete; completely lacking in the richness and fullness of a real piano.The string music, on the other hand, is incomparably better- not great, but pleasant. As was mentioned, it was cool to hear pieces that are usually not played on solo strings being played on solo strings.Even so, I find it hard to recommend this set. I know for the price, it seems tempting, but even $10 is a waste if the cds are just going to collect dust on the shelf (as they will in my case)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting first novel.","review":"This interesting novel seems to have been a first in the detective genre from Paul Coggins, who has become a noted former U.S. Attorney and criminal defense lawyer since publication of this work.

What is it with 3rd party vendors unloading OLD product on Amazon and hoping that customers won't notice??? It's a despicable business practice.The reason I buy in bulk is so I can store the tea for long periods. I don't drink tea every single day and therefore the tea Moonlittree sent me will EXPIRE before I use all the boxes. Ugh. I'm certainly not going to waste my time trying to get a refund.

Not blink and its over quick but turn your head to look at your poster of White Queen and its over quick. :)If you liked the first game.. you have to get this one... if you never played the first game... find my review on that one, rent it and see if its anything you like, than buy this game. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A great idea reduced to a miserable atrocity","review":"Yes, this game is sadly an atrocity. Anyone who has played the first X Men LEgends would know that the game is actually very fun. Legends 2 is no different. However, there are far too many glitches in this game. Activision should've had a recall. This is just poor programming and testing on the part of Activision. I'm not sure if they would acknowledge it, bu there are far too many glitches. IE: Once you get into hard mode, the game constantly freezes. This is inexcusable. Equally appalling are the other bugs. Jean Grey's Mental Mastery (increases damage done by mental power attacks) does not do anything. Putting points into the last 4 bars of her Dark Phoenix skill doesn't raise its effectiveness by any means.Overall, this is a great game. It has the potential to be very fun. However, the crashing occurs so constantly that you just can't ignore it. I hope Marvel Ultimate Alliance would be much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love X-Men, but the Game Has Too Many Glitches","review":"After great reviews about the game I bought the PS2 for twenty dollars at my local Walmart several years ago.

It is about a British bomb-defusing squad and all the drama and stress endured by the participants.

The mysteries are rather transparent and I am not sure if the mysteries are the driving force in this series or just a pleasant sub-story.

They're not as low as former vocalist Jay Blachowicz's, but they're as good regardless (though certainly different.)The guitars are the same as they've always been: full of fast strumming and interesting riffs.The drums are also similar to what Malevolent Creation is known for: blast beats and thrash rolled into an effective combination.The best songs (to purposely impose my opinions on you) are 'Lifeblood,' 'Divide and Conquer,' 'All that Remains,' and 'Lifeblood' (since its so awesome, it deserves mention twice.) Oh, and I forgot about 'Lifeblood.' Man, who am I kidding? They all rule.

However, i had already purchased that dvd a few years ago and I am very upset that this was not annotated on anything in the product description or anywhere else online.

I'm overweight and new to pilates. I have been trying out various beginner workouts these past few weeks, and even the beginner ones are seventy times more challenging than this.This would be a great DVD to plug in if you just want to unwind, or learn proper breathing, or if you haven't moved off the couch in ten years. Its very low-impact, so I imagine it would be a good fit for older and severely overweight people... Not a 25 yo girl trying to lose 20 pounds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beginner's workout","review":"I would not recommend this DVD for intermediate or even for a beginner that has done some Pilates , even for a few weeks or so. The exercises are not challenging at all (not even at a beginner's level), they mainy focus on breathing techniques which you can easily find in any other workouts that are also trying to accomplish some results (body sculpting/toning). I only recommend this DVD for those who never worked out or those recovering from injuries. I am planning on tossing this DVD , only watched it once and could not find anything I might be interested in. Complete waste of money , if you were to ask me ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as advertised","review":"This is advertised as the powerhouse workout, but when the DVD starts Jillian states that it is A.M. pilates. Gaiam just took an existing DVD workout and then marketed it as something else. It is bad business practice. Besides that, it isn't much of a powerhouse workout, and disn't raise my heartrate. I would recommend it for very out of shape people or beginners to pilates. It does offer some of the meditative/spiritual side of pilates, but not good for a workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review","review":"My best friend and I are animal collective fans.

The techniques are detailed followed by large, colorful pictures. There's no guess work when it comes to interpreting directions. The author is clear and concise with every technique.

Get your training partner and practice these techniques, no substitute for practice in the different ranges. If you seek in depth principles try Jeet Kune Do From A to Z."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plethora of trapping/grappling techniques","review":"This book does a pretty good job of presenting techniques from a clinch, or another situation where one is close enought to use Wing Chun-style trapping techniques. It also covers moving into a clinch possition, as well as several takedowns and throws from said possitions. It covers using these techniques both offensively and defensively. Also covered is basic fighting stance and footwork, some standing submissions, and some leglocks for securing a person on the ground. The book was made in 1984, so it may not be 'state of the art' where some clinching and grappling techniques are concerned, compared to what has developed in modern MMA competitions. It's a decent enough book, and for someone with no knowledge of clinching, trapping, or basic upright grappling, I think it could be helpful, and is reasonably useful for MMA competition and self-defense training, but mostly as a suplementary text."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for all amateur bakers!","review":"A definite \\"two thumbs up\\" for this book!!I found it to be thoughtfully organized and written for amateur bakers just like me.This book has a fantastic collection of recipes with easy and clear cut directions with detailed color photos whichwere very helpful.This is one baking book that I know I will keep coming back to use over and over again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I am disappointed and frustrated.","review":"I am not sure what the other reviewers talked about.

DC made that possible for me with the chronicles. For any Batman fan out there, this is a must read. It was so much fun to read the early days of Batman, and see what made him and what stays with him. Suprisingly you'll see that a lot of the traditional Batman themes were created very early on. From the very beginning we are introduced to the Joker and Robin. The 40s style, sometimes laughable, is so entertaining with Batman in it. It was definately one of the most rewarding trades I've bought this year.I disagree with others and say that I think the presentation is awesome. Full color, covers, and no lengthy forewards and afterwords. If you want nothing but every comic in Batman's history, I suggest you join me and start buying the chronicles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Stories--Horribly Cheap Presentation!","review":"Batman=Awesome. There is no disputing that. And these early stories from the 40's are awesome. No doubting that, I give it 5 stars. What really SUCKS about this edition is how awful the presentation is--the worst part being the coloring. I know that comics are colored on computer now, but this thing literally looks like it was colored with Microsoft Paint!! There are pixelated edges where colors run together and there is one especially crappy looking panel with Bruce Wayne wearing a blue pin-stripe coat. It looks like they used the \\"line\\" tool to color the stripes onto the coat, it's so bad! In the \\"Greatest Batman Stories Ever Told\\" collection, there is a reprinting of the Evil Monk story, and you can see how much nicer of a color job they did there compared to this crap. Also, the format is so low-budget that when I tossed this book down on my bed, all the pages popped out from the cover! RRRggh.

Big let-down. I'm glad I bought the cheapest copy available!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little gadget with room for improvement","review":"I pretty much agree with the other reviews here, that this gadget is highly useful and does everything its designed to do well. The non-backlit screen, and awkward shape are the only negatives I can think of. The photos presented of it don't show the convex back of the device that makes it chunky and awkward to hold.A similar device with a backlit screen and comparable pricing, though not currently available on Amazon, is the Hobbes Digi Wifi."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does good job, but smokes batteries","review":"I'm just now getting around to this review. I bought it back in the summer of 2005. As I recall, I bought it because it was the only one that told you if a net was encrypted or not, afterall, no need to waste time trying to hunt down and log onto nets that are encrypted.The only downside is that it rips through the batteries pretty quick. And I think it does it even when it's powered off, so I recommend always removing the batteries once you're done with it. Maybe newer models don't have this problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun with a button","review":"It is fun to use this as you walk or drive around and see all the open networks, with default names and presumably admin passwords, that people have set up. Also nice to see channel numbers, in case you want to change yours. A few small problems:1. Button on the front gets pressed in your pocket or bag, harming battery life (mine said \\"low battery\\" shortly after purchase).2. It showed nothing at Logan airport, but when I fired up my laptop there was a very strong signal.3. Text scrolls quite slowly. Also, you press button again to see next network -- would be nice if it said total found up front."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"Must have\\" for the computer user on the move","review":"Works flawlessly. With this little gadget on the market I would never consider spending money on a Wi-Fi finder that doesn't have the ability to tell whether a hotspot is open or encrypted. The only improvement I would suggest is to recess the button to avoid accidently turning on the unit while carrying it in the pocket. I have started carrying it in my jacket pocket, rather than my pants pocket and that seems to have taken care of that issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Susan McKeown At Her Best!","review":"This is, without a doubt, Susan's best album yet. Her voice has matured and her style is fully developed, leaving us with a delightful, refreshing taste of not-so-traditional Irish music. Every track is beautiful, even the somewhat-critized \\"Oró Mhíle Grá (A Thousand Times My Love)\\", though the sound is definitely one that takes some getting used to! \\"Sweet Liberty\\" and \\"Caledonia\\" are two lovely Celtic ballads that you'll listen to over and again.This album is also a must-have for fiddle-legend Johnny Cunningham fans. The last track, \\"When I Was on Horseback\\", a particularly haunting and poignant song, was recorded just one day before Johnny passed away, in December of 2003.If you're going to buy just one Susan McKeown album, make it this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Liberty","review":"This CD is just like all previous McKeown releases: wonderful voice and great singing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the gifted kapok I received.","review":"My friend gave me her excess kapok.

It consists mostly of (not exactly rare) photographs of Castro through his life, and some video footage of him meeting with Soviet Premier Khrushchev. Overall, this documentary contains nothing that can't already be found on Wikipedia (information and photographs) or YouTube (video footage).The final ten minutes is subjective, not objective, and consists of the personal opinions on Castro of people who were U.S. officials or journalists during the Cold War.Overall, I was expecting a lot more and remain unimpressed--and I certainly do not consider myself a guru on post-1959 Cuban history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very basic, similar styles, good for beginners.","review":"Being a very experienced sewer of clothes, I was very disappointed in the very basic and simple content of this book.

What Baars discusses about 'affirmation' ties in directly with the discussions of John Paul II in Theology of the Body about the discovery of the heart.

She mentioned how she missed her \\"alien\\" seat with the \\"bug eyes\\". I ignored it until this season. For Mothers Day, I bought her a third one. It has now had the first gel pad split, there is evidence of the second pad starting to fail. It has been less than two months. Her bike is always garaged and babied, I restore bikes and maintain about 30 of my own vintage bikes. Very disappointing seat, I hope to find a different kind that she will like.

I'm a 5'6 female of average frame, and it always felt too big for me. Also, it seemed like no matter how many adjustments I made to the seat, it always ended up being pointed slightly upwards in the front, which made it even more uncomfortable to ride on.The worst feature of the seat are the gel pads. They heat up under the sun, and many times I ended up walking with my bike because the seat was too hot to sit on for any period longer than a few seconds. I ended up removing them altogether so that I could actually ride my bike.I would not recommend purchasing this product, there are others of lower or similar values that are much more anatomically comfortable (and without gel pads from hell that will give you butt burns)."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very good","review":"This seat came apart after riding on it just 4 or 5 times! I was not happy with it at all. The reason I bought it in the first place is because I liked the design.

Although the width is nice, the gel sucks! The gel pads felt soft but once you sit on it there is no cushioning. Within the first 3 months of use, one of the gel pads split. I taped it but the other side burst within 2 weeks! I taped it again and the gel pads eventually fell off a couple of weeks later! I'm not a large person so weight was not an issue. It's not worth the money. Don't buy this crappy seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Giant sponge.","review":"This seat is not the best choice. My girlfriend and I each got one for our bikes for the summer and they worked great a couple times. Going to college, bikes are a great mode of transportation however these seats weren't up to par. Both of our bikes got rained on in a brief summer shower and both seats absorbed so much water it took days for them to dry out. Even when it looked dry, when you pressed on the seat water poured out of it. This is something of an inconvenience when one returns from a 1 hour long class to find a soaked bicycle seat. If you own this seat or are thinking of buying one, make sure to cover it with a plastic bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I saw these guys live and the album is great.

This book--with its expert imagery, fine-tuned voice, perfect line breaks, and lush cadences--is especially insightful about the myriad shades of feeling and wonder that wave through consciousness, and just beneath. From the slightly comic metaphors of \\"Generation\\" to the riotous colloquialisms of \\"Stylist\\" to the sexy implications of \\"Eating San Ginigmano,\\" Barker lifts away the thinnest veil of unnecessary decorum to expose all the runnels of desire. Without being unduly graphic, WAY OF WHITENESS is one of the most erotic books of poems I've read in a long time. Very few poets I know can render both the ethereal longing and the visceral impact of sexual romance like Barker. When I finished this book, I went back to it for a second and third time. I'll surely teach it. I hope she publishes another like it, soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent-- though highly specialized-- reference","review":"If you are a follower of cryptozoology and a serious researcher on that subject, then this is a book that will not disappoint.

He is unobjective because he gives the opinion that these groups could be elected, therefore democracy is capable of hijacking itself, so he argues these political parties should be outlawed. He goes so far as to give the reader the impression that the whole nation of France is either Facist or ambivlient to Facism because the French police killed a suspected Algerian terrorist. The author gives to many personal opinions rather than a to the point analysis of groups like the Austrian Freedom Party and the French National Front to make the book a true literary work documenting the rise of neo-facism in Europe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"For the first hour this game is fun.

For some reason this embarasses me. Of course, I think of myself as one of those godawful intellectuals who have long conversations about Back's inner voices. I have to sneak away from myself to enjoy something that is simply pure and melodic, something which, in this day and age, puts emotion and beauty first.Well there, I've confessed. Chloe Agnew does a wonderful job of picking music that fits her voice perfectly and then being perfect with it. The selection runs from classical to popular, and there isn't a loser in the bunch. What I would really like to know is why there is only one Chloe Agnew album on this continent (or any other).

From the songs from \\"Walking in the Air\\" to her father's oboe performance of \\"Gabriel's Oboe\\" shine brightly.

The first fifteen seconds are great, with the inspiring astronaut voice sample and the future pop bubbling in the background...but then it degenerates into a limp, meandering, simpering that is as flacid as it is meaningless. WHY WHY WHY didn't Beloved get a US single? EPICENTERE?!!! NO single...instead we get TWO singles for Genesis? it's no wonder the industrial scene is so sad in the United States.

The myths are grouped by subject (Creation, end of times) and paint an interesting picture of human beliefs worldwide.

Indeed he seems to spare no effort to be a toady, not only in his uncritical praises and optimistic assessment of the United States's prospects in the future, but also in his putting down all other rival powers to the US, real or imagined, now or in the future. As a guide to the \\"big picture\\" view of the twenty-first century, this approach strikes me as unrealistic and contrary to the fundamental patterns of world history. The simple fact is that great powers rise and fall, and to think that America in its exceptionalism is immune to this is just juvenile thinking. The world in the twenty-first century is a lot more complicated than Bill Emmott thinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"American leadership?","review":"Is it possible that a smart man like Mr. Emmott does not realise that outside the USA hardly anyone looks up to 'American Leadership' anymore? Even my British and Canadian friends are telling me how disappointed they are now.

And the destructive hate all over the globe of the Muslims is only beginning to be felt, all of it directed at USA, though that's not directly the fault of Americans. I'm not against what he wishes to be true - as a European (& a German) I see the world differently, that's all. I'm not alone. There is in this book much wishful thinking. I don't even want to discuss all his mumbo-jumbo about Europe.

From the United States' point of view, the US-China relationship is going to be the most important bilateral relationship in the 21st century. Already in 2003 China has become America's third largest trade partner (after Canada and Mexico, and ahead of Japan) and America is China's second largest trade partner (after Japan and ahead of the EU). If the economic boom in China continues - a big if, but nonetheless a realistic one - then China will replace the United States as the largest economy within two decades.

He seemed to believe that being America's poodle is enough to make a country powerful, forgetting that France, whose GDP is $30 billion larger than Britain's, spends $47 billion on military expediture as opposed to Britains' $32 billion, and that France owns twice as many nuclear weapons as Britain does.In this book Bill Emmott shares the same insular view of Boris Johnson and refuses to accept the fact that by almost every criterion China has already left Britain (and France, Russia, Germany and Japan) choking in the dust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book is not data-dense & the writing style is very bland.

What else would make a foreign author bubble with such glee about our country like a child with a candy bar in one hand, an ice cream cone in the other, and a lollipop in the mouth?Bill Emmott reminds me of a famous line from the world of physics.

UK - $1101.6 billionIn addition, China's trade growth jumped 36% last year, compared to about 10% for the world as a whole (which figure includes China's).I don't know how any competent journalist can claim, as Emmott does, that China is peanuts in international trade, ranking behind the Netherlands (as he says in this book). The numbers show a very different picture. If any country is peanuts, it is Britain.Emmott's doubts that China's GDP growth is real must be put in the same perspective.

The human-ness of her characters, their trials and their steadfast attachment to the joy of life is a silken thread through this masterful sequel to \\"Six of One\\" and \\"Bingo.\\" Rather than seeking easy, obvious answers, Brown explores the actions dictated by human nature and strong personalities. Juts and Wheezie are more alive than ever, and the town more deeply defined in its uniqueness.I heartily recommend this book, and the series. The stories are a wonderful read, like slipping into your most comfy pajamas and having a cup of real hot chocolate in front of the fire on a chilly winter's night. A joyful mixture that will make you laugh, cry and maybe even rage a bit, but will ultimately reaffirm your belief in the strength of the human spirit to enjoy the precious days of our lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Case study in the triumph of uninformed dogma","review":"I'm inclined to be generous with the stars because of the number of clearly orchestrated negative reviews, all using identical language. Nevertheless, Losing Iraq demonstrates what happens when the object of foriegn policy is considered irrelevant, and the only consideration is ideology. It becomes clear that history, national identity and circumstances were really of no interest to the neo-cons, who were anxious to use Iraq as a proving ground for their interventionist philosophy. It also shows how alienated the policy professionals have become from those who drink the administration's kool-aid."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Literary Fiasco","review":"This is a thoroughly dishonest book written by a man who has never been in Iraq during the reconstruction he condemns -- and has never been in Baghdad at any time.

But the new one went in easy and I had the feeling of accomplishment when it was fixed."},{"rating":"2","title":"These may need replacing every few years","review":"We are big fans of \\"pressure assist\\" toilets - they flush everything down and do so without wasting excess water. If yours are several years old and giving you problems with partial or incomplete flushes, consider replacing the cartridge. We replaced all of ours and they are now better than new. One note about installation; read the directions. If you just screw them down all the way, it will leak; rather, you continue tightening until the water flow stops - no further."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!","review":"This is one of the most entertaining books I've read in quite a while. The main character being in the break up business gives the book so many quirky and humorous turns. The relationships between the characters are beautifully crafted. Fabulous chick lit!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that interesting","review":"Dani Myers is a \\"communications specialist,\\" which means she helps people break up with their significant other. She works for Your Big Break, Inc., which is not a believable company. I was irritated with the fact that most people who break up will not hire a company to do the breaking up for them. That is just tacky and weird. And building a Breakup Recovery Kit? That came off as absurd to me.One potential client happens to be a woman who is trying to break up with her boyfriend, who happens to be Dani's dad. Half of the book centers around this plot, how Dani and her brother Sean handle the changing family dynamics and how it affects Dani. The other half is what happens when Dani disobeys company rule #5: do not get personally involved. This subplot I found amusing and interesting.Overall, it is a quick read and is predictable, but it wasn't as enjoyable as I had hoped for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat and Disappointing","review":"I read and enjoyed the author's first book and looked forward to this one. I tried to like it, but was disappointed. The plot concept seemed original, but the book itself just seemed flat, no pun intended, and devoid of any real charm. The characters weren't particularly appealing and though I finished the book, it was a bit of a struggle. But, hey, maybe it's me :) Sometimes when you have high expectations, you're set up for a let-down.

I was so happy that I was able to find it right away. I read the entire book yesterday! It has been a long time since I have not been able to put a book down and I just have to finish it then. This book is so funny that I was literally laughing outloud on numerous occations (which made my husband think I was nuts!). It deals with a woman named Danielle Myers and she works for a company that will help you break up with people. Danielle's life gets complicated when a woman comes in her office to have her break up with her married boyfriend, who turns out to be Danielle's father. Her life is further complicated as she begins to fall for one of the men that she was hired to dump. I would very highly recommend this book to anyone! Very very funny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Video - Incomplete on Amazon Instant Video","review":"Time Travel Through The Bible is a great series that introduces some of the Bibles history in great detail. As a fan of Star Trek it was nice to see Jonathan Frakes as the narrator and he does a great job overall. Unfortunately on Amazon Instant Video the film is cut short to only 48 mins when the DVD states is 107 mins total. This seems to be a part 1 of 2 but the rest of the series is not on Amazon Instant Video. I am going to have to purchase the DVD to watch the rest of the series, for this part ends at the birth of Jesus. I highly recommend this series for young adults as well as adults to learn more about the history of the Bible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as good as Charmed Life","review":"In a very strange world, different and similar to ours, in a classroom a teacher finds a note tucked inbetween too books. \\"Someone in this class is a witch\\" is written in big letters.

Or is it Nam, a girl who's named atfter the most famout Witch of them all? THe teacher dosen't know but from that day on strange things start to happen. Things that only the great Chrestomanci can fix.I really liked this book. It was just as good as the other book in the series I've read, Charmed life. If your a fan of magic books and/or works by Diane Wynne-Jones I really reccomend this book. I'm part-way through the next book in the series and I'm just as pleased. If you like fictional witchcraft and magic read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Witch Week","review":"This book is very intresting and imaginative. It is about another universe where in the modern day, witches are still burned and is set at a boarding school called Larwood House where a lot of the children are 'witch-orphans'. It has an unusual plot and is a good read, but one thing which spoiled it for me is I didn't really like or identify with any of the characters. Charles Morgan was probably my favourite character. Lots of other people who have reviewed this have compared it with Harry Potter, I read this book before I read Harry Potter and don't think they are much alike at all. I prefer Harry Potter, however but I would recommend this book to people who like fantasy stories about magic, and other Harry Potter fans would probably enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rodney Yee","review":"A lot of these are a review, but I like them.

I like running and biking, you know, moving and jumping around. So I thought that yoga would bore me to tears. I tried this out because of the words power and strength. I really need to build muscle so I thought I'd give it a shot and I love this! I've been doing it for about 2 months and my flexibility has increased dramatically. The first couple times I did this it was a little hard but after awhile it'll be second nature although I still can't do pendulum pose. Word of advise, be careful when trying pendulum pose, I thought I could do it right away and wound up falling on my face! To wrap this up, you can't go wrong with this DVD. You should still do other muscle training but this'll work your arms and make you more flexible for sure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't flow","review":"This workout doesn't flow and is a very boring workout. The half hour feels like 2 hours. Bryan Kest gives a better more intense workout with great flow leaving you feel refreshed as well as having worked muscles and the 50 minutes goes in no time.

This one comes with no verbal direction and no time between transitions to get ready for the next activity. Poorly done."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good stress-reduction, physical experience","review":"You really can't go wrong with Rodney Yee. But he does lack the attention to the viewer and practitioner you'll get from Bryan Kest, for example. He doesn't talk to you or about your feelings and the poses are too quick in some places to do much good. A pose should be held about 12 seconds at least. You're in up dog about one to two seconds and must revert to down dog.Nonetheless, you get a good general physical workout and feel tenseness fade. So this short yoga session serves it's purpose.Recommended.- Susanna K. Hutcheson"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rodney Yee's the best for at- home yoga!","review":"I have been taking yoga off and on for the past 3-4 years living in Los Angeles. As I have now been broke, I figured, I guess I can do the yoga at home since I have been familiarized with different styles of yoga as well as the poses. The Rodney Yee series ( I have three now) are pretty good. The power yoga really is helpful in helping me relax as well as build up my strength. In addition, it is actually nice to do good yoga at home without the stifling crowds we get in the yoga studios. I highly recommend this as well as his other 30 minute series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goes too fast","review":"I like and own many Rodney Yee dvds. This one just goes way too fast. You move in and out of the poses so quickly that I can't see how there is any benefit. Also I was aware that this was for upper body and I like that, however the moves are very advanced and if you aren't able to do a handstand forget about being able to do most of this dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginners....period.","review":"This workout is for people who know the poses already,do not need any instructions and can move from each one with flexibility and speed. I am not one of these people right now in my Yoga practice. For example,as I was attempting to get into one of the poses he had already moved through it and was already on another pose.I am still in the process of learning to breath along with the poses as is emphasised in any Yoga practice. Apparently not in his Power Yoga series.It felt as if I was doing an aerobics workout. Not even Rodney's calming voice saved this DVD for me.I will be putting this one on my shelf until I am at a higher level of Yoga."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconsistent and frustrating","review":"Although I can do most of the poses in this and am suitably challenged by the few I can't (or can't do well), I find this DVD to be, overall, not worth it. Yee is inconsistent both in instruction and in pacing.Instruction: Sometime he doesn't tell you to exhale or what to do while you're exhaling -- he'll skip over a pose. (You go from inhale back bend to inhale namaste hands, but he didn't tell you that you were supposed to do mountain pose on the exhale. One might say you could get it from watching, but when you're in a back bend, you can't see your television.)Pacing: If you follow him properly, your breathing cycle can go from inhale and exhale in the same second to inhaling over three or four seconds. I understand that this may be intentional, but he doesn't really give you anyway to gauge which it's going to be until you're in the middle of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than mediocre","review":"I bought Two a Rou on a lark, being a fan of hurdy-gurdies in general and wanting to expand my collection with someone I'd not heard of before.

He merely puts todays interpretations on yesterdays message. As those living in past Bible times could not understand our times, likewise we cannot understand theirs. For us to try and imagine what it must have been like for early Christians is a poor guess at best.

I did not read anywhere that explained how they are funded in large part by George Soros, the maniacal billionaire whose sole intention is to bring down the current government, probably just an oversight though.The one thing this book does prove however is just how easy it is for people to be duped so I guess in light of that it deserves one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Propagandist hype by a gun-grabber...","review":"Want to support those who would take away your rights (and not just the 2nd Amendment guaranteed rights - these people are engaged in an effort to stifle the voices of the nearly 5 million people in the NRA, not to mention the countless others in all of the other pro-2nd Amendement organizations)??

Accents aside, the songs sound like typical American R&B from the same period, with lots of throbbing Hammond (and Hammond-like) organs, chattering rhythms, and inconsequential lyrics. The music isn't funky in the James Brown sense, in that the overall sound isn't dominated by exploding drums and tinny, clattering guitars. To my ears, none of these songs are awe-inspiring works of genius, but it's still incredibly fun stuff, and should appeal to any true blue dance-soul fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"so cute!","review":"i got this for a present for my mom for christams a year ago.

I just didn't realize in the beginning that the little gadget they included together with the screws is what you need to use to tighten the screws for the legs of the table (the circular thing that's seen in the middle on the photo).

I don't think so. Like others have said: rather than an account of struggle and hardship, all we have here is a bored teenager who did a 2-year stint as a street worker.I also question her reason for running away. Sure, overbearing ethnic parents can be stifling and problematic when you've grown up in a western world with (somewhat) different values and ideals to those of your parents. Fair enough, they locked her in her room most of the time and forced her to study; but is that really that bad?

Oh, and it's also supposed to pass off as a \\"...compelling and unsettling journey into the mind of a teenage girl.\\" (as written by the Globe and Mail.) Hardly. This drivel is essentially 300 odd pages of self pity, regrets, and whines. The suffering experienced by the author was self inflicted and that warrants no pity whatsoever. The book absolutely terrible. Go borrow it from your local library and refrain from purchasing it. Even then I would advise against picking the thing up.If you want to read about true human suffering, misery, and hardship, do yourself a favour a pick up \\"The Diary of Anne Frank.\\" The horrors that Anne had to live through makes Evelyn Lau's little stint on the streets look like a walk in the park by comparison."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn!

The tips and tactics are great for those of us who take our fishing seriously but have to do it on a slightly leaner budget. The show is also entertaining and Mike D. comes across as a good guy you wouldn't mind fishing with.

The film draws you in. It leads you thru the paces of a man and his pregnant wife visiting a fishing village that contains muderous children.

You think it's all figured out and you're on pins and needles to find out the ending. When you get there, you're still left with asking yourself ... WHAT???? It's worth another read or more to look at the scenario in a different perspective. A fantastic book/story line that also has that bit of heated romance sizzling.

I was so horrified by the recounting of what she had witnessed that I threw up, had nightmares that night, and still, more than 12 years after reading this, still wish I could have brain bleach to forget I ever read it. I returned it because I wanted to make sure the bookstore understood what was in it.I still love Sandra Brown. It took me a few years to read anything else new by her, but once I did I remembered why I feel in love with her stories.

I have read several of Sandra Brown's book and some I have liked and some not so much. I can't say there was any part of this one I liked. After awhile I found myself just skimming and went to the last few chapters and ended it. Even the ending was bad! Okay some liked it-so we all see things differently.

Sadly, it wasn't. The plot is ridiculously convoluted with no logic whatever to the \\"clues\\" and no good explanation as to how they are interpreted. The dialogue is absurd with one character even reduced to speaking backwards for several chapters (and does that ever get annoying)! As to the Irish accents, one can only shake one's head as characters seem to develop it then drop it all in the same sentence. This book, which I honestly had hoped to like, is a real stinker.

Don't waste a penny on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Celtic Riddle: An Archeological Mystery","review":"Being of Irish descent and having travelled throughout Ireland, I thought this would be a fun book to read. It wasn't. If there was an award for cliche filled tripe, this would win first prize. The writing is awful, the plot unbelievable (if there's any logic whatsoever to the treasure hunt clues I missed it, and defy any other reader to explain it) and the dialogue as bad as I've ever read. One of the characters even speaks backwards for several chapters! The attempts at Irish speech turn on and off, even within sentences. One has to wonder what the editor was thinking to have let such poor writing pass as a story. I really did want to like this book but I just can't recommend it or any others by Ms. Hamilton. There are numerous other books out with an Irish theme or locale and one should look for those before ever wasting money on this effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I don't know how long the author spent in Ireland, but if she went at all it couldn't have been for very long.

I DO NOT recommend getting a design in sterling silver where the stone is secured by prongs. The silver is too soft, I guess. Retailer provided a beautiful looking ring, but design is bad.

VTech tech support is appalling.","review":"Right out of the box, one of the handsets would not take a charge. A call to VTech got a live person, whose instruction was to call back in 24 hours to a different 888 number, the reason being that the tech people needed 24 hours to research the problem. When I called back the next day, the number was disconnected, and a new call to the customer service line would not produce a live person no matter what I did. I even selected the order line but was disconnected after 13 minutes on hold.I see now that other people have had the same problem with handsets not taking a charge and the bad customer service, and I leave this review as a word to the wise.UPDATE: I did finally get through to a customer support person, who helped me through the return process.

I read on another Amazon review that the phone was to be returned due to the batteries not charging, a problem I am having. I wonder if this is a common problem they are having with this model. I read on other reviews that the bottom of the phone gets heated when plugged into the base. Another problem with my phone. The phone does not sound bad when it worked. but for $120.

Other than that... it's GREAT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Replacement Parts","review":"I do like the phone. But I'm giving it a low rating because of VTech's policy regarding replacement parts. If anything fails, you must replace the whole phone. I'm just over the warranty period, and the small handset charger has stopped working. Everything else works fine. The answer seems simple -- just buy a new little handset charger. But you can't do that. I discovered that, because it's a dual handset phone, VTech's policy is to replace the whole thing, or replace nothing. So, unless I wish to purchase a whole new system, I'm stuck with one phone that can be charged and one that cannot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great phone for a reasonable price","review":"I bought this system to replace two old and incompatible phones I previously used. The installation was trivial (including the voice mail setup) and everything worked perfectly. This system has great features like a speaker mode on the handsets and 3 separate voicemail boxes.

I would definitely recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another CHECK BATTERY problem","review":"You get what you pay for - got the phone in fall 2005, and started experiencing the dreaded \\"Check Battery\\" problem noted in multiple reviews here on Amazon.The phone works great when it does work - albeit the battery life is a little too short for my own liking.Other problems noted after 1+ years - the LCD display seems to be bleeding/not showing certain pixesl now. Battery life is short."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good solid phones, excellent audio","review":"These are solid phones, with large buttons, well spaced. The audio quality is excellent, with callers saying you sound like you're in the same room. The batteries are NiMH, not NiCad, so they have no memory effect and last longer.There are at least eight selectable ring tones, some business-like and some more entertaining.The only drawbacks are that they are not true 5.8 GHz -- the handsets transmit back on 2.4 GHz. I have a home wireless network, and they do not interfere with it, though.And the answering machine will lose its time setting, but not messages or greeting, if the power goes out for even a few seconds.The volume controls are on the side of the handsets, so you don't have to fumble with the front of the phone while you're talking to set the volume.I would buy these phones again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suckie Customer Service","review":"If you have ANY problem with this phone, the company's only solution is, \\"Put it back in the original box, with the original receipt (who has this months after they bought the product?) and mail the whole thing back\\"You CAN NOT get a live person on their 800 phone system and every option tells you to mail the whole unit back. But it also tells you that if you are missing anything (like the receipt), they will mail back the broken one. Period.I, for one, will no longer purchase any products from this company. Even the e-mail I sent them gave me the exact same reply. And every option touts the web site. \\"Go to our web site\\", which tells you exactly the same thing. What if you can't access a web site?

I chose the VTech because itwas available at a great price, and I'm happy with another VTech cordless that we own. The ip5850 has performed well. It has excellent voice quality and good range. It's an attractive, solidly built unit, and I'll give it 5 stars if it proves to be durable over the long haul."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not made to last","review":"So far, I've had 3 Vtech cordless phones.

Eventually, pressing hard doesn't work either.If you want a 'disposable' Vtech phone for light use for a year or two, you may be fine.

However, I've only been using one handset since I bought this phone. One of the handset recieved is not working properly. \\"Warning! Check Battery\\" is on display. I already replaced with a new rechargable NiMH battery and receive the same error. If you swap batteries with the good handset, the malfunctioning handset will still display the same error. I'm in the military and currently stationed in Japan. With the warranty service(product replacement) of Vtech company, it is not possible for me to return the product to them since the company don't accept PO BOX, FPO or APO address.I believe no customers should even go through the pain of trying to get warranty service for a purchased brand new product.This is my first Vtech phone, it has great features maybe if the handset is working, warranty service not so good.

I called the customer line and was treated like an idot. The representative took me through the trouble shooting process which I had done from the manual several times.

The quality of the incoming messages is very poor. 5 in 10 messages are hard to understand, 1 in 10 messages is simply not understandable. The tape answering machine I had 20 years ago was better.

Definitely not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incompatible with my set-up or just static?","review":"The reception on the phone was terrible, with static so loud and constant that I couldn't hear anything else. I don't know if this was a phone defect, incompatibility with my VOIP service, or interference from other devices in my home or adjacent apartments (though I don't own a router or other wireless products). I would not recommend this item. A 2.4 GHz phone by AT&T worked without any problems under the same conditions.

We use voip which means there are NO phone lines outside to tap into. So the spread spectrum should be perfect. NOT!A minimum of three times a day our phone reflects \\"Parallel Handset in use\\" while we are talking on the phone. We hear the other party dialing and starting their conversation on our line.After about 20 seconds it does fix itself- but it should not happen in the first place. Don't count on Vtech to help either. Their response is that if someone else also has the Vtech 5.8 in our neighborhood our lines will cross. So much for their \\"spread spectrum\\" they are using."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice features but one handset stopped charging","review":"This phone has some really nice features like speakers so you can do handfree and i never hear other people talking on my line that was so annoying with my old 900 MHZ phone.Something i don't like include: flimsy battery cover, not convenient to mute the phone which i like to do while i sleep. But the biggest trouble is two months into its life, one handset stopped charging. It will not charge on either charger. I can take its battery out and put it in the other handset and it charges fine.

It's not that the batteries are dead, they may work for a day or 2, then stop again. I replaced the recharageable batteries for $30...but the same thing kept happening. The phone still rings and records messages, but 80% of the time when I try to answer a call, the handset is dead. The only other problem with this phone-answerer is that the messages are much less clear than my 16 year old Panasonic tape answering machine! It has many other helpful features and seems a bargin for the price, but is no use to me if the handsets don't work. I'm looking for a more reliable system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery Big Problem","review":"We have had this phone for about 18 months now and the batteries on both phones are dead.

While giving naturalism a fair presentation, the implication that it is bad news for the many is shown clearly. The fifth dimension is a spiritual realm which transcends the physical world. There is something within each of us which is akin to that realm. With full humility Hick presents the case for the view that we are finite fallible fragments of the universe, and that each of the major religious traditions is a path (not the only path) to Reality.

Even though, It was a risk that I didn't try this guitar, I was right to guess about a better sound and projection because the \\"biger\\" body. Since I received it (a year ago), I use it a lot in my bed and at travel circumstances. Remember that it is still a very small travel guitar, it has less projection and volumen than a Little Martin or a Baby Taylor(wich its my favorite but expensive). It takes a few practices to get use to the small accoustic body. But It has a sound volumen for playing in a small family Happy Birthday party.

I am also in love with Rodney's gentle voice and careful instruction to \\"breathe\\" in all the right places where I usually find myself holding my breath, as well as \\"soft eyes\\" which when I first heard it found myself release my eyes which had crept up my forehead!

Too fast for Flexibility","review":"I Like Rodney Yee's AM Yoga so much that I thought I'd try this one also. As a beginner, I felt that building flexibility is important, so I got this video. I tried it for a week but decided to go back to other yoga for beginners video since there is little instructions and the pace is simply too fast. In a few months, maybe I'll try it again, but I am concerned that the he doesn't hold the poses long enough for us to work on the stretch, which is key in building up flexibility. I am going back to Barbara Banagh for now, because her pace is perfect for the beginner and her videos offer a good selection of routines in various lengths and levels of rigor, so they are more versatile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"I am a beginner and only been doing yoga for about 3 months.

I love Rodney Yee and have many of his other videos. This video is really good but I recommend stretching and warming up first. It feels like it starts in the middle of a yoga session.

I deliberately ensured that I bought Rodney Yee's Yoga for Beginners, although I'm not a novice to Yoga, but wanted to ensure better form while doing the poses. It was very helpful and I felt ready to tackle Power Yoga - Flexibility.I don't particularly like voice-overs, but I don't make a big deal out of it..My main problem is that aside from the flow being too fast, his instructions and what he's actually doing are not in sync, which made it sometimes difficult to follow. This resulted in an unfulfilling short workout. I'm a bit disappointed, but plan on persevering, especially since I also went ahead and bought his Total Body Workout as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Yoga Routine","review":"Rodney Yee does a great job of explaining the movements.

The title of this book suggested an orientation toward the more active, adventurous traveler. From the way the author wrote, I don't think that she could have kept up with my 8-year-old.She seemed to value places that were quiet and comfortable. She seemed a bit intimidated or uninformed about some of the more active jungle type adventures.Belize is a great country to visit, both for the adventurous and for those who like to lie around on the beach. However, I bought this book expecting information about the more challenging types of vacation. Next time you write an \\"adventure\\" guide, send someone who likes to crawl through narrow cave entraces, hike through the jungle at night, and get wet and muddy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the same book!","review":"We used Explore Belize, which was the guide written by Harry S. Pariser, when we last went to Belize. It was a new edition o Adventure Guide to Belize. It was a big improvement in style. Unfortunately, this guide is a step back.

We really feel deceived that this is being called a \\"new edition.\\" !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fake reviewers?","review":"I havent read the guide myself but as I often use the recommendations here on Amazon it seems worth pointing out the 2 highly dubious almost identical 5-star reviews by Midwest Bookreview and Library Bookwatch who have obviously never actually used this guide and probably havent even opened the cover either. Shame on you"},{"rating":"1","title":"Find a different guide book","review":"I used this book as my main guide to Belize and was sorely disappointed. I stayed at two places recommended by the author and it seemed like she gets unduly influenced if the owner is personable or outgoing. One place in southern Belize she described as \\"luxurious\\", \\"elegant\\", and \\"truly a treasure\\". Not that I had a bad time, but there is no way anyone would describe it in those terms. Words like that mean things - was the author so naive or inexperienced as to believe them?The other place in Caye Caulker she rated extremely well and even suggested trying to get reservations ahead of time. Come on! It wasn't horrible, but not something you would go out of your way to obtain.At best, use this book as a secondary guide. If your vacation days are precious and you want to make best use of a trip to Belize, rely on a different guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost what I'd hoped for","review":"My daughter is Korean and I was delighted to find this outfit. The hanbok dress, jacket, and shoes are very pretty. I realized I'd better make sure the dress fit before giving it to my daughter in Christmas. Good thing I did - one of the snaps on the jacket was barely attached and came off as soon as I snapped it, so I had to fix that. The dress is such a tight fit that initially I didn't think it would fit. It has to be pulled to one precise spot and then very carefully snapped into place. The poor doll looked like she needed a girdle as I squished her into the dress! I'm hoping the fabric will give a little with time. For the price, I expected a bit more attention to detail. I've found better vendors for AG clothes, so I'm not sure I will buy from this one again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doll dress not as Korean as hoped.","review":"I was disappointed in the quality of the dress. I also wish it had come with some explanation of the history of the dress. I would have preferred that it come it different colors. My Korean daughter-in-law wore a pink one at her wedding. This was absolutely the ONLY choice I had for an 18\\" Korean doll dress, so I took it and my daughter-in-law appreciated my efforts. I'm not sure how it will hold up with use as the child who received it doesn't live with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"best yoga ever","review":"This DVD is good.

I had never done anything like these before and LOVED them!I immediately purchased 4 more (all excellent) as well as trying out other Kundalini Yoga instructors.This is the best of the non-Ravi & Ana Kundalini Yoga DVDs. I would prefer to have more breath of fire, and alignment pointers, like in the Ana & Ravi ones but it is very vigorous which I like, in fact, it is so energetic it has a little bit of a dread factor for me. You will sweat and feel amazing afterwards!Gurmuhk is said to be over 60 and looks pretty good.

After following the video for a few weeks, I now use some of the moves combined with some less energetic ones from other styles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kundalini clearing","review":"It's OK, if interested in Kundalini Yoga. Gurmukh is more traditional. You get the feeling of a full practise, well put together. Quite demanding as far as endurance is conserned otherwise the exercises are simple and repetitive. That makes it good for all levels, beginners will have to do less repetitions. If you are a beginner though -I 'd like to say that kundalini yoga is not the typical kind of yoga practise. Do it once or twice per week to leave time for other yoga practise,-to pull yourself together! such as iyengar or hatha for instance. Not for everyday yoga. When you think you need a cleaning up, -or freeing up go for it.I also like Ann Brett's 'Yoga quick fixes' It is nice and fresh and you will find many of Gurmukh's exercises and more. So long!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite","review":"I completely agree with Sally's review. I tried this tape a few years ago ( no DVD at that time) and injured myself due to the pace and intesity of the workout. It didn't take time to walk me into the postures nor allow for a breath between postures. It did not explain the process very well, just going from one position to another. If you're young and in good shape then you can do any exercise routine but unless you have practiced kundilini yoga for a few years I recommend not starting out with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpected but fun!!!","review":"I knew it was not a yoga video in the sense of what we all expect of a yoga video but still I was amazed.

I get a really nice feeling with this work out, and true, the things you do canmake you feel silly, so don't do it in front of a football fan or what ever- I have only been pracicing a week and I can feel the positives already. Very good meditation practice at the end too. One of the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've seen better","review":"I've been doing yoga DVD's for almost two years, about 2x/week on average. I went from unable to stretch at all to almost a full russian split, and very flexible & loose compared to most people. I love the the Ultimate Stretch Workout with Ana Brett & Ravi Singh which is also a thorough workout but was fun and left me stretched not tight. (...)

The only similarity I see is the end corpse pose. For the physical part, I would say it is quite primitive compared with other yoga. Moves include: spin your upper body around your spine, kick your leg across your body, some Konfu style punch, every move repeats forever.. It might be the origin of all other Yoga, but other Yoga has already evolved to much higher level. My dad's own choregraphed exercise is better than this. Frankly I can not find any thing special from this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"silly yoga","review":"Totally silly yoga: I felt like laughing at myself as this guru wanted me to pant like a dog with my arms in the air for 3 minutes.

'Aint That Just Like A Woman' and 'Goin To The River' are infact by Ronnie Hawkins (recorded at Hallmark Studios, Toronto, 1964). The other songs are for the most part mistitled . Sound quality is to be expected from a live recording of this era; muffled and at times rather unclear, but it is not the worst of the type. Musically you will find (from Alice) heavy, sometimes cacaphonic garage-psych tinged heavy rock.

You (and up to 3 other people) can play as characters from the X-men and the Brotherhood.

This is great when you have friends over and want to play an offline multiplayer co-op game."},{"rating":"1","title":"While it's not the worst game...","review":"You'd do well to avoid the gamecube version of this game, if you have a choice. The graphics are overly compressed so that everything looks blurry, and to make things worse, there is no contrast between your tiny character models and the admittedly detailed background. This can result in you sitting right in front of your TV to tell what's going on. That might be worth it if the game were a little more FUN. The levels and enemies are pretty bland and cheesy. My girlfriend and I were bored by the second level. There are at times weird text formatting bugs in the written dialogue, and some of the spoken dialogue sounds like it comes straight out of a backstage professional wrestling argument. Imagine Macho Man as Sabretooth and you're close.

Accounts of how life in Bihac town was, stories from and about local people, and their views on how life in Bosnia might have ended had the US not broken the weapons embargo, were missing.And then perhaps a subjective epilog from the author on how to survive an onslaught by an army, which is supported with men and material from the JNA."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!","review":"We started listening and playing with this CD at my daughters story time at our local library.

It's soulful and jazzy, and even has a gospel edge (\\"Changes\\").The title track has a definate Memphis soul influence, with noticeably fuller instrumentation than the other tracks.

I found the information in this book to be fairly presented and without the snide comments the subject is famous for. Very interesting that \\"the most famous mother in America\\" was working after her child was born, verified by college pay registers listed in the appendix. Also interesting that she (1 had affairs with a married men(Bill Balance, Lew Bishop); 2) cohabited prior to marriage with Lew Bishop; 3) was trying to get pregnant while not yet married to Bishop; 4) Bishop was a dead-beat dad who had to be taken to court by his ex-wife to support his then 16-year old child. Puhleese! Although I don't dislike Dr. Laura entirely, I find her obnoxious when she tries to sound like a prophet from the Old Testament. This book captures the real Dr. Laura."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cha-ching","review":"That's the sound the author of this book was looking for. Popular subject written in the true muck-raking tradition of the tabloids -- so we stretch the truth a little and reach a little to find the negative and quickly gloss over the positive and smile while all of Dr. Laura's \\"targets\\" scramble to make themselves feel superior by reading this \\"great revelation\\". All of these other \\"reviewers\\", such mean hearts. No wonder they found this \\"entertaining\\" and \\"true\\". Lots of people who are good people have made bad life decisions or haven't had the best advantages.

The author really seemed to get to the heart of the matter concerning the good \\"Dr.\\" and her true way of looking at things, even better than the Vanity Fair article did. The life that she apparently leads in her personal life differs greatly from the one she attempts to show on the radio, and this book conveys that magnificently. She really had me fooled! The interviews in the book of her estranged mother and former coworkers I found to be quite believable. It is a pity that she didn't agree to be interviewed herself to try to rebut some of what was said. But I guess that's why they call it \\"Unauthorized\\". As someone currently in therapy, I look up to psycologists in general, and I always really tried to look up to her.

Dr. Laura made the same \\"mistakes\\" or were they \\"on-purposes\\"? Having her tubal ligation reversed in order to become pregnant by a married man was an extremely manipulative act. And it seems that Dr. Laura has remained manipulative, not to mention sadistic, to the present time. What she did to Dr. Barbara DeAngelis (having the nerve to claim that her psychology degree was bogus, when Dr. Laura's OWN degree is in physiology, NOT psychology) is downright bizarre, yet she got away with it. Her audiences must consist only of masochistic idiots who believe that they deserve to be called stupid by a woman who doesn't practice what she preaches.

But I found this book very dull, especially after listening to her program regularly. Dr. Laura does a great job of shocking the audience with her agressive advise and humiliation of her callers, but this book was just plain dull and unenlightening. It took very little information, expanded on it to the point of frustration and rambled on and on and on. My recommendation is not to bother with this book, it was a poor attempt to capitalize on the Dr. Laura Phenomenon, and I don't even like the lady!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Suggestions","review":"This book was very very good.

It turns out the stray dog had wandered all of Ohio to find another stray of the same obscure spaniel-type breed to have puppies with, that is purebred puppies. At this point you start to suspect that the movie was written by some old German Nazi movie producer who wants to re-create Hitler's dream of a pure race on the Cleveland Clinic campus. Everybody there is white. And not as much a single doctor with a Jewish sounding name. The patients are all white, and even the janitor is white.

I'd hoped for a solid, evenhanded treatment of the experiences of the Vietnam Veteran's Movement and the important struggle for better treatment from the VA and other government agencies. Instead, the book leans heavily leftward and resorts in many instances to almost childish caricatures (Henry Kissinger has an \\"...elitist, smirky Harvard smile...\\"; government agents are \\"...FBI guard dogs...\\") and inconsistencies.

The only reason I checked this book out of my local library was to confirm a couple of things about John Kerry and the VVAW. All my questions were answered either by the book or by a recent interview with Gerald Nicosia. The first was that the other members of VVAW felt that John Kerry was just using the organization to gain public notoriety to help him with his political career.

It made me think this wasn't going to be a good choice but I brewed a pot anyway. It was so bad that after one cup I poured the rest down the drain. It is bitter, it has a \\"grain like flavor\\" kind of like chewing on unsweetened Metamucil powder, and it has a terrible aftertaste that lingers long after you finish drinking it.

Plus, she even talked about Fulcanelli, whose works I have been aware of, which has increased my intrigue into this book. As it turns out, I found this book to be quite fascinating and rather entertaining, and most certainly a food for thought.I found myself reading this book more than once because it contains most interesting clues and insights about Rennes-le-Chteau and the mystery into the alchemical lore. But, the reason that I find it \\"entertaining\\" was due to the poetic attestations or statements of the subjects rather than having them been based on irrefutable facts.I do recommended this book for those who are specifically interested in the alchemical work and the mystery of Rennes-le-Chteau."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last Roman Catholic","review":"A good book for those who wonder what happened to the Catholic Faith in the aftermath of the devastating Second Vatican Council.

Marquardt writes with clarity and grace about things which strike at the heart of the experience but are often hard to quantify.

The idler wheel seized on mine, and when I took it apart to check the bearings I found that the bushings were not replaceable, and not listed on the parts list. I was using just the disc wheel for a bit after removing the belt drive, and the capacitor that starts/runs the motor exploded. This is not unusual for cheap electrolytic capacitors, so replacing it should remedy that. But Grizzly tech support says that there is no capacitor! It is omitted from the parts diagram as well.

They said it sounds like the motor burned out & they could send me a replacement motor for the unit, at my expense ($81 + shipping - another $20). An entire new combo sander is $125, so I pitched the unit in the garbage & ordered a Wen combo sander through Amazon, couldn't be much worse than the Grizzly I had.

For one thing, the authors exude an opinion in their writing that ASP.NET is useless without XML, and that XML is the greatest thing to come along since the transistor. I disagree with the sentiments, but that's beside the point. This book doesn't accomplish anything in the end but to confuse the reader. It's as if the authors are trying to impress you with how many acronyms they can spit out in a single page (I counted over 30 on one particular page). This is not writing, this is not teaching, it is shooting facts at the reader with a shotgun.In retrospect, I read this book a year ago when I was new to ASP.NET (but not to XML). I find it useful for storing read-only data in XML to be used in ASP.NET web sites. However, it's still one of the dryest books you will ever find."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lives up to Title","review":"I too found it difficult to find an XML book dealing with Specifically .NET.

If you have any of the same desires, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK.In addition to being horribly written, convoluted, and cryptic, the book is not \\"written with VB and C# examples.\\" Some code is VB and some is C#, yes, but nothing is written for both. For example, one section I wanted to implement was written in VB. Period. No C# alternative, not even a mention of C#. Move on, next topic.

There are very few examples, and even fewer pictures to display the effectiveness of the examples.

Then if you do get the sunflower seeds in, the holes are too small and the seeds won't come out unless you shake the bottle. Even if you shake the bottle, sooner or later water will get into the bottom and wet the seeds. And if it is winter, the water and the seeds freeze.

Even on high, it was pretty quiet, and the features (oscillation, remote control, etc) were great. Unfortunately, after just a month of use, I noticed it started to get a lot louder on the highest setting. A week or two after that, it got unbearable to sleep with on the loudest setting, mostly because it was an inconsistent noise: sort of a cranking sound every 10 seconds. This probably has to do with oscillation, as it sounds better when it's not oscillating (but still louder than it should). My solution was to leave the fan on medium setting, but soon even that setting started to get loud. I checked the fan to make sure it wasn't dirty,any broken parts, etc, and everything looks normal.

She even cites a study that I did while affiliated with The Institute of Human Nutrition at the Columbia University Medical School.

I was greatly disappointed.The topic is inherently fascinating, but the redundant writing style was a continual distraction. Additionally, presentation of the relationship between the Israeli and Palestinian adversaries was shallow, and the terrorist bombings were presented with very little variation from one incident to the next.Overall, this was a disappointing read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Thrilling Read","review":"No one can dispute the fact that Samuel Katz is probably the world's top expert in the subject matter at hand. This true account of the hunt for a master terrorist goes far beyond anything a wild imagination could concoct. It is fascinating, detailed, and an absolute must for anyone interested in terror, counter-terror and espionage. One wonders how Katz has managed to glean the information that makes this book a page-turner, for certainly much of it must be stamped \\"Top Secret\\" and locked up in a safe somewhere. It's a \\"must read\\" for both amateur spies and the top case officers at Langley."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unattributable sources and Interviews","review":"With no information on the author regarding his credentials (except to say that he is a \\"expert on terrorism\\") no bibliography, no index and lots of interviews and sources that are unattributable one is left wondering if this is made up journalism!

It's virtually pure propaganda of Israeli intelligence and their military services. Samuel Katz takes a one sided view here and mostly describes the Israeli population suffering due to the suicide bombers destruction. He virtually ignores the fact on why the Palestinians resort to this method and does not inform the readers how the Israeli's murder of innocent civillians started the whole issue. Samuel Katz should have explored both sides of the issue well before writing this book. Furthermore, those wanting to know of how Israeli agents tracked the bomber would be dissapointed as the book largely focuses on Israeli politics. A bad buy to anyone interested. I would recommend \\"By Way Of Deception\\" by Victor Ostrovsky and \\"Gideon's Spies\\" by Gordon Thomas for a compelling read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Life Thriller","review":"Ever since 9/11, hundreds of armchair terrorism experts have taken up the pen. But Katz has been living in this world and writing about it for decades, and The Hunt for the Engineer is probably the only true life thriller I've ever read on the subject. Katz takes us right down into the drainpipe of homicide-bomber mentality and tells the real story of what it takes to thwart and defeat the twisted minds and fingers of the master terrorists. If you're looking for a primer on what truly has been going on in the Middle East, this is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hated to Finish It !","review":"This is one of the very few books I've EVER read that I actually hated to finish.

This book has much more about \\"the hunt\\" than it does about \\"the engineer.\\" Even more broadly, this book is about the Israel politics in the 1990s, the attempts at peace, attempts by terrorist groups to thwart that peace and Israel's attempts to stop those terrorists. At times, Ayyash (the engineer) seems like a bit player in this narrative. There is very little biographical information available about Ayyash, so Katz makes do with what he has.I agree with another review who was concerned with Katz's overly vivid descriptions of events and scenes he didn't witness. I also found some of the bombing scene descriptions redundant and cliched.As a whole, however, this book is a good choice for those interested in modern Israeli affairs, terrorism and counter-terrorism and peace between Israel and the Palestinians."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rated: Do Not Buy","review":"The motor for the juicer broke within seconds of being turned on for the first time.

And those skills were the point of inner order training. Which leaves the impression that the author missed the point (that one at least). To be fair it was early in his career.

I can go to that page, and get a complete plain-language explanation of the test and what it measures. Examples are provided for each test to determine appropriateness, and this section is followed by an example with computations. A complete analysis of the data and a discussion of the test ensues. All of the necessary tables for computation are included in appendices. I am a complete novice at statistics, and this book has helped me to understand material in classroom lectures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Backbone for statistical analysis","review":"Excellent book for handling all common and uncommon stats tests. Plenty of examples for application, an overview for each. This book is good for those that have had stats and need a reference guide on them later. I would not recommend this for anyone that has not actaully formally studied higher end stats."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Casualties Newest Attack","review":"The Casualties have been around for 10 years and running, this being their brand new full length in a while. It's a little different than their early music in 90-95, but it's great. The whole cd is a constant attack of aggression, anger, and fast crunching guitar riffs, the way street punk is supposed to be. This cd has great songs like \\"No Way Out\\", \\"Preachers\\", and \\"Violence\\". On the end of it they even cover an old Exploited song \\"Dead Cities\\". It is awesome cover too. With the same aggression, as the original, only like 3 times faster than the original. This cd is a must for Casualties fans along with anyone who likes street punk at it's best period."},{"rating":"2","title":"True punk! Don't like it, **** off!","review":"This is my favorite punk band, I'm glad there are still real punk bands around, I hate that poser punk crap(Blink 182, Green Day, and most things people call \\"punk\\"), it is like a boy band with a guitar and drums. This is like they did one take of each song and don't care how it comes out(like true punks would), and it works. To those who like real punk, hate the government, like drinkin, drugs, or all of the above, this is your new band. They don't have any bad songs, they all kick a**!

Peter byrnes funding may have ended, but I'm sure his research hasn't!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It is worth seeing.","review":"The video offers quality substance of coherent inquiry touching whether or not the existance of such a beast is feasible. The inclusion of \\"novel\\" affirming material endows the film with a \\"breath of fresh air\\" essence.However, one of the amatur films purported to be of the beast could have been edited without harming the film. Indeed, some of the positive witnesses included in the documentary exude a slightly questonable quality while being interviewed. (I wouldn't want their court testimony on my behalf :) Surely other footage more worthy of review could have been included.Even so, the study demonstrates sound work, comes packaged respectably, and warrants the investment of anyone geniunely interested in Bigfoot."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must See For Both Believers And Sceptics","review":"Lots of information in this video, and plenty of facts to answer common questions regarding if Bigfoot is real or not. Some interesting facts were that some bigfoot print casts display dermal ridges, same as fingerprints, what hoaxer would take the time to do this? How can something as big as Bigfoot exist in todays world and not be seen? Since World War II there has been 73 aircraft lost in the forests of the Pacific Northwest,and they haven't been found either. Why haven't we found remains of a Bigfoot? According to Peter Byrnes, in over 20 years of asking he has yet to talk to anyone that has found the remains of bears that have died naturally in the forest, and we know bears exist.

I actually bought the triple Cardoza \\"Beat the Casino\\" videos in one set that feature Video Poker 2000, Casino 2000, and 100 Slots 2000. They are all way too slow for me.

If only, the chracters were a little more likable. sadly, her imagination, as far as plotting goes, seems to have been fed on daily doses of soap operas and too many oprah winfrey shows. despite being quite disappointed with the plot, the sheer quality of her prose made me finish the book in a canter.Beth Standing has an uncomfortable relationship with her mother who is hiding a tragic secret form her. As a child, she seeks solace and comfort in her neighbourhood friend Dan. But when they grow up and Dan falls in love with Beth, things take an \\"unexpected\\" turn.That in short is the plot with way too many twists in between.Read the book nevertheless for Macdonald's wonderful writing skills."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rhythm Band Fun","review":"This is one of the most helpful little books for use with rhythm instruments. It is designed to aid in the instruction of the simple instruments used in the elementary music classroom. The combination of their use becomes what is known as a rhythm band, commonly used to accompany music which is sung, played by instruments or played on a recording device. It is also useful in assisted living and nursing home settings for music therapy or recreation time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but ...","review":"When it arrived it was cute and color was soothing but after the first/initial wash in warm water it start falling apart.

These Speakers are not the best i would go with another company not boston."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This entire CD is ridden with cheesy vocals......from track one to twelve. If that is what you are into, then this is the disk for you. If you're into horns, whistles, & sirens....this is the one for you.The baselines sound like the ones you would find in an early nineties \\"bass\\" CD.I had to take this CD out of my car, just after one day of having it.I have seen DJ Spice a couple times(with DJ Friction) and they rocked. Brad Smith has put out other sick tracks. Just not sure what happened with this one.P.S.

What a wonderful surprise. I was careful not to order the tiny, postage stamp size for $5.99. Thanks to your reviews, I knew I could never work with anything so tiny. Instead I ordered the $8.99 version. The cards are 3 long by 2 wide, perfectly lovely for a travel/meditation deck. The hard-covered book that accompanies the deck fits snugly into the surprisingly stylish little box along with the cards.This serves as a lovely collectors deck. I would not recommend it for new readers. Although some of the cards are in line with traditional images of \\"learner's decks\\" many are not. The Chariot depicts a man doing tricks on a bike, The Magician is represented by a rabbit. The Emperor is an ornate cowboy boot with a face. Etc. Although these are great, imaginative images, if you're doing readings they may not evoke the powerful results you're committed to.Whimsical. Colorful. Lovely. Ya gotta love this deck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not recommend for someone just learning..","review":"These cards are lacking a lot of the symbolism that RWS cards have that help when reading the card. I do not think this is good for beginners. I do think that the cards could be used as a travel deck for someone more experienced with the cards. I also found them a bit difficult to shuffle as they are very stiff and of course smaller than a regular deck. If you want cards, especially if you are a beginner I would invest a little more and either get the Rider Wate Smith version, or a deck inspired by, that has a decent \\"starter\\" guide for understanding how to use and interpret the cards. I recently ordered the Gilded Tarot Deck and can't wait for it to come in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute and accurate!","review":"So cute! and the imagery on the major arcana is accurate and appropriate. This deck would be fine for an older child or teenager learning to read, but I wouldn't discourage an adult from enjoying it too. I prefer the simplified images because I try to remain open to spiritual influences during a reading, and cards that editorialize on their own meaning can be a distraction."},{"rating":"1","title":"INTENSIVE WASTE OF TIME","review":"In a word,USELESS.

I pray to God we never have another time in our history like that shameful. It always amazes me, to this day, just how inhumane people can treat their fellow man. Great book and I learn something with every book I read. This book is a glimpse into the horrors of World War Two. Vivi was a survivor but she was lucky if you can call what she went through as luck.

To watch her play is mesmerizing. I also expected a whole CD of Fiddle music to be too much. Wrong! so happily wrong. The magic transcends the visual. The entire CD is arranged into an ethereal journey and when it was over I felt lightened.

Also this was a very hard to find album at the time. I'm a big fan and had to wait till now to get my copy. This is a solid slab of metal and should not be overlooked. Its got the growls and fury of \\"Blut\\" and a few moments of exploration like the Goth anthem \\"Love Is Dead\\" wich would go over big with Type O Negative fans. If you think they lost the plot, look again at this one.They did come back to heaviness with \\"Gemini\\" and \\"Atlantis\\". Lets hope they release \\"Gemini\\" properly some day also.

When he finally gets to her department, pandamonium ensues among the employees. The final role the computer takes in the company symbolizes the way computers will be used in the workplace for the next 50 years. The side story between Hepburn and Tracy is classic.

This 1957 comedy is all about the acting and the entire lineup does a great job. If you like old movies this is one to add to your collection. I especially liked being able to watch it on Amazon Prime right after purchase.

I'd like to exchange it and try again, as I'm sure this is a good classic movie worth watching and adding to my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best screen team of all time","review":"After 50 plus years of being a fan of Katharine Hepburn, it's great to finally have all of her films with Spencer Tracy in one DVD disc set. Plus, It's nice that the set includes her tribute to Tracy -- The Spencer Tracy Legacy. If one more item could have been added, I would like to have seen \\"All About Me\\" -- Hepburn's narrated story of her life and career as part of this set. As a collector, I like the fact that the disc set comes with a paper sleeve that replicates the photo of Tracy and Hepburn that is inside the cover of the plastic case. The set also includes a little booklet featuring photos from the films.It's a nice set and one that was long overdue. Every Hepburn/Tracy fan will want to own this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Desk Set","review":"This is great movie for fans of Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy. It's also a great movie if you are a lover of classic movies. It's a good comedy, and Hepburn and Tracy are terrific in this movie genre. Some people will find it interesting what technology was like about fifty years ago and the effect it had on people at that time. It's the kind of comedy that will keep you laughing without getting raunchy or unpleasant. Baby boomers will enjoy this, and so will younger people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this Movie from Amazon","review":"A \\"must see\\" for Tracy and Hepburn fans.

This is one of the laterTracy/Hepburn movies but both are in top form and ably supportedby Joan Blondell and Gig Young. Probably ahead of its time sinceit is about an electronic brain being installed at a big TV networkand whether it will replace human beings.

You expect nothing less from the team of Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn. However they do not distract from the performances of the other actors who are well-known in their own right. Harry Ellerbe, who plays Smithers, played the main role of Richard Sumner in the play.Bunny and her staff and the research department are all preparing for Christmas season. But who should appear on a seen but the mysterious Richard Sumner, with a tape measure, 24 questions, and mysterious past in electronic brains. The conversation between Richard Sumner and Bunny are worth with film its self; yet it only gets better from there.Like many plays the real worth and interest is in the dialog and interaction of the characters more than the action or the overall story.

The plastic handle on this knife is too small and does not cover enought of the hilt when closed. When the knife is closed, the bottom corner of the hilt is exposed from the handle of the knife. If you carry the knife in your right pocket, using the clip, your hand will get scraped by the sharp corner everytime you reach in your pocket. This coupled with angle of the serrated thumb rest causes your hand to get snagged. Choose a different model Spyderco."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great knife","review":"I don't think I'll drag on for too long on this review.

VG 10 steel for a pretty nice price. It came razor sharp, could shave with it, but I've never shaved my face with a knife(would probably get a few cuts).

I liked that not all of the recipes were purely chocolate, there was a good combination of coffee cakes and muffins that had a good balance of chocolate to other ingredients. I only have a few complaints. One is the authors love of coconut. I hate coconut and wish the author would have remarked if the coconut was required or optional as she does with nuts. Also, some of the recipes require odd sized pans like a 10 inch square or a 9 inch tart pan that it 2 inches deep (most are one inch). I wish she would have included a substitute pan guide.

I would have liked alternative recipes to make my own. I cannot imagine me presenting a dessert to guests in which the primary ingredient is Heath Bars!I also have a big problem with everything being 'measured' in cups, spoons, etc (except the chocolate).

I have written two none 4 or five star reviews on their products, I believe in giving a company a second chance, and neither appears on their products. It is like they won't post lower star reviews to get you to buy from them. You can't tell me everyone is happy with everything they sale. I had ordered a helmet from them and the latch was broken when I took it out of the box so I called them to see about a replacement and I had to argue with them for a long time to finally get them to exchange it.

Playing anything other than beginner songs is an exercise in frustration; it seems like if you've had your foot on a note any time in the past few seconds the pad won't register another step, which makes playing anything with multiple steps or a rapid step on the same arrow pretty much guaranteed to miss.

The most dramatic manifestation of this problem would come after I finished a game - the roulette wheel where you select songs would run around in circles endlessly. I could only get it to stop by picking up the pad and shaking it.

The authors take a spattering of information from other sources (they are not researchers or policy makers themselves), tell a few narratives, and that's about it. You are much better off buying another book on generations.Also, notice the publisher: Focus on the Family. Thus the book is written from an explictly stated Christian perspective. For some readers this might be a bonus; others might be put off by this in a book that is not about religion."},{"rating":"2","title":"A History of Change and Values in America","review":"It was very helpful to explain generational differences using a decade analysis approach. Stories and conversations used to illustrate the socio-economic and technological changes for each decade were also helpful in giving the reader a better understanding of how much impact each decade has on our values and perspectives. Although the authors base their assumptions that character and personality are determined around age 10, his theoretical model is quite accurate in helping assess each decade.If I don't give it a 5 it is because in my opinion the book does not reveal any new facts not explored before that talk about generational differences. The differences between Baby Boomers and other generations have been a long-discussed topic. Nevertheless, the fact that they bothered discussing each decade and its impact on values in America is engaging and invites for further discussion on this issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Builders vs. Everyone Else?","review":"The authors bring out a few interesting points, but this book seems to be aimed towards reconciliation between builders (pre WW2 generation) and the rest of us. It paints a picture of each generation that could at best be called cartoonish. At worst, the picture painted is stereotypical generalizations drawn from a world where everyone is white and generations are easily classified. The chief problem with this book is its age. It fails to paint an accurate picture of today's generational divides due to its age.This book does create some interesting thoughts, but would be most useful in an aging church that is trying to change its mission to include younger generations."},{"rating":"1","title":"boo to \\"soccer moms\\" and hurray for working women everywhere","review":"I agree with the previous reviewer who wrote of the guilt trip that this book gives to working mothers. I am an Australian who is residing in the USA, and I am shocked and appalled at the American attitude towards working mothers. In Australia it is the norm for women to pursue careers and work in fulltime jobs, whether they are single, married, de facto, mothers, young, old, whatever. Childcare is a policy issue for government, is often subsidised, and considered imperative for the growth of the economy and the wellbeing of the community. What assistance does the American government give to working mothers?! How does the American media portray mothers of Generation X?! The attitude here is so far behind it is laughable. For American authors to claim authority over subjects such as Generation X and its place on the world stage, they will need to update their ideas and look to other societies as well as their own."},{"rating":"2","title":"great show","review":"I agree that every business owner should see this series.

It was structured a little differently than any other episode I've seen in the series, and Tabatha wore the dress from the title sequence.

However, be warned---this is truly not a story for the faint or tender-hearted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humanity can be frightening","review":"Take a story based on reality and have it written by Ketchum and you have a stunning story.

Very good read with an unusual plot and ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"I threw this book away when done","review":"This book was well written, the characters fleshed out, but the subject matter and the presentation just turned my stomach. It wasn't fun and exciting. It was like reading DCFS files and seeing pictures of the pain inflicted on children by sick twisted others. I threw the book away so no one else would have to remember it. It was too raw for me and that's saying a WHOLE LOT. Ketchum is a fine writer. Buy offspring instead if you want something that gory and depressing to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unoriginal and Unnecessary","review":"The author has no imagination. He took the story outline from an actual crime, changed a few details, added some explicit gore, and gave it a new name. Read \\"House of Evil\\" by John Dean for the true story. \\"House of Evil\\" is even more disturbing because it's true. There was no need to repackage this horrible crime. Don't bother with this version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Copycat story!","review":"This is a copycat of what happened to Sylvia Likens. Minor adjustments made, but basically the same story. Not very original. You should read the original story \\"House of Evil\\" by John Dean."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Girl Next Door","review":"This book was certainly disturbing, but really not worth all of the time and effort I had to put in to locating a copy.

I had the unfortunate timing to finish it before I went to bed - I think i lay there for at least two hours trying to figure out what I had just put my brain through.What a magnificent, terrifying and twisted story. It is honestly the very first book that has ever made me really think about the characters who stayed with me for days afterward. This sounds silly, but I had to put the book away, otherwise every time I saw it I would think about the story and get all \\"weirded out\\" again.Mr. Ketchum is a talented and gifted story teller who really holds your attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't think so","review":"This was my first Ketchem book. I choose this one due to all the rave reviews. I don't know. Perhaps I am missing something; perhaps not. Maybe this is just not my cup of tea. I thought the writing was fair and the characters very fleshed out. But there is just so much of a girl tied up in a basement being tortured that could be interesting. It also got very frustrating watching all these people coming and going and watching the beat and not even saying anything about it. Sorry, I just didn't get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting","review":"Book started out good...and then fell off into a deep dark hole... A very sick story.

If one appreciates the author's attention to historical details and the crisp descriptions of the characters, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing","review":"I chose this book as my own intro to Jack Ketchum, as he makes regular appearances at the horror convention that I like to go to, so I figured it'd give me a reason to swing by his booth. I started reading it out loud to my dad, as his eyes keep him from reading, himself. This book had so many moments where I just felt uncomfortable having to read it, and my dad even asked me to stop reading it to him at one point, because it was too disturbing for him. No book has ever had that effect on him before, and it is only because of the very realistic and agonizing depictions of child abuse that are written about throughout the story. I had to finish the book on my own, and it definitely convinced me to want to read more by this author. While I haven't really read any other stories based on this subject matter, it certainly seemed to be written quite well, and I would suggest this book to anyone willing to put themselves through it."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THY NEIGHBOR","review":"High tension and horrifying moments take center stage in the very haunting and narratively compelling THE GIRL NEXT DOOR. Jack Ketchum pulls out all the stops in this coming-of-age tale of survival among evil, whose human form is scarier than any monster imaginable. Based on a true story, Ketchum's fifth Leisure offering is explicit to the core and not for the fainted heart. It is a ride like no others, but a well-deserved one, for TGND is one scary read, told with a sharp and inhibited mind. An unforgettable journey to the center of madness. If all horror novels were like this one, any fan of the genre would suffer from insomnia. Yes, hate kills. Just ask Jack Ketchum; he has one heck of a story for you.-----Martin Boucher"},{"rating":"1","title":"DISTURBING","review":"This book was a train wreck.

When I read some of the reviews, I saw horror, I have read horror books and I enjoy some of them. This one passed the horror level and went diving right into things I did not expect. There was mental illness and child abuse of such an extreme nature that it was disgusting. The story begins very mildly and you do not expect what you are coming to when it begins. Truly not a book for anyone who does not find the abuse of a child to be entertainment, as I certainly do not. I am not prudish and I understand things happen in this world that are just this disgusting, I just do not choose to find them entertaining. I am sorry that I ordered this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"It should have been the torture of the girl next door.","review":"This may have been written well and suspensefull but too graphic of prolonged torture of a young person.I had to skip over some of the torture to get to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning!","review":"With such a wholesome sounding title, I was surprised at this perverse and sickening narrative.

For someone to come up with these ideas has to be a little unstable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrific","review":"This is the most horrific, disturbing book I have ever read. I always finish a book once I start reading it, but in this case I had to force myself to do so. If it were possible to give less than one star I would do so.The book chronicles a group of young boys - encouraged by a psychopathic neighbor - who kidnap, torture, mutilate, rape and eventually kill a young girl who is their friend.I can't help but wonder what would motivate Mr. Ketchum to write this book.I also can't imagine anyone but a sadist finding anything positive about this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Read","review":"The Story is a little dark, but a good read.

The characters were left undeveloped, and there was no real plot. The story focuses on the torture and eventual death of a teenage girl at the hands of her guardian, a single mother, and the neighborhood children. I am not a squeamish person, but I found this book to be disturbing not in terms of a story line (there wasn't one) but because its only purpose seemed to be to describe the horror of a young girl. An exploration into the psyches of her perpetrators would have lent the book some sense. As it was, I couldn't wait for it to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing","review":"I read other reviews before ordering this book and thought it would be a good one to select. It was very disturbing to me because child abuse strikes so close to home for me. The book was well written, but some of the language could have been left out. It is hard to fathom humans treating another human in that manner. I had to finish reading the book, but I almost feel like I need to remove the disgusting story from my Kindle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"I enjoyed this book, it kept me wanting to read more.

This book I found deeply disturbing and I would not recommend it.I am unsure why it is referred to as this author's 'most sought after book'.This book is an easy read, however, it left me uneasy and horrified as a parent.I understand that perhaps the author wanted to bring up the bigger idea that if we sit back and allow things to happen we are just as guilty as participating in what is occurring around us.

Five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've never been more Frightened by a Book","review":"As i have said above I have never been more frightened by a book in my whole life. Consiquently, i also haden't been more grossed out by a book either. I say this was exactly what i was looking for and i finally found it. Be careful what you wish for never fit in a better situation. And then i found out it was based on a true story.After i completed reading it, i felt sick to my stomach. I have never had that feeling from a book before. It got me thinking about the things that happened and those who participated in the events that let it happen. Its an eye opener and i think that exactly what the author accomplished what he was looking to do.Suffice to say he is my new favorite author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad, but I couldn't put it down","review":"This was for sure a page turner.

But there are two things I have not been able to complete because my soul could not take it: Faces of Death (those documentaries about things getting killed about dying and murder and ppl getting killed right there on the screen, monkey heads protruding to the top of a table, the top of the head lopped off while the monkey is still alive and then the ppl eating the brains. Good Lord.) and this book. It was rather pointlessly stringing me along for the first half,although I understood that the author was trying to set the scene of Father Knows Best atmosphere of the 50s. I didn't need all that, and was absolutely sick at what I started to read. The abuse was appalling. I've never read such a description and I, a former cop and avid hunter, was literally ill at what I read. IDK how anyone can survive the reading of this book. I just don't know. I'm forever changed, and I thought I was strong and stable as hell."},{"rating":"2","title":"GET READY...","review":"...to spend the rest of your waking hours engulfed in one of the most memorable reads of your life. You WILL NOT put this book down. You couldn't if you tried. I finished this one in just over four and a half hours.Ketchum's theme here seems to be \\"horror without the supernatural\\". Much like James Dickey's \\"Deliverance\\". But I think Ketchum's real genius is his ability to mesh two seemingly unrelated situations into one great thriller. His juxtoposition of a seemingly normal small town, innocent neighborhood in the 1950's with the darkest realms of the human psyche untapped by many... let alone pre or young teens of that golden era.I read that Ketchum loosely based this on a true story of a woman in Indiana somewhere in the 1960's and it does ring of a fictional book I read in High school called \\"Let's go play at the Adams\\" but Ketchum's hard driving, page turning prose takes this story to a place where the former two stories will probably be forgotten, true or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow","review":"This book is a literary snuff film. If you are into that, by all means purchase. But for this to top a list of horror novels is an insult. I am an avid reader, and i typically love the gory and gruesome. But this is a new level for me.I'm guessing my reaction is exactly what the author is looking for, but child rape? Really?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"This book was very good. It was also detailed and sickening. I don't know if I would recommend this considering it's graphic details some people may not be able to handle.

All in all it was a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"Interesting concept, good build up .......will definitely try another book from this author . He kept me hooked til the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"True story of the 'Torture Mother'","review":"I was happily reading TGND when I happened to do a google search and found the real story behind this horror novel. Then I just couldn't finish it. I like my evil stylistic and confectionary, think Dan Simmons Song of Kali and Poppy Z. Brite's Exquisite Corpse. But this....this evil is so raw and unbridled. And the fact that the neighbors just played along. Lastly, the complete and total innocence of the victim. Names and dates have been changed to protect the wicked...the only innocents in this are dispatched of at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author has problems of his own","review":"Did Jack Ketchum write this book while spending time in a Psychiatric Center? It looks to me he set out to write a book on a sick, perverted, scary story and he found one that took place in Indiana 1965 and put it in his own words."},{"rating":"1","title":"Compelling but WAY too Disturbing","review":"I read a lot of horror/post-apocalyptic fiction but rarely post reviews. The rape and torture depicted in this book were much too disturbing for me, and I want to warn others who may be at all sensitive to stay away. I must give the writer credit for a compelling, well-written novel, but it still makes me sick to my stomach to think about what occurs in its pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poorly written","review":"This was one of the most poorly written true crime novels I have ever read.A well written true crime novel allows the reader to get to know the characters. It should also allow you to know the victim well enough to sympathize or at least understand the victim. This book doesn't do that. The author jumps back and forth between characters, confusing the reader. It is written in past tense with many situations barely skimmed over. I would not recommend this book on any level."},{"rating":"1","title":"perverted !!!","review":"This was sick!!! I would question the person that could even think of such trash. I didn't finnish it.

I am not sure that was not the point, sick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good","review":"I hastily chose this book for my kindle. When I first began reading it, I was alarmed that it might just be a sensationalized story, created for shock value.

Meg is new to the neighborhood, after having been orphaned, she finds herself with her crazed aunt who has a serious grudge against her. At first the Aunt is just rude and uncaring towards Meg. However, once she begins fighting back, Meg's torture escalates into some of the most violent and terrifying scenes ever written. To add insult to [serious] injury, the boys from the block are all allowed to watch and sometimes to touch... Meg doesnt dare fight back anymore or her aunt will switch her evil attentions to Meg's crippled younger sister. Then things become unimaginable.This story is gruesome and horrible, but like a brutal car accident, it is hard to look away. The Girl Next Door will make you not want to meet your neighbors, or if you do, wonder what is in their basement.Relic113"},{"rating":"2","title":"Positively disturbing","review":"I read this book in one evening. I probably should have spent more time with it, but in all honesty, I could not put it down. At the same time, I found the progression of the story rather predictable. Since I know now that the book is based on a true story, I realize that the predictable nature of the abuse only shows how depraved and sick the people involved truly were. Obviously they needed a new kick and felt the need to engage in progressively more disturbing torture methods. I found myself wondering, what sick thing are they going to try now? Definitely worth reading if you can stomach both the horrific nature of the plot line as well as the moral ambivalence of the main character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one","review":"In Stephen King's introduction, he raves about the risks Ketchum takes in his novels, risks (presumably) King himself would take if he thought he could get away with it. I didn't see it that way. The story did not \\"mirror the problems of the 50's\\" (the threat of nuclear war, corruption in the media, etc.) Instead I thought it was a cheesy, sick novel by a man who tried to set the stage, giving a plausible explanation for the novel's events, then with that out of the way, proceeded to write a sick, sick story. No explanation was made about why Ruth was the way she was. Sure, people do things like this, and worse. Yet in novels like 'Red Dragon' and 'Silence of the Lambs' the reader is given insight into the cause of the sickness, delving back into the sicko's childhood. Here there is no such explanation. And I do not believe that a group of children this large would let such activities continue on without alerting their parents, even in this cynical age in which we live."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"One of the worst books I have ever read. I'm not going to recap the story as I'm sure you've read the previous reviews. There's no suspense, horror or even storytelling, the only emotions I felt were boredom and revulsion. A book solely created to depict various means of torture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wicked aunt","review":"Albeit this book is based on a real story as it says in the author's note. Although the main plot'll keep you reading and hating Ruth and at the same time David for doing nothing about the problem. The problem with this book is that could be written in manifold pages less. Who cares about the town's fair? Who cares about every introduction written at each chapter's beginning?This is the first book I read by JK and even though I do believe this wicked story could happen if not already happened this book'd be written in a briskly pace.P.S. The real action stars at page 100. So you can start the book in page 101."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Man Disturbed","review":"I skimmed through the end of the book mostly because I couldn't believe these people were going to go through with what they were going through with. I was only looking for the part where David helps her and Susan escape and the evil family gets locked up, but it doesn't happen, so what's the point. It's difficult to fathom how a person could actually write a book like this, and why they would want to write it. Humans are sinful at best and there are many who are depraved. You have to be somewhat disturbed to write a book like this. There's nothing positive about it. It's one of the saddest books I've even read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain Gross","review":"This book has absolutely no redeeming value what so ever, I know these things occur in the sick minds of monster humans but I would prefer not to read about them in detail. It is definitely not a horror novel at least in my definition of what horror is supposed to be.The book is just plain gross, it does not take any kind of talent to conjure up sick images, just a sick mind. I stopped reading a lot of King when he used a child in Pet Sematary getting hit by a semi trailer.Cheap tricks if you ask me. Good horror is akin to Anne Rice's Interview With A Vampire. Read it if you must. Skip the first 135 pages nothing happens."},{"rating":"1","title":"BURN BEFORE READING- very disappointing","review":"For the first ten pages this book seemed to be a promising read; the other 200 or so were a compilation of vile rape and torture scenes.

I was so offended to the core of my being that I believe Jack Ketchum needs to be removed from shelves. This is not a praise of his horror writing abilities.

If you're interested in the true story on which it's based, look on Court TV's site, or search for Sylvia Likens, and read it on the internet.My problem with this book is not the theme- we've all seen the concept of the innocent slipping into monsterhood, and the reality of people ignoring monsters among them for whatever reason. I am disturbed by my sense that the author takes a little too much voyeuristic pleasure in the details of the victims' sufferings( despite his protestations in the afterward that he himself had to draw the line and not reveal all the real Sylvia's torments).Stylistically the novel ends on a clumsy note, with contrived resolution to the conflict that is unsatisfying in it's contrivance (and nothing at all like the reality of the case).Don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic writing.","review":"This is a gripping book, and proof that a story can be beautifully written even if the subject matter is horrific.

It looked promising, but the commercials had this guy I've never seen before talking about how he had always loved spy stories, and that was why he created the Bourne Identity. I thought 'I know what Robert Ludlum looks like, and that ain't him!' Apparently, the guy who created this show was the producer or something for the Bourne series of movies, and he either thinks that means he created the Bourne Identity or he wants us to think he did. I watched the first several episodes, and they weren't good enough to convince me to support an idiot or a liar (whichever he is), so I stopped watching it. Calling this show 'smart' is an insult to smart people.

I am so sick of seeing shows about white people I just want to throw color at the whiteness like Jackson Pollack. OK, this show is over dramatic, boring and has way to many white people. Many people say it's like Sex in the City with CIA agents, Thus it's BS. My father was CIA. This is BS with lots of white people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome series Covert Affairs","review":"This series is excellent, and each episode is exciting and keeps your attention the entire time.

The main charactor is who brings the show down.Totally unbelieveable actress. She was good in Cyote Ugly.No good in this. The blind guy is the only thingholding the show at 2 stars. his Great.Boring stories/script writters.This show proves how you can have good actrorsbut the show may be crap if the directors n writters are junk.boo"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a waste of paper","review":"I expected a well written book (as someone recommended to me) but it is sprinkled with all kind of stuff I found to be straight obscene, that some people with a low self esteem might enjoy. There's no precise subject in this book, the author just circles around some happenings but her style is very confuse and ambigous, one can really image anything. I don't know why a decent publisher would finance a book like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not the \\"Alien\\" series","review":"Don't be misled: this is not the Sigourney Weaver \\"Alien\\" movies. It's a seven tape boxed set of cheesy 1950's and 60's black and white low budget sci-fi films that will only be of interest to someone who collections unknown films of this type. The acting, photography and editing are all third rate. The titles are: \\"The Slime People\\", \\"The Arrival\\", \\"Alien Contamination\\",\\"Creature\\",\\"Star Knight\\",\\"Abraxas\\" and \\"Day Of The Triffids\\" with \\"Triffids\\" being the only one making it to second rate. Seriously, don't waste your money unless you are into this kind of film. Frank Zappa without a doubt wrote the song \\"Cheepnis\\" about these movies! :-)"}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},O={class:"card-container"},B=["disabled"],M={key:0},N={key:1};function W(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",O,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",N,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",M,"See more"))],8,B)):b("",!0)])}const H=d(x,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-ce4d775a"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"sponsor/39.md","filePath":"sponsor/39.md"}'),R={name:"sponsor/39.md"},P=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{L as __pageData,P as default};
