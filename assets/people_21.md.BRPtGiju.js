It was very affordable at Target. Easy to use and makes yummy espresso. I don't use the steam part jus tthe coffee maker. The reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is because it didn't come with a tamper to press the coffee down. Also the little knob to start the brewing and the lid to the water part is a bit hard to turn-doable though. Since I had some medium grind coffee left over I used that and it was fine.

Still, the instructions should be more clear in terms of making steam. (I don't know what I did wrong but when I tried to steam milk the steam wand sucked the milk in instead of blowing steam out.

Theoretical perspectives are the end all and be all of international politics, but Pease's book bites off more than it could ever dream of chewing. Critical theory (Marxist and Feminist) is grossly oversimplified, as she not only leaves the reader with a dearth of literary references to actual writers, but moreover gives these marginal perspectives half the page space that she devotes to Realists and liberals/idealists. The organization of the book, though - offering deductive as well as inductive arguments - is intriguing. The case studies make the book worth buying, though the theoretical synopses that precede them, through questionable portrayals, almost negate their practicality.

I much prefer the more Country sound of her earlier work. Also, she does a middle-of-the-road version of \\"Easy From Now On,\\" a song that's pretty much owned by Emmylou Harris, and Terri pales in comparison. If Terri is going to keep wearing the cowboy hat, she needs songs and arrangements that fit the image.

I heard the single \\"A Little Gasoline\\" while in Nashville last year. I was totally blown away! It kind of reminds me of Jo Dee Messina's \\"Bye Bye\\" because it is sort of a kiss-off song.The rest of the record is just as strong. My favorite cuts are the haunting \\"Empty\\" and the life-affirming \\"No Fear\\" and \\"To Tell You Everything\\" (both co-written by Mary-Chapin Carpenter).

However, her music is still connected to this new pop country, where money talks. One can only hope is just a matter of time for Terri to come up with a great country&folk album.

It truly did feel cooler under the umbrella compared to the ambient temperature (low 90s), and there was not even a hint of sun exposure after being in the sun for hours. It even passed another test: My granddaughter used it for several trips under a pretty heavy waterfall in one of the kids' walk-through activities. Not only did it repeatedly hold up to the very heavy downpour, but she stayed as dry as a bone and, after an hour of drying time, the umbrella looked as good as new. I have since purchased one for a friend who has lupus, and now I don't leave home without it. Since I've only had the umbrella a short while, I don't know how it will hold up over time, but it sure did pass the summer-time amusement park test."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sturdy enough for daily use","review":"The umbrella is very attractive with the wooden handle, wooden \\"spokes\\" at the end of the ribs and the thick canopy. It gave a very good sun shield. However, using it every day, by the end of the first week, it was starting to give. The spokes started falling off and the ribs would often go inside out with a little wind, causing the ribs to bend awkwardly. By the end of the first month it was barely recognizable. In all, I was able to wring about 2 months worth of use from it. And I never even got to use it in the rain. It was a waste of money for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a good book","review":"I thought that this was not a true story but when my teacher read this book to the calss she told us that it was a true story and she told us what the book was about.

There are ribbons to tie to hold the house open. There are dozens of accessories to punch out-- clothing, food, bath items, etc. When you open the book, items in the room pop up. There are many flaps/drawers to open and explore. There's a Maisy doll who can walk through the doors and do things in each room. My kids had lots of fun with this book, but completely torn it to pieces within a couple of weeks of starting to play with it.

I would/will buy again; it has been installed and working for a few weeks now, no worries or startup issues. Powerchute had to be reinstalled as once it looses the connection to the battery, it does not recognise a new battery.

His words sing and the vividness of his descriptions bring his characters and settings alive in a way unparalled by any of our contemporary writers. The only reason this collection of loosely linked tales did not merit a full five stars was the uneveness between the narratives, some stories richly rendered and fully resolved, others, such as \\"The Unholy Grail,\\" \\"The Circle Curse,\\" and \\"The Price of Pain-Ease\\" only sketchily conceived and less strongly written.

You want to jump up and start dancing. His theme song \\"Welcome To Jamrock\\", when I first heard it I loved it and is what drew me to purchase this CD.

What I found with Damian Marley's \\"Welcome to Jamrock\\" just simply amazed me. I like reggae but I love what Damian is doing. His music can only be described as reggae with electronic infusion and rap/r&b sounds with a rock/r&b beat.

It was very good quality and my dogs love it, also it was not greasy or too high in fat. That is not the case for the chicken flavored treats from this company. Maybe it is a bad batch, but it is so oily I have to blot it with paper towel before letting my Papillon have any and even then it upset her stomach. The package says it has 10% fat but I think it is much higher and would not recommend the chicken flavor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got Beat Up by Bad Massed Albert","review":"I was listening to Got Beat Up that a friend gave me and was like, wow, these fellas are good. They have their thing going. So, I went out to buy some of their other stuff. Lucky me picked this album up and thought it should be good. I put it into the cd player and was so shocked. Only \\"Summers Over\\" reminded me of their older stuff. Probably because it was the only one not sung or written by Mr. Snyder. I mean, I know that artist like to \\"grow\\" with each album, but how do you go from punk-pop to beach boy wannabes? So, if you are thinking about buying this album because you liked other earlier Weston albums, you might be disappointed, like me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this a Pixies album....or just a Pixies Rip-off?","review":"I've been a Weston fan for years (6 to be exact) and this album confirms what I thought 2 years ago - Weston peaked with 'Got Beat Up'. Anyone who truly loved the band previously known as Weston will understand in one listen why this album is more self absorbed than a Kevin Costner Movie. They have taken on the persona of a mellow-dramatic indi-rock band with so much to say (whah, whah, whah). The only decent song is track 6 sung by Dave. Unfortunately for the true fans, without Chuck at Bass there's no punk in Weston's rock. Unfortunately for Weston, they are not talented enough to make the punk-emo cross-over (unlike Blake of Jawbreaker-Jets to Brazil). So, if you want to listen to a pixiesish/alternopop/coolie band with nothing to say, the new Weston is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"I miss the old weston","review":"I never loved a band as much as i've loved weston...that is until Chuck left the band and they began to deviate from the most amazing, silliest, pop punk i've ever heard. Now I keep buying their albums hoping for some glipse of their past brilliance. Unfortunately all I find is highly derivative stuff that we've all heard before. I dunno why they try to sound like the Pixies and Weezer when they were brilliant in their own right. Weston should have broken up and re-named themselves Snyder after the guitar player/singer whose influence overwhelms this album, shadowing the genius of (my kind of superstar) Dave Weston. I suppose someone who never heard the old weston might have any easier time stomaching this album, but for the fans of old, it's a heartbreak sandwich."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Review","review":"I'd never heard of Weston until hearing Liz Phair on my local college station. I thought that it was a great song and looked forward to their record. I was so happy when I got it because the entire record is amazing. I found out they had earlier records and bought Got Beat Up which was OK but sounds like a hundred other bands I've heard. The Massed Albert Sounds is different and new. A great mix of different styles and musical tastes that come together and make something special."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to Weston?","review":"Where did Weston go? I think they've \\"grown up\\" and are \\"taking themselves seriously\\" and have made a terrible album in a desperate attempt at joining that long gray line of awful contemporary \\"alternative\\" music. Enough with the quotation marks already! I found this album in a bargain bin for fifty cents and I was really excited about it. I'm a huge fan of Got Beat Up and Matinee, but had never even heard of this album. After a few listens through, I think fifty cents was too much to pay for this pile of steaming excrement. You can argue that Weston is just trying something new and that Dylan tried something new when he switched to the electric guitar and look what that did for him, etc. I'm not against a band's personal growth. I think any band that has any kind of staying power has to experiment with their sound; however, this album is just awful. Even if it wasn't Weston, it would still suck. If you're into Got Beat Up or Matinee, PLEASE save your fifty cents."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have to agree - this ain't the same old Weston!","review":"A few years ago, my sister put a couple of tracks from a local PA pop-punk band on a mix tape that she made for me. That band was Weston, and the tracks were from _Got Beat Up_, which I immediately went out and bought. It was catchy, witty, melodic...all the things that good pop-punk bands should be.Today I was combing the used bins and found _Massed Albert Sounds_ for three bucks. Whatta bargain, I thought to myself...little did I know how wrong I was. It's nearly impossible to believe that this is even the same band, it's that different from their older stuff. It's reasonably well-done, well-recorded, and well-produced, so I'm sure that some people might like it, but I'm not one of them. Yuk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The OLD Weston must have \\"Got Beat Up\\"","review":"Yeah, anyone and everyone who says that Weston is not the same band since Chuck's departure has hit the nail on the head. These guys were definitely one of my favorite punk bands out there, til Chuck left and they seem to have picked up that \\"alternative\\" sound that EVERYONE has. What happened to the witty, fast-paced, teenage lyrics that made us all love them? I wasn't happy with Matinee, but thought I'd give them another chance with this one. There will be no more chances. I think, at this point, they SHOULD \\"Just Quit Rock and Roll\\". Sorry, guys, but ya need to go find Chuck."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"I bought the cd a while ago, and I still listen to it a lot.

Or should I rather say, why do all my favourite bands (Blink, Goldfinger, Millencolin, Lagwagon, RBF and now FIF)change to the worse. Why do they all turn slow as soon as they get kind of popular? I could never really agree with FIF lyrics, but the music, the energetic, awesome ska-punk sound I really loved, but this? Sorry, I find it just boring and some songs (like No.8) are just plain stupid. Oh, before I forget, this CD doesn't really deserve 1 star, I would actually give it 2 or 3 stars, but since everybody gives it between 4 and 5 stars I just wanted to drop down the overall reviewer ranking :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun CD","review":"I bought this CD after I heard about FIF from a friend and I am really glad that I did. At first I thought that many of the songs sounded similar, but after a few listens I can now appreciate them all individually. The songs on this CD are fun and are uplifting. I especially enjoy Phantom Mullet, Ugly Day and Greatest Story Ever Told. Five Iron Frenzy is a unique group that should appeal to most people. I recommend this CD to anyone looking for a different type of music that you don't normally hear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"The latest FIF CD truly lives up to it's name.

It was a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is not up to the FIF standard","review":"I used to say that the only ska band I liked is FIF (aside from the local band that rocks called Buckledown! ). This album changed my mind. It is not very good at all. Their other albums, even if not musically superior, were at least fun to listen to. Oh well. I guess that's what you get when you listen to ska. Try some YES, Dream Theater, Kansas, or good stuff like that. Progressive music rocks! peace folks."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to their awesome punk rock/ska sound?","review":"This is probably going to be the most disappointing music purchases of my life. Five Iron Frenzy had such a great sophomore release in \\"Our Newest Album Ever\\",that I thought they would stick with their awesome punk-ska sound, and forever be remembered as one of the best in the genre. Instead, with the most recent release from the Five Iron bunch, they almost completely took all the punchy edge out their sound. \\"All The Hype That Money Can Buy,\\" has such a watered down sound,I can't stand to listen to it with all their older(and much better)stuff in my possesion. I however, can't deny them of two good punk-ska songs on here, The Phanton Mullet and Farenheit are both pretty decent songs. Besides that, all I can say is they very slowly went the way of the Supertones. It's a shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best cd I own!","review":"This cd is a great cd for anyone who likes ska. It has some slower songs and of course some fast ska rock.

I'm not a big fan of this album to begin with, I considered it to be quite average, so I was hoping for some nice treats on the bonus CD. Unfortunately it only contains 3 bonus tracks, 2 original songs and a remix. Now here's the real unfortunate part, the bonus disc is garbage, nearly worthless. The first track is 42 minutes of pointless noise, if you thought the track \\"Cryotank Expansion\\" off of \\"Dreams of a Cryotank\\" was annoying, just wait until you hear this. The next song is ok, nothing great, and then the Ritual Noise remix is pretty pointless because it is just way to similar to the original. Needless to say, I am even more disappointed by this (more expensive) version. This truly is a pitiful release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing ....","review":"This is disappointing cd. maybe 2-3 songs here are ok , but the rest is anything but ok. i really don't know what happened to them since their last album \\"Northern Light\\". that was a great cd , but the current just isn't good enough . from this band i've expected a lot more than this false release. believe me - you do not wanna spend money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shapes into nothing.....","review":"I like Covenant, but I wasn't impressed with this release. The songs are kind of flat, and although not bad, they just lack energy. I saw them in concert supporting this cd, and it was quite good, but they really seemed sort of conceited. After the show, the ushers, and a stage hand announced that the band would be at an after party in a bar in Cleaveland a few blocks down, but the group never showed up.It's a so-so recording with no zip. Try Northern Light first."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars because it still beats american radio","review":"People, I love Covenant, they have become one of my favorite groups ever. This is total tripe compared to everything else they have ever done. It feels like they either gave up, or ran out of creativity. If I was them I would be absolutely embarassed by this effort, because they are capable of soooo much more. The only track I like, and I really digit, is 20 Hz. It is one of my favorite covenant tracks ever. Everything else? Garbage. Just being honest people, don't force yourself to like it just because it is Covenant!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT their finest hour","review":"I agree complete with Erik Cobbett.

It's extremely repetative and boring. It doesn't really go anywhere at all. The best song on the cd is Ritual Noise and it could be better. I've got the cd with the bonus disk...don't waste your money on that either. Normally a bonus disc has something interesting not 3 songs with 1 song being over 40 minutes long! It would be ok if the song was interesting or a really well composed song...but it's NOT!!! The 40 minute song is insulting! I almost think they are trying to make people hate them. Sadly enough I'm sure that plenty of people will praise them on a wonderful job done when it's just the opposite.

But this is one is all over the map. It introduces several new factions and players (including a Hutt gangster who could give Jabba a run for his money) but never has enough time to properly flesh them out. We see them plot and scheme but it really has no impact since we're never given a chance to care about them.Kir Kanos it practially a supporting player in this story, since so much time is spent throwing in new aliens, new factions and new alliances.This series desperately needed to be longer, or an editor needed to give it more focus.

You might need two of them, because you will wear it out!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This ain't right folks...","review":"I would not recommend buying this because of a couple of glaring ommissions. How can classic slowjams like 'Am I dreaming' and 'Let's get Closer' be left out and this be called an ULTIMATE collection? Pullease! Hardcore fans should know that A.S. is really a tale of TWO groups: the Soulful Sharon Bryant era, and the more Mainstream/Pop Barbara Weathers era. That's probably how the collection should be presented anyway. But AS's success was as much about the songwriting/production talents of its founders(3 brothers: David, Wayne, and Jonathan Lewis) as it was either of these talented ladies. Its unfortunate that so many still judge 'good music' solely by its crossover potential.Also check out 'Secret Lovers: The Best of Atlantic Starr' to hear the aforementioned tunes. Its an older release, hence the inclusion of those classic tunes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"To describe this book would exhaust superlatives.

D. B. Bryan), every one of these stories is a gem, a find, a transcending experience.

This sweet story of a handicapped orphan finding her family -- and herself -- was charming for me as an adult and I expect would be captivating and honest for a child. Two moments stand out: the tender scene where the young girl is praying (and so humorously explains her understanding of the personalities of Jesus and Mary); and the singing contest (where the confusion over her identity and her twin's begins).

Under the experienced production wings of contemporary gospel pioneer Fred Hammond (who continues to show he has a great eye for talent) Shea shines apart from the rest. Tracks like \\"More and More\\" and \\"Fell In Love With Jesus\\" will excite you as tracks like \\"Supplier of our Need\\" and God of Love\\" will cause you to think and worship.

I left the FIRST COAT on my nails for 10mins and it smeared!! I've never had a China Glaze polish that took more than 5mins to dry completely. This is just ridiculous. I can't even keep the polish on unless I'm expected to sit in my chair still, not doing anything for an hour or something.I'll still say this, the shipping was prompt and fast. I'm not blaming this on the seller because maybe it's the company that really messed up on this one but if anyone else happens to get this color at the store or from another seller, please let me know how it worked for you!

No kidding. It is very thin so it does not even look or feel caked on after that many coats. You can actually apply a new coat to your first hand just as soon as you finish your second hand, that's how quickly this dries but I would not use this nail polish if you want to do your nails quickly. After putting this nail polish on with 10+ coats on, my nails still needed more coats of polish, I didn't want to mess with it so I just put on black crackle the next day and it looked very nice. It does dry matte so don't forget your topcoat and I like to put on a base coat as well as neons have a tendency to chip. I don't think I would buy this again just because it takes so many coats.

It's a great deal for your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect tiffany blue color","review":"love this color, it is perfect for all summer long!! china glaze has a nice thickness to it, so it doesnt require but 2 coats for perfect coverage"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Sheer","review":"This color is VERY sheer, after about 5 coats you will finally get an opaque color and then it peels off in about a day. Definitely avoid this nail polish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not The Right Color","review":"I first saw this product in a salon and it was more of a mauve shade. So when I ordered it on the internet I just assumed the shade on the computer screen was just one of those \\"difficult to do it justice\\" situations. When it arrived it was orange. That's a problem for me. I will never order nail polish again online."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chips right away","review":"This has got to be the cheapest nail polish I have ever bought... not in the good sense. I love the color, but the texture of just the polish is very weird and started chipping the next day. Even with two coats. Definitely apply a top and bottom clear coat to get the best staying power. Not like OPI where you don't need them. Probably won't be buying any more China Glaze polish. Only OPI for this girl! Giving it two stars just because I LOVE the color, which makes me sad it chips so fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product! Great service!","review":"I love this color! It is perfect for the summer to show off your toes or for those who love bright colors! The pictures don't do it justice (not as pink in person, more like a neon coral color). Truly one of my favorite nail polishes. Also, service from buyer was fast and flawless!! Love my purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice Color!","review":"I love this color and it is perfect for Spring/Summer 2011! It can be a bit streaky, so you'll need two coats and a base coat.

I wasn't sure what blue to pick but seeing the name \\" Frostbite \\" I decided to give it a try. Let me tell you something, this nail polish color is GORGEOUS! I recommend two-three coats to bring out the full color but wowwwwww! I never thought I'd fall in love with a blue nailpolish quite like this!! Now I'm looking for a color from China Glaze to act as an accent for this color. Absolutely recommend all the way!"},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"I normally love China Glaze nail polish but the one i received was terrible. It's thin and watery and wont go on well at all. I think it may have been more to do with the seller filling a half empty used bottle with remover to make it seem full. I am very disappointed with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"China Glaze Nail Lacquer: Shocking Pink Neon","review":"The person from whom I purchased China Glaze Nail Lacquer in Shocking Pink Neon packaged my product safely and beautifully. She even gave me a free, sample sized lotion. My purchasing experience was very pleasurable, and I would gladly do business with this person again. The polish application is a bit streaky, but this probably has to do with the manufacturer and not the seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's dull and ugly","review":"I bought this color because black is now one of the new hot colors. But this black is dull and ugly. I made a mistake with this color"},{"rating":"1","title":"China Glaze Flying Dragon :(","review":"Totally hate it. In the bottle, it looks like a fun fuchsia with blue and pink micro glitter, but in reality, it dries unattractively matte, shows EVERY brush stroke, and the glitter (which is barely visible) resembles little pebbly specks. A huge disappointment since it looked so nice in the bottle. I managed to salvage the manicure by hiding it under a glittery top coat, but I think this is ultimately going into the swap pile. I still love China Glaze, I just don't consider this to be one of their successes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty color but...","review":"It's a very pretty color, a little lighter than i expected but very bright. The photo shows the color as being a little darker, more pink than what the color actually is. It takes about 3 coats, possibly 4 to get an even look. I love China Glaze brand but i wish they'd change the brush, too little.Overall - pleased but wish for some improvements."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really want to like this","review":"I purchased TUT from Sally's yesterday and gave myself a mani-pedi in the evening, the color is fantastic, like other neons it dries matte, which is easily fixed by applying a top coat (something I'd usually do anyway, alongside a basecoat, to ensure it lasts longer).However, I woke up this morning, noticed it was already a little chipped, took a shower and afterwards noticed that some of the polish was missing entirely from some nails, and on the rest of the others it was more than half gone, despite the fact that I used both base and top coats and three coats of the polish (it's rather streaky, but if it would have lasted longer, I'd be more than happy to put up with that because the color really is great).I really do want to be able to wear this, but I'll likely just have to find a similar color from a different brand, I wouldn't repurchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"probably fake.","review":"I use China Glaze whenever I go to salons and get professional manicures/pedicures. I also have purchased China Glaze at a much higher price tag from upscale cosmetic stores and salons. Needless to say, I have a pretty good idea of how wonderful a nail polish China Glaze is.China GLAZE is supposed to come out SHINY (hence the name). This garbage looks like I colored my nail with a highlighter. Besides the fact that the color I purchased (Pool Party) looked NOTHING like the color it's supposed to be, I had to put on THREE coats of the nail color and TWO coats of top coat to make it look like normal nail polish.I keep reading people's reviews saying you have to use lots of coats/the color looks flat. REAL china glaze DOES NOT do this!! I guess you get what you pay for... I should have spent the extra $5 and purchased the real thing at a store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was expecting... At. All.","review":"I was expecting a coral/tangerine color but ended up with a BLAZE FlORESCENT orange. Not happy. Plus it took about ten coats, I am not exaggerating, just to get decent coverage on my nails. I'm not sure if the polish was \\"watered\\" down but I expected more from the China Glaze brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top 5!","review":"It's rare I say this, but I'll probably buy a back up. I have my go to color, there are around 10 but my top 5 rarely change and Tantalize Me took the place of a my Orly purple that I used all the time.Like most china glaze polishes this does need 2 coats. It is a light purple that reflects light bluish tones in direct light, it's the kind of polish you start moving you hand and your eyes get hooked to. I love this color and totally recommend it to other people."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most beautiful color ever!","review":"This is my new favorite. I love it. I put it on 3 days ago and can't bring myself to change the color yet. I simply adore it! Great price! Totally needs a top coat though. I had chips the first day. It's my fault I didn't top coat but I didn't have time. 2 coats is totally enough to take care of it but a top coat is needed for sure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved the Color, Terrible Quality","review":"I LOVE the color of Flip Flop Fantasy (neon orangey-pink). Unfortunately the nail polish is really watery, goes on streaky (needs 3 coats of color), dries with a matte finish, and chips within 2-3 days, even with top and bottom coats. I tried it once on my toes and once on my hands and I had the same experience both times. As much as I love the color, I doubt I will try it again- not worth the effort because it doesn't last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hot color but chips fast...","review":"Make sure you know the real color prior to buying the product. It's a really nice neon and you need a top coat to make it shine. However, the color chipped within a day even with a top coat on. I'd rather just buy a different brand that holds up longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"I love this nail polish. It's a nice dark navy. Looks great on.

What's great is that you really only need one coat. The formula is soooo smooth. Favorite polish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best.","review":"Nail polish is not very good. Good color, but doesn't come out clearly. Brush is too thin and shows strokes on nails. Requires MANY coats on your finger to become opaque.

VERY durable and long-lasting. My manicure lasts longer than ever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Polish","review":"This polish is amazing!!! The color is great and it sponges on really well as well.

Price was the best i found!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Supposedly doesn't peel","review":"This product is advertised as a no peel nail polish. I dont know if the bottle i got was defective or something, but I have never had a polish that peeled more. Also it never seemed to fully set and seemed quite soft. It did not survive the night and I had to go back to my favorite brand OPI in the morning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chips within an hour","review":"Within an hour my nail polish was chipped off on all nails (I'll be removing it tomorrow) and I was just doing things around the house...reading, watching tv, walking the dogs, nothing to cause the polish to chip off. I used a base, two coats of this turquoise polish and then a shiny top coat because the polish is an ugly dull color without it. It's a beautiful color WITH a top coat, more green than turquoise, but unfortunately it's terrible quality and does not stay on the nails!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Looked like I colored my nails with a HI-LIGHTER!","review":"I'm not sure if this is authentic China Glaze or not, but I definitely do NOT thing it is authentic. I highly doubt that authentic China Glaze would look like you colored your nails with a hi-lighter. Not to mention that it chipped off within an hour after I painted them. Definitely won't be buying again, ever. And if I did, it would have to be from an actual store so I would know it is authentic. I think I'll stick with OPI."},{"rating":"1","title":"STREAKY","review":"So I needed a good white polish after my last one was out, and I didn't want to pay $10 for a good one, so I thought China Glaze was a good alternative. It was horrible. It took 3-4 coats of polish before it looked even remotely opaque and non-streaky, and the brush was so so at best. I love China Glaze, but a lot of their nail polishes differ in quality like the houses at Hogwarts. This is one of their worst formulas, and I am incredibly disappointed.However, the shipping was fast, and the packaging was solid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"It has zero shine and takes at least 3 coats to look OK.

The application wasn't too thick and although it wasn't too sheer, it wasn't completely opaque either. I could see the line where my natural nail grows from it's bed when I held my hand out.

I don't know why but this bottle I got from here was dark.. more like a slightly shimmery navy. Not pretty on my olive skin. I was expecting the color in the blogs.. a vibrant beautiful light Royal blue.. instead.. it is quite dark.. with a slight shimmer if you put your hand in the sun... just looks like Navy cream polish...I don't know if the formula is different.. I don't know if this is a second? I don't know if the blogs lie... but you know mailing it back would just cost more than the whole thing is worth.I guess.. if you are looking for the Iconic Blue in the Blogs.. try buying in person and try on...Just looked too dark.. and was totally not what I expected.. very sad..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty color","review":"A little brighter in person and has more of a white hue to it.

Two coats is all you really need.Great for nail art too, I've gotten really into polka dots with this black, and it makes a bold statement on lighter colors.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous color, make sure you have a great manicurist","review":"This color is stunning for the summer; equally beautiful on fair and olive skin tones. The only complaint is the makeup of the polish causes the first coat to be very streaky and chalky. The second coat will smooth it out beautifully and a top coat will literally seal the deal. I had one manicurist apply it really well and another one who did a terrible job. Just depends on the technician doing your nails."},{"rating":"1","title":"streaks like Old School","review":"I had to do multiple coats (more than 2) for getting a solid color w/o streaking.

As much as I tried to make this look good it would just not do it. I have been doing my own nails for years so I know a good product. It's is cheap, poorly made nail polish.

I was looking for a bright, fun summer color and this is a beautiful shade. However, to even get the color close to what it looks like on the bottle, you need at least 3 coats. And even with a good topcoat, it only lasted less than 2 days before it was peeling off so badly I had to remove it. It's a shame because I love china glaze polish and I was really hoping for this color to be my summer go-to, but I think I'll keep looking. Oh and this color is matte when applied so make sure if you decide to give it a try that you have a shiny topcoat handy, without it, it's not flattering."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING polish!!","review":"I am definitely a nailpolishaholic and china glaze is one of my favorites.

I find myself actually staring serenely at my nails just mesmerized by the color. However, this nail polish Turned up Turquoise is the absolute worst for chipping that I have ever used. I used a base coat (China Glaze) AND a top coat (Sally Hansen Insta-Dri)and within 1 hours, I suffered chipping on almost all my nails. In all fairness, I am a cashier and I work 8 and a half hours a day. But I have never had a nail polish fail on me after 1 hour. I am not ready to give up quite yet, because I am so in love with the color. Maybe next time I will use 2 coats of top coat. This is not a good nail polish for long term wear. Also as a side note: Without a top coat, this nail polish appears matte."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful color","review":"The perfect neon orange. My only complaint is that it is not very opaque. It dries matte just like most neon polishes. 2-3 coats is best. If you don't want a super-bright color, this one is not for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Consistency is poor, won't use it again","review":"I can't even describe the consistency of this polish. It's thick and runny at the same time. In some places it goes on too thick and in others you can see through it. It takes FOREVER to dry, even with only one thin coat. I painted my nails several hours before bed and when I woke up there were sheet marks all over and there were dents on every nail. I ended up taking it off because it just felt thick and sticky even 24 hours later. I only even got one coat on!

In fact, I would go as far as to say it's a great motivator to start building your own projects. As far as the plans in the book go, I recommend either redoing measurement calculations on lumber and hardware, or finding plans elsewhere. I built the lawn chair, and found some measurements to be wrong in lumber and in the screw lengths.

It crimps very well and makes sure you fully crimp whatever you are working on.I haven't used it much for larger wires. I have found when crimping 16-14 AWG butt connectors (blue) that if the wire going in it isn't 14awg it may not crimp down enough to hold the wire well - or at all. At that point just put the connector in the red 22-18 spot and it will crimp it fully without damaging the connector's jacket.I like being able to just lock onto a crimp connector so the crimper itself holds the connector while I insert the wire.

DO NOT TRUST THAT. I have purchased two \\"compatible\\" cards to upgrade my kids DELL PCs to find out that they are NOT COMPATIBLE (after purchase from a different vendor, I found a difficult to find ATI WEB page where ATI admits that there are issues with DELL PCs). I waisted time and money (so far I could not get any refund from ATI). As far as this specific card (that was supposed to be used in my own Dell PC) I sended it back to Amazon without opening the box so I cannot say if the card would work fine.

It helped me find out exactly why I was doing what I was doing. But this book is a disappointment. Alice Koller is a highly trained philosopher and has a sharp mind. Some of her thoughts are thought-provoking, but I found her preoccupation with her dogs sickening. I have two dogs myself and volunteer/foster for the local animal shelter, but people come first. Why is Koller blaming the vet who 'let the dog die'? Last I heard, 13 1/2 years is a pretty good age for a German shepherd like Koller's dog, Logos. And I don't think dogs should be used to scare people away, IRS agents or not.

The Limited edition comes with a small photobook of the band, very artistically beautiful shots. There are five interchangable CD covers for the CD, one of each bandmember, and a pack of trading cards. All is incased in a flexible plastic sleeve with white writing on it.Musically, this CD is solid Kagrra. Personally I didn't find that any one track really stood out as absolutly brilliant and unique (such as Yotogibanashi's B side, 'Amafurase Tanmaina'), but each song could easily stand alone as a great composition and perfect example of the band, outside of what is a beautifully arranged and strong album.Introduction of guitarist Shin's Koto work in the song 'Meguru' is a particularly effective addition to Kagrra's unique mix of rock and traditional Japanese influence."},{"rating":"2","title":"No mystery fan should miss this superb work of research","review":"New Jersey crime is the author's forte (see \\"Murdered in Jersey\\") and here is the one with everything. The wandering rector, the bored choir singer, the domineering wife, the ineffectual husband, steamy sex, and secret mail drops. Tomlinson has combed the vast literature of this unsolved crime and presents the reader with a tightly argued case for the probable vilain.

One can literally feel the mind of Holmes/Doyle lurking in the wings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good account of the details. . .","review":"Tomlinson losses track of his own thoughts very easily dismissing important details. His \\"suspect\\" illicts laughs and eye-rolling from most people close to the case and its history. With a focus almost entirely on the sensational, there is a persistence to enforce his reasoning as \\"sound\\" and \\"psychologically based.\\" It is none of those things. It leads to a lot of bias in his assumptions YET it does demonstrate why this case was unsolved: Too many seeking a scandalous resolution to a rather unspectacular murder, were it not for the participants. There are far better treatments of the subject. Kunstler's Minister and the Choir Singer and another difficult to find book, THE GIRL ON LOVER'S LANE, in particular.

He loves to play pretend with animals and people. I thought this would be a step up (as far as age) from the Little People Playsets. I was so excited to give him this toy and after hour and a half of putting this together he was ready to play. After 5 minutes of play the whole thing practically fell apart. After putting it back together again its just fell apart again. I couldnt believe my eyes! This toy ended up being just a pile of plastic pieces. I ended up returining the Treehouse and taking my chances on another Playmobil set and bought the Treasure Chest. This was a better choice. Takes 5 minutes to set up and doesnt fall apart when playing with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"You just can't keep it assembled!!!","review":"I bought this last Christmas for my 5 & 6yr olds and I was really excited about it because it looked really cool. It was a little overwhelming when we opened up the box and saw that it came in a million pieces and had several pages of assembly instructions. After spending quite a bit of time putting it together, it did look impressive, but as soon as they tried to touch it, parts started falling off. There is no way you can play with this toy, it is so flimsy and unstable. This might be better suited for older kids who are able to constantly reassemble it without getting frustrated. We ended up tossing it soon after because parts would fall off and end up missing."},{"rating":"2","title":"He's got it right","review":"As an entrepenuer I can speak from experience that what is said in the book is correct. You are either a hunter entrepenuer or a farmer entrepenuer and a big key to success is knowing what you are. Everyone wants to think of themselves as a hunter over a boring \\"farmer\\" but in reality most hunters would love to have farmer skills... that's true in my case. I spend all my time trying to smooth over the weaknesses of my \\"hunter\\" approach and banging my head against a system that is set up to support and nurture a farmer approach... even to entrepenuership.Some of the reviews here don't cut it... they didnt get the point which is... know yourself first, then work around your strengths. This is a cornerstone work in my mind. The reference by other reviewers to the e-myth as being superior show that they love the \\"farmer\\" approach. I'd suggest they re-read FEO with a more open mind.

I'll read this book multiple times in the years to come, because there's so much information it. He writes like he has no doubt in his mind that you will be the next Entrepreneur that all the press wants to interview.What I didn't like:The author's definition (being absolute) of an entrepreneur. In his eyes, opening up a pizza shop isn't an entrepreneur, that's a small businessman. Entrepreneurs, per the author is someone with the goal of becoming a Fortune 500 company."},{"rating":"1","title":"James Bond, the man","review":"This book talks as if James Bond was a real person, and puts him on display. It's kind of like other DK books where they have the little leader lines pointing to his gun and telling you what kind of gun it is, or that his hair is brown, etc. Duh. I tend to go for James Bond books that are behind the movies. Like, where did they come up with ideas for the plot? Who stared in it? What were the gagets and how did they do the special effects? Where are there weaknesses and strenghts in the story? Memorable lines?Instead, I suggest The Essential Bond: The Authorized Guide to the World of 007 (behind the films)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Your mission 007","review":"This is great, a book that finally explains all the little things you mite miss when you watch Bond.

It was nothing but a bunch of boring common knowledge. They name a subject then give you 1/4 of the info on it. And there was only a couple pics of the bond actors except for Pierce who there was a lot of pics of. I think the author is gay for Pierce.

The one I read is boring and trite. Written as a story of a fictitious plastics company in the UK who is trying to figure out how to sell more, the book fails miserably. Why on earthy would the author choose a commodity vendor to write about, why not a company that sells something a bit more interesting. Ok, you sell tones of raw plastic material that your customers melt down and use to make their products. And, the big breakthrough? Nothing more than investing in the capability to provide prototypes for your customers. Gee, very innovative.And, if you're in the good old USA you'll probably be put off by the UK oriented writing. I got a bit tired of \\"whilst\\" and the inept attempts at humor.Sorry, I just didn't get it. I've followed McFarlane's company and get their newsletter and find it excellent. That's probably why I expected more from the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a gifted & lyrical writer!!!!","review":"Dave Kindred ranks among America's finest sportswriters. He and the late Shirley Povich were the best sports columnists The Washington Post ever had (present sports columnists included). The stories in Kindred's book are a joy to read. He's got a Ring Lardner touch. At his best, no one is funnier than Kindred. A few of his tales feel like a Frank Capra movie, sentimental and heart-warming. Baseball captures the essence of America with love of family, country and seventh inning rallies. Kindred makes it come all come alive. His stories on Mark McGwire and Jackie Robinson must be savored.

It eases you into the basics, while saving the more complicated stuff for when you are ready.

And theres nothing in the book on how to use the ast3d function to code a game. What you essentially get in the example on the disk is nothing more than a 3D bouncing object screen saver.

I am disappointed by the paucity of vocabulary and notes-- even obscure mythological references are not explained.Also, the text itself is not particularly easy to read. For example, the lines of Ode 1.11 (tu ne quaesieris), which has 16 syllable lines, apparently didn't fit right on the page, so each line is broken into 2 lines with the second indented, but there is no explanation of this.I am not happy with this purchase!

Especially, the more one zooms in to the object/scene, the more the image quality is reduced. Even without any zoom, the image quality isn't as clear and sharp as other cameras. Another minor con is, the camera isn't meant for big fingers because the buttons are rather small including the zoom button.If one wants a simple camera with great features and an easy-to-use interface, the camera is for you.

First, why do scenes of hospital beds always show the patient in a dark room with siderails down and door closed? This patient was in ICU without a nurse right there watching him. What's with the medical advice on this show. Also...info about the patient would NEVER be discussed with a stranger. This violates HIPPA laws. The scene of the ICU nurse talking to the gal probing the death would never happen. Also....the doctor would not be sneaking in to give a drug without the nurse seeing it.

You're literally paying twice as much per bar by doing that."},{"rating":"1","title":"The taste...","review":"First, I am an avid fitness person. I eat healthy and work out regularly. I need a protein bar during the day to get me through at times and I usually have something similar to this. The problem with this product is it is layered rather than mixed like most other products. You ca feel the graininess of each layer and the taste does not mix well. On top of that, it melts in the heat making it gooey and even less appealing. Wish they had the choco chip one. That one holds up well and is not has hard to get down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Super sweet topping","review":"I like that the protein is soy based.

Shirer's attention to detail makes it a true historical treasure, but at the same time it might become confusing to the reader all of the people that were involved in the Third Republic. If you set that point aside, the book does indeed shed some light on a subject not really covered as well as the other events of World War II. After reading this great work, it left me anxious to find out the rest of the story, and what happened in the years of Vichy France. That is how compelling Shirer's book is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding examination of why France failed in 1940","review":"In my opinion this is as masterful an exegesis as Shirer's Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, particularly since it covers such a sweep of European history in excellent detail. The reader is drawn into the myriad of influences beginning with the defeat by Prussia in 1870 through the Dreyfus Affair and WWI and culminating in the resurgence of Germany under Hitler. The evidence is developed showing how and why France failed to meet the challenge posed by Germany; we also learn what befell the principal players after the war. A mesmerizing account: despite its length I found it difficult to put down, wanting to finish it at one sitting. I recommend it very highly indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it and Weep","review":"The author's detailed chronicle of the fall of France in World War 2 with an overview of the Third Republic from its foundation in 1871 after the Franco-Prussian War and the suppression of the Paris Commune through the Dreyfus Affair, World War I and the economic and political crises of the 20s and 30s during which time the sympathy of much of the political and military elites for fascism informed their cavalier indifference to the Nazi threat which led, in spite of its many material advantages, to France's humiliating rout in 1940. A good companion book to the excellent documentary, \\"The Sorrow and the Pity\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid, Readable History","review":"Shirer's solid narration on the troubled history of the French Third Republic (1870-1940) explains how decades of monarchism, anti-semitism, and bitter divisions weakened France and contributed to the 1940 collapse. When Shirer covers the 1940 debacle in the later chapters, it seems almost pre-destined. I liked the author's strong attention to the 1930's, when weak French governments failed to confront a re-arming Nazi Germany. William L. Shirer (1904-93) was a U.S. journalist in Europe from 1925-40 who later spent years researching the rather baffling subject of the decline of France. This volume doesn't quite match his \\"Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,\\" but Shirer's immense talents are evident, and Charles De Gaulle complimented his objectivity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite what I expected","review":"Although parts of the book are very helpful I feel that a majority of the content is aimed at getting a company to do reference checks. I found myself wandering when I was going to get past the \\"WHY TO\\" and get to the \\"HOW TO\\". I also found the number of errors in grammer and spelling to be annoying. Overall after reading the book I feel I could get by doing reference checks but I know for sure I could convince a criminal to check references on his future victims."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly Obvious Information & Whining","review":"Most of the info was obvious.One new thing - get the interviewee to set up the references to call you.He kept whining about how companies refuse to provide more than the usual hire date, job title and last day of work. He never answers the question of why a company would want to help its competition in the hiring game.He assumes that past performance ALWAYS PREDICTS FUTURE PERFORMANCE. This may be true in a theoretical sense but he fails to acknowledge that management styles, environment and hard lessons in life also predict future performance and never indicates that these also should be inquired about.He also failed to mention that the interviewee is also judging the company and deciding whether they want to work there or not and that certain things should be done to mitigate the feelings of interrogation and controlling that some of Andler's recommended techniques will create."},{"rating":"2","title":"A smart must read","review":"Robinson hits on a key essential point in the learning process: questions.

The only problem is, it's really time consuming to do this method, especially at first, which makes it hard to stick with it long enough for it to make a difference. I would recommend reading it right before you start a new school year or semester; it's easier to change if you do it right from the beginning.It's definitely an advanced way of studying--what I mean by that is, this method is for people who already have the basics down.

This belies the fact that some textbooks are full of completely irrelevant information. There is no way to relate to it.

So much Shadow lore is available out there - comics, radio shows, and novels - but many overlook the profound effect of Mr. Gibson, who is entitled to a cult following similar to that of HP Lovecraft or Robert E.

I don't expect the books I read to have a point or a plot per se, but I do expect them to contain something to consider, mull over, and be worthy of my time and effort.\\"Elroy Nights\\" refers to the title character in the novel, an art professor at a small university in Mississippi. It starts with him feeling discontented with his life with Clare, his wife. This is what pulled me in--the descriptions of Elroy's discontent promise some future insight, or SOMETHING.

Mr. Oto, a \\"foreign\\" man, arrives half-starved and becomes Miss Anne's \\"Chinese\\" gardener. Mr. Oto and Sophie, a \\"real lady\\" who never had a chance at love, slowly develop a relationship as delicate and beautiful as the bird's wing in the Japanese folk tale that is skillfully woven into the story, blending truth, dream, and fantasy. The bombing of Pearl Harbor enrages the town, forcing Miss Anne and Sophie to making fateful decisions in their attempts to protect Mr. Oto. The book is a quick, pleasant read that gives the the reader a look into a different world through sympathetic eyes. I thoroughly enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasant book.","review":"If you're looking for a pleasant, quick read, this is a a nice novel for a lazy afternoon. Since the Publisher's Weekly review above just about recounts the entire storyline, there's no need to cover that here. The book reads like a short story, with interesting characters stepping lightly through the story to give the book a surprisingly quick pace.For those who have ever lived in the rural South, you'll recognize these characters (you may even be related to some of them). Trobaugh is obviously fond of the people she portrays, and that takes some of the sting out of the less noble qualities they possess.While it's not a \\"I couldn't put it down\\" sort of novel, it is a very pleasant read, a sweet story and written in an intimate style. I liked the book quite a bit.I've read rumors that the book is to be made into a film, with the role of Mr. Oto played by Chow Yun-Fat. I can't think of a better vehicle for him. Let's hope this is one rumor which turns out to be true."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sweet, light read.","review":"Nothing too heavy here. Sopie and Oto's budding love story is told through the eyes of Anne, Oto's employer and the \\"keeper of the town\\". This story touches on inter-racial relationships, racism, fear, war.

This book is great for a light, weekend read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"I liked the premise of the book. Japanese American and Southern girl fall in love in the days before WW2.

This character-focused film will appeal to those who prefer indie productions to plot-driven Hollywood blockbusters and trite rom-coms. It deals with slow revelations of character and interpersonal complexities.As the lead female, Marie-Francoise Theodore turns in a nuanced performance as a painter struggling to balance her artistic ambitions and emotional needs. She and the men in her life confront the stereotyping -- divas, mammies, strong & silent --that stifle honest relationships. \\"Strange as Angels\\" is a welcome relief from films that cater to the UPN-TV view of black womanhood as either as high maintenance divas or ho's, and of self-absorbed or immature men. If you liked recent character-focused films like \\"Lost in Translation,\\" or \\"Sideways,\\" this is your speed."},{"rating":"1","title":"all over the place","review":"i saw this movie late last week,&i liked the creative element of the chick who is the painter,but the film ventures quickly all over the place without having a central theme.

About the only value she added was occasional big smiles that reminded us of her famous Mom. My husband and I usually love John Corbett but we felt he could've contributed more to this film than he did. The chemistry wasn't present between the two main characters and Kate's \\"I'm so cute\\" persona just made us squirm. The children were much better... and we believe the real star power of this movie was Joan Cusack. Go Joan! The sad part is it could've been a really good movie, with some more thoughtful casting, directing and story flow. Lots of holes. Kate wasn't believable as a savvy administrative assistant. But Helen Mirren as the model agency owner was fun... except her character lost credibility for tolerating all the sloppiness of Kate's character.

That's about the level of attention we get here.I'll give Hudson the benefit of the doubt and assume it's the material that makes her character so unlikable. I figured Felicity Huffman and Joan Cusack could 'raise' \\"Helen\\" but Huffman isn't on the screen enough to make an impression and Cusack is handed a role and directed to a performance that makes her look frumpy, unfunny and unpleasant, which is a shame. Check out Richard Linklater's 'School of Rock' - there's a guy who understands how to employ Joan Cusack's comedic skills to maximum effect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time!","review":"Aside from the extremely predictable plot, bad acting on almost everyone's part, and unbelievable behavior on the part of the pastor, this movie has little to redeem it.

You really get the feeling that she was completely out of her element being an authority figure with the kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I expected","review":"A tip: watch Raising Helen the first time by yourself. I bawled at several points during this movie and that surprised me because I usually don't do that. I like how Kate Hudson's Helen grows up during the movie, at first she is career-oriented and likes to party, but she ends up settled at the end. The two younger kids in this movie are adorable and the oldest would cause any parent anxiety. Joan Cusack and John Corbett turn in awesome performances as well, Joan with her trademark subtle humor and John as the sexy pastor of the kids school. One of the funniest parts is the Inter-Faith hockey league (whoever came up with the names was very clever) and Helen's neighbor in Queens (and her baseball bat).

A family of three sisters - a fun-loving mom, a dour mom, and a single carefree modeling agent (Hudson). When the fun-loving parents are killed in an accident, the kids are left to...Helen (Kate Hudson) instead of the dour sister with kids. This is the story - how she copes/doesn't cope, how the kids react, how she learns to weigh family, friends, job & find romance in the end.She (of course) must quit her high-paying job, move to Queens, get a new job (used car sales) & meet Dan, a sexy Lutheran pastor who runs the school where the children attend. The usual chaos ensues along with child-rearing angst (the part we parents love) until an expected happy resolution.

How could it all go so wrong? I'll tell you how: Her sister and her brother-in-law were killed in a car accident and they left their children to Helen, instead of the other sister, an uptight mother personality. Cue millions of highly unrealistic situation, some-not funny jokes, enough morals to write a book about and several cameo apperances by Paris Hilton.Now, if you're into that sort of thing, then this is your sort of movie.

He pulls work by others out of context, tears it to shreds, and then refuses to take a position himself (except to say that Dickinson was upper-class and was something of a snob). He also has an anachronistic view of class and writes as if class in the late 20th century is the same as class in the 19th. Pity his poor students if he is distributing this sort of misinformation. On top of everything, this book is boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"It told what a great guy Jeff is and his look on life!!","review":"It was definitley the best book I read about Jeff Gordon! It has his ideas on life and religon and I respect that in a guy! He is a sure guy someone could look up to and respect. I wish I knew him becuase now I know how nice and sweet he is. How he has charities and talks to kids which is great! My dream in life is to meet Jeff Gordon because he is really an inspiration in my life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Perfect Arrangement It's Not","review":"If you have trouble falling asleep, this is the book for you. I typically give a novel a minimum of 100 pages before I stop reading, but in the case of this one, I made an exception and gave up sooner. There is a annoying \\"Haven't we all had the experience of searching for a nanny?\\" tone that fails miserably as either satire or voyeurism. Mirella and Howard are compromising and self-involved, which would work if the attempts at humor weren't so labored and if the author's self-satisfaction didn't blare across each page."},{"rating":"2","title":"certain things not explained","review":"I enjoyed A Perfect Arrangement, but there were a couple of issues I felt were not explained enough. For one, how did Mirella find out her husband had an affair? Did she get a letter? Did Randi say something? It was never explained. Did I miss something?Second, what was the deal with Randi? I know she was getting overly attatched to Jacob, but I thought before the story ended I would get some sort of explanation as to why she acted that way. Seems like there was more to Randi that never was explained."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strung out dramatic tension","review":"This book builds and builds to its dramatic end and is ultimately disappointing. The foreshadowing is annoying rather than suspense building. The book also includes a lot of tangents and details that detract from the story itself. The more interesting characters (like the in-laws) are often set aside to dwell on the archtypes of the overly-helpful nanny, the distracted and unfaithful husband and the overextended working mother.The climactic revelation of the nanny's misdeeds is historically short-sighted. The nanny's breech was long considered essential to taking care of children. Two hundred years ago the breech would have been a status symbol, rather than grounds for dismissal.I thought a good editor might have been able to shape this book into something more cohesive."},{"rating":"1","title":"diluted story line","review":"This wasn't what I expected. I was still \\"hungry\\" after reading it.I just wasn't satisfied. The nanny really didn't do anything wrong with the exception of the creepy part with the child. (I won't give it away). I hate to criticize any writer but after reading it I was wondering how a publisher thought it was even good enough to publish. If you have to read it-don't buy it-borrow it-go to the library but don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Compelling Page-turner","review":"Suzanne Berne's writing style is magnificently descriptive, which makes putting the book down difficult. \\"A Perfect Arrangment\\" will strike a cord with mothers who rely on hired help to care for their children and force them to not make such quick decisions about hiring a nanny.\\"A Perfect Arrangement\\" isn't as horrifying as \\"The Hand that Rocks the Cradle,\\" but equally maintains the attention of the reader to find out what will happen next. I highly recommend this book as well as Suzanne's \\"A Crime in the Neighborhood.\\" It is a pefect addition to any summer reading collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inane","review":"Maybe it's just me -- always a possibility -- but I don't get the comparisons to Hoffman, et al. This reads like an MFA manuscript...not always a good thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing and dull","review":"The best thing I can say about this book is that I finished it (if only because I was on vacation and there was nothing else to read). The story starts out very promising- I had really been looking forward to reading the book. The beginning of the story is actually pretty intersting as the writer drops gradual hints that lead you to believe that the nanny is not all the family thinks she is. As the story builds, the reader comes to expect an explosive climax only to end up very disappointed as the plot just peters out. I ended up disappointed with each and every character, children included.It felt like a completely different writer wrote the ending- one who did not know the characters at all.I would not recommend this at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfying","review":"The \\"ruling class parents in need of somebody to raise Binky and Muffy\\" concept has created a genre onto itself with films, books, movies of the week, etc, that create nightmare scenarios in which the babysitter kills and seduces. In this novel the parents are the problem and the author makes fun of them in the way only one of their peers can. And while the writing is strong, oy, the ending is just...annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moments not enough to carry this novel","review":"This came recommended by a friend who reads nearly everything. There are certainly entertaining moments in the story, but overall, I have to say that I wish I had spent my time with another book. I should add that I was once a nanny for entitled and self-obsessed people like the parents in this book. If you like dirt on rich jerks, buy The Nanny Diaries instead, it's a lot more fun and doesn't take itself so seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was horrible","review":"This is what my parents would call a \\"junkie teen book\\". It has no substance to it, and the whole theme of the book is sex. There is no substance, and no climax. All that happens is she goes to Greece with her friends instead of a trip with her jerk of a boyfriend, then they break up, then he comes to Greece and they get back together again. How can people think that is interesting? The only reason I gave this book 2 stars is because I thought the description of the house and the country sounded like it would be a neat place to go. I totally wasted my money buying this book, and I'm sure the Spanish Holiday book is just as bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"so good and so BAD","review":"this book was really good until the end! the main character really screwed things up nothing really got resolved for hersorry but if you dont want to be disappointed make up your own ending"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!!","review":"This book is boring!!!!!!!!

I just read it because it was the only book my friend would let me borrow becuse it was so bad when I spent the night at her house. I would recomend it to girls from britain because the story takes place in europe and the girls are from england and they say british words and it is hard for me to understand it since I'm from Arizona!

I too was drawn in by the magic of the setting having traveled abroad myself, but beyond that, I found the story to be rather flat and predictable. I don't think many of my students would identify with the girls' affluence and I think the cover was created to get a reaction. Angus, Thongs, and Full... is a much better read, as well as, Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants. Don't waste your time on this one! Develop some taste!

Its seems as it was just going to be about Kelly but it wasn't it turned into a story about three completely different girls learning about eachoher and who they really are.

I prefer recordings that are limited to nature sounds, with no human voice that labels the bird. I can use a printed list to follow the calls when I wish to learn the birds names.

There are a number of high quality songs on this album such as The One You Love and Soul Searchin, and You belong to the city. Soul searchin also features some great harmonies reminiscent of The Eagles, but delivered by a female gospel choir.So far it has passed the acid test, which is that I can listen to the whole album while driving my car without pushing the skip button once. That makes it a quality album in my book.How does it differ from The Eagles? The production values are as good. The music itself is different, there is more use of different instruments such as the saxophone. I would say it is a little more progressive. The songs are very good. I highly recommend this album.I hope you find this review helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"as advertised.","review":"Great songs from a great composer and artist.

The graphics and unique music is what really makes this game, crunchy guitars roaring and lots of creatures. The story line is ok, nothing ground shattering, the gameplay is in some ways frustrating.

The problem is the video production. The leader is almost impossible to hear through most of the workout because of a terrible echo in the room and one of her assistants randomly yelling over her (not in sequence with kicks, as in real TKD, most of the time). The other thing that got me was that the class leader does different moves than the women behind her and besides what she says to do--she throws in extra little bounces and jabs and movements that are confusing.I'd do this workout again, but I wouldn't buy it unless they cleaned up at least the sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst form ever!","review":"If you know anything about kickboxing (even fitness club style), the instructor's form in this video is terrible!

And much more profoundly. For various reasons (based on a rationalist's skepticism), I really do question the validity of most of the book's contents. And in a \\"self-help\\" book such as this, integrity is all important. If a story is created just to make a point, that's nice and all. But getting happy applying Mack's advice in real life works the same way you get rich by playing the lottery. Additionally, the book is self-published by Mack himself. Listen folks, the world is made up of a million self-help gurus selling us stuff to make us like them.

This is the exciting sequel to the loose threads in Burroughs' TARZAN THE UNTAMED, and I eagerly read it in one sitting. For the record, Farmer does not characterize Tarzan the way Burroughs did, but rather treats him as the infrahuman that Farmer believes him to be. Farmer's use of collective ape language nouns (like \\"Kando\\" for ants) with plural verb conjugations was a bit unBurroughsian (for example, \\"Kando were...\\"), but that's probably nit-picking. Also, the end of the book contained more science fiction than any previous Tarzan story by ERB. But the book is quite entertaining, and surprisingly, Farmer DID surpress a bit of his own style in favor of more Burroughs-like dialogue and plot devices. If you liked this one, find copies of Farmer's Opar books and TIME'S LAST GIFT and wonder if there's a double meaning behind Tarzan's moniker as \\"the Uncaused Causer\\"..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misguided, Badly Written Mess","review":"Avoid this confused, poorly paced, ineptly plotted mess. The characters are wooden and one-dimensional (even their names are largely silly and unbelievable), and the \\"action\\" is as dull as can be.

Instead, the book wanders all around with no focus. Tarzan goes through earthquakes, floods, uninteresting lost cities, encounters with weird little half-men, etc etc etc. None of these are important to whatever story there is, and after awhile, I got tired of trying to make my brain believe there was a story there. As an attempt at a Tarzan story, it falls flat. Even Tarzan's character is off-kilter. Tarzan is completely reactive through the whole story, instead of the proactive hero we are used to.

For example, \\"'What does Gung Hay Fat Choy mean?' Arnold asks. 'It means Happy New Year.' Donald responds\\" It keeps the book from flowing at all.Although there are some funny points, and good description, there is no reason to read this book. Unless you want to be put to sleep, I wouldn't reccomend this one for leisure reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Frank Chin uses 3rd person to go through the novel. What? Is he trying to question our competancy? It's and incredibly dull and boring book and is about a boy who dislikes being chinese. He wants to be a famous dancer-- so why doesn't he just do it. I mean it doesn't matter if you're chinese or not. Really, the book is about a kid who is so emo over his ethnicity, it just sickens me. Shut up and quit complaining. Only a few interesting dreams but that's it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"I read this book in my freshman Foundations to Literature Class in high school. From the first page, I found this book incredibly boring. Frank Chin uses the 3rd person to write his novel about a boy who hates his heritage. While there are a couple interesting dream sequences (the only reason this book got 2 stars), the book is continually boring. The ending in particular is horrible, and leaves many uninteresting questions that the book is based on unanswered. I highly discourage you from buying this incredibly overrated book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music Appreciation 101","review":"This is a musical tribute to Cuba, literally a journey around the islands musical influences, it feels like a musical documentary yet it is done with great style and celebration of the music. It starts with the sounds of the waves as you land on the island, then you hear sounds from a broadcast from Radio Cuba, and it just gets more interesting after that. This is not something you have ever heard before. If you are Cuban, this is mandatory listening, buy it. For the rest of us this is an unbelievable musical journey. Absolutely not something you are going to hear on radio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended","review":"I purchased this book when my daughter was a baby. I enjoyed reading it word for word my first time through and have referred to it many times since.

Her book has greatly enriched our lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Special Needs...","review":"I was kind of surprised other people liked this book so much. I didn't find it useful at all. I especially don't recommend it if you are looking for any ideas to help with a special needs child. It doesn't even touch on that. There are a lot of suggestions about things you can do with your children to increase their music appreciation. The author suggests taking your child to the symphony or the opera, but dress them in comfortable clothes... Just not too helpful at all. It also has lots of lists making recommendations as to music your kids can listen to. I took a one-day class on music and child development last year and there is so much good information that this author doesn't include. If you're looking for a good book on this subject, look into Don Campbell's book on the Mozart Effect for kids. I wish I hadn't bought this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"This is a very interesting and useful book. It is thoroughly researched and organized.

I didn't see the first citation until several chapters in, and the research in general is extremely weak. The author simply repeats newspaper accounts without adding anything else, so he perpetuates flawed or false accounts without questioning them.The terrible methodology would be partly forgivable if the author supplied a compelling text that was fun to read. Instead, the writing itself is laughable, with no real attempt to edit for style or content. There is certainly no artistry in the writing--- it is bone dry.As an aspiring historian with a deep interest in Florida history, this book was too bad to finish. I'm happy that I borrowed it from a friend rather than buy a copy. If I had bought a copy, I think i would have sent the book to the author, only beside a fish wrapped in newspaper. \\"Cigar City Mafia sleeps with the fishes.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateur Hour","review":"I've read around 100 plus \\"true crime\\" Mafia books over the years.

The loading and boot up is slower than your typical DVD player, but it is well worth the 45 second wait. The picture is clear and the surround digital dolby is unbeatable especially in conjunction with a surround sound system. So now you can not only see the movie, but feel it too! Yes, the unit is a bit bulky and heavy (reminds me of the first VCRs that came out back in the days) but for the price here on Amazon, well, it is well worth it considering that they retailed at almost $499. What I suggest is contacting the seller to see if they have updated the units or simply buy one from me because I update each unit so that the buyer can start using it out of the box.

It is colorful, funky, harmonically and melodically imaginative, catchy, and deep. After a bunch of looking around on the web, I got the English translation of the lyrics from Tom Ze and his wife, who generously responded to my request. Knowing the lyrics makes the music even more remarkable.The only difficulty is that I can't quite think of what to compare this to for you readers. Some of the rhythmic and timbral ideas do remind me of Zappa, and the deep tunefulness and occasionally snarly voice reminds me a bit of Steely Dan. But it is much more naturally funky and unleashed than either of these. Some of the melodic and harmonic directions are bossa nova-ish, but again, much more driving and rythmically deep.Anyway, this is great music...P>Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Very Worst of The Worst !","review":"OMG !

Right now they releases remasters and all kind of stuff.Every song is here is great and different, and there is no point of reference for this stuff (maybe cynic, but they are not that alike). I think the best description for the music is death fusion.

It's not that the producers have run out of ideas, it's just that the sparkle's gone and its perspective is entirely different, very down to earth and sometimes very boring, like a brittish soap.

This act shows how intelligent Sarah Jessica Parker is. I stopped watching after season 4. After seeing the amazingly lame series ender I was happy to discover I was right. The series was entertaining but overrated. The writing and the acting seemed very tired at best. To transfer the greatness of New York to Paris after all this time is incomprehensible. Of course, I didn't see the whole season but I clearly missed nothing but Hollywood cliches: Carrie falling for a Feench weenie (and STILL smoking and STILL behaving like she has no brain!); Samantha getting cancer (who would have guessed - it should have been AIDS); self-centered and obsessed Miranda not changed a bit (and Steve's mother having a stroke); Charlotte as flakey and ridiculous as ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frustratingly Great","review":"This show is so frustrating because it is so darn expensive, and because of that it's not a great value ... unlike the \\"New Sex Now\\" dvd which is a life-changing little video, with a painless price.

However, customers have buying power and they should learn to use it to relay the idea that this type of business practice doesn't work. I will not be buying this Part 1 of Season Six DVD set. I own all five seasons, and buying the fifth season was difficult to rationalize, but I wanted a complete collection. I draw the line here. I cancelled my subscription to HBO and will not be purchasing this wickedly retarded half-season set.

It's excellent. And, on Amazon, you can get it under $28. That's the ENTIRE fist season. But now, HBO wants to retail just half of the sixth season for $50? This season is not that good when compared to the earlier seasons--the plots are tired, the actresses seem to have had enough of these roles. So to ask $100 for the full sixth season is rediculous. I'm confused here--for the best season, HBO sells it for $28, but for the worst (or maybe the fifth season was the worst?) they want $100 retail.My rec: this wouldn't even be worth $50 for the entire sixth season, and it's certainly not worth $50 for just half of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"AN ARTIST KNOWS WHEN TO STOP","review":"Am an avid fan of the show, have seen each episode of the first four seasons more times than I could care to count.

I am protesting because they are releasing the 6th season in two parts and charging dearly for both of them. The ONLY reason I can see for this is MONEY, MONEY, MONEY. I can certainly afford to buy them and I love the series, but isn't there any sense of ethics remaining.

Although I am a huge fan and bought the first 5 seasons in ORIGINAL, I am disgusted at this move and refuse to buy season 6 until the producers realize their greed has backlashed (i.e., via terrible sales figures, coupled with soaring distribution levels of bootlegged copies).I say as a consumer, boycott this one until they give in and release a single DVD set for SATC 6.

My son was diagnosed over 5 years ago, and I still remember the pain the diagnosis brought, so I could relate to Melanie. The disorder is not as easily improved as is shown here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blech","review":"I really, really disliked this book. While I'm sure it's a relief for many moms to find a book that addresses their struggle with their children's autism, I thought it could've been done 100x better. I am a person who is sympathetic to but mostly unaware of what autistic children and their parents go through. This book did nothing to help me understand or really feel anything.I couldn't relate to any of the characters. Andy was perfect, his work with Daniel was a magic cure, Stephen was just pure evil and Melanie chasing him around was completely ridiculous. The author kept telling us how great Stephen was (or had been) and how much Melanie loved him, but I had no evidence or reason to believe any of it. And was Larry supposed to be comic relief?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving story","review":"If you have a child with autism or know someone who does, this book will be something you can relate too.

I believe this book to do a great disservice to parents of children with autism, as well as, those who provide services to children with autism. As a speech therapist who provides language therapy on a daily basis to individuals with autism, I find it highly unlikely that ANY speech therapist who ever deny a child therapy because they do not have any words. Also Melanie, Daniel's mother, repeatedly claims that Asperger's Syndrome is not full-blown autism. Did the author do no research into the autism spectrum? Daniel's progress is also unrealistic in the short time-frame. This is the sort of book that people who are unfamiliar with autism will read and think that if only parents tried just as hard as this mother, their non-verbal children will learn to speak, play, interact, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful read","review":"I loved this book from cover to cover.

They routinely offer promo cds for a penny (!!!) containing many new bands, and they certainly did themselves right signing these guys. To me, they sound like a hybrid cross of early Hot Water Music (especially concerning the vocals) and under the radar era Grade. And this is a very good thing. Their lead single \\"Doom! Doom! Doom!\\" plays like you're standing admist a mass of bouncing bodies in a club, and you can almost see the lead singer shredding his voice, spittle flying everywhere. The album is very raw, but satisfyingly so. It is electric, and sparks with energy in spades. But above all, it feels very honest. There is nothing particluarly novel about the album, but there are no pretentions either. It is intensely catchy and enjoyable punk, that is just edgy enough to stay off of most people's radar...but you would do very well to pick this up and give it a spin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great arrangements and song choices","review":"I could attempt to disect every song on this cd and relate their importance, but I'll skip all of that to say this: put it on and just let it play for days. Paul Weller has chosen some really great songs to cover and gives all of them the justice they're due. Probably his most consistent work in some time. The voice is there: clear, concise, and smooth. He surrounded himself with some really good backing musicians also. But the color layout of the insert makes it difficult to determine who are the contributing artists. A minor discrepancy that is tolerable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cover master","review":"How many do better than the original? At least, one does. Believe it or not, Paul just does it.

It's excellent, whether or not you're a Weller fan (as I am). His voice is superb, and there is a sincerity and excitement to his renditions (Close to You never sounded less sappy!). The musicianship is first rate. It's true that I'd rather listen to a Weller original than a cover album, but it's still a fine effort!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please come back Paul!","review":"This record is barely worth mentioning. As a fan from the very beginning, I think I can safely say this is among Paul's worst. Passionless and dull-and really, most of these songs were dreadful to begin with. Why remake any of them?

It seems that Jackie's dad is quite sick and had to stop by a curb to take a rest, but it was too late. Jackie's dad died but she doesn't know that he did. Now, two men came to pick Jackie up and she thought they ere bringing her to the police to get help. Instead, they took her to an old creepy house. If you want to know what happens next, read the fastinating book Three Days and find out because I am recommending you and all readers to read and enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 days","review":"I did not like this book at all. I would not recommend this book to anyone unless you like slow books. It starts out good and then gets very bad at the end. I would give this book 1 star unless you like books that talk in Italian and you can't under- stand them at all. But I did like this book in the very beginning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Three Days","review":"I liked the book there was alot of good juicy chapters like when Jakie was worried about her father in the car when he had a heart attack and was takin by these people she didn't know. But in some parts it was to slow and dragged on and made it boring, like when she was with the Kidnappers and was eating and describing it and her running away over and over again.So if I were to rate this book I would give it *** stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it","review":"Somebody handed me this book when I was in college and I dutifully tried to read it thinking that I was going to discover some deep knowlege. Nah. The history is pedestrian. Your child's black history encyclopedia gives more facts and figures. The book is written largely in slang that no-one born after 1970 can understand anymore. It's paranoid, defeatist and wallows in victimology."},{"rating":"1","title":"a fallacy of history","review":"this book really states a very antagnotistical perspective of black people and is no different from the writings of Hitler or any other books dealing with a strong racial outlook. there is nothing in this book that can be said as informative, only failing, outlandish insights on what certain blacks like the author theorizes was the black person's history and their view of black people's interactions with others is terriblely jaded and misguided. the author rambles on and on about topics he meant to open the reader's mind to the \\"truth of black people\\" but he forgets that the truth he is writing about is totally his own bizzare imagination. for those who want a respectable book on black history, this is not for you. also, any african american reading this book is surely to be offended and his/her pride diminished by a black history that serves only to satiate those who enjoy angry and unnecessarily antagonistical slander."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can we say \\"ISSUES\\"?","review":"The author of this atrocity obviously has issues. That is not to say that blacks have not been put down, beat down, and downtrodden. The plight of blacks in America is an incredible story full of treachery and the lowest of human conditions. It is also the story of triumph and all that humans can be despite their past and their circumstances. This book misses all of that. The author focuses on debunking Christianity, but only uses his own fictional illusions. I feel sorry for the author of this book. It must be a sad life to feel victimized the way he does. There are much better alternatives out there. Avoid this one like the plague."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Catherine Cookson Film","review":"Brought me to tears at times, had me on the edge of my seat sometimes and just kept me thoroughly entertained all the time. A lovely, romantic drama featuring a biracial girl's life in post-War England. There are the good (her \\"Uncle\\", the bad (her grandmother) and the ugly (her biological Uncle). But most of all, there is a father-daughter relationship that survives forced separation and racial harassment.Beautiful movie, which I can watch again and again. Apparently one of Ms. Cookson's first novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Colour Blind","review":"Colour Blind has all the ingredients of a great drama/romance story. Set in the north-east of England prior to World War 1 it tells to story of a romance which goes against the mores of the time...an English girl who falls for a black sailor & the ensuing consequences.The settings are wonderful, the acting first rate. It is a movie not to be missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christmas music????","review":"If you are looking for a good Christmas CD, this is not it!!! I LOVED SheDaisy's debut album, The Whole SheBang. The sisters have a unique and wonderful harmony to their music. But this CD is so NOT Christmas!! I was very disappointed at their approach to Christmas music. There is nothing wrong with a modern twist to Christmas songs but they completely changed the basic tune that should stay with the traditional songs. It is definately unique, I will give them that, but not (in my opinion) what Christmas music should be."},{"rating":"1","title":"SheDaisy let me down!!!","review":"All I want to say is I adore SheDaisy's Debut album!

I would definately recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sing a Christmas Carol...","review":"This is my family's all-time favorite Christmas CD. It's not traditional and it's not country. It's honestly indescribable, except that it's absolutely perfect. We love these versions of classic Christmas songs more than any other versions we've ever heard, including originals. It is truly not Christmas until we've listened to this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"What planet are these renditions for?","review":"I love SheDaisy but what were they thinking? This is the most non-holiday album that presumes to be one that I have encountered. Jingle Bells is totally unrecognizable. There are only 2 songs out of the whole album that have any merit. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the year's best!","review":"Easily one of the year's best albums, and it just happens to be holiday music. A wonderful collection of original tunes and reworked classics, striking just the right balance of playfulness and, where requred, reverence. And those harmonies! Even if it's after Christmas, get this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!","review":"THIS CHRISTMAS CD IS ROCKIN'!! THE GIRLS HAVE DONE IT AGAIN--OF COURSE WE KNEW THEY WOULD--, BUT SERIOUSLY THIS CD IS THE BEST!

OK to be honest with y'all I was totally expecting a Silent Night.... type of CD I mean come on a Christmas CD???? That is gonig to be SO boring. But WOW I was SO wrong. First of all they totally transform Jingle Bells into a BEAUTIFUL song.... probably the nost interesting & beautiful version EVER. Also they literally bring me to tears with What Child Is This! Kristyn does a MAGNIFICENT job writing new Christmas songs! I mean what a task that would be. And they're FABULOUS! *ATTENTION RASCAL FLATTS FANS* The song Twist Of Magi is AWESOME..... It's basically Rascals & Daisys battaling it out over who bought who for what! AWESOME! This CD takes my breathe away BUY IT..... you'll be listening to it next June I promise! Also about 3 minutes after the last track is a \\"hidden\\" track called How Can I Keep From Singing and it is the BEST song on the CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly Sad!","review":"Don't get me wrong...I love Shedaisy, but I can't help but wonder where their heads were. I WAS looking for some modern twists to classic Christmas songs, but was NOT looking for a total butchering of them! I think they have a GREAT song in \\"Brand New Year\\", but it's unfortunate that you have to buy the whole sad CD to get it. Perhaps a CD-single solves that problem. At any rate, I'd suggest listening to as many sound bytes as you can before purchasing this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I think their friends must have given them 5 stars!","review":"In all honesty, talk about a lame CD! I sold this back to a used CD store yesterday... VERY EMPTY. I think they were so wrapped up in wanting to put out another CD they missed the whole point of Christmas. It sounds like a Wilson-Phillips trying to kill country music with a \\"pop\\" edged sword. Also, I was at their Christmas concert.. and they sound a lot better on CD than live (to their detrement!) and they acted very very very arrogant. Trying to push a Dixie-Chick image won't get them very far. And neither will this rushed Christmas CD. 1 star for effort.. not an instant winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I bought this CD without having heard any of the songs because I was so impressed by \\"The Whole SHeBang\\" and I was not disappointed! Sure, I enjoy the classic versions of these songs, but how many CD's do you want that all sound the same? The new \\"SHeDAISY-fyed\\" versions of the classics are amazing! I absolutely love the \\"Hark the Herald Angels Sing/Carol of the Bells\\" medley - they stated they were \\"intent upon creating a musical journey for the senses\\" and they succeeded. You'll also find humour like that of \\"Lucky For You (Tonight, It's Just Me)\\" on \\"Twist of the Magi.\\" I predict \\"Brand New Year (My Revolution)\\" will be a hit. \\"What Child Is This\\" is the most traditional song on the album and their voices are hauntingly beautiful on the track. This album has great energy, wonderful new songs sure to become Christmas traditions and heretofore not-so-well known songs that you'll gladly incorporate into your holidays."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Christmas cd!","review":"I love this cd - one of the best Christmas cds one can buy. Great arrangements on classics and the SheDaisy girls have fantastic voices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho Ho Ho? No!!!","review":"One listen to SHeDAISY’s Brand New Year and you’ll be wondering what the girls were (thinking) when they concocted this disaster. Though the trio fares well updating the traditional hymns “What Child Is This�?and “Hark The Herald Angels Sing,�?modern chestnuts like “Deck The Halls�?and “Sleigh Ride�?are ruined by jarring arrangements. And the new songs are dreck. Both “Twist Of The Magi�?(with Rascal Flatts) �?which finds an unhappily married couple giving away each other’s possessions �?and the cynical “Tinseltown�?�?with screaming child intro �?contend for worst Christmas recording EVER. Who selected these songs? The Grinch?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is supposed to be Country?","review":"Futile attempt to re-vamp holiday classics. Sounds like \\"Fresh Aire Christmas\\", a drum machine, and Enya karaoke-tapes helped them. Not a favorite, and quite dissappoiting. If you like SheDaisy, this is a let down. If you're not into SheDaisy, well, this album really won't sell you on them at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most unusual..............","review":"First I would like to say \\"Way To Go\\" SHeDAISY on the debut album, however, I sure hope it wasn't a one time wonder. This is THE most unusual Christmas album I have ever heard. Some of the songs are just plain strange and I found myself disappointed in my purchase. However, after listening to it 3 times in a row, a few of the songs kinda grew on me, well, maybe 3 songs grew on me, but the rest are \\"aquired taste\\" if you will. You should have a REALLY open mind to listen to this cd and incorporate it into you Christmas season. At the opposite end of the spectrum, you have my husband who LOVED it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product for kidney stones","review":"The local hospital had paper ones with strainers and limited them to just5.

I can't believe that the author is not a mathematician but a Chemical Engineer. As I was familiar with the first one in this series, \`the Basic Math and Pre Algebra', there wasn't any doubt whether to buy this or not. My purpose was to brush up my math after 22 years. This is neither a text book nor a replacement for it. If all you want is to brush up or learn the basics or a reference, this is the book for you. For more practice, finish this and get a text book; you will get a better picture. Written in a very simple and clear language and it is not just a collection of formulas or definitions or equations.

I recommend Hiscock's book instead. This book seems a bit dated in techniques compared with others and assumes wood is only available locally and tools are hard to come by. I was hoping for something more closely tied to constructing a guitar purchased from common components available at Luthier supply stores."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think Twice","review":"I have just finished reading \\"Constructing a Solid Body Guitar\\". If you are wanting a step by step book to teach you how to build an electric guitar, this is probably not the book you are looking for. There are plans in the book, but the body was resized to allow it to fit on the page. The information contained in the book is good, but not near complete enough to allow the average person that has never built an instrument to construct a nice guitar.Having said this, I have a great deal of respect for Roger Siminoff. I recently purchased and finished reading his book,The Ultimate Bluegrass Mandolin Construction Manual. I seriously doubt you could find a better book on building a Mandolin.I expected \\"Constructing a Solid Body Guitar\\" to be the same quality.

The hype of the reviews must have been paid for!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time.","review":"I forced myself through 2/3 of this book thinking all along that it had to get better. Well, I'm not going to read the last 1/3 - life is too short for such a weak novel. This tale of fantasy and contrived characters would be complete if Latham had only thrown-in a couple of hobbits. This dribble does not deserve any comparison to Lonesome Dove."},{"rating":"1","title":"A weak effort","review":"For all the hype on the book jacket, with comparisons to McMurtry, etc., this was a pretty poor book. Even though using names that are linked to the real old west (Goodnight and Loving) the location, plot, and action are closer to a poorly written Paul Bunyan tale. This book is more a work of juvenile fantasy (even though sometimes x-rated) than historical fiction.

Norway maple is an invasive species in northern forest zones, and is threatening habitat for sugar maple, an important tree for wildlife, tourism, maple sugaring, history, and the regional economics that accompany those. Norway maple became very popular in urban areas for its pollution tolerance. It should not be planted anywhere near natural habitat for sugar maples. American beech is an excellent choice for a hardwood tree with good climbing branches, and delicious nuts. All hardwoods grow much more slowly than softwoods. There's nothing wrong with climbing a white pine tree. And try swinging on birches."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book for parents and gardeners","review":"This book is exactly what I was searching for.

I found 25 objects in one weekend alone using this book. I'm up to 95 objects total with no doubt in my mind that the book will allow me to find the remaining 15 objects. In dark skies, the Telrad finder charts work extremely well. Over a dozen times I have literally been able to line up the Telrad finder per the book's illustrations and look into the eyepiece and see the desired target. In light polluted areas, where I do most of my observing and where the Telrad is not quite as useful, the star charts in the book provide just the right detail to find the target by either star hopping with a conventional finder or moving along lines of constant declination or ascension relative to a known star. Well worth the low $20 price tag."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-have for serious Messier searchers.","review":"This is an extremely helpful book.

If you want to listen to progressive/ metal bands that are much more talented and put it all together better than Symphony X, (better lyrics, better musicianship, and better production quality)- look to Queensryche (Operation: Mindcrime, Empire), Dream Theater (Awake), and Savatage (Dead Winter Dead, Magellen's Wake).

Otherwise, start by going backward chronologically, \\"The Odyssey\\" (5 stars), V-New Mythology Suite (5 stars), Twilight In Olympus (4 stars), Divine Wings Of Tragedy (4 stars), Damnation Game (2 stars).Symphony X is an Yngwie Malmsteen-type/dungeons & dragons metal group with prog-rock/metal leanings, great musicianship, Michael Romeo is fast becomming a guitar-god.

It's simply a hodgepodge of internals of the .net runtime with a heavy slant towards c# (did the author really just want to write a c# book) with nothing at all to contribute to people actually developing day-to-day apps. This is your typical situation of the emporer has no clothes so I'm certain that my review will not impact anyone's buying decision, but trust me. Buy this at your own peril as the book will NOT make you a better .net programmer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trivial Pursuit book","review":"As another reader stated, this book IS NOT what the title suggests. I also purchased this book for it's \\"Applied .NET Framework Programming\\" title to find that it doesn't go into programming applications at all! Instead it is mainly Trivial Pursuit-like information on the lower level structures used to support various C# constructs.Who cares? The whole point of the BCL and C# is that I don't have to know about this stuff. I'm paid to deliver applications - not tell my management how cool .NET is internally. And we programmers wonder why management won't buy into this stuff :( Until we learn to focus on how a framework results in faster time to market with more bullet-proof applications instead of the \\"gee-whiz\\" factor, how can we hope that our managers will ever care?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Check OReilly First","review":"This book is better than most microsoft press books, but as a rule of thumb always check OReilly first. Microsoft Press is known for fluff - even books people consider the bibles are fluff when compared to OReilly. After reading a few OReilly pages you'll say 'gee that was simple'.I don't work for OReilly, I've been a Unix programmer for 15 years and used OReilly for a long time. I am now switching to .NET. I was very disappointed when I tried to use MSFT Press books to learn anything.Steve"},{"rating":"2","title":".NET Intro","review":"This book serves as a great introduction to the building blocks of the .NET Framework. I've always enjoyed Richter's professional, competent writing style and would definitely recommend this book to anyone looking to find out what the .NET Framework is all about, how it works, and how best to utilize it in your own .NET development."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUST READ for .NET GURUs","review":"Jeff really shows off his experience with consulting for and working with the .NET framework team in this book. This is one of the very best .NET books and will remain as such for the lifetime of the technology. It covers the internals of .NET, critical to a solid foundation of knowledge for a technical leader in .NET. As such, it's not a \\"getting started guide\\". There are dozens of those on the market, but few \\"must haves\\" like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Book","review":"I am a little over half way through this book and must say that the way the author relates the concepts to practical examples is pure genius. I beleive the key to a great teacher is the ability to break down difficult concepts into understandable clear pieces that mere mortals can understand. The author has achieved this difficult task. I read the reviews here before I bought the book and even though there are so many, I still feel compelled to add my praise also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect book to unserstand .NET internals","review":"I ready couple of chapters specially on .NET CLR and Assemblies. This is the book you want to mix with Don Box's .NET Internals to understand .NET internals ;). Trust me. You will know what goes under the hood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Title is a bit misleading.","review":"I bought this book because of all the good reviews...but. This book looks at .NET from a very low leverl. I just wanted to be able to write programs with .NET. I didn't really care about how it works and why it does things. I wanted a little bit of a higher view of things. Perhaps I didn't understand the reasons behind starting at this level. It was a good book for C#, but not for general .NET programming. The new Visual Studio was not touched at all. It was basically about writing your code for optimum use for the .NET platform. I found the information not very useful because I wanted a book that would immerse me in the environment and help me to use the tools, not look at how the compiler interprets the code and how to look at it. My 2 cents."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic book in the field of Microsoft.NET","review":"This is one of the few classics, programmers should get and learn from it. The easy reading(keeps refreshing the reader on earlier concepts) style makes learning enjoyable and exciting.Even after finishing the book, I still can't help but wonder why System.Threading wasn't covered. Maybe Jeffery should include this topic in his next edition of the book.After finishing the book, the reader should find the concepts covered in other areas of .net easy to handle and understand. After all that's the objective of the book.Five stars from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"incredibly deceptive title","review":"this book is a complete 'under the covers' look at .net, which is a fine goal in and of itself. however, applied to me means means 'applying .net towards accomplishing a given programming goal', which this book will *not* help you with at all. If you want to know all the underlying details (which is sometimes useful) this may be a good book, but if you want to learn new tricks and techniques for actually using .net in your daily programming work or to program something, this book is a huge detour.Just wanted to make people aware that the title is totally incorrect for what the contents are, I'm returning it since it wasn't what i thought it was."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Basic Introduction to the CLR","review":"Applied Microsoft .NET Framework Programming is a solid introduction to the CLR. Richter provides a peek under the hood of delegates, the garbage collector, finalization and application domains.The book contains a mixture of practical advice and technical trivia. Some C# knowledge would be useful to get the most out of the numerous examples.There is a good level of detail for such a readable book. If you want more technical information about IL and the CLR, Gough, J. \\"Compiling for the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR)\\" might be a good follow-on from Applied .NET."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not a classic","review":"I was fascinated by some parts of the book(the chapters on delegates, exceptions & GC are really good), but some of it left me saying \\"duh\\". Richter does state the obvious at times, but all-in-all this book has a lot of info that you just can't find elsewhere. I think that the complaint of some reviewers dealing with the \\"trivial\\" nature of some of the info is valid, but some of the info is essential for writing tight code(the boxing info. for instance). Richter always brings good common sense to the table, and has a gift for explaning things clearly. I've read other .NET authors who don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some important topics missing...","review":"Its one of the best books, but surely not a Bible and Not a 5*. It DOES NOT cover all topics. Most importantly, Threads and Asynchronous calls are missing. No remoting or web stuff either, and not much on security.In essense, this is a very good book to get started but not as a reference for 'everything in .Net'. This covers basic types, text, strings, enums, exceptions, arrays, memory management..you get the idea, right?We at work, read through the entire book - and in the end, had to go to the O'Reilly book by Juwal Lowy for Threading, thread synchronization and async calls... So, If you are a Backend or middle layer developer, get Juwal Lowy and Richter. Between the two you will have most of .NET programming covered (other than web specific stuff)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great CLR book!","review":"This book is a must-have in learning .NET because of its in-depth coverage, tips, and great examples. Its discussions on exceptions and garbage collection are the best I've seen anywhere! *Note that an understanding of C# is helpful to get more out of the book since almost all of the examples are in C#. Although this book does a great job at covering the fundamentals and internals of the CLR, I was surprised by the lack of interop and Framework Class Library coverage. Therefore, I must say that this is one of *three* essential .NET Framework books that you should buy. So if you have this book for CLR coverage, \\".NET and COM: The Complete Interoperability Guide\\" (by Adam Nathan) for COM interop and P/Invoke coverage, and \\"Developing Applications with Visual Studio .NET\\" (by Richard Grimes) for FCL and VS.NET coverage, you'll have all the materials necessary to be a .NET expert!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo. This is how it should be done.","review":"This book is a wonderful peek under the hood of many of the parts of the .NET framework and IL. If you are like me and easily overwhelmed by all you need to know to code at the next level in .NET and get confused by some of the parts. Look no further. This books breaks down all of the code and provides excellent insite overall all in C#. Mr. Richter should be giving classes on technical education writing to the many guys out there that have published lackluster .Net books. This book should not be the first .Net book you read but it should definitely be in the first three."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks great in the picture but not in reality","review":"Picture perfect only, on hand looks very inconspicous and sometimes down right ugly.

Very deceiving package is what I would say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Freda Payne Meets Rap !!??#@","review":"Pretty ruff-edged, unedited, and sometimes smooth jammin' CD, from an awful B-class movie! Freda Payne kicks-off the bluesy Ragdoll Jam, which adds some twangy guitar licks and harmonica wails but, oddly, Freda just doesn't convince me she's ever been through a ruff day out in them there streets, ever! The rest of the CD jams/raps pretty nicely, especially Phelon's \\"Make it Happen,\\" and Ugo's \\"Be True.\\" Definately a sleeper of a CD, that deserves a second listen, especially at this give-away price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better (By far) than Sticks and Stones","review":"Lats summer, I bought Sticks and Stones, and I loved it. I thought it was the best album ever. Little did I know that their self-titled album was five hundread times better. I am a HUGE NFG fan, but seriously, what were they thinking when they recorded Sticks and Stones?!? I mean, Head on Collision and My friends over you are great songs, but NFG succomed to the evil power of record lables and the trend of Pop. This album is so great, that its my favorite album done by them. They should have stuck to the Punk-emo mix that we all love. And thats that."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great CD!!","review":"I just brouth the cd about maybe a month ago and i have played it non-stop since i got it. I heard of NFG before i got the cd but i never really heard anything from them. I had burned a cd with one of the songs from this album for one of my friends and i really liked the song so i decided to get the cd if i ever found it. Sowhen i found it i was thinking if i should get this CD or another one that was in my hand. I decided this CD and im damn sure happy i did. I think all the songs are great nd id say Hit or Miss and Boy Crazy are my favorite songs on the CD. Since i got it though i have not stoped playing it and i enjoy playing it cause when i am under the weather this is a godd CD to listen to to bring me back up so i say anyone should get this cd no matter hwat you listen to cause i myself love hardrock more than anything but this would have to be on top of my list of cds."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolutely horrible","review":"a new found glory was once a great band but this cd is terrible. it is just a bunch a bad girly pop punk. nfg is a bunch of sellouts. they completely change their style and one of there best songs and make a new music video for it that is not even half as good as the old one just so they can get on mtv. mtv ruins punk bands. if you like other bad \\"punk\\" bands (since none of these bands really are punk) like sum 41, blink 182's last three cds, alien ant farm... you will love this cd because it is just as bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Album of the Year: plain and simple","review":"Well imagine that! in just 6 short months they have created 11 new songs and one of our favorites returning (Hit Or Miss). this is...in my humble opinion the album of the year!

CC has what 2 albums? C'mon. And the singer for C&C, well to put it kindly, he sounds more womanly than Jordan. Picture a modern-day, castrated Geddy Lee stuck in a band that loves to be woeful in every aspect of its music. There is no comparison between CC and NFG except that both singers have higher voices. Other than that...NFG does more interesting things with their music that contrasts with their lyrics (which is a good thing) while CC seems mired in despair. Personally, I'm surprised they haven't committed mass suicide yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Scenesters Dream Come True","review":"Catchy yes, a top seller, yes, RADIO FRIENDLY, yes....New Found Glory, formaly A New Found Glory (Just NFG sounded more \\"punk\\") has created a masterpeice for kids that are just dying to be ahead of the crowd....those who want to say they are \\"punk\\" in the commericial sense are in heaven with this album....The first album was good, the second was alright, and the third has hit rock bottom...The way mainstream punk has been going is to become as immature and silly as possibly....And on the third attempt NFG has succeeded fully....This album is just what a punk crazed scenester needs in their cd collection...side by side with MXPX and Blink....Enjoy...."},{"rating":"2","title":"not their best but certainately out of this world..","review":"Its as good,if not better as nothing gold can stay and its all about the girls.no,it doesnt sound as raw as the other albums because they used better equippment.frankly,i kinda like the rawness.NFG,in this album,as in all of them are incredibly emotional and i could instantly relate to the lyrics.in my opinion,is a good,solid band.this album really makes you pay attention to the lyrics and if you've ever seen them live you can tell their music really comes from the heart.a must buy.also check out the other 2 albums and theEP"},{"rating":"1","title":"What was i thinking","review":"I reviewed this Cd a year ago exactly.

I will admit that they don't have the most original sound, but that doesn't take anything away from their talent. Most of my friends agree that it's an awesome CD, and even my friends who don't normally care for punk rock type music have told me they like New Found Glory. This is one of those rare CDs that I enjoy listening to the whole way through, not just certain tracks. I just can't recommend it enough!"},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my favorite albums.....","review":"i purchased this cd about 3 years ago when it first came out and i hadn't really listened to it sense then. But now that i did i gota say this is great! I honestly think that this is there best album and is way better than there newest album \\"sticks and stones\\". if your looking at purchasing an NFG album get this one. Honestly this has to be one of my favorite albums ive heard in a long time. This cd is very well writen and has alot of very catchy songs and also has alot of energy just pounding through some of the songs. \\"dressed to kill\\" i would say is probably the best and most well writen song ive heard in a long time, this song is so great because of all the great emotion it has in it. Also id like to say that just because these guys sold out dosnt mean that everyone has to hate them. Trust me these guys are great and you should get this cd, If I could I would rate this album way higher than five stars because it deserves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"By far NFG's best","review":"This is hands down one of the best CDs I've ever heard. This is a very high energy CD with little filler. Highlight tracks include Hit or Miss, Better Off Dead, Ballad for the Lost Romantics and Vegas, but there really isn't a bad track on the disc. If you didn't like Nothing Gold Can Stay or their latest release, Sticks and Stones, don't give up on NFG because I didn't like them either but I love this CD. I thought the vocals were a bit weak on NGST, but on this one they really improved. Sticks and Stones sounded a little too manufactured for my liking. Overall, you can't go wrong with this CD. If you like groups like The Starting Line, Saves the Day (their earlier stuff), or Midtown, buy this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Nothing gold can stay","review":"This CD is one of the best pop-punk emo albums to come out in the last year. NFG continues to write songs that are common to the typical teen(Relationships&Growing up). Every song on this album is awesome and if you are a fan of Blink, Saves the Day, Fenix Tx you will love this album. Order there other releases from Drive thru records. Give these guys 6 months and all the teenage girls will be jumping on the bandwagon. But thats ok because these guys truly deserve all the props that they have coming to them and are truly one of those bands out there that puts out records that you can listen to from begining to end. Forget that one hit wonder BS."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Found Stardom","review":"This has to be one of my favorite albums of all time. Basically, it's five Florida natives taking half an hour to share their interpretation of punk music at its best...and they succeed. You've got Jordan belting out lovesick anthems like \\"Eyesore\\" and \\"All About Her\\", then switching to funnier moments with \\"Boy Crazy\\" and \\"Sucker for a Kiss\\". \\"Ballad for the Lost Romantics\\" pretty much ends a great album. If I sat here any longer, I'd name all the tracks and give you reasons why they rock, so buy the CD and wear it out. I guarantee that if they don't become one of your favorite bands, they'll give you thirty minutes of damn good fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're a Blink 182 fan or were, you will love this album!","review":"The first time I heard New Found Glory was over the summer at a Blink 182 concert. They were one of the opening acts and they rocked! I bought the CD hoping that it would be every bit as good as their live performance and it is! Every song on this album is excellent. \\"Better Off Dead\\" is the first and probably my favorite song. It is the perfect song to start a CD with. Other great songs are \\"Dressed to Kill\\", \\"Hit or Miss\\", \\"Sucker\\", and \\"Boy Crazy\\". I can't wait to see and hear more from New Found Glory!"},{"rating":"2","title":"NEW FOUND GLORY ROCKS!!!!! and so does their cd","review":"HEY GUYS!! DUDE>>>>>>> new found glory is so good. They're like pop punk, but with emo. So they're really not pop punk.....but somewhat. If you like emo, rock, punk, anything at all, YOU WOULD LOVE THESE GUYS!! \\"Better off dead\\", \\"eyesore\\", and \\"hit or miss\\", are probably the best tracks, BUT THIS is a cd where you really don't have to skip any tracks, the songs are good, clean, and fun. They're like a punk band, with a singer that can sing really like a goose well, and then they're music is awesome too. THIS CD ROCKS!! They're comparable to: The Get Up Kids, Relient K, stuff like that.......SO guys BUY this cd, IT ROCKS!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vomit!","review":"What is the deal with New Found Glory? I don't get it! I've listened to it because my brother owns this cd, and frankly, it sucks. The guy's voice is terribly annoying, and they just come off as extremely...I can't even find the word. I am amazed they've made it this far. It is quite sad what is happening to the pop punk genre. I can recomend much better. I even like Blink182 more than New Found Glory. In my opinion, Sum 41 is probably their complement and is probably my favorite band in the pop punk genre. Another band close to that is probably The Vandals. All of which are better than New Found Glory"},{"rating":"1","title":"this cd sucks guys","review":"i got this the day it came out popped it in the stereo and suffered a big blow of dissapointment...what happened to the raw nifty sounds? all of these songs sound basically the same. However, think of it as party with yourself music,even thought it sucks it is still fun to bop to. and they are just a really good live band, sooooo much energy. so if you are a fan of nfg you may as well pick it up to top off your collection, but if you are a newcomer to them do yourself a favor and get nothing gold can stay or the ep which is so underrated, i love it. yeh so buyers beware, this sugar coated album gets really annoying after a few listens."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD has not 1 bad song on it !!!..","review":"This cd Rocks. there is not one bad song on it. i recommend song #7. this is their best CD ever. a matter of fact this CD IS THE BEST CD IN THE WORLD !!!... simmilar artists are simple plan, good charlotte,and blink 182. 2 words of advice BUY THIS !!!..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disgrace to punk rock","review":"Bands like New Found Glory and Sum41 are nothing more than a bunch of dummies trying to copy Blink, who by the way are also regressing since they're too caught up in the pop-punk scene. Anhow, when I bought this album I listened to the first track (duh!). It was pretty good. Then I listened to about 20 seconds of each track after it, and they all sounded EXACTLY the same. The bottom line is, no matter which way you look at this ablum from, there is one good song and that is the first one that you listened to. SINCE THE REST ARE THE SAME!! My advice would be to buy an mp3 from this album. Then you already have the whole album. Also, if you thought you're interested in seeing them live at Warped Tour, skip their crap set and go check out Rancid, The Misfits, or Me First and The Gimmie Gimmies."},{"rating":"1","title":"pop/punk for the mainstream only","review":"nfg is alright this is a good cd if your into pop/punk awhile ago i was (for the 5 min before everybody had heard of them) but it grew old fast check out bouncing souls or flogging molly if your ready for a change i know i was"},{"rating":"2","title":"NFG - posers? but love them!","review":"I first heard NFG by accidentally downloading one of their songs a year and a hafl ago. The song was \\"Heaven.\\" (It's a cover). I instantly loved them, and downloaded \\"Hit or Miss\\" and \\"All About Her.\\" I became a NFG fan right away. Although they are what most people would call \\"punk\\", true punks know that this is more pop than anything else. Sort of like Blink182, but with better lyrics. Don't get me wrong, I love NFG! If you prefer poppy punk, you'll love them too. If you like hardcore, you're better off with bands like Rancid, NOFX, AFI, etc. The tracks on this CD are great, from the sweet rythmic melodies of \\"Dressed to Kill\\" and \\"Eyesore\\" to the upbeat, catchy sounds of \\"Hit Or Miss\\", \\"All About Her\\", and \\"Sucker.\\" I definately reccomend this CD to pop punkers."},{"rating":"2","title":"buy this cd!","review":"This is a great cd. Its real catchy, exciting and fun, and despite what some of the other reviews say, its not all the same! If this cd wasnt any good, would i have gone out and bought every other cd they have ever released after hearing it?

Well, I decided to pick up there self titled album and let me just say it hasn't left my cd player since then. If your into punk music, then this is definiatly an album you need to go buy. While all the songs are enjoyable and high-energized, some of my personal favorites include: All About Her, Sincerely Me, Better Off Dead and Vegas.A lot of people compare them to blink-182, but I think this band is way better(No offensive to you blink fans)This is a cd you definiatly need to go get if you haven't already."},{"rating":"2","title":"By far the best punk emo band out there!!","review":"New Found Glory have started to pick up the pace of their career.

Nothing Gold Can Stay their first CD is a amazing work of catchy punk phrases \\"love is another word for regret\\" and if you like New Found Glory give Nothing Gold a look. But their self titled is still very good and will bring the die hard fans even farther into the depths. some people will complain that New Found Glory is selling out but I still think they're one of the best punk bands around and will definatly be there to support them."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Next Blink 182... that's not a compliment","review":"Bands like this are giving punk a bad name! Punk used to be about good music and provocative thought, now bands like A New Found Glory, Blink 182 and Sum 41 are turning it into a joke. This album, basically, is trash. All these bands choose to write about now is what will sell, so much for individuality! It's exactly the same as any other pop band out there. The only good thing I can say about this album is that it has a clean sound, although they can give the credit for that to the studio. Do yourself a favour and do not buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Gold Didn't Stay...","review":"Granted, New Found Glory kicks major booty and this cd is awesome but if you haven't purchased \\"Nothing Gold Can Stay\\" yet my advice is to get that first. The self-titled CD is not as good a follow-up album to \\"NGCS\\" as I expected, but its still enjoyable. The new version of the song (number 4)Hit or Miss isn't as good as on their first CD. Although there are some catchy songs like Boy Crazy and Second to Last, nothing beats 3rd and Long and 2's and 3's from \\"Nothing Gold Can Stay\\". So if you really want to experience A New Found Glory to their fullest, forego this CD and get \\"Nothing Gold Can Stay\\". If you already own that, don't be surprised if you're not completely pleased with this selection."},{"rating":"1","title":"They Missed Badly","review":"I love how bad these guys really are. You know you're really trying to make it big when your first big single on your new cd is a freshly remade version of a bad song on your old cd. They are simply trying to follow in the footsteps of the extremely bad Blink 182 to try and strike it rich by overproducing their so called punk album and making funny videos. In fact, whenever another band like this comes along, there should be a 182 added on to their name just to warn the public that the music is unoriginal and boring. But if you must be trendy like all of your friends, go out and get this cd now."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've owned this CD for 10 years now, and it's still awesome.","review":"This album has staying power... ten years worth of staying power. I bought this when I was a kid, and it still rocks my stereo to this day. Pop with a bit of hardcore roots, if you listen closely.Just to clear this up: As of this release, and beyond, NFG is no longer a \\"punk\\" band. In this release, they are purely pop rock. In later releases, they move into hardcore pop territory on a few songs, but stay in the pop rock category.

As a fan of emo in general, I was expecting this to be awesome. Unfortunately, I believe it is terrible. I don't feel NFG classifies as \\"emo\\" - they sound more like a pop punk band like Blink 182. The lyrics are awful and all songs sound the same. I'm sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Wow I'm suprised at all the 5 stars. This CD, unlike Sticks & Stones, Nothing Gold Can Stay and Catalyst (their best yet) has no personality. Every song sounds exactly the same and you'll get extremely confused as to which track your listening to. The melodies aren't even that catchy. Plus, its completely forgettable. I listened to this CD all the way through about 3 times and I can only remember one song: Hit or Miss (which is the only good song on here). This label goes out to pop-punk bands alot, but I think this CD is seriously Nsync with guitars, every song is about relationships and they never branch off into any other topics. At least on Sticks & Stones they had Sonny, which was about somebody who died. Buy Catalyst instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most listenable CDs ever.","review":"NFG's Self Titled, and most recent release, carries more replay value than about 90% of the CDs I own. It's so catchy and talented; yet it has this awesome, raw edge that only New Found Glory can add to a music genre that isn't known for being raw at all. These songs, just like the ones on \\"Nothing Gold Can Stay,\\" get stuck in your head for what seems like forever. And that is a good thing. The band has not let up at all, infact, opposite to what many have said, this release is actually heavier than their previous ones. My advice is to buy it now, kick back, and listen to some awesome tunes. I dare you to sit still while you're listening to NFG, you won't be able to. Not with songs like \\"Better Off Dead,\\" \\"Sucker,\\" \\"Eyesore,\\" \\"Hit or Miss(new version),\\" and \\"All About Her.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Homophobia, anyone?","review":"(...) Fact is, this music is catchy and fun to listen to. Sorry to the people out there who are looking for pop-punk to offer breakdowns and amazing solos. If you don't like the genre, then don't write about it. And saying that blink-182 has less annoying vocals is like saying you'd rather ingest a gallon of acid than a glass of iced tea. And saying that Jordan tried to copy Claudio's sound (I'm a big fan of Coheed as well) is kinda innaccurate. I say this because New Found Glory, a band from Florida, who broke it big in 2000 with this album, would find it hard to copy Coheed and Cambria, a band from Nyack, NY, who first became well-known in 2002. But, that's my thing there. Anyway, this album is fun to listen to, if not overly cerebral or musically brilliant. I have been playing the guitar for 8 years now and this album is still one of my absolute favorites. However, I suggest having a listen before buying it, as anyone should."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why bother","review":"Ok so i read one of those things on this web site that tell you like if you want to listen to good music read this... that was so not true they sent me to NFG... i have nothing against NFG but its not \\"Punk\\" music.

It took maybe 2 listens before I was unable to get these songs out of my head. The lead singer Jordan has a great, emotive voice, as shown on my personal favorites \\"Dressed to Kill\\" and \\"Sucker.\\" This is easily an album one can listen to from start to finish in one sitting. I think the only reason I didn't give this album 5 stars was because the subject matter of the tracks, which is girls, girls, and more girls, is obviously a pretty overused theme. Not to say that this is a bad album by any means though....this album is full of endless energy and addictive hooks. Also check out their 7 song EP \\"From the Screen to Your Stereo.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Good cd, but sometimes a little light","review":"This cd has its moments. Although I think its more pop than punk, its still a good cd. The first single \\"Hit or miss\\" is a song that'll get stuck in your head- fast.

This book does nothing but endorse false stereotypes that Islam is a womanizing religion full of violent terrorists. The scariest part is that this book has found its way onto many middle school's lists of books to read! Here is one disgusting excerpt that really made me cringe: Page 111 - \\"Islam. You thought that religion was a pact between you and God, but it wasn't...Men who hated women. Men who wanted women literally locked in their clothes and their homes.\\" Anyone who has been around Muslims knows this is not true. Yet why does Ms. Cooney wish to force this view unto the middle school students who this book is targeted for? I would really like to sit down with Ms. Cooney and explain to her the true meaning of Islam...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Book","review":"The Terrorist is a book that tends to mislead the reader in many ways. It is confusing and full of misconceptions about Muslim people and their culture. I am not a muslim but I feel that the author has in many ways insulted and put the muslims in a bad light. The plot is also basically about murder and terrorism which is not an appropriate reading for middle school kids like me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly racist","review":"I read this book as an adult, as I was reviewing books for a school board. I gave it a pass! This book presents the typical sterotyped view of Muslims as violent, ignorant people--particularly those Muslims from the Arab world. It seems that Cooney got her information about Muslims from reading hysterical media published in the mainstream Western press, and watching movies where Arabs are all depicted as suicidal fanatics. She does not know anything about the religion, and even less about people from other cultures. Of course, there are \\"bad\\" Muslims, just as there are bad Jews, Christians, Buddists, etc. But they are a minority, not the majority. It's time that we stop promoting this type of literature. Yes, I know it is fiction, but why waste time reading such trash? Why must the terrorist be a Muslim? Avoid this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Religion is a sensitive issue, don't you agree?","review":"I do agree that Caroline B. Cooney has captivating story-telling skills but \\"The Terrorist\\" teaches nothing but inaccurate, offensive and stereotypical references to Muslims.Writers for children should always make their stories full of good values free from any bias against race or religion. Imagine Jehran was not a Muslim girl, and was replaced by a Christian character called Catharine or a Jewish girl called Hannah, wouldn't the story offend the people of those faiths too?Feeding our children's minds with ignorance and intolerance is what Cooney has done because from her writing, she shows no knowledge of Islam (and Muslims).I recommend this book if you support discrimination against religions!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Islamophobia","review":"The writer is clearly determined to demonize and raise suspicions about people of Middle Eastern origin,the religion of Islam and Pacific Islanders. Definetly not recommended reading as the book teaches religious and social intolerance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why the West Encourages Stereotyping","review":"It doesn't surprise me the book stereotypes Muslims as terrorists. Why didn't this author know anything about Muslims, Islam, and the Middle East but terrorism? Is it ignorance? Or is it hiding facts that would change the worlds view about Muslims and Islam as a system? Islam teaches us that if we are to say something it is to be useful or to not say it at all. What this book does is nothing but creates hatred, misguidence, misinformation, and spreading lies about Islam. Fiction or not, it doesnt serve humanity in any way. The only ones served are the enemies of humanity! Don't let your kids get their hands on this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read","review":"A very great read for sure. Stereotypes in most instances are based on truth. Think about it: 99% of all terroristincidents the past four decades have been caused by Arabs under the guise of Islam. Unfortunately the stereotype is true. People will say, well all religions committed terrorism. Perhaps, but not nearly to the extent Islam has. Terror and killing in the name of intolerant Islam continues even today as we speak.THis has taken a toll on our country. We need profiling, and stop insinuating that grandmothers and babies could be terrorists. We need to hone in on people from Islamic countries.I look forward to a sequel to this book. Perhaps one of the hunter of terrorists."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't really enjoy it","review":"This book was very discriminating against the Muslim religion and it sounded like Americans are supposed to be the top race in the world, but at the same time they are also naive in other people's eyes, at least in \\"The Terrorist\\". I did not like the way the book was written. It was confusing and lacked detail. It was pretty unrealistic when it came to students with mixed races. I myself go to an international school, although not quite as international as LIA (the school Laura and Billy went to), and you have friends no matter what country you're from, and nobody criticizes you the way the kids criticized each other in this book.

Although this appears to be a low budget movie (no big name actors, etc.), it is still a good movie to watch, own or rent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst acting, worst writing, worst plot ...","review":"I expected this movie to be a little shy of Oscar quality, but it was actually horrifyingly bad. The acting was SO bad that I could not stop watching. And the dialogue was ridiculous. I think it hit its low point when Eric tells Belle about the horrors of being trapped in a car with his dead wife, praying for her to be alive but knowing she was not. Belle's response: \\"Some times bad things happen to good people.\\" Eric didn't even blink. He should have thrown her in the lake. THAT would have improved the movie a lot.If I could give this 0 stars, I would. I'm a big fan of sappy Christian romance movies that you might see on the Hallmark Channel. This movie makes those Hallmark movies look like a Meryl Streep/Robert Deniro Oscar-winning blockbuster by comparison."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not truly Christian","review":"Overall I thought this movie was a very good production with an exciting plot and good acting, but I was disappointed with the Christian aspect. The messages (both subtle and not-so-subtle) conveyed in \\"Belle and the Beast\\" seemed no different from those conveyed by secular romance films: The woman is perfect as she is and does not need to change; she has unrealistically high standards for a partner; she alone holds the power to change a man; in a healthy relationship, the man does all the work and pursues the woman and placates her until she is satisfied. I am not advocating the traditional model of a relationship in which the the man is the head and the woman a mere submissive puppet; I appreciated Belle's confidence and independence. However, after watching this film which explicitly advertises itself as Christian, I felt as if I had sat through just another secular romance that portrays false ideas about true love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading . . .","review":"Ironic, this \\"Christian\\" movie (dishonestly) doesn't give you a clue that it is a religious-based / Christian-based story in the advertisement - after paying, and clicking \\"start\\", within 30 seconds, you know that Belle is a good, hardworking, generous \\"Christian?\\" girl. Felt like brainwashing. I don't object to the movie, just how it represents itself. If you want this fine. But you should have the option to choose, prior to payment. I'm sure people w/be offended if another religion did this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Christian","review":"I am happy to see that this video has been discontinued. \\"A Christian Romance\\" it is NOT!

In the movie, there is no mention of living for Christ, indeed no mention of Christ, just a God who could be anyone/anything.Please do NOT buy this video wherever you might be able to find it.

Like its predecessor, Solas, Anthem is an upbeat mix of driving rhythms, soft vocals, and synthetic instrumentals. It's a bit repetitious, but MUCH more varied than Solas. This is a clearly more mature composition, and the progress it illustrates give me great optimism for future collections from this gifted composer. I've heard Hardiman's style described as a mix of Enya and Enigma, but I don't know if that is fair. It's neither as serious as Enya, nor as moody as Enigma, but it's fun, lighthearted, and should have a wide appeal. Pop this CD in and go for a drive--you'll relish every minute."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Proven Master Falls Barely Short","review":"I have waited for _Anthem_ to be released for nearly two years. I bought _Solas_ and was hooked. My wife introduced me to the collaborative work Mr. Hardiman did with Michael Flatley. That was enough to tide me over until I got my hot little hands on this CD. Overall, it's a wonderful piece and the songs stand up to inspection alone or as a whole. But ... it's not _Solas_. I love the more relaxed feel that _Anthem_ has, and the comparisons made in other reviews to Hardiman's work sounding like 'Enya' meets 'Enigma' is perfect. I suppose I'm just more of an 'uptempo' Hardiman fan. I do heartily recommend this album to anyone who likes the Celtic genre -- of *any* stripe. Ronan is a genius, and whether writing dance music or slow flowing scores, he has captured the essence of what it is to be Celt."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book.","review":"My kids love all things halloween or spooky.

Honestly, I think I will likely reread this book every year that I am in the ministry."},{"rating":"1","title":"exhaustive descriptions of preaching","review":"The author exhausts every conceivable conception, perception, angle and view of preaching.

The music, the instruments, the vocals.....where do I even begin? With tracks including the ever-so-talented Jane Monheit, this album could not possibly get any better.

The Les Brown Band was always one of the tightest and swingingest groups of the \\"Big Band Era\\". This is one of the best recorded examples of their sound that I have heard. For a collector of Big Band Sounds this is a valued addition to his collection. Les Brown Jr. leads the band in a way that would do Dad proud. Jane Monheit envokes memories of Doris Day and the other fine girl singers that have come ane gone with this Orchestra . Lou Rawls would sound good singing with anybody let alone with this solid backing. This is a five star CD of great Big Band Sounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this one!","review":"I love the fact that you can select as much or as little of a workout as you want each day! The five minutes for each workout go by so fast that I hardly notice and I don't get bored with my workout. It also has a very short intro and no preview information so you can get started with your workout right away. This is very important to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"lot of innovative moves","review":"Having previewed this DVD I am struck by several things: first, I do not think I've ever seen more innovative moves or variations than on this DVD. she had a new twist on just about every familiar move.Second, this workout was different in that she rarely, if ever, requires 12 reps. She just keeps moving quickly through a variety of exercises for one body part.Third, speaking of the upper body workout, she only uses one pair of weights for all of the exercises, except for doubling up on one. I am used to using different weights for various exercises. For example I would use 10 lbs for biceps and 5 lbs for shoulders, but it's all the same here. Maybe it's OK to use just one set of weights for exerything considering how fast she moves between exercises."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout","review":"This is one of the best Denise Austin videos I own. It provides a great stretch and toning option to any workout routine. With a nice warmup and cool down option it allows you to customize which parts of your body you want tone.The only option I wish it had was that instead of just selecting all the workouts, just individual, or just upper body lower body or abs, you could select all lower body and abs without having to individually select them in the customize menu. But that is petty compared to the great toning workout you get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very satisfied","review":"As usual, another great program from Denise Austin.

Thanks for the DVD, it's awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great DVD!!","review":"I had been for a while doing the Denise Austin Power Zone DVD (which is excellent!!), but I wanted to do a workout section with weights instead of the bands. I found this DVD, which is excellent and challenging. I began to see results within 3 days of doing the DVD. I still do the Power Zone, but I incorporate this one for the muscle toning :o). You will not regret getting this DVD. It is excellent!! 5 stars. Thank you Denise, once again!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Uses some different exercises, customization feature is a plus","review":"This is my first Denise Austin DVD. She uses some unique exercises that I don't see often.The only down side is Denise moves fairly quickly, so increasing the weights might not be do-able. The customization feature gives you the option of doing the exercises YOU want to do. Personally, I like her style, and her sincerity. I smile when I'm doing this DVD. Her cueing is a little off at times; I can live with that. I need the encouragement she gives, too. That's a plus for me. I do wish she would use all \\"shapes and sizes\\". This is a DVD I look forward to using..no dread factor. I plan on looking at more of Denise's DVD's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginners","review":"This might be a good workout for you if you are already in shape and want to stay in shape. The exercises are fast and difficult. And the video cuts to standing and floor exercises so quickly that you have to have memorized the workout and know what position you need to be in before the next exercise starts or you will, literally, miss half of the repetitions. You could get about the same results by just standing up, sitting down, standing up, sitting down, standing. . .Horrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"great format","review":"The five minute segments makes it feel like you are devoting less time.

I definitely felt the burn a couple days later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Denise is good, but a little too overenthusiastic...","review":"I bought this DVD because I wanted to find a weight training video. It does a good job, especially the Abs portion. Denise is a little keyed up for this video. Lots of cheering you on. That's okay, but sometimes it's like \\"Shut Up and let me work out!\\" Some of the legs portion is not as challenging as I would have liked it to be. It is easy on the knees though. Make sure you have a chair ready for the legs bit and 2-5 pound dumbells before starting. I started with 2's and went to 5's after a couple of days. Also nice that you don't need a lot of room for jumping around, this is not that kind of DVD. More concentrated on movement and quality of form. Great video to combine with cardio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout","review":"This is an all around great work out. It works every major muscle group.

No crazy routines to try and follow. No awkward stretches or reps that wear on your joints. It's the perfect video to develop a strong, lean, healthy body, sculpting ALL areas. The variety keeps it fresh with just the right amount of warm-ups & stretching. I love being able to choose the routine that I want when I want it. Denise is wholesome & beautiful.

I felt like I learned something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninteresting and completely unbelievable","review":"In medieval France, every noble from the King and Queen on down alternates endless sexual antics with declaring war on each other, with some occasional devil worship thrown in.History as excuse for \\"romance\\"/sex.

In any case, the thin excuse of a plot was tedious and I didn't even make it a quarter of the way through before giving up."},{"rating":"1","title":"potty mouth Passover","review":"I didn't like this as much as I thought I would. I liked the idea of some of the stories (the mother is always upset), but I found the frequent usage of the eff word distracting. I don't think that usage of profanity should be banned from books, but how many times is it necessary to tells someone to eff off at a Bris, or a Seder?The dialogues seemed contrived and unconvincing. I read the entire book hoping to find a story that would justify the purchase price; I was unable to do so. I really felt sorry for the characters who found themselves in these stories, but hopefully they are fictional and will not need to read their portraits.However, if you like to read details about yeast infections and graphic accounts of vaginal itch, this may be the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Judge a Book By Its Cover...","review":"This book was a selection from my temple's book club...did not know what to expect when I heard the title and was uttertly surprised once I cracked the cover and starting reading it...not exactly your zadie's fiction! Ms. Albert definitely has a gift with the pen, but while her recurring somewhat-sexually-repressed-Jewish-woman-in-quotidian-situation is written with some wit, the stories grow quickly tired and are reminiscent of a Larry David \\"Curb Your Enthusiasm\\" episode or a \\"Sex in the City\\" episode peppered with a bit of Judaica. Nevertheless, it's entertaining to read about 30-something women live life and be Jewish. Curious how the novel she is working on will read...Mazel Tov!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jewish Stories told differently!","review":"Be forewarned! This book contains irreverant responses to things typically Jewish. Don't read it if you are easily offended. What this book does extremely well, however, is take someone's pain and superimpose it on a Jewish situation, thereby making very poignant statements in the way each situation is played out. Superficially funny, but deeply sad, these stories are unique and thought-provoking reads.When I first started this collection of stories, I didn't think I'd like them. As I read through them, though, they began to grow on me. I have to say that, by the time I finished this book, I had to admit I found the stories very entertaining. \\"Etta or Bessie or Dora or Rose\\" was the most powerful, but my two personal favorites were \\"When You Say You're A Jew\\" and \\"So Long\\" because they echoed my personal experiences. I will certainly recommend this book to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Religious reflections","review":"Not being Jewish there were parts of this book that I didn't quite get, but being Christian I know enough Old Testament to fake my way through some of the terms and holidays.This was recommended to me by a Jewish-Catholic friend who was very dear to me through college, and I'm glad I read it. The people in each of her stories had a complexity that is hard to find in shorts.. there was depth attained in paragraphs that would take others pages or chapters to attain. I found some of them to be a little bitter about life or their religion - but I books with angry and/or depressed and/or repressed women have their place too.The characters alone made the book well worth the money, and I'm certianly going to pay attention to her future published works. The last short story had me smiling and giggling at the absurdity of it all.Excellent read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This was perfect for what I wanted it for.","review":"It's not the most amazing piece of jewelery ever made but it was exactly what I was looking for. A little while back I read about this Greek Myth. This small fish was so strong that it could stop a ship from moving and when worn as a pendant by pregnant women it would protect them in pregnancy. It would stop them from having a miscarriage. Anyway, I liked the myth and I wanted to remember it so if I knew anyone who became pregnant I could give it to them as a congratulations present. This neckless was the perfect representation of the myth. It's not too expensive and the fish is nice looking and not heavy. When the fish got to my house a wished on it to give her a good and safe pregnancy and guess what!?! She pretty much had no morning sickness and is past the three month mark with no complications so far!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dance Hall Daze","review":"The Dance Hall Crashers' Live Record should go a long way towards establishing them as show-stoppers.

Too damn many are being put out nowadays in a market where the official live CD [especially in punk rock] used to be rare. As I listen to 70 minutes of dual-female vocalized punk/ska, Fat Wreck style [there's your summary, kids], I ponder: why do the Dance Hall Crashers need a live CD? They're not breaking/broken up. The songs aren't varied at all from their original recordings [at least the ones that I have heard before, which are about half]. This isn't a benefit for anything/anyone. So why? I mean, DHC is alright, and I'm sure they're nice people. But unless the live CD is marking a special occasion [i.e. Cheap Trick's \\"Music For Hangovers\\" or Braid's \\"Lucky To Be Alive' {both recorded at the same place, might I add}], keep it under wraps. And if you ska kids REALLY want a live ska CD, check out the new Slackers CD, it's great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great statistics, website resources and basic insights","review":"I often forget the importance of keeping up with my website marketing reading offline.

Action figures that come with this pack are not poseable, and they just move like the old vintage action figures of the 1980s, and they come in awful poses. Luke can't stand up outside of the diorama. Uncle Owen needs to bend forward to stay up outside of the diorama. C-3PO has a zombie face as if it was an undead robot from a scrap yard.I bought it since I had some Jawas, R2-D2, R5-D4, C-3PO and Luke.

And we have played and played and played with this since putting it together. I was hesitant because we gave him the Knights castle last year and it was not quite as sturdy, the 2nd floor tends to come off if you are not careful. What's really cool is that he mixes the knights, the pirates, and some of the modern pieces together to make some very interesting stories. I highly suggest getting the Treasure Chest with this package... Because it makes a nice place to store the pieces. Also the Treasure chest can be turned into a pirate's cave by turning the backdrop cardboard over. I don't remember that being advertised. Also there is a Pirate Lady you can buy for about $2.99. She's pretty neat too. Note: My two yr old can play with this without having to rebuild it (unlike the castle.). But she tends to take the hair and hats off of everyone. This is not so much fun for my son:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pain in the butt!!","review":"Several of the pieces don't fit together properly and the directions are lousy.

Sadly, whoever did the finish work on these did not get the blade sharpening quite right. It crushes as much as cuts (bad). Also, the curve of the blade and length of the cutting surface is actually too long.

In addition to helping me with the loss of my dad, this book has helped me be a better human being - walking around in the world and noticing when people are grieving and giving them the safe space to talk.

It puts down some of the theories of Elisabeth Kubler-Ross who has written many wonderful books on grief. Some of the statements in it are so simplistic that they sound stupid. The book puts down the \\"denial\\" aspect of grief by saying that none of the people they interviewed ever denied that their loved one had died. That's not what the \\"denial\\" step is about. It's about saying \\"This can't be happening to me\\" or \\"I must be having a nightmare,\\" when faced with the loss of a loved one. I would appreciate the book more if they just said the book contains their beliefs about getting through grief and not that what they think is the gospel and what anyone else has written is wrong.

While it may have been well intended, I really didn't have the patience or the desire to endure the protracted sales pitch about what a great book this is for several chapters, followed by the redundant sad rambling stories of the authors lives. While I do agree we tend to repress the correct emotional response to loss and medicate ourselves into a state of apathy, the rest of the book and the exercises were just too dramatic and unrealistic in their benefit. To sum the process with \\"write a letter saying how sorry you feel\\".. well why not just say that up front and be done with it. To top it off with a sales pitch of the grief products was just a disappointment. basically \\"We'll fix your lifetime of grief for 12.99\\"... not really, but we'll make 12.99 and feed you some worn out psychobabble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the reviews","review":"We purchased this book based on a recommendation that although it talked about divorce and death, the process was helpful for other losses as well. You need to be able to plow through A LOT of repetition about divorce and death to see that. I am a very open reader and can see past the obvious, but this one was even tough for me.

But as they say, everyone's experience is different. Glad to see that it helped some people, but there were many, many omissions and oversights in terms of ways to deal with both traumatic and predictable events - past, current or future - and how you let them effect you as you move forward.(They only briefly touch upon that concept.)

I have used this resource with my clients and I know many other therapists who regard it highly and use it in their practices. If you get this, I would also recommend the classicOn Grief and Grieving: Finding the Meaning of Grief Through the Five Stages of Loss. After a big loss of any kind, I think it is very important to take action, but also make sense of the loss. Both resources I mention in this review will help with making meaning out of the loss and getting reoriented."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun princess story!","review":"My kindergartener loved listening to this story. She loves the princesses, I love how this is a non-Disney, creative take on the classic fairy tales. It's full of humor, adventure and friendship.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I like this book!","review":"My mom bought this book for me (age 6 1/2). I liked it. It is a good book for girls. Princesses are cool, that's why I like it. I liked it so much, we have read all four of them. I can't wait until number 5 comes out.The first book would be a five star if Ella had brown hair. That is how I imagine her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Princess School: If the Shoe Fits","review":"I'm 16 and loved this book. My sister (age 10) was reading it and the title caught yy eye so I picked it up. It's really cute and it stresses great values such as indiviuality and friendship. I found that this book made the princesses more like real girls and gives them the opportunity to relate to them better. It was good and I recommend it really for anyone who is a princess at heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just For Kids","review":"I'm almost 13, but when I caught sight of this book, and picked it up to look at, I fell in love with it. Its adorable and kawaii, I think even teens could read it. It was a quick read, sure, but that won't stop me from buying the rest of the series!But one comment-Ella's hair should be brown."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a fun story of girls with great hearts!","review":"Okay, I'm nowhere NEAR being a teen anymore, but when I was one I thought princesses were wimps. Since then I've come to believe there's more to them than Grimm's fairy tales let on, and these authors think so too! If the Shoe Fits was a delightful story of friendship in the tradition of Into the Woods -- where they all share the same world -- and slightly reminiscent of Harry Potter's school adventures as well. I laughed out loud at the dreadful danger of peas...! It's well-written, funny and sharp with lovable and interesting characters.I reccomend this book to anyone who loves princess stories and believes in friendship. I can't wait to read the rest of the series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Splendid!","review":"Lesley Gore had the ability to hit every note and make us long for her insight into love's complexity. All are worthwhile, but \\"Look of Love\\" is the cream of the crop \\"Here I stand, all by myself, watching him with someone else - bet he doesn't even know I'm here - wish I could hold back my tears ...\\" is right on target. The Phil Spector-like arrangement is over the top and adds to this superior song. But really, \\"She's a Fool\\" and \\"Maybe I Know\\" are classics in their own right - well sung, well phrased and, well, just perfect. This is a must-have for anyone longing for the days where the most thorny problem we faced was \\"who should I take to the sock hop.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Good selection","review":"As with any album marked \\"best\\" it is the best according to the people that compiled the album. In the case of Lesley it would be impossible not pick something of her best. You will find each song has a different pace and still have the sound that makes it Lesley.Unless you are making a Gore collection this album will do fine as an example of the person and time. However for me is much more as I lived through the era and each song bring back a memory. I spent a few California Nights on the beach in the 60's. Of course there were other singers of the time and they were more popular. Yet I would not count on them as substitutes for the uniqueness of Lesley Gore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leslie Gore: The Best of Lesley Gore","review":"Best memories in this one.

The music of the early 60's was second to none, unlike what they call music today. When Leslie sang like many others of her time you could atleast understand the words. It was music to have high school crushes on, first loves . Music you don't forget a month after it comes out. After all these years I can still sit around and sing along with the music. You can't do that with the music of today.

It's as if the Gods of Mt. Olympus themselves crafted this immaculate contribution to mankind. I am thoroughly pleased with this wonderful product as it falls nothing short of stupendous.For further clarification it is in fact a genuine wall poster. It's not an off-brand Post-It note called Post-ers. It's not someone who goes around town posting things to other things.

While I haven't listened to \\"seasons one\\" (1st release) yet, I have heard the \\"United DJs of America Volume 9.\\" That CD showed how awesome house music really is. Farina blended soulful, deep groovin records with more precision than any other DJ out there. The same can be said about the Mushroom Jazz series. So what is the difference between SFS and UDJA9? The mixing was as good as it gets (as usual), but the track selection was not as affective; unlike UDJA9, not every track made me want to get up and dance. But I will note that tracks 4,8,9, and 13 still rocked the house for me. Overall, despite being in need of a little better track selection, \\"San Francisco Sessions\\" is great. Mark Farina is the man, and that's all there is to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jass Acid House Groove God (a.k.a Mark Farina)","review":"Do you want a CD to spin when it's time to chill out? How about a house CD that would make good dinner music? Never heard of such a thing? Well you've never heard Mark Farina.

Never too boring, with just the right amount of vocals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not really in to House But a Great CD !","review":"Like I said, I am not much of a house head, more into the harder stuff, but I must say that this was a great lay back CD!

Talk about an intro! As usual, the flow of Farina's mixes are smooth and even. No bumpy rides here. It seems every song ties in to the previous, yet the details of each melody offer something different. For lovers of the underground, this is as good as it gets. Great mixing, nice cover art, and quality production from a proven mixmaster. Here is to hope that Farina will continue to bless the masses with his unique style of smooth dance music!

Shoulda listened to the samples I guess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quasi = Brian Wilson + Elliot Smith","review":"An almost perfect pop record. This divorced husband and wife duo grind out great pop song after song on Field Studies. You'll hear strains of vintage Brian Wilson and sometimes even current Elliot Smith. It's not a surprise that producer-extraordinaire Jon Brion often sits in with the band when they're playing in southern California. If you've got a weakness for Brian Wilson or Lindsey Buckingham's sensiblities - try this one out - you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Overall a very disappointing release, not so by the songs and the concept, but by the dated music Quasi is playing. We've heard it before, we'll hear it all again.

I immediately took to the song and the band and bought the album. A truelly first class record on all fronts. As the months went by I kept wondering why they havn't broken out. Then I recentley witnessed the trainwreck of a video for the same song. Who the *^%$ put the \\"Okay Stamp\\" on that one!!! My advice to the band...\\"drop your label and move on!!!\\" Any label that would allow that piece of crap to be paid for and released needs to have their heads checked. Judging by the exceptional quality of this album and the little air play and attention it's recieving I'm gonna have to repeat the afformentioned advice. DROP YOUR LABEL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another example of \\"Christian\\" music erosion","review":"Reliant K is the latest in the \\"we can't get a real record deal so let's try and call ourseleves a Christian band\\" junk that is available. Their music is fluff and their lyrics are less than weak. It is impossible to find the message of Christ in most of their lyrics and their parading as anything other than a garage band that got lucky and got a contract is a joke. There are legitimate punk/rock/whatever bands in Christian music (like Philmore, This Train, etc.) that are much more worth your time and money. Reliant K is anything but reliable! In the words of their popular hit I can only hope that Marilyn Manson will eat this group!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good!","review":"Their 2nd Cd is better, but their newer CD is coming out in March 2003 and I've heard some of their new songs like Trademark, and Wits all been done before, but I would still recommend this one.

I listenedto it at the CD store, and it ROCKED. Then a few weeks later, thelyrics were so tongue-in-cheek, so stupid. The only good song was\\"Softer to Me\\". But overall, if you don't want something tongue-in-cheek, DON'T GET THIS!..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet CD!!!!!","review":"this is an AWESOME cd.

It Kicks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blink 182 meets Jesus","review":"This is the BEST album I have ever heard a band put out in a while. If you like the sounds of Blink 182 you will LOVE Relient K.

Very good album.Clever lyrics + punk music + a christian meaning= Relient K"},{"rating":"2","title":"RELIENT K -THE FUTURE OF CHRISTIAN MUSIC !","review":"This self titled debut album by RELIENT K is already one of my all time favorites and I've only had it for two days. This is a very talented band with alot of potential. My favorite songs on the album are \\"HELLO MCFLY\\" based on the movie BACK TO THE FUTURE and \\"SOFTER TO ME\\" a song about how life is not always fair. This may be a new band but they are going to be very popular soon. Give them a chance and I am sure you will agree."},{"rating":"2","title":"A work of art","review":"this CD is all most all i and many other people could have asked for from this band. the way god worked through RELIENT K. each song is its own creation but togeter they are another creation of a different manner. the cd starts out kinda catchy and funny (moody rings) then it goes on getting more and more deep and at the end relinet k pulls of one of the best writen songs ever and what are words with out music. well the music is great too. i have to say that this CD will bring you ever where you could think of. i would have to say this cd is for all different typed of people. thouse who like slow music, well it got that, fast, yep we got that too. this is a great CD. GREAT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Seriously this cd is ... I wouldnt even consider this album punk. It's like Christian pop. the only song that has some punk in it is \\"My Girlfriend\\" (which is the only reason why this cd has 2 stars). Their new cd is much much much better than this. if you want to get some good Christian punk, check out MxPx, Slick Shoes, the OC Supertones, or Dogwood"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"This cd is awesome.

Their lyrics are great, and the music sounds awesome. They are similar to MxPx, Ghoti Hook, and a lot of other christian punk bands, this CD is definitly one to add to the collection"},{"rating":"2","title":"You can't hack Relient K","review":"For all of you that think that Relient K is riding in on the Pop-punk wagon, I got one thing to say to you, your wrong. These guys take the style of music that the beetles used, or from the movie, \\"That think you do\\" or Wheezer, and simply punk it up. The fact that Pop-punk resulted is only a coincidence. My personal favorite on this CD is \\"Softer to me\\", but all the tracks are strong. These guys are an invaluable addintion to any punk collection, Buy this disc!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want punk by Christians, buy MxPx or Ghoti Hook","review":"I really dislike this cd. The label may say its punk rock and roll, but the production is definitely pop. I guess if you like pop with a little bit of punk like Blink, you might like this. Also, all the pop culture references get old really quick. The artwork is a rip-off of The Get Up Kids' \\"Four Minute Mile.\\" If you want good punk by Christians, stick with Ghoti Hook, MxPx, and Dogwood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"Like most of the latestChristian bands,they really .... Some of the songs(like K Car and Nancy Drew) have the lamest lyrics. Very few songs actually caught my attention. Unless you're a diehard punk/rock fan, don't waste you're money on it. Listen to ALL the songs(not just the first few,cuz those are the best)first. A way better Christian punk cd is MxPx, \\"The Ever Passing Moment\\". They definately tried to hard. Especially with that lyrics."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the relient k i know","review":"This cd is NOTHING LIKE any of there other ones. I'm not a huge christian music fan (although i like Mxpx and fm static), but when this band put out \\"two lefts don't make a right\\" it totally changed my mind about this genre. I can't believe i waited for 2 weeks and paid 15 bucks for this junk. The vocals are bad, the songs are weak and if it didn't have the name relient k slapped across it, it would have been discontinued 3 years ago. I'm glad rk has become more mainstream with every newer album...and yes, i know it will make alot of people mad but this album is just TOO preachy. It ruins the music with overly sappy lyrics about jesus. I'd recommend anatomy (which is good but borderline too preachy) two lefts or mmhmm instead..."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow","review":"This CD is a joke. Seriously... it's awful. It's for people just starting to get into punk and rock. Use it to convert a friend from Britney Spears to rock and roll.

That was when the problems started.First, it came with US maps.Second, it was out of service, so we could not do anything about the maps or upgrading the software.At that time, we contacted the seller, who could not help us get the new maps, so we returned it.I think if you are selling something as \\"new\\", it should not be obsolete, out of service, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"A step backward for Navman","review":"I've now tried the icn550, replaced by the icn530, and now the n40i.

Personally, I could not care less about that. What's amazing to me is that the map data around my house got WORSE this year (it's got the 2006 maps). Also, I find the user interface even less intuitive than its predecessor the icn-530. I can say at least that it gets a GPS fix pretty quickly. I had to reach for something nice to say.

I was looking for a spoon that was 18 inches long, at minimum, so I thought I would try this. Turns out this spoon is 17-1/4 inches long. It's very roughly milled, has quite a warp to it, and is poorly finished with something clear. I'd be hesitant to use it for food. If you are looking for a cheap 17-1/4 inch spoon and don't care about quality, this is the spoon for you. Otherwise, you might want to keep looking.

Basically, it's about some dreary, gloomy, joyless heavenly angels that live in a library, (it gets worse).This movie lost ALL credibility for me in an early scene when one of the angels (Cage) reveals himself to a doctor (Ryan) who doesn't know he's an angel. He then asks her what food tastes like. Without batting an eyelash, she answers him like this is an everyday normal question. I think he also asks her what an orange tastes like...like I said, it's hard to remember. I can not recall anything from that scene on, not even how it ends.

This movie I hated.I as I sat through this movie, I had an overwhelming feeling that I was being played. This movie was made for the sole purpose of making people cry. Not that it had a story to tell, just string together as many sad events as you can in two hours. It was heavy-handed and insulting.

And he's willing to give up immortality, and I assume his immortal soul, just so he can touch Meg Ryan. Hey most men would give up a lot to touch Meg Ryan. But as the romantic premise for a movie?In the end this is like so many recent movies. All style and no substance. And the images are admittedly enticing. But there's got to be more.

Subsequently, I was interested when Hollywood made its own version of Wim Wender's film with Nicholas Cage and Meg Ryan, both actors whose work I've enjoyed. I saw \\"City of Angels,\\" and for the most part I liked it -- that is, until the very end. What a DOWNER!! No matter that the movie gets all psedo-warmfuzzy-philosophical and time-to-get-out-your-handkerchiefs, it misses the point of the original film, which was a celebration of Human Life and Love.

It didn't strike me as sad at all. Nicholas Cage plays angel. Somehow instead of doing important Angel things, all he has time to do is follow Meg Ryan and wish he was a regular human. Somehow he gets wish and they get together. Then Meg Ryan gets on her bike and decides it's a good idea to ride it with her eyes closed and duh, she hits a big @ss truck. Man, that part of the movie is so funny. You'll pee your pants laughing. That is the only part of the movie I really remember very well but it was hysterical.

Why, oh why, do american moviemakers insist on remaking old classics and foreign films? No ideas of their own I suppose. Pathetic.

The angels all hanging around in black trench coats made me tense...not to mention that as a Christian, I found the whole concept to be totally non-biblical, which may be why I just never got hooked. I stuck it out for the ending, and found that even that made me feel empty and mad.

And yes, the angels do look ominous. Meg Ryan was miscast as a heart surgeon. This is simply not worth watching.

That book contains photographs of a variety of boxes, has large line drawings to illustrate details, has precise measurements for each box, and has a numbered step-by-step procedure for making each box. That book enabled me to make several of the boxes in the book with relative ease. Stowe's book, on the other hand, really disappointed me. Although it has colored photographs of the boxes, they are so small that it's difficult to see what's going on in them. His procedures for actually building the boxes are way too general for me to follow. In a couple of sentences, he attempts to describe five or six procedures at a time. He has no dimensions for any of the boxes. There are no line drawings to further illustrate what he's trying to show in the tiny photographs.

Taken in by a rag picker (a person who collects and sells rags and bits of old clothing), Millie finds herself struggling to adjust to her new life.An evil pimp, is also bent on getting his hands on Millie, so she is sent away for a while. Eventually she becomes a governess, where an awful incident and a chance meeting with a young nobleman has Millie falling in love. But is it true love? Or did the young orphan boy she grew up with also have a claim on her heart?This was an excellent and entertaining DVD. Millie is a loving, and nice girl, and the friendship between her and her foster brother Ben was touching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incoherent jargon that doesn't make a point","review":"I felt obligated to write a review after seeing that all of the other reviews were 5 stars. I found this book to be endless jargon that never seemed to make a point. The reason that I bought the book was that I thought it may offer some insight into business systems architecture that went beyond the standards. What I found was a low level philosophical discussion of things like \\"beauty\\" and \\"power\\". There is little about system design, this book is mostly about organization structure and corporate politics, and it is a poor discussion at that. What is also misleading is the use of the terms \\"Chaos\\" and \\"Complexity\\" in the title. My interpretation of these words was that it linked business systems architecture to the field of Chaos Theory. I found nothing in the book that did this. I would recommend that the scientific minded individual avoid this book, however, if loosely worded business management reading is your style, you may like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Old IBM saying","review":"The reason I bought this book is purely out curiousity on the subject.

But he soon learns that To Be Different is Bad. The other rabbits, instead of sharing his joy, reject him for his special gift, as does his own mother. He soon learns that it's better to deny your own gifts than to Be Different; and in the end, voluntarily shorn of the wings that gave him so much delight and lifted him above other rabbits, he is again accepted by rabbitkind.A stirring celebration of mediocrity, and a much-needed message to children with gifts and talents that they had better learn to hide them.

Only at times was it written well. Only at times did it give you just enough detail to imagine what is happening. The book is an easy read and sure you can read it, dont let me hold you back, but there are so many better books on the same topic out there. Dont be mistaken that Rita Williams-Garcia is a bad author from this book, but its not one of her best works. Thulani, the main character, just isnt a normal guy. The book can give you wrong impressions about him, but really I think that one of his pigeons poked his head one too many times. And Ysa with her drawbaks.....it gets to be stupid.

In the early chapters I found it very easy to understand what the author was saying but then it got to the subject of Archetypes. The author starts to talk about archetypes as if they are real people and then she really goes over the top when she starts to attack Hitlers character to bolster her rather perverted view. It is now 60 years since the second world war, which incidently was started by the British and not Germany, so why rake it up now? It is a very weak and insecure writer who feels she has to stoop to this type of character assassination. Maybe she should look closer to home at some of the recent American Presidents as moral examples for her book. Whilst the book as some merits, I would not recomend it to anyone who is serious about the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite!","review":"This is the first book I purchased when I started exploring my path.

If you already own the first edition this second collection book isn't entirely necessary. However, if you are trying to decide between the first and the second...go with the second. It is gorgeously detailed and DOES have a quantity of new items, but I would say most of the book was a repeat of what I already had. P.S. There aren't any ACTUAL patterns supplied with either book. It does list the pattern numbers should you want to try and find a copy the info is there, but the book is strictly the scans of the fronts of sewing patterns of the 1940's."},{"rating":"1","title":"This could have been a very interesting true crime story...","review":"if it wasn't for the author's atrocious writing skills.I honestly can't believe this book got published.

As I continued reading this book, I was increasingly surprised that it ever got published, so pervasive was the poor grammar and sentence structure. It was disjointed and confusing and lacked substance; I learned so much more from reading a piece that was written on this case for the St. Petersburg Times. I think Kathryn Casey or Ann Rule could have done so much more with this tragic story. Furthermore, the author's bias towards Valessa was very clear, thereby victimizing Vicki Robinson all over again. Please, Ms. Wellman, most children who grow up in far worse circumstances do not take part in murdering their parents. There were NO excuses for Valessa's actions."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly written true crime","review":"As a reader of over a thousand true crime novels, this book was very disappointing. It was fraught with fragmented sentences, poor english, disjointed and scattered thoughts, and was written is a very biased manner. Valessa Robinson got a sweetheart sentence, for without her this crime would not have occured. (Let us remember Pam Smart, who wasn't even present at the murder of her husband. She was just as guilty.) The author seemed to blame the mother for her own murder by being too lax in her dealings with her daughter. She mentions throughout that Vicki's friends were very anti-Valessa, forgetting that these are the very people who knew both the victim and her daughter and had a very good understanding of what was going on in the Robinson household. A writer should not allow herself to become one-sided in her reporting of a crime. I wonder if Ms. Wellman has had teenage children. The writer needs an English class, or, at least, a new editor."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it!!!","review":"I just purchased this player about a week ago, and it is great.

This film is the explanation. There is some built in comedy here. Murray, thinking he's participating in a theatrical farce, digs himself deep into the underground world of international spies. Through clumsy coincidences he manages to convince those in power that he is actually very clever. This is something to watch if you're reeeeeal desperate. It works on a lowest common denominator type of comedy. Murray incorporates a slapstick humor here, which is not his fortee. I think that the fact that there is no emotional bond to the characters works against its entertainment value. Rent \\"Groundhog Day\\" or \\"Scrooged\\" again instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"The comedy that tried hard","review":"About 8 or 9 years ago the team of Bill Murray and writer-director Howard Franklin delivered the funny and energetic QUICK CHANGE. With THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO LITTLE, Murray and Franklin tried again with mixed results. They seemed to want to make a quality comedy and Bill Murray definitely will crack you up from time to time. While THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO LITTLE falls short of the energy level it's trying to reach, it's worth a look nonetheless. See THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO LITTLE, on cable TV."},{"rating":"1","title":"LAUGH? I NEARLY CRIED!","review":"I was expecting a lot from this film, it had been descibed as Bill Murray's best film since \\"Groundhog Day\\", one of my personal favourites. However it wasn't. Indeed, it was a disgrace. How can it's producers sleep at night when they produce a so called comedy that delivers no more than one laugh in its miserable duration.

It was well worth the money. The plot is not very believable that it could 'really' happen in real life, but it's a riot to watch played out on film. Bill Murray does an excellent job of getting in the role for this film. I highly recommend watching it if you can.One of the best parts are when Bill Murray gets mugged and thinks it's all an act, so he \\"rehearses\\" the best lines to give the crooks over and over.

Wallace mistakenly answers a phone call from a real hit man, remains oblivious throughout the film of the mistaken identity, and the rest of the film is about reality mistaken as fiction and vice versa. This film got horrible reviews, but I thought it was hilarious."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"Bill Murray proves once again that he knows how to make people laugh.

It's very funny it may not be as good as his more famous comedic performances like Stripes, Caddyshack and Ghostbusters but it's still a fun movie. Bill Murray has very few bad movies. This is worth a rental and if you can get it a cheap price worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Old-Fashioned Laugh-Aloud Humor","review":"If you don't find Bill Murray funny in general, this movie is not for you. If you do, then you're in for a treat. This is a fast-paced, genuinely funny movie. Not deep, just funny. Think Abbott and Costello, for a lot of physical comedy and slapstick humor.Joanne Whalley, as the cabinet minister's call girl, and Alfred Molina, as \\"The Butcher\\" also put in wonderful performances. But Bill Murray steals the show with his hilarious Matreshka dance that he performs with a group of Russian dancers. If you're in the mood for comedy, don't miss this highly underrated little movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughed so hard!","review":"THis movie is a great way to relieve stress from your daily life.

However, I imagine that that would be just as funny to watch.I imagine the pitch for this film went something like this...\\"Bill Murray is back, in the new blockbuster side-splitter 'What About Bob: 2'! This time, Bob is mistaken for a government spy who... What's that? Change the name? Ok, how about 'The Man Who Knew Too... umm... Little! Hmm? What's that? No! This genre has plenty of gas left in the tank. You're practically guaranteed to make bank on this.\\"That pretty much sums up this film. If you find it as easy to laugh at Bill Murray as some people find it to laugh at Will Ferrel, then you might want to plan a few intermissions to stop yourself from getting a hernia. If not, then pop some extra pop corn so you'll have leftovers to throw at the screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deadpan hilarity","review":"This is one of my favorite movies. It's deceptively low-key.

I was listening to this album in my bed after I bought it that day. I was really tired, so I kind of drifted off (not because the album was boring, far from it - I was just tired). When \\"Fever Dream\\" came on I instantly became aware again. It's not like this song has a loud or startling beginning, either - no Iron & Wine song does. But the guitar line was so beautiful my mind must have said \\"wake up and hear this.\\" I rarely hear a song that affects me so...so dramatically as \\"Fever Dream\\" did, and still does. I just layed there, captured by it's sheer gentle beauty. It aroused so many emotions inside that were lying dormant somewhere inside me. The fact is, I've been extrememly lonely lately, and there hasn't been anyone I felt could really sympathize with me. But this song captured my emotions so well I shed tears. You probably think I'm lame, but I just needed to share how deeply this song affected me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth double the price","review":"I bought this on the recommendation of a friend and can not get over it.

In a world of heavy bass and angsty lyrics, Iron and Wine's definitely a delightful departure from the norm, but not an unwelcome one.Lyrics come at an intimate whisper. The vocal harmonies drift out of the speakers like springblown seeds. Accompaniment is sparse and yet critical.My favorites from this CD:\\"Naked as we Came\\" the first Iron and Wine song I heard and one I bought singly before I got into the group. The lyric:She says \\"If I leave before you, darlingDon't you waste me in the ground\\"I lay smiling like our sleeping childrenOne of us will die inside these armsEyes wide open, naked as we cameOne will spread our ashes round the yardThen, there's \\"Sunset Soon Forgotten\\" which reminds me of summers long ago, bandaided children and june bugs....If you're looking for some quiet, introspective folk, this is the place to come.Rebecca Kyle, May 2009"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fake Drake","review":"Take a man with an obvious devotion to Nick Drake (did you know that the title is a clever reworking of some of the lyrics from the last song on Nick's final album Pink Moon?). Make sure he has a passable voice and songwriting skills, and that he can write lyrics that on the surface sound profound. And you'll get this - an uninspired collection that sounds great as backgound music 1 or 2 times, but becomes increasingly pale after a couple listens. Upon scrutiny the lyrics are often senseless and artless. The whole thing has a misleading sense of \\"genuineness\\" which, when revealed for what it is, really rubs me the wrong way. It's the kind of cd that sounds amazing at Starbucks, but when you bring it home and listen to it a few times you realise you just wasted 15 bucks. With so many real, genuine singer songwriters (Bob Dylan, Bruce Cockburn, Nick Drake himself - to name a few of my favorites) out there there is no reason to bother with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"I must be missing something?","review":"I've tried to listen to several InW releases,and no matter how much i try,I can't seem to listen to a whole album.Yes,there are some great lyrics in here,but its basically just a man whispering into a mic with background music playing.None of the songs i've heard seem to go anywhere.I do like heatmiser,Elliot Smith, and Bright Eyes,and other slower tempo bands,but i do not see the appeal in this.Good lyrics,boring songs,very little cohesion.This is simply my opinion,but i would not reccomend this at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I like folk music. All kinds. Joni Mitchell, Greg Brown, Ani DiFranco, Nick Drake, Gillian Welch. This music, on the other, is just monotonous. It could benefit from some crescendos, variation in tempo, or something for God's sake. When it's playing, it's sort of just background music. It drones on and on, and eventually I get distracted and forget that it is there. I'd suggest Superwolf by Matt Sweeny and Bonnie Prince Billy instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea","review":"If you like someone straining a whisper into a microphone as two acoustic guitars strum monotonous tones, you might like this. However, it gives me a headache. There isn't anything original here, and frankly it is very dull.And for those who love it, well, don't deny the truth. It is exactly that. A dude whispering into a microphone with two acoustic guitars playing dreary songs. Like I said, if you like that, more power to you. Me, I prefer innovation and a little more of something I can move to or at least use my imagination without wishing to put a bullet in my temple.I'll try listening a couple more times....but right now I have to see a psychiatrist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Amazing, a Modern Masterpiece","review":"If you don't have this album yet you are missing out on a modern masterpiece. Sam has done it again. The talent he showed in his first album was no accident as he proves with this latest stroke of genious. Start to finish i was spellbound in the melodic beauty of Iron and Wines latest installment. Do not pass this one by."},{"rating":"2","title":"pure and beuatiful","review":"casting himself in the role of a southern man's answer to Nick Drake, Florida native, Samuel Beam has carved out a stunning collection of heartfelt songs under the guise of Iron & Wine. there are several mini eps from this singer songwriter and Endless Numbered Days is the second full-length album; and so far, and he has yet to write one bad song. these melodies are strikingly stark and beautiful in their gentle tone and no one with an ear for simple intimate beauty in their music can deny the magical touch of these folky touching masterpieces."},{"rating":"2","title":"once again...!","review":"I have to agree with a previous reviewer, when I heard that the new album was given life in a proper studio, not a bedroom, I was nervous. I was worried that the music would lose some of that \\"special charm\\" so present on the first album. Yes, this may sound a bit corny I realize, but iron and wine fans KNOW of which special charm i speak. No worries however, as Mr. Beam's second album is filled with charm, emotion, beauty, pain, and wonderul songwriting. His beard is also a sight to behold, and I'm convinced he gets much of his creative inspiration directly from the beard itself, although this is most cetainly NOT beard rock. Reccommending this album and giving it four stars is far too easy--This music is real...unlike most that is recorded and released these days."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Whisper Speaks Volumes","review":"The man with the awesome beard, Sam Beam, and his co-horts have created a wonderful world of music here.

Also, check out the \\"Woman Kind\\" EP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"The vinyl, Our Endless Numbered Days, was crammed into a box that was too small for its dimensions, which made it be warped upon delivery."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't believe the hype","review":"This recording should be sent to every dentist in the country. Musak for people who like to think they have taste, forced breathy singing (\\"Hey I'm as talented as Nick Drake\\") forced steel string guitar squeeks (\\"Wow, what a lifelike recording\\") pathetic Hallmark quality lyrics (\\"Hey I took a creative writing course, really\\"), and just to make you feel comfy, the songs are redundant. \\"The art of saying things well is useless to a man who has nothing to say\\" -Macaulay"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good mellow listening experience","review":"It's a bit different than I expected, but I like it. All in all I think the songs are good, although Sam Beam's voice does get a bit monotone at times. But I would say he is a bit like Bob Dylan in a way, more of a song writer than a singer. The more I listen to this album, the more I like it. There is a nice melancholy feel that runs through the entire album, not really depressing though, just a bit moody. \\"Sunset Soon Forgotten\\" is my favorite song on this CD. This is a really good mellow listening experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"everything I could ask for","review":"I have been a fan of Iron and Wine since I heard \\"Bird Stealing Bread\\" from The Creek...When Our Endless Days came in the mail I knew it was going to be special before even opening the package. It has since become one of the few albums in my collection that I feel will never grow old. It is a masterpiece from beginning to end. Sam Beam has warmed up to become an authentic song-writer with a message that any person is due to hear...if only once again. This is a great album and deservant of the utmost praise from any critic issuing stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Other stuff to check out","review":"I am a huge fan of catchy, quiet yet melodic folk/pop.

I think this is very misleading to a buyer when they use the same cover from the LP for the CD. I guess I should have tried to find out what songs were on this CD before I ordered it but how would I have figured out this rip-off when they made the CD version using the original cover of the LP version?? As with ALL of Barry White's music regardless, you will enjoy whatever songs are on any album. I guess I will have to search for all the songs from the Rhapsody LP, buy them from either iTunes (and that still doesn't have all those songs either) or buy other CDs and then put them on a playlist to burn my own \\"Rhapsody In White\\" CD.

More so than some of his contemporaries, Stevens has been forgotten: growing up, I knew tons of kids with James Taylor and even John Denver albums (not to equate any of these artists!!!) but none who listened to tons of Cat....And that's not really fair. He was an artist (albeit a bit of a flake), a heck of a songwriter and musician, and one of only a few artists who can just generally connect with about any listener. That's an accomplishment.....

These boys Rock! This is my first purchase of so called new \\"Heavy Rock\\" as I am probably older than most of their fans and generally listen to 70's and 80's hard rock/southern rock/hair and heavy metal. This cd is excellent with the rhythm guitars and drummer being outstanding. The solos could use a little more technique and less feedback but maybe this is typical for this genre. The vocals are pretty clean but they need to be louder in relation to the guitars. I have seen others say their sound is a combo of Skynyrd/Ac/dc but I think that it sounds much closer to Sabbath/Metallica. It is a full on Sonic assault. The only detriment is that there are only 7 songs and the fact that there are no lyrics included. I am now interested in hearing their other albums. One recommendation to the band, do a skynyrd cover \\"all metaled up\\". Rock On Dixie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Looking Watch","review":"My grand daughter was going to turn 16.

It uses a battery that lasts for 5 to 7 years, and there are no moving parts that have to be serviced as with a self-winder. The body and bracelet are of surgical stainless steel that will not rust or stain and polish easily to a sheen. It is stylish, Swiss made and functional. My own watch is a Baume & Mercier Capeland which cost considerably more $$$.

BTO is still great 40 years after the fact. This excellent collection brings back fond memories of those days of my youth when rock musicians actually knew how to play their instruments and sing meaningful lyrics in harmony. One of the unforeseen side benefits of purchasing this collection is that I discovered that my 5 year old son absolutely loves \\"Takin' Care Of Business\\" and \\"Roll On Down The Highway\\". Whenever we go on a car trip we play those songs and he enthusiastically sings along while boogieing like a maniac in his car seat.

The Tempest sound is propelled by the tasty fretwork of gifted British axemeister Allan Holdsworth (Gong,Soft Machine,etc.), the rhythm section from pioneering jazz-rock outfit Colosseum and the formidable warbling of one Paul Williams (no, not the diminutive composer with dubious pipes who penned \\"Rainy Days And Mondays\\", but another!)The most amazing thing about the album is how contemporary it sounds; the only thing that screams \\"early 70's\\" are the occasional silly lyric (a la Spinal Tap's \\"Stonehenge\\"). Several cuts sound like virtual templates for the Dixie Dregs, Dream Theater, King's X or Queensrhyche; especially with Holdsworth's fat, sustaining guitar tone, sophisticated chord chemistry and his occasional flourishes on the electric violin.

The Marvel universe has x-panded that I am cursed on to only following certain charcters, this book helps fill in the gaps of the other reamaning charcters and their life threating tramas.Your never going to get ALL the X-facts straight unless you have read all the comics..until then, in my opinion, this is a cool that will kind you threw the halls of the x-mansion to Asteriod M and leave you craving for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ultimate X-Men!!","review":"This book definitley lives up to it's name as Ultimate. I wish this book would've been around when I first started collecting X-Men. It brings you up to date on characters, teams, villains, continuity, and more. If you're a fan or just starting to collect X-Men this book is a must have!! Great pics, and there's even original artwork created especially for this book!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Characters--Zero Plot","review":"As a die-hard X-Men fan I had to pick up this trade paperback. Taking the X-Men out of a visual comic form allows more to be written. It gives writers a great opportunity to flesh out these colorful characters. Unfortunately, the anthology format ensured that no plot would survive. Each story is averaging 20 pages. In order to accomodate such a shortage of paper, the writer has to present a plot, flesh it out, and resolve it on the turn of a dime. I was frustrated halfway through the book at the stilted writing and lame ending after ending after ending. This book does get two stars. One, because it is afterall the X-Men, and two--it does focus on a variety of heroes. If you want X-Men fiction that won't leave you unsatisfied, I recommend checking out those novels written by Christopher Golden. (The Mutant Empire Trilogy is nicely written.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A gift","review":"This is an xmas gift for my 14 year old niece. Haven't read it, but seems like a good book for her to realize she's not alone in some of her teen difficulties."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Provocative Read!","review":"A wonderful collection of short stories about kids who are \\"outsiders\\" which can facilitate some great discussions both in the home and in the classroom. The stories are written by well-known YA authors and many readers, both old and young, will easily relate to the universal situation of those in the \\"in-group\\" versus those \\"on the fringe.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Throw It Away","review":"The book deserved 2 stars because it was a terrible book. I really didn't care for it. it is basically a bunch of short stories about people on how they don't fit in. Alot of it was untrue because people only act bad when they are not liked by others. I also think it deserved 2 stars because it had a bunhc of short stories and there is no boring parts in it. If it would of been a long book i dont think to many peple would be interested in it. Over all i think if somone get's the book they should through it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Throw it away","review":"I thought the book was a bunch of bolagna. I didnt care for it at all and someone should burn it. The only reason i liked it was because it had a bunch of short stories and not just one big book with a bunch of chapters. It had a lot of truth in it which is the only good part of the book. The book was basically about kids that dont fit in and are outsiders. Who ever get's this bpok should throw it away or tearit and burn it into peices."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want the whole thing.","review":"The picture and sound quality aren't bad. Although, the earlier videos were shot on film and it would have been nice if they had cleaned them up a little. There are a few songs missing. Worst of all, the very beginning and end of each song is clipped/covered by a graphic providing title and year. The music starts and after a few beats the graphic slides off, and then it slides back in before the song is over. If I'm paying for a whole video I want to see the whole video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I saw this on the racks in Hong Kong but frankly the sight of the poor reproduction on the cover (it's a US copy) put me off from buying it.ABC was a favourite band of mine from the past and it's great to see it being re-released on DVD....but the collection is far from complete. The song \\"The Real Thing\\" is missing and there's no extras at all. The sound doesn't even seem to be remixed....If only those concerned who had the heart of putting it out again just add a bit more effort into it. Perhaps the UK version could do a better job?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Punk on a whole new level.","review":"ATDI is full-throddle yet melodic punk that drives lyrics and amazing musicianship through your body. An excellent record to say the least. Cedric's lyrics and yell hit you harder than you can imagine. Just because you're a punker and love bands like Pennywise and Bad Religion, doesn't mean you'll love ATDI...you have to love brilliant music...and if you do then buy this record, not a single song will dissapoint. Guaranteed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter complete garbage!","review":"Sorry don't mean to put down others that have a bad ear for listening to this band.How many times can a person handle the get away,go away cliche in the lyrics!? I'm talking about One Armed Scissor,a played out song.Enough of the nonsense.The singer is the most annoying I have heard since the New Radicals debuted on the radio.There are many others bands that make noise and also have good songwriting abilities such as Incubus,Taproot or Deftones,etc.This album is all noise and that sums it up! Better bands are out there that deserve to be heard.At The Drive-In is not one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond the MC5 clothes and fros these guys lack substance","review":"If I have ever heard a more extreme perversion to one's ears I would be kicking myself off of a ladder and into a bar b q pit. These punks don't represent Texas well, they are a disgrace. We at El Paso were already on the map. They're music is shallow, and they are major league sell outs. What's next for cedric and company? Gap ads, Calvin Klien models, thay have that waif look about them. Spend you money on less cliche rock and buy something worth while."},{"rating":"1","title":"ARE YOU JOKING ME??","review":"I believe that I've written about this cd before but I can't remember so I'm gonna write again. THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST CDS I'VE EVER HEARD!! How could anyone call this music?! What really brings them down is there pointless, too-big-for-their-own-good words, where sometimes don't even fit the context of what they are trying to say. And don't give me any \\"you don't understand big words BS.\\" I am a very intellectual person and this is just stupid. The music itself is just average mid-line punk rock. So what do you get? A extremely mediocore band with no singing/lyrical talent whatsoever. Even his voice (...) Wow I can't go on, I'm getting sick just thinking about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saviours of Music?","review":"I have lost all respect for the writers of \\"Rolling Stone\\" for hailing this album to be the saviour of rock music. This album offers nothing new or powerful. Instead, you get a screaming fool with an afro, collapsing out on stage, trying to get your attention. The sad thing is the audience falling for this childish act. I saw them at the recent North X Northwest and was let down. Take away the stupid on-stage antics and you have very average music played by guys pretending their sixteen and in a wannabe cool punk band. The music industry is waiting for that one band that will take us into the future, clearly ATDI will only remind us of the past, not the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gah the voice!","review":"Being a pretty big Mars volta fan I decided to check this album out, and at first listen I was horrified at the lead singers vacous non melodic excuses for a voice. I understand that the singing was actually collaborative work, but just listen to The Mars Volta and you'll be blown away by earnest beautiful talented singing and screeching. I suppose Bixler really found his true self/voice on tremulant. Most of the music on this album is brilliant, but is seriously, seriously marred by some of the droning vocals. After some time I decided to overlook this \\"scar\\" and focus on the music. I have to give this album 4 stars because it cannot be easily ignored, although at times you'll be shaking your head at the nonsense vocal workings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow fans of Mars Volta beware","review":"I bought this CD because I heard good things about it and because I loved the album De-Loused in the Comatorium by the Mars Volta band which has the lead singer Cedric and guitar player Omar from ATDI. But unfortunately Cedric just screams out random stupid lyics on this album by ATDI and the musicianship is nothing special, don't buy this album unless you like screaming and rip off Rage sounds. I love Rage against the Machine, I love the Mars Volta, I loathe this album with all the contempt that Nero had for Christians. This is truly one of the worst albums ever made IMO but if you like Emo and screaming and fast music go buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapoining","review":"This album is incredibly dissapointing. The songs sound all the same, and it gets old fast. The lyrics are horrible, and the lead singer dishes them out in a really strange and unpleasing fashon. Stay away from this one and spend your 15 bucks on a good Rage Against The Machine cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"ATDI-wishing they would get back together and come out with another album!","review":"I originally bought this album only for a few tracks. One of the being:ONE ARMED SCISSOR. But once it was purchased, I sat down and listened to it...the whole way through. I found other songs that quickly became favorites for me. It is rare that I can sit through a whole album, and keep from hitting the SKIP button. This is one of those albums....Everytime I listen to it I hear new and different things in the background. This is a album I know I will never tire of."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most inspiring albums Ive ever heard","review":"This quickly became one of my favourite albums of all time after buying it because I liked the look of the album cover. There aren't many pieces of music that capture my energy quite like the now defunct hardcore post- punk band At the Drive-In. This isn't for everyone's taste that's easy enough to tell, but if you find it easy to listen and 'get into' various lesser known types of music then I suggest you take a good look at this. \\"Cosmonaut\\" will implode your heart with passion and fury, whilst the following track \\"Non-Zero Possibility\\" will leave you comatose with its anthemic despair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emo just ROX At TheDriveIn was the best modern rock group!","review":"I loved At The Drive-In! I was sad when I heard they broke up. Oh well, that always happens. I just was starting to get into them when I heard they broke up. I cried for rock music, because they were losing one of the best modern rock groups alive! But thank God, that Sparta and Mars Vulta were created, now we can get out At The Drive-In from 2 different groups! I just bought Sparta's new album today and I love it, but for now let me just end my review by saying, get all the At The Drive-In CDs, because they just absolutely rock! I love this CD the most (the only one I have)! GET IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I haven't been this impressed since system of a down","review":"A friend of mine walked into my house one saturday night carrying a CD. He looks at me and asks \\"have you heard 'at the drive-in'?\\" I replied in the negative and he proceeded to put the CD on. I settled in to listen to just another heavy band that sounds like every other band... was i wrong. Now don't get me wrong I love heavy music, I just hadn't heard anything good since System of a Down. Now what i personally heard at first (and you are free to disagree) was \\"Rage Against the Machine\\"-like vocals, then all of a sudden it sounded like the cure. The vocals are absolutly amazing and i haven't heard anyting like it, and I think it unlikely that I will ever hear it's like again. So if you're into hard music or just plain good music, this is the album. I wish them all the luck in the world, i just hope the radio doesn't mangle a band I believe i could listen to a thousand times in a row and never tire of."},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredible finish for At The Drive-In","review":"The bands' last effort before the end, this is an amazing finishing work. Their music was polished and refined to a pinnacle level by this point, and in conjunction with the Vaya EP, this is At The Drive-In's best work. Don't hesitate to buy it at all; even if you're uncertain about \\"punk rock,\\" you can still find stuff you'll like on here. Ivalid Litter Dept., Quarantined, and Non-Zero Possibility are incredible. The lyrical ramblings are likewise interesting to listen to. If you're not a heavy punker (like me), just be warned that a few of the tracks tend to degenerate into a more formulaic punk \\"I am screaming really loud\\" sound. But regardless, this is an incredible album, and should be purchased without hesitation. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nay - sayers beat it!","review":"I cannot believe that some people actually do not like this CD. I am scratching my head, because they either like metal, or rap, or they are too young to know what punk music is. I have been around this scene for 20 years and I know good music when I hear it. At The Drive In is punk at it's finest... they totally make me spaz!"},{"rating":"2","title":"another great album by the most energetic band ever","review":"At the Drive-In delivers another great album. Can they do no wrong? They scream, pound the hell out their instruments and somehow control the chaos to make beautiful songs. They are complete rulers and will take over the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont believe the hype","review":"Maybe I'll be drawn and quartered for this, but this is their weakest effort. Just because it had the \\"best\\" producer, biggest budget, and they had a cookie cutter three and a half minute song with a chorus sung 8,000 times on MTV doesn't mean this is an album of the decade. Honestly it took me three times before I could even get through the first half of this record. I found it that unimpressive. And still do. Its slightly above generic alt rock or whatever the hell MTV would label this as. If you're going to get any ATDI, please do yourself a favor and get Vaya and In/Casino/Out, then Acrobatic Tenements third. Actually, don't even bother with this one at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice change","review":"This album comes like a breath of fresh air to my tired ears. These guys sound like nothing else (that i have heard anyway) and make a nice change from the suffocating wave of nu-metal that keeps on coming. Would give this 5 star but it takes a few listens to get into it. All in all an excellent album full of energetic and heartfelt vocals (though non-sensical lyrics)and brilliant guitar work."},{"rating":"2","title":"We miss you, ATDI.","review":"To me, At the Drive-In was the most amazing band that I have ever heard. I think that any new emo/punk/rock/hardcore band will never match At The Drive-In at their prime. PLEASE COME BACK TOGETHER!!!!! PLEASE!! LET THE WORLD HEAR THIS GREATNESS ONCE AGAIN."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unadulterated Crap","review":"This CD is so bad it's embarrassing. One star is too high a rating. I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Farewell to a great band!","review":"I was deeply saddened to find out that At The Drive-In broke up shortly after I borrowed this CD from my cousin and burned it. I had never heard of At The Drive-In and was wondering what kind of music is this. I can't honestly tell you, its an experience you would have to experience to know what it is. This band was as great as Zeppelin and Pink Floyd were! They should be in the Hall of Fame because ATDI were a bunch of complex rockers with a point, that you couldn't quite figure out. The sounds were always grungy and punk in nature but not too repetitive, the lyrics Floyd like but were in a category all their own.R.I.P.AT THE DRIVE IN!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WHY? WHY GOD WHY?","review":"WHY DID THEY BREAK UP?! I LOVE THESE GUYS! I HAVE THEIR NAME TATTOOED ON MY BUTTOCK (not really). I LOVE THIS ALBUM! I cannot begin to explain all the passion that is put into this album. The stars above are not enough to express the extreme cult love I have towards these fellas. DON'T WASTE YOUR LIFE INTO NEVER HEARING THIS ALBUM! If I had 5 albums to keep me for the rest of my life: this would be one of them. NO JOKE! If you pass this album up; it's like missing the Yellow Submarine by The Beatles, or not ever seeing Star Wars (ok; so that movie wasn't that great: but still you had to see it because everybody else did). This album undoubtedly tells a story, and you may take from it what you will, but it has seriously enlightened my outlook on life. LONG LIVE ATDI!..."},{"rating":"2","title":"At the Drive-In is where it all started","review":"Omar's high woman-ish but extremely awsome voice hasn't quite shown itself that much in this CD. Songs like \\"Mannequin Republic\\" and \\"Non-zero possibility\\" are probably what got him the idea for Mars Volta. If thats you'r favorite part about At the Drive-In you should definitly look into some Mars Volta. But don't think of them as an \\"underdeveloped Mars Volta\\" because they differ in many ways and have more of a EMO style."},{"rating":"2","title":"ummmm, I think I like this","review":"My online friend told me about this band last month. Then I heard One Armed Scissor on the radio and I was like, huh? The lead singer can't sing to save his life but for some strange reason I am drawn to this band. Kind of like a hot stove---you know it's hot, but you reach out to touch it anyways. ATDI definitely has a future; they are a kick in the pants in the corporate world of rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Armed Scissor is good enough for a purchase as it is!","review":"This CD is awesome. Serious hardcore music. ATDI remind me of Rage Against the machine, but with so much ENERGY! Buy this CD, its cheap, cool, and just something good to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Album","review":"I didn't really know much about this band until I heard One-Armed Scissor. When I heard it, I was shocked of how unique this band is. You can't really categorize them.There are very few CD's you can listen to more than once over. This one of the few great CD's. The day I bought it, I listened to it four times. I would recommend this CD to anyone who listens to rock music. I guarantee you will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST CD I EVER BOUGHT","review":"Wow.. this cd blew me away. Every solitare song is a hit.

It's too raw, too loud, too energetic, too melodic for you \\"Mainstream Fans\\" to handle. This band is for true Rock fans who have real taste in music when it comes to Rock. At the Drive-In resurrected garage Rock that has been faint for the last decade. Since this album has come out I have noticed more Garage bands have been emerging to the likes of The Strokes, The Hives, The Vines, The White Stripes and all those other \\"The\\" bands. Their break-up is a tragedy but, in the ashes you will find something left in THE MARS VOLTA, not Sparta. This album is a must in a collection of true Rock fans. Blink 182 fans stay away from this album for your own safety."},{"rating":"1","title":"MC5 ...","review":"This has to be the most overrated, overhyped, talentless bandin the world. At the drive in is one talentless band. They clearly[replicate] their stage antics and hair styles from the great MC5."},{"rating":"2","title":"At the drive in - Relationship Of Command","review":"The Relationship of Command is a rock record. It's as simple as that: raw guitar rock with distressed vocals and crushing choruses; just gutteral rock n' roll. Although it sounds like Fugazi and Rage Against The Machine colliding with Iggy And The Stooges and MC5, the record is more pop than not, and should appeal to MTV viewers sometime soon. Vaya and In/Casino/Out were really good albums, I just think Relationship was a huge step forward. Nothing is left out of this record; you have joy, darkness, sadness, anger, and just pure emotion seeping out of all the corners. Tracks like One Armed Scissor, Enfilade, Ivalid, Litter Dept., and Rolodex Propaganda are awesome new songs that need listening, and the curious openings to many of the tracks draw the listener in. Guitar rock has been needing something refreshing for quite some time: the refreshments have arrived."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genius","review":"At The Drive-In is genius. They're the best there ever was, will be, and seemingly can be. I still can listen to the same ATDI cd for hours a day and not be tired of it.

The only reason i gave it 4 stars is because it really seems like something is missing to make it complete."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crawls under your skin","review":"When I first heard this album, my first exposure to the band, I loved the music but hated the guys voice. Now with only a few more listens, the voice is the main reason I cannot stop listening. It's what makes it like nothing I've ever heard, sonic and soaring, yet warm and sincere.Crawls under you skin, and lives there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raw, intense, sincere","review":"Relationship of Command may be ATDI's most crazy, loud record as of yet. It still maintains a lot of melody through. It was produced by Ross Robinson, (korn, limp bizkit, other bad metal bands), but don't let that scare you away. I think Ross really captured something the previous producers missed. ROC is the real deal. Pick it up, and see them live to fully appreciate them. If you haven't heard of At the Drive-In, you might want to get In/Casino/Out first, but all the albums are incredible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not great","review":"This is one good album, probably even better. However, this is not among the great albums of all time. This is a wonderful recording and it combines some of the great elements of their previous work and adds new flavor to the rock landscape. However, this is not for everyone. While it is pretty hard throughout the album, 3 songs (Quarantined,Invalid Litter Dept., and Non-Zero Possibility) break the hard rock in a hurry and some people won't buy it. Another thing is the lyrics. At first, they seem like gibberish, but after awhile, you'll be wondering what the hell do they mean? This is a great Major Studio Debut, but not a great album. Hopefully, ATDI while come back from their hiatus soon and make a better album"},{"rating":"2","title":"Saviours of music","review":"Melted disc, damaged speakers and a hearing problem as a consequence of unstoppable listening. They built their own musical stile, without any influences, truly original. Their music is contagions because of its power and energy which is squeezing through the songs. Nice combination of melody and great Cedric's vocal. They have also literally good lyrics, that are spreading a great feeling. Many people like to mention their similarity with Rage Against the Machine, but I disagree, the only similar thing is the vocal. Time has come for some serious changes in music, and just like Nirvana in 90s, At the Drive-In will make the revoultion nowdays.

The book does not go in depth on how to perform each of the steps of a successful Dev process, but it is excellent for getting a Manager (or programmer) to understand the benefits of each part of the process, and the pitfalls of NOT doing them. It also offers an excellent reference list of other dev. process books including some with more in-depth coverage on the how-to's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good for \\"Projects\\", but not for \\"projects\\"","review":"This is an excellent guide to doing large software projects (10 man months minimum) well. Not only does it tell one what the right steps are, but also what difficulties one may encounter and good ways to get around them.Unfortunately, most situations I've seen lately are for many micro-projects (a.k.a. feature enhancements) which, I think, require a somewhat different methodology."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five Stars","review":"It is an example on how an insipid topic like software project management can be made interesting. It is a great book for software project managers who are new to the job and wish to learn. You can use this book as gateway to reading more advanced books on this topic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Highly Recommended Book On Software Project Management","review":"Steve McConnell covers software development strategies in great detail. Important issues involved in software development are discussed with illustrations that make some complex factors affecting project management easy to understand and analyze. Survival tips presented are very practical and to-the-point, making SPSG a must read for people currently in the software industry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Software leads need this book","review":"Software Project Survival Guide is one of the best books I've ever read about leading a software project. The author is not trying to sell any specific process or methedology, instead the book is full of down-to-earth practical advice about software development. If you are a software lead, new or old timer, read this book. If you are a software manager, buy a copy of this book for every one of your leads."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent resource for project managers!","review":"SPSG provides excellent guidance and a host of project tracking and documentation ideas that are sure to aid any type of development project. As a first-time project manager, I am part of the target audience the book was geared to (How to be sure your first important project isn't your last), and I was searching for some sort of guidance. My team has implemented and adapted many of the suggestions, and we are developing tight process controls as a result of the input from this book. The only thing that I wish for the book is that the valuable resources on the SPSG web site were also included on CD with the text. The companion site provides a wealth of ideas that have helped us to mold our project and set standards within both our company and our clients' organization. Every project manager should be required to read the SPSG."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you need to read this You're in the wrong business","review":"No statement in this book is incorrect, or even inaccurate. The problem with it is it goes on and on about a number of simple, if not trivially obvious facts about how to manage a project. The main one which occupies hundreds of pages is \\"PLAN YOUR PROJECT\\".So if you could not have thought of these on your own, or ever did anything more complicated than playing tic-tac-toe without discovering this book's type of advice, you have no business managing a software project.However, if you skip all the obvious advice (averaging about 1/70 pages) and enjoy reading phrases like \\"Executive Sponsorship\\", \\"Mushy Milestones\\", and \\"inch pebbles\\" this book is for you. But please buy mine... cheap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed by this book","review":"I expected a lot from that book based on who wrote it. Unfortunately while reading I realized that this book is not up to the standard I expected. All practical parts I would expect to be there are missing - you will find plenty of guidelines though. Also the book throws a lot of numbers at you, but doesn't back them up.Often the book says that you can \\"overdo\\" something and that's true, but it doesn't say when you're overdoing. I think (and I have nothing to prove that) that many new PMs will try to follow these guidelines \\"too much\\" (as it often happens with highly theoretical books that should be practical)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Software Project Survival Guide","review":"This book was initially loaned to me by my IT specialist when I came to him with problems I was having with a software product whose development I was overseeing.

This Album includes 'Nemutta mamano Joenetsu' a song that made a great hit, and 'VOYAGE' a very beautiful song. Although Deen is a band under the gender of J-pop & rock, this CD shows a little 'Jazz' and 'Vocal'. This CD is described as the real DEEN itself. I'll rate this the best Album ever released from DEEN."},{"rating":"1","title":"orgininal length","review":"I just wish the dvd would have been the original 151 minute version.

Then came this new version that holds up to the original. The new mix gives it an elegant feeling and the Instrumental is beautiful. Soaring strings and flute abound. Perfect for a wedding as the mix suggests. The same applies to the new mix and Instrumental of \\"Dreaming I was dreaming\\". Get it while you can. These songs are already classics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong photo and description","review":"This is the wrong item. Only in small print is it CORRECTLY described as HDMI-f.The photo shows it as HDMI-m, and the lengthy description explaining its use also has it backwards. Don't trust the photo or the long description.There's no way you could really tell which this is. So I ordered wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book for building any telescope","review":"This is my favorite book on telescope making. The authors share their wisdom and experience designing very large amateur telescopes for visual observation of stars, planets, and nebulae. While they are mainly concerned with reflecting telescopes of over 16 inches aperture--the BIG ONES in their phrase--the optical designs and construction details are adaptable to scopes of any size. The book is logically organized for quick skimming and attractively produced with easily understood photographs and construction drawings. The witty and jargon-lite writing style makes it accessible to any reader likely to be interested in the construction and use of home-brewed telescopes. Budding telescope makers might also take a look at Richard Berry's Build Your Own Telescope for complete designs of more modest instruments."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's good, but don't count on liking all 101","review":"The format of this how-to book is good. The instructions don't give all the steps, but the photos help fill in the blanks. There are some great ideas for topiary arrangements, working with tulips and their tendency to bend, and some beautiful ideas for wedding bouquets. Though most of the ideas in this book are good-great, some are awful. The gold-spray painted cherub arrangement, and the hankie draped vase leave much to be desired. I guess it was hard to think of 101 great ideas, so they had to throw in some second rate ones. Overall though, very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"101 How-To Favorites by Florist's Review","review":"I'm sorry, but at this time I cannot review this book as I have still not received it as of July 23/05.

Of course, the CD here fails to mention on its packaging that these are not the beloved originals.

Since I own a small company that sells products on the internet, I know how returns should work. I would not use this company again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Birding by Ear","review":"This is a great intro to bird songs. It has many common birds as well as several I had rarely seen but often heard. Its strength is that it is arranged in groups of similar-sounding birds, with narration that ties them together with memorization clues. This makes listening on my way to work amusing, and memorization not too tough. The weakness is that it is not easy to find the song of a particular bird if you want to identify something you just heard. A good companion would be a CD with lots of individual songs easily searchable, although such a format would not be nearly as easy to listen to for more than a few minutes.On the whole, a great start. Bike rides are more fun too, since you always hear more birds than you can see. After two years of listening to this each spring, I'm ordering the sequel, More Birding by Ear, as well as a more complete song collection for searching."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe I read the whole thing","review":"This is the worst book I ever read! The grammar is terrible, with commas, semi-colons and dashes liberally applied in incorrect places. Misspellings are common, as are cliche's and mixed up sentences.Even disregarding the miserable grammar, the book is bad. The storyline barely hangs together and the sub-plots are hardly introduced before they fizzle out. The characters are very flat. They remind me of the standing photo boards of celebrities at fairs--maybe nice to look at, but absolutely no substance.I kept reading the book because I wanted to see what the author would do with a couple of intriguing ideas. Unfortunately, he never developed them--just basically played with them a little and then cut them off.Please get an experienced editor for the next book, Mr. Grant. This could have been such a great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"In My Top Ten","review":"The sacrificial love in this book takes my breath away! I enjoy Callie and Sin's story every time I read it. I'm reading it to my husband each night. Camraderie, bravery, love and passion make it a fun bedtime story for us both. It is one of my ten favorite novels!"},{"rating":"2","title":"born in sin","review":"I'm new to Ms.Macgegors writing and literally devoured this series(staying up all night to finish). But of all so far,this one moved me to actual tears(which is alot to say about a historical romance novel).It was so well written and heartfelt,equally sad and funny.I dont ever leave reviews but I just had to for this gem.I look forward to reading more about these brothers(I love series stories).Thank you Ms. Macgregor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the MacAllisters so far....","review":"Out of all the MacAllister novels so far, I enjoyed this one the most. Sin was one of my favorite characters from \\"Claiming the Highlander\\" (the story of his younger brother Braden, and the first book in the MacAllister series.) When you have a character you really like, and you are waiting for their story, often times you are let down, because the actual story doesn't live up to what you've built up in your mind. Sins' story however lived up to my expectations. He was very human, especially for a 'hero', and our heroine Callie is great. She's far from a shrinking violet, and Sin needs a strong woman to help him conquer his ghosts. The MacAllister series in general is a great series to get lost in, but \\"Born in Sin\\" is my favorite, and I strongly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I cried during this story and I don't cry easily. Sin's childhood and his life up to the point where he meets the heroine, sounded so awful, I don't know how anyone could have survived it. And when asked by Callie, the heroine, he was honest about it too. It adds to the bittersweetness of this love story. I loved the moment when Callie finally showed him how much he means to her and what she was willing to sacrifice for him, a man who was rejected by both parents, hated, and feared but who had always sacrificed himself to save someone less stronger than himself. This is, by far, my favorite out of the MacAllister series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"Although this book takes on an interesting idea, the book is poorly executed. The dialogue feels flat and unrealistic (set more in current day US than in either England or Scotland), the hero and the heroine are unbelievable and the plot feels empty. I forced myself to read until roughly 90% done and then couldn't bring myself to finish. This was a waste of 7.99 (what I paid for the kindle version) and it was vastly unsatisfying. Those are a few hours of my life that I'll never get back...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not memorable.","review":"After writing a handful of 4&5 star reviews I thought it was about time I bothered to write a negative review so I didn't come across as loving every single book I read (it's much easier to write reviews for books you loved rather than hated).This was one book that everyone on the boards seemed to hype up and came highly recommended but unfortunately I can't feel the same. I read this book a couple months ago and as I write this I'm struggling to remember what it was about. Hero and heroine were boring, as was the plot, and well, I suppose even the supporting characters were dull. As I recall, I was barely able to finish it.. there wasn't enough in there to keep me interested, and I just wanted to skim over it quickly so I could start reading another book already.I don't get what the fuss was about. Maybe one day I'll give it another go but if it didn't work the first time, it probably won't again.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad! Really Bad!","review":"So trite! So many tired phases! The hero, so tried, so true, so tortured! So bad! He didn't even have a birthday- nor any Christmas presents! Never loved! NO mother! No love! So many 20th Century phrasings! So old! The usual Scottish vs English during the Plantagenet era. (Could have been the Tudor era!)I bought this book only because it promised a storm for the weekend. Will I ever buy a book from this author again? Noooooo!Even the \\"romantic\\" scenes were so tired- so trite...need I go on? Sophomoric, really."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!

It's a treat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! Wow! & More Wow!","review":"The moment I finished this book I wanted to pick it up and read it again. This book caught me from the very first page. Sin's story is the saddest think I have ever heard. My heart hurt so much during this book. I loved the way Sin & Callie's relationship played out. I liked Callie's sence of humor and the way she made Sin laugh. In some parts you could almost feel Sin's heart opening up to Callie. This book was truly amazing it is my favorite out of all of Kinley MacGregor books so far. If you are looking for a wonderful story this is for you. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have."},{"rating":"2","title":"An angel for the lost soul","review":"For those who had read Claiming the Highlander might remember Sin, the dark brother who had been treated harshly by almost all people in his life (excluding his brothers). And for those who had read Master of Desire might be happy to find Draven's little brother Simon presence in this book.I really shouldn't reveal too much about the story. However, I really enjoyed this book and I loved the hero and heroine.What can I say about Sin? He was hurt too much by people around him since childhood thus he never expected any kindness from those around him. Callie was a really stubborn girl who wanted to crack the ice of Sin's cold heart. She used several weapons to do so: courage, kindness, good humor, sweet smile, patience (a lots of it!!!), herself and love."},{"rating":"2","title":"IS THIS GOOD \\"BLUES MUSIC\\"?

It was lacking something that they had live...Most of the songs sounded the same. I bought Circle used while on a vacation, and listened to it all the way home. This CD was ten times better than the first! You can tell that they are much more matured in music then they were on the first CD. Very good CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Blues","review":"No, this album might not be as 'hard hitting' as the original, but who said that that is what blues albums are suppose to be? Also, I don't beleive anything about the band trying to make this album more radio friendly, actually I'm not sure I've even heard anything from this album on the radio. This album plays like a story being told, and we are rapt listeners. That is what the blues are all about, and this is one incredible blues album. The band has matured lyrically and musically since their debue, and I for one hope that the continue on in their own direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISSAPOINTED","review":"This band is great live,only because of the lead guitar playing of mato.

The drumming and singing have improved from their last record, and the songs are excellent. This is a less derivative sounding release than their other records too. And the guitarist, Mato Nanji, is simply the best alive on earth. His play on \\"Circle\\" is less \\"in your face\\" than in the Live shows, personally, I prefer this approach, more Clapton-like. The CD's production is very layered and dense,interesting and fun to listen to: it sounds great. I've looked and looked, and this is the best blues rock out there, in concert or on record. Buy Circle."},{"rating":"2","title":"very accessible blues","review":"I really enjoyed this cd. I agree it is more radio freindly, but if that helps get this band more exposure, I am all for it. Mato Nanji shows the depth of his talent, great writing, great playing. I can definitly hear a Hootie and the blowfish groove, but that aint necessarily bad. I think this cd is a perfect balance to the raw guitar spectacle that is \\"Live at the Pachyderm\\". do yourself a favor and get both."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indigenous does rock!","review":"If you are looking for a top rated blues act, this is one C.D. to check out. Indigenous with Doyle did progress to a different sound on this C.D. but to tell you the truth, it worked. This is the C.D. to buy so far for this year. Mato is one of the top blues guitarist out there right now and he is only improving with age. If you have the chance to see them live you will only fall in love with them more. They really do have a good feel for the blues and a powerfull raw edge that will leave you smiling. If you love Stevie and Hendrix give them a shot. All of thier C.D. kick, so buy it and listen to the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Circle is pure Rock N' Roll","review":"Circle has to one of the best rock/blues records to be made this year. It brings back the '60s feel and really rocks like a Hendrix or Cream record does.

(1) The illustrations are not silly or too cartoonish. (2) The text is decent, meaning it is easy to read but not too far removed from the Word of God. (3) A significant scope of stories are included, not just the same old Noah's Ark and Jonah and the whale. You will get a sample of everything from Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob to the end of the New Testament era, including a very decent treatment of such Bible topics as creation and the crucifixion of Jesus (short but sober).

It is easy to understand and the little pre-K and kindergarten age students will grow into it. I highly recommend this Bible.

Keep in mind that when project Nim was launched the human genome was decades in the future. We did not yet know that we share over 95% of our genes with chimps.The interviews are especially effective because they give you a candid look at the people involved in the projects. Some were naive; some were heroes in their own way, and one or two were just plain jerks. I like the way the interviews allow each viewer to make these judgements for themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your Money!","review":"I enjoy animal movies that are based on true stories rather than purely fictional tales. NIM is based on a true story; however, I found it lacking a few of the basic ingredients that makes people want to watch movies. There was little action, suspense, or drama, and what very little bit it did have, it was way too predictable. Basically, this flick is more of a documentary than a movie. Half way through it, I found myself looking at the clock, hoping it would soon end. I'm sure the chimp in the research experiment wanted it to end soon, too. I kind of wish I had saved my money on this one, and waited as I think it is now out on the premium movie channels like HBO or Showtime."},{"rating":"1","title":"PETA probably was behind this!","review":"I stopped watching this 20 minutes in. I was surprised after watching the opening scene of the portrayal of how horribly the chimps were treated. If I wanted to think about this from the standpoint of taking a chimp from it's mother, I am smart enough to realize it. I got this movie, because I really wanted to see how smart the chimps are. Time after time, they continued to just stress all the negatives....Unless you are a member of PETA and want to see this stuff over and over to emphasize your beliefs to yourself, DON'T GET THIS MOVIE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shortcoming of the Profiler","review":"I found this book to be a lot less than I had anticipated. Having read several books by different authors, I had my hopes set too high for this book. Ressler was more concerned about telling the reader how great he has been over his career. He repeatedly throughout the whole book tells us readers how good his talents are and how he was the sole person who developed criminal profiling. The information given was shallow, though the interviews with Dahmer and Gacy were interesting. He provides no depth of knowledge into the criminal mind. I found this book to be an overall disappointment, unless you are a self absorbed person, then Ressler's attitude might be what you looking for. There are several books out which are much better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fascinating Material!","review":"Unfortunately, no one ever told Mr. Ressler that the presentation and analysis (sans the incessant patting himself on the back) of each case would have made his intelligence, experience and expertise self-evident. It is heart-breaking that he felt the need to remind us on every other page how amazing he thinks he is. Speaking only for myself; I'm sure I could have figured that out on my own! I won't buy another of his books and I wouldn't recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite possibly the worst book I've ever read","review":"Given all of the skills available to Mr Ressler and his colleagues, maybe a more interesting topic would have been studying Ressler's massive ego, which appears to be hiding a serious inferiority complex about John Douglas. While Ressler is no doubt highly skilled as a detective, I find it amazing that he has invented every technique, coined every phrase, and discovered every new concept in the history of detective work. After enjoying John Douglas' works about the teamwork at the FBI Behavioral Science Unit, I was amazed by the relentlessly self-serving tone of this book. Everything is just \\"I, I, I, I,\\". The only time he stops to mention anyone else is when he takes time out to take a cheap shot at Douglas. As an author, however, he commits an even worse transgression - he is painfully BORING. I have never before put a book down half read. However, I won't be throwing it away - one never knows when insomnia might strike."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great book","review":"So what if Robert Ressler may have a bit of an ego. This book is very interesting. I enjoy John Douglass' books as well, but his take on the crimes tends to come across as being a little too emotional. Ressler is very clear headed. He also provides more details about the specific crimes and gives credit where credit is due to the police officers who are really the ones who catch murderers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Informative, yet self-aggrandizing","review":"The validity of Ressler's information is automatically questionable considering he seems to use this book as a way to get back at his former colleagues with the BSU. I found myself laughing at times when he gives himself considerable amounts of credit for progress in a case or his repeated claim of coining the term \\"serial killer\\". This inflated sense of self takes away from all the information that the book provides. The interviews with Gacy and Dahmer are interesting. However, I wonder how accurate they are because Ressler seems so concerned about looking smart and good at what he does. It is apparent that he has something against John Douglas, who is the guy you should be reading anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"great cases - bad egos","review":"This book explored a lot of different cases and included a lot of material you don't find in other forensic/crime books, such as the interview with Jeffrey Dhamer. However, Robert Ressler has a HUGE ego problem and seemed to spend a lot of time boasting about himself and his work, his overwhelmingly large picture on the front of this book is just a small comparison to whats inside. ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A good beginning, an egocentric ending","review":"I enjoyed the interviews with Dalmer and Gacy as well as the author's expertise in the serial killer arena; however, the book became increasingly tedious and self-involved as the chapters wore on. Frequently, Kessler is self-referential and self-congratulatory, attempting to deny responsibility for SNAFU's that occurred over the course of his career. In addition, he invariably gives himself considerable credit and seems to see himself as a sort of demi-God where this field is concerned. The book seems as much about this author and his perspective as it is about serial killers. At best, his tone is extremely irritating after page 150 or so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disorganized and uninteresting","review":"Ressler writes a rather disjointed and perfunctory summary of cases he has been involved with, some in a very minor way. He doesn't go into any of them in much detail, and you get the feeling he has a lot of personal axes to grind and rivalries with his former co-workers to air out. For example he says more than once that, despite what his detractors have claimed, he doesn't actively solicit work, but rather he is sought out by his clients. John Douglas is mentioned only once, in a rather critical way, but Douglas's books are far better written and more interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ego, ego, ego....","review":"Mr. Ressler seems to find ways to work himself (and his accomplishments) into each story he tells. Very disappointing book! Really didn't care for the comment made about John Douglas either! Mr. Ressler, I wanted to read a book about what stirs these people to commit the crimes they do - not about you and your accomplishments. Save it for your bio - and let someone else read it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ressler sounds angry at the FBI","review":"I have enjoyed reading true crime for some time now including Whoever Fights Monsters, But this book is self serving and does not introduce any new information you have not already read. It seems Mr. Ressler is angry at John Douglas and others for not aknowledging his effort while an active profiler and he is trying to show them he was first or best or something. The message was lost on me. The interviews are something to read however the bulk of the book is simply a retread of his previous works. My advice. Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up to hype","review":"Unfortunately for the reader who spent good money on this book, it does not live up to its hype. First, Ressler has a monstrous ego; an example: he didn't coin the term serial killer any more than the three other authors claim to; it's been around since the 50's. His book is biased and slanted, while masquerading as a facts-only book. He claims to have had a greater play in many cases, most notably the Chase case, than he actually did. While the book was entertaining, it was not worth the money. Borrow it from the library or a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS BOOK IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY-AT ANY PRICE!","review":"ROBERT RESSLER NEEDS TO GET OVER BEING IN LOVE WITH HIMSELF. WHILE HE MAY HAVE SOME INSIGHT ON THE SUBJECT OF SERIAL KILLERS, HE SPENDS MORE TIME INFLATING HIS OWN EGO THAN HE DOES ON THE SUBJECT. A MORE APPROPRIATE TITLE MIGHT BE, \\"I LET SERIAL KILLERS TALK TO ME\\". THIS BOOK IS A WASTE OF TIME."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast","review":"This does exactly what it says it does.

However the B sides don't live up to Oasis' reputation for putting out great tracks on there singles as well as albums.Don't get me wrong, Track 2 \\"Sittin' here in silence (on my own) is still a good song, but sadly only runs for about 2 minutes and so much more could have been done with it. Written by Noel, it is very much a Lennon-esque song that deserves to be a B side onlyTrack 3, a live version of Rock N' Roll Star has been done before, and is no better or worse than other versions getting around.The B sides get 3 stars each from me. Buy it only if you are a hardcore Oasis fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not among their best....","review":"What can I say? I would have never chosen this track as a single for this album.Traditionally, singles are picked for radioplay and marketability.\\"Let There Be Love\\" is not one of those songs. It's a weak track. Noel should have just left this up to Liam to sing the whole song.Reccomended for serious Oasis fans only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak!","review":"This is a high level overview of renovation with almost no useful details. The author tries to address too many things and in doing so never goes into depth anywhere. I bought the book to learn his take on cost estimation. He spends 1/2 page giving ballpark numbers for an \\"average-sized house\\" and it is too high level and he leaves a bunch of stuff out. If you know absolutely nothing about renovation then this book is a quick read and it might give you an idea of SOME of what there is to learn elsewhere. If you don't know anything about renovation before you read this book and all you do is read this book, HIRE A GENERAL CONTRACTOR AND DON'T ATTEMPT THIS YOURSELF!"},{"rating":"1","title":"misled by previous reviews","review":"Donna Ingersoll's book depicts the hardworking and respectful life of the Cheyenne people. Her hero's tribe, including his own wife treat the white woman he finds with kindness and generosity. My disappointment with the book comes from the boring dialoge and lack of descriptive writing.

We graduated from high school together and have met up at several reunions. Many of our classmates have lost touch, but a core group of us strives to stay connected. I always knew Lynn was creative and artistic, but I never knew she would be able to write such a heartfelt story about the hardest time in her life. \\"Losing Hazel\\" has helped me through my own grief; our 16 year old son died suddenly last October. Lynn's words reach out to all; whether you have been through a similar situation or not her story helps you be a better person."},{"rating":"2","title":"Losing Hazel is intense.","review":"Losing Hazel is intense. Lynn's pain, rage and despair touched my own wounds. I felt that I couldn't recommend this book to anyone who was too vulnerable, but I'm assured by others that vulnerability demands acknowledgment and validation; this is the perfect book to do that. By the end of the story, we see Helen as a vital light in the life of her daughter, granddaughters, and many others. We see Lynn as a reflection of that light in ways she never could have imagined.

Miller calls Christians to repent and believe again in the power promised by God through His Holy Spirit. Both leaders and lay people must reorientate their lives to \\"regular and thorough meditation on the promises of God.\\" Miller outlines many characteristics of an ingrown church and calls us to repentence using biblical principles in a contemporary manner. A suberb book for the spiritual empowerment necessary for becoming the true Chruch of Christ with a missionary character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good","review":"Barbara McGrath has done lots of books like this--simple counting books using candy or some kind of food.

Veteran travel writer Lisa Matte, a Boston-area native, is as smart as the city itself, and she brings to the book a real insider's expertise, with anecdotes and stories that perfectly illustrate Boston's quaint, colorful and sometimes quirky history. Abundant photos and maps quickly acclimate readers unfamiliar with Boston. If you're planning a trip to Beantown, get familiar with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"EYE OPENER.","review":"\\"Day of Deception\\" is brilliant. The book is an open exposee of the issues that need to be addressed in the USA. The root cause being deception. The book applies to everyone; a self-examination will tell us if we are deceived or not. There are solutions proposed, some of which I could live out. The book is for those who will take action; definitely not for faint-hearted reader. I thank God for his man of integrety and boldness whom he uses to expose a nation's deception. This book encourages and invigorates the reader to pay attention to the times and act within the limits of God's will. Fortunately, the exposure of deception in the USA emanates from love; the reading will not depress you, but tickle you..."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book shows the rapid decline of America today","review":"Thanks to John Hagee for telling us the real stories of how America is falling into moral degradation seemingly unaware. Hopefully, this book will open the eyes of all who read it and they will become determined to take our country back and re-affirm the attributes that made it the great nation it was in my youth. Hagee points out that America is still the greatest nation on the face of the earth, but we all need to look closely at the steps we as a nation are taking. I highly recommend this book to all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patriotism diguised as Christianity","review":"I don't deny that John C. Hagee is a Christian. However, in this book he seems to be focusing on the American flag more than the cross of Jesus as the symbol of his religion. He bases his ideas on all the patriotic rhetoric we've heard before -- dollar bills say \\"In God We Trust\\", the pledge of allegiance says we're \\"One Nation Under God\\", so therefore America MUST be a Christian nation, and any idea that goes against its foundations is therefore anti-Christian as well. I've never believed it, and for any other Christian who doesn't buy into the patriotic style of religion, I would recommend reading Who Speaks For God? by James Wallis. It talks about similar issues from a much more balanced point of view."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book for preschoolers","review":"This crazy combination of reality and fantasy mix to make a great story that my two preschoolers have loved since we've owned the book. My son and my daughter can easily relate to the balls that call to them to be \\"opened\\" and the mayhem that ensues.The brightly colored pictures grabbed their attention right away, but the story is what truly steals the show.

Jyuuku is a great band that plays alternative folk-rock with ska, punk, and rockabilly influences. Anyone that likes great music will love \\"Mugendai\\" or Jyuuku's first album \\"Ongaku.\\" Although all of the lyrics are in Japanese, it's a fantastic listen. My favourite tracks are \\"Boku no Uta, Anata no Uta\\" (transl. \\"My Song, Your Song\\") and \\"Subetehe\\" (transl. \\"To All\\", I think...my Japanese isn't fluent). Do buy this album and give it a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wallace Line","review":"This is a very good, very long and detailed book. About halfway through the book appears the only thing that most people remember about Wallace -- the Darwin crisis. But there is lots more to go. What a life. It is a good introduction to all sorts of Victorian concerns that I had heard about but never assimilated (the Land Question, for a start). The book is very detailed on Wallace's journeys (though we could have done with some new maps (there are pictures of ones he made). It would be a good thing to read this book in conjunction, at the very least, with Daws and Fujita's recent (and fabulous) Archipelago, about the Islands of Indonesia, which is mostly about Wallace).The author is interestingly judicious. Many pages are given over to the spiritualist cult and the debunking of it, but the author never steps in personally to say that it is all bunk or all true. He just lays out the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I thought this turner would be a good investment because of the Calphalon brand. Not impressed. Almost immediately it started almost chipping at the tip. Then I went to cook a grilled cheese and it melted to the pan! Not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This spatula melts ... even on low heat","review":"Let me start by saying that I am a big fan of Calphalon. We own a lot of their products, and we love their pots and pans. But this spatula is useless. I bought it on Amazon and it arrived promptly. But within 2 weeks it had begun to melt and fall apart. I was surprised because we don't cook that much, and we don't use excessively high heat. I ended up sending it back to Calphalon becuse they have a lifetime warranty. They sent me a new one. And now that one is falling apart.My advice: Spend a bit more money for a better quality spatula."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for a While","review":"I bought this turner because it was recommended by Cook's. It was fine for a while, but if left on a hot surface, the end melted and was no longer sharp. That happened when I left it on a cookie sheet with small cookies that I'd taken out of the oven and left to cool.I still use it for cookies, after cutting off the melted part. I was disappointed in its performance. I have the larger one (looks almost the same) made by Calphalon, and I have had no problem with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Melts too easily","review":"Apparently the 400 degree max is not enough for my needs.

Unfortunately, it does not hold up as advertised. Using the turner on a T-Fal non-stick pan on a GE electric stove where we never turn the heating dial past the number five (5), the end and side of the turner is disintegrating and fraying. Clearly, this is not \\"heat-safe silicone\\" as advertised. Nor is it \\"heat resistant to 400 degrees\\" as adveristed. Frankly, I don't think there is any silicone in it.

The Best Pleasure was released in March 1998 to commemorate 10 years of success. The songs selected are all chart-toppers, and a close listen reveals to us why this duo is one of Japan's most beloved.The album begins with orchestral music but breaks into rock after about a minute, with Love Phantom. This is one of my favourite songs on the CD, but there is plenty more good music to listen to here! Other amazing tunes include the ballad Alone, Zero, Ai no mama ni Wagamama ni Boku wa Kimi dake wo Kizu tsukenai (yep that's one title), Bad Communication (special English version for this release), Calling, and a whole lot more!Tak's guitars come through on this release even more than on the follow-up Best Treasure album.

Gordis divides the work into theme -units and provides commentary on each. He makes the ideas of 'Koheleth' clear, however paradoxical they are.For me 'Koheleth' has always been the most profound statement on human life imaginable. The man who advocates enjoying life on earth, while at the same time acknowledging the vanity of it, who rejects the world - to- come, and the justice of this world while urging our obedience to G-d gives a description and presciption of human life which it seems to me is not vanity of vanities, but instead for human beings so long as they are on this earth, eternal truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scholarly, complete","review":"Robert Gordis has written a complete, if not definitive, commentary on the Book of Ecclesiastes.

The language is dull and boring, and the writing is dry. It is very difficult to sit with it for an extended period of time. While the author attempts to address critical issues in Mexican architecture he over complicates the relevant information with the rhetoric.The noble attempt to provide dialogue with influencial authorities on the subject by way of interviews seemed tainted. This was because his questions were not open ended and were often worded in a leading manner. It was as if the author was trying to draw out the response he desired from the subject.While Burian's writing was lacking, some of the articles written by others contained in the book were more appealing."},{"rating":"2","title":"melting pot ladle- not melting ladle","review":"The ladle was larger than expected.

Plus, the introduction of the ideas is handled in such a rushed fashion that you never get to stop and like a character or absorb the concepts.Some of the individual things worked alright. Lea Hernandez and Peter David score with a fun, kabuki-sytle Punisher. Kaare Andrews' take on Spider-Man is... okay, really. Udon does nifty art for Avengers Assemble, but the story isn't up to much. Same with most of the others.Frankly, there are great Manga and superhero books out there. May I point you to the work of Miyazaki or Mark Millar's Ultimates for entertaining Manga or pure superhero reimagining?

Some projects require an actual clock while some need only a movement. There are clocks for every taste, from folksy to funky.

All the clocks are half-baked ideas you will see if you visit craft/bazaar/antique stores. Each featured clock is based on the standard timepiece (no surprises there) you're likely to find at most retail outlets which maintain a craft shelf, yet none of the ideas serves as springboards in any direction - not one of the projects even offered some previously unforeseen technique or variation of craft in the various media involved, nor use of tools.Fortunately we have a caged bird, so my copy will provide some utility prior to topping off a local landfill."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm hooked","review":"The banjo arrived double boxed and well packed.

Probably best to have a professional adjustment, but I wanted to learn myself. The neck was twisted but with a few small turns of the truss rod and all is good. I love the sound of this banjo. It has a loud, pleasant plunky tone. It has a high gloss finish on a lovely maple. The armrest is engraved with a floral pattern and the gold tone logo.

They come unclasped very easily and I often go to the barn in the morning to find entire sides of my paddock with the fence on the ground because a horse bumped it and they came undone. I have stood there and watched as the wind caused 3-4 of these insulators to come undone just from the pressure of the wind on the tape.I suppose if I lived in a place with no wind and didn't have horses that would test the fence occasionally, I would probably like them...but I will not be buying these again.

Years later, as a professor, I decided to switch from Krebs and Davies' text to this one for the greater number of examples. However, the lack of theoretical underpinning makes this book more of a fun read than an educational one. My students often thought \\"wow, thats cool\\" without understanding the significance. I also found the avoidance of mathematical models troubling. This is a trend I have seen in the most recent Ricklefs' Ecology text as well (which I no longer use).

The writer is an evolutionary biologist himself, and he makes this clear when he explicitly compares his opinions to other biologists' opinions.

Here's a big reason why: the index lacked entries not only for \\"patents\\" but for \\"intellectual property\\".For lots of companies in my part of the world (Silicon Valley) patents and other intangible rights in technology are the most important kind of intangible asset. You also can't do patent strategy without having some understanding of the constraints (and opportunities) created by patent law. If the book omits those topics, then I don't see how it can do a complete job.OTOH, if you like lots of consultant-type diagrams with platitudes about \\"customer value\\", \\"long-term value\\" \\"meeting customer needs\\" and the like, all garnished with arrows going all over heck, you might feel very comfortable with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"no value adding book","review":"All topics in this book are already covered in \\"The Strategy Focused Organisation\\". \\"Strategy Maps\\" says the same, but with five times as many words.

I have as much respect for killer guest appearances as the next guy, but you have to be able to translate that into a dope album as well. I don't think it happened here.

Guess which seat they used as an example of the worst qualities in a poor booster seat? You got it, this one. You can go on the IIHS website and see for yourself.

It is not user-friendly. We had been using Britax car seats, but I didn't want to spend as much money this time. Yet, this car seat feels so awkward and clumsy. The clasps take a lot more effort than my other car seats, and it's even difficult pulling the straps tight ~ not impossible, but it takes a lot more energy. We have another booster for my 5 year old in our other car, and I like that seat a lot more (from Costco). I don't recommend this seat at all; I wish I could get rid of it.

The entire book was choppy and poorly written. Claudia doesn't really seem to love her daughter at all. And the thought of Tiberiu and Claudia as a couple is laughable, I much prefered Lath, the Bak-Faru. I hope that the next installment in the series is better than this one. It wasn't worth the $6.99 I shelled out for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Darker Crimson","review":"Claudia Donovan is a tough cop in Crimson City, but she has a vulnerable spot, her daughter, Holly. When the girl is captured by demons, Claudia will break her own rules to join forces with a vampire, Korzha, to get her back from the demon realm. A secret Claudia never imagined knocks Claudia for a loop, and the young mother is forced to do things she finds horrible to save Holly, but do them she does. As an added complication,she finds herself caught in a nightmarish \\"love\\" triangle with a demon who loves and hates her as well as Korzha, whom she does love.** This is an unusual story. Claudia's rape is portrayed in a very disturbing manner. How she falls for Korzha is never clearly defined, and there is a large gap in the background information. If you read this book, be warned, it is a very dark story, invoking a subtle form of horror. **Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad Story","review":"I enjoy the Crimson City series - some authors more than others. I'm not bagging on Carolyn Jewel's writing style - just her plot / character movement. I gave the book 2 stars because I felt the author was completely WRONG in her choice of \\"anti-hero\\". For the first time I completely felt that the so called \\"bad guy\\" should get the girl and the \\"anti-hero\\" should drop dead.

I have loved the rest of the series, but could not get \\"into\\" this book. I found the action sequences disjointed, the jumping from one \\"nightmare\\" to another confusing. It is not until Chapter 8 that you understand where the heroine is and have an inkling of what is going on. Character introduction is particularly weak. I was also annoyed by hackneyed ploys in speech, (\\"har har\\", \\"that's need to know\\", and on and on). Though I will read the remainder of the series - I will not finish nor keep this book. Unless you are a real fan of Carolyn Jewel, this book is not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's giving me a headache!","review":"I agree with another reviewer that the heroine should have ended up with Lath instead of her vampire love interest. The book consisted of one intense action scene after another. There never seemed to be any pause in the action at all. How exhausting! The hero managed to get injured on almost every other page. I just didn't like the pace-it was too tiring. I almost needed a nap after reading this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"barf","review":"This is quite possible the worst book I've ever read. The plot is horrible, the characters shallow and there is an icky feeling that you are actually reading a bad Jerry Springer episode. The only characters I liked were the daughter and her pet. The bad guy is hate her/love her and dies way to easy. The good guy doesn't care that it was less than a day and a half since she was forced in mind if not body to \\"mate\\" with the bad guy before he \\"mates\\" with her. The whole thing ends with guess who the daddy is for her new baby. The only thing missing to make this story any more tacky is a dna test and a chair throwing fight.

To bad zero stars isn't an option!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"Seems to be where the series is taking a serious downturn. The first three books were relatively well written. This one, however, tries to go dark (think Book 4 of Harry Potter compared to the previous 3) and disturbing and achieved that with a healthy dose of confusing, mainly due to the fact that it wasn't very well written but also because the plot was just...weird.And Carolyn Jewel apparently completely left out the fact that demons can only reproduce with their true mate (can't remember the term...). It really bugs me when people change recognized facts in a series simply to suit their (so-called) plot.I'm still reading the series since each book is written by a different author, so I can't judge the entire series by this one bomb."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"owned littermate before and what a difference. there is no mess under cache, thethe tines don't get clogged, there is no odor and my cat took right to it. refillsare pretty big to store, and a little expensive, but do last almost a month.it came right away and was packed so as not to break. easy set up. is just alittle bit bigger than littermate but so much easier to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"No...No for LARGE Cats!","review":"I love this sytem and the idea is wonderful but if you have a LARGE cat forget about it.

It deals with the hard issues of race in a very sensitive manner. After reading the book a child will understand that everyone is different, not necessarily \\"better\\" but different and that different is GOOD. This book should be on all the bookshelves in every school(children need to learn to be tolerant of one another, not hateful or envious or inferior)!!! This book is a good find."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun read","review":"This is a fun story that covers many questions that a child would ask.

The awareness of such diversity starting at a young age will prepare our children to deal better in their growing world. And we as adults must lead by example."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful children's book!","review":"Lin Fong-O'Neill writes with tenderness and grace when exploring the famous 'why' question posed so often by little ones. What child has not, at least once in their life, felt ill at ease due to a perceived difference? This book explains, in simple language, the reasons why little children feel confused by differences, and how to remedy those feelings. This brightly illustrated children's book is sure to be a winner amongst children of every race and nationality!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If it ain't broke, don't fix it!!","review":"I was disappointed to find these MP3s are mediocre rehashes and NOT the brilliant original arrangements from the film soundtrack.

I was looking to get it on CD and opted to try this version. I wish I'd listened to the other comments that said the original was better. This version seems \\"tinny\\" and empty; it lacks the richness of the original. I still prefer listening to my cassette over this CD, and I'm looking to buy a copy of the original on CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Travesty of the Original","review":"I bought this because I lost my original (and I mean ORIGINAL) in a fire. This, on the other hand, represents false advertising. It is billed as the \\"Original Motion Picture Score\\" but it is not. It's not even close. They've taken the most beautiful movie soundtrack ever recorded and destroyed it. It's difficult to listen to - it's noisy, all nuance is removed from it. This is the soundtrack as if played by some high school band. Do not buy it. Buy the original. I will. This was a mistake. There should be a disclaimer on the cover such as \\"based on the original motion picture score.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Here's how bad it is....","review":"Don't get me wrong, the score is beautiful! This recording is not great. To me, the sound is a bit brassy and tinny. Get the original recording instead, especially since you get the nice pop song from the original version of the movie. Here's evidence that this recording was thrown together hastily: The liner notes say \\"A Longstocking Tale\\" and anyone who knows anything about James Fenimore Cooper and his classic novels knows that they are \\"The LEATHERSTOCKING Tales\\". Who knows how they made that mistake but it's quite embarassing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Last of the Mistakens","review":"I always imagine the scenes with the music only to realize that the music is only good while you are watching the movie.

Elevator Music. It is particularly evident in the Promentory scene (where the emotional, harsh violin bow-strokes of Alice's dive from the mountain ledge has disappeared from this overly symphonic take).I halfway expected \\"Moon River\\" or \\"The Windmills of Your Mind\\" to play in...If you love the music the way you heard it in the movie, you will be sadly disappointed. Stick to the 1992 soundtrack already released."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Remake for Capital?","review":"The remake of the origional soundtrack was extremely dissapointing. The voicing of the insturments is incorrect. The drumming on the intro is annoying. All these elements distract me from the feeling that I get from the origional soundtrack. It is my opinion that the remake was made by a orchestra somewhere that saw an opportunity to make some money by fooling customers into thinking that they are buying the origional soundtrack. That is not uncommon in our profit obsessed culture. Don't be fooled."},{"rating":"1","title":"the original soundtrack was better","review":"This version of the soundtrack lacks the richness and depth of the original release. If you can find the first one, buy it! This one is an okay substitute but clearly of a lesser quality, sounding tinny and one-dimensional in many places. It also pulls out much of the original celtic music by Clannad and Dougie MacLean -- these are significant losses."},{"rating":"2","title":"old and fun","review":"I actually have trouble remembering what Milon's Secret Castle is like since it's been 10 years since I last played it.

I never got very far, but after I'd die I would keep coming back for more because it was always fun to see if i could discover a new area of the castle. And of course, after I'd discover a new area I'd die immediately because... SO MANY ENEMIES!!!Pretty nifty game for a great price.

Fit and finish were excellent and I actually prefer CT grip shape to those that came stock. The laser includes a recessed on/off switch at the bottom of the left side grip, so I can use the laser when I want and save the batteries when I don't. Otherwise, with the switch set to on, whenever I pick up and grip the MK9 I get a nice bright laser dot on my target.

I have been using Palm devices since the late 90's and have used various cases. This is the style that I have found most successful. The advantage of a flip style is the way that it flips around from the top and reconnects with its magnetic catch again. This creates a loop thorough which you can pass your hand resulting in a much more secure grip on the TX.The top flap has a extension that loops over the bottom of the TX to connect with the catch when closed. This protects both the face and hotsynch port. The leather is soft. The flap that covers the face of the TX has a rigid liner to protect the screen. There are various slots on the inside of the cover to hold spare memory cards and business or credit cards. I do not use these as I have read in posts to newsgroups over the years about screen damage from those cards being next to the screen.This product ships from Boxwave Corp and I received it earlier than I expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fit","review":"Case fits perfect and stays tight even after much use.

I called the Quality-built customer service number and was told by one of their reps that it was likely a poor installation with a break in the grounding.After checking the connections myself to no avail, I just decided to head over to Advanced Auto Parts, pick up a reconditioned starter, and swapped them out myself. As expected, problem solved. I should have saved myself the trouble and the cash and simply installed a reconditioned starter myself from the beginning.

Where I disagree with the current historical philosphy is that the pole shifts do not alter regional climate and thus impact civilizations. That is where this book comes in. It makes a long standing and firm argument for periodic catastrophic events. The book documents the points and theories in an enjoyable manner and is a quick and easy read.

There are more scientific and explainable reasons for everything. The great pyramid, a water pump? It would have been nearly impossible for something made of limestone to have any engineering purpose at all.

Since Kunkel self-published, his work may be lost except as preserved in Noone's book. Hats off to Noone for this alone.P.S. It's 5-21-00.

I bought it in 1997, began reading it in mid 1999, and just finished it today (July 8,2000). Obviously Noone's predictions were in error. But perhaps there were other redeeming characteristics, such as the history and philosophy surrounding the origins and purpose of the Great Pyramid. Forget it. All one gets from the text is repetitive, pseudomystical mumbo-jumbo couched in dogma and supported by multiple \\"interviews\\" with scholars and obscure references to the mysteries of the Freemasons.

Now what should that tell you about the \\"scientific\\" basis for this book? Noone is nothing but a book peddling doom-profit without any real knowledge of science. When will people stop buying and writing these ridiculous apocalyptic books. That doesn't mean there is no danger, just that books like Noones aren't worth the paper their printed on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I just see a pig fly by?","review":"Well, the world better not end because May 5 is my birthday and this might possibly spoil the party. As far as the book, nothing happened on 2/5/62 when the planets were closer to being aligned so I'm not worried. Maybe I should make up a date and write a book about the world ending that day. There is always a slight chance I could be right."},{"rating":"2","title":"As fascinating as a mystery story!","review":"I enjoyed reading this book in June, 1998, borrowed from the public library. Wanting to refer to the book again for a piece of information, I found the library's copy now soiled from use. I have ordered a copy from Amazon for my own library (even tho I discarded a few hundred books and wanted not to add more.) The book is worth reading for its scope of information and hypotheses presented in a most readable way. As with all writings, one can believe it or not, and it will cause one to think. It is entertaining reading if one is interested in the subjects covered."},{"rating":"1","title":"5-5-2000 Hides more \\"truth\\" than it shows.","review":"I've just finished reading Richard Noone's 5-5-2000. While it contains some interesting takes on the great pyramid mystery as well as info. on a shift of the earth's magnetic poles on 5-5-2000, it ended up being basically an \\"infomercial\\" recruiting folks to join up with the Freemasons. Consider yourself warned!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok but a little odd","review":"As a lover of yoga I quickly bought the first prenatal yoga video I saw the day I found out I was pregnant.I just wasn't happy with this video. I find myself stopping to fast forward through the chanting and the \\"free dance\\" part of this video much too often to get a nice rythmn going.The instuctor was much to \\"new age\\" for my taste and more over the top then I have ever encountered in previous yoga tapes and instructors.The only part I felt was helpful was the leg strenghtening exercises, but not a good enough video for those that are more experienced and looking for a better workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE HORROR","review":"Between the chanting and the music I just wanted to burn the DVD with the TV and all. I will be lucky if I can sell the DVD out to anyone.If you are into this new age yoga thing, oh be my guest! But if you are new at trying yoga exercises I recommend Leisa Hart's FitMama.Good Luck Shopping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Plain Weird","review":"I've tried all sorts of yoga and this one takes the cake for weirdness! If you are athletic and like Rodney Yee's tapes, this one is not for you. Too New Age."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate this video","review":"I do a lot of videos workouts - this has got to be one of the worst. I have a background in dance and have practiced yoga for years. I found a few of the exercises not explained well for a beginner and can potenetially hurt your lower back. I'm also not into all the chanting - I like yoga for stretching and relaxing - there are much better pre-natal yoga tapes out there that I like much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much stretching","review":"I have done some yoga and was expecting more stretching and holding poses than I felt that this video had to offer. I did enjoy the live music but the endurance portion was pointless as I've already had one baby and can't imagine slapping your hands together above your head and below your waist for 3 minutes daily would have helped me at all during labor. If you're serious about stretching , don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"When I read the reviews of this video, I decided I could put up with the mystical aspects if it was a good work out. I was dissatisfied with the work out, which doesn't seem similar to any other yoga tape I've ever seen. Granted, I'm not an expert at yoga. However, I did find many of the exercises uncomfortable, and I'm only 4 months along. In addition, the mystical bothered me more than I expected. I believe it was when the instructor said to flap my arms like an eagle to increase my magnetic field that I stopped the video and tossed it into my Salvation Army donation box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have done about a year of Iyengar and Hatha yoga and was looking for something of a high beginner/intermediate standard. This workout is NOT what I had expected. There are no asanas/poses. It is more a very low impact stretch/calisthenics routine. She talks WAY too much, as another reviewer also commented. Even with the sound down I found it annoying. Contrived and corny. I would NOT recommend this at all. If you want a 'yoga' class try Prenatal Yoga. This is a pseudo-yoga tape. If you want very easy low-impact stretches, dancing and movement then this will help you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too nutty for me","review":"This workout helped alleviate my back pain, but I still wouldn't recommend it, mainly because the wacky instructor is so distracting! She talks incessantly in a breathy voice (think Julie Hegarty in \\"Airplane\\") about the goofiest things. When she asked viewers to \\"imagine squatting in the forest 1,000 years ago\\" I had to stop exercising and laugh for a bit. Really ridiculous stuff.Plus I was disappointed that she didn't concentrate on form at all. I think a responsible instructor would give more attention to breathing techniques, alignment,and proper form to help prevent knee and back injury. Luckily, I had already taken classes with a more conventional instructor, so I knew a bit about this. Other viewers might not be so lucky.As long as I've already paid for this, I'll probably continue to use it. But I'll turn on the mute and fast forward through the goofy chanting from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wasn't into the chanting","review":"This video has provides some good excerises, but it's a little weird. I had to fast forward through the chanting and the meditation.. it was just too much for me. The instructor is a little on the new age side (she wears a turbin). Not the video for you if you don't like the radical new age stuff..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The turban has to go...","review":"This yoga video is a great one. I did it throughout my pregnancy and it sure was a workout! I never knew stretching could tire you out so much! It also showed me I'm far from flexible, but I digress. This was my very first experience with yoga, so I really didn't know what to expect. The instructor in this video is a very gentle voiced woman. I loved her tranquil demeanor. It really helped me to relax. But her chanting made me giggle. And the fact she was wearing a turban didn't help matters. But if you can get past that, this video is excellent"},{"rating":"1","title":"SNL Skit","review":"I am admittedly not that into yoga, although I am very active. I have been a bit stiff so I decided to try this yoga DVD. The instructor was hard to take seriously and I felt like I was watching a Saturday Night Live skit. I don't mean to take away from those that are very into yoga but this particular DVD was terrible. I had to struggle to make it even 25 minutes into the DVD and I finally just gave up. Unless you like cult like music and bizarre references to your relationship with your growing body and your baby this is NOT the right solution for you. I would still like to stretch more so I am going to search for a more straight forward yoga DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Choose another prenatal video","review":"The first time I watched this video, my thoughts were, \\"Give me a break!\\" That hasn't changed. It is a little too \\"new age\\" for my taste and the exercises were not to my liking. It is not a relaxing video. Instead it is repetitious with a lot of emphasis \\"exercise\\" rather than the traditional yoga poses which emphasize strength, balance, and flexibility. I recommend to potential buyers, \\"Yoga Journal's Prenatal Yoga with Shiva Rea.\\" That video is far better than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"I don't understnd why people are so spooked by the chanting, the dancing and the instructor's turban. It works on this instructor and for this routine. I love it and don't consider myself a new-agey kind of person. It's so relaxing and empowering. My back was hurting me and now I feel terrific. I love this video!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I would NOT recommend this video to any of my friends.","review":"I loved doing yoga before I got pregnant and wanted to continue after as well. I purchased this video only to be disappointed. I liked doing yoga for the physical stretching/strengthening and the mental relaxation. In my opinion, this video incorporated too much spiritual philosophy into the workout. I would prefer another video with less spirtuality and more focus on the physical benefits of the poses/exercises."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I own several pilates videos from The Method series and was looking forward to using Baby and Mom: Prenatal Yoga. I've been practicing yoga for 10 years, but knew very little about required variations during pregnancy. This tape was not helpful at all in educating me on what yoga techniques can be used or which ones need to be altered. I want to maintain my physical fitness during my pregnancy and this DVD was not physically challenging at all. Its main purpose seems to be for meditation and relaxation, however that was not possible since the instructor never stopped talking the entire session. This DVD is utterly disappointing. Unless you have very little yoga and meditation experience, save your money and buy something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense yet gentle; uplifting and energizing","review":"This is a fabulous workout that stretches one both physically and mentally. Kundalini yoga is much more aerobic than Hatha- anyone who claims you can't break a sweat practicing yoga is wrong! This is a true workout- your whole body feels stretched and more limber after this 45 minute session. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I found the instructor to have a calming and soothing presence. Her philosophy of staying calm, stress-free and treating birth as a natural process is sound and something I'm trying to focus on throughout these exciting nine months. This is an excellent tape for people who have never practiced yoga, as well as those who already practice, but are used to another form- such as Hatha. Kundalini is in some ways a more relaxed, yet more intense form of yoga. I liked the fact that I exerted myself. Another plus- the instructor concentrates on endurance exercises meant to strengthen one for labor and delivery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for ANY trimester!","review":"My earlier review (Maybe not for first trimesters, 9-4-03) has proven to be true fo the 2nd trimester, too. I haven't gotten nauseated at any other time (caveat: smelling weird things, but that's another story) except when I try to do this dumb video! I've tried to do this workout three or four times since I hit 4 months, and every time ends up a disaster. I had to lie down for an hour this last time before it went away! Not to mention the scary towel lady business. My advice: get out and walk instead of wasting your time or money on this dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"Don't get this video if you have done any form of Yoga previously. This video is very weird and useless when it comes to \\"exercising\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"a huge disappointment","review":"i was disappointed by this video. i felt that it was too \\"touchy feely,\\" without giving SPECIFIC instructions for the positions she spoke about. in other words, i felt that this wasn't a yoga class. the amature videoing of the studio didn't help and though there are a number of women in various stages of pregnancy, it is never directly pointed who is in the right posture, and who isn't. i am not new to yoga, but know that i have different concerns now that i am pregnant. quite honesly, my back ached more after the video, and i sent it back the next day."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought this video was a little too hippie-dippy.","review":"I understand that yoga is suppose to be a spiritual experience, but the video was too werid for me to sit through. If you are like me and just want great excersise without all the werid mombo-jumbo, you may want to avoid this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic way to nurture your body and tune-in to your baby","review":"I love this video! The exercises focus on stretching and strengthening by using slow, relaxed movements and breathing. The chanting allows you to clear your mind and focus on your body and your baby. If chanting isn't your thing, deep breathing can be easily substituted. This isn't a hardcore workout, but a soothing, loving way to nurture yourself and your little one. After doing this tape, I feel strong, relaxed, flexible and totally at peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Thanks.","review":"This was definitely NOT the yoga tape for me. There were very few true yoga postures, mostly chanting and flowing movements. I kept waiting for familiar yoga moves....and waiting....and waiting. I did not feel as if I got much in the way of good stretching."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're a yoga person....","review":"If you're a yoga person (Iyengar and other similar forms) looking to continue doing yoga during pregnancy, this video is not for you. It is not based on adapting traditional poses (traingle, warrior series, side angle, etc.)However, it is relaxing and has some good points to consider for labor and delivery if that's what you are looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"warning; don't arch your back like this when pregnant!!!","review":"This video is based on kundalini yoga, which is very different than what most people think of as 'yoga,' which is usually hatha yoga. There is a lot of chanting in it, too, and not really any asanas, b/c that's not what kundalini is about. (I've studies some kundalini when not pregnant.)I like the imagry the yogi presents, but her methods are very bad for pegnant bodies ... arching your back when pregnant can cause all sorts of problems (see the book Essential Exercises for the Childbearing Year, by Elizabeth Noble for more details about why arching the baby is bad during pregnancy).I just wanted to warn everyone -- BE VERY CAREFUL WITH THIS VIDEO! (or any other program that tells you to arch your back while pregnant)I did get a good sweat going, but it was hard to modify the movement not to arch my back, so I want to return the video."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Video is a Natural Childbirth Must!","review":"I credit this video (and live pre-natal yoga classes with Gurmukh in L.A.) with not needing an epidural or any pain medication for my first child's birth. Lead by the original pre-natal yoga teacher, her technique of exercise, breathing and vocalization really helps you get physically and emotionally ready for having a baby. It helped me be strong, relaxed and unafraid of the experience so I didn't fight the contractions; I rode them out. Your baby will thank you for using this video to prepare yourselves. The live acoustic music was a big plus for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"This video leaves much to be desired.","review":"I have exercised using Yoga before so this was not my first experience with it but come on, can we say light the incense bring in the finger cymbols and lets all chant! When you are pregnant you want to do something that is going to make you relax, become more pliable yet somehow energize you, this video is definitely not it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Chanting & Dancing?","review":"I've taken yoga lessons at a variety of venues in my area, I've read several books and learned a lot about the practice. Not that I'm an expert by any means, but I usually know what to expect. This was WAY out of the realm of what I expected and I was so disappointed. Her odd chanting was unnerving and the dancing around with my arms around my belly (not even a belly yet, as I'm only 5 months pregnant!) made me feel silly instead of relaxed or challenged. It was a big waste of money and I hope the bookstore will take it back when I return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just shut up and let us think.","review":"I've been doing yoga for three years. Continuing the practice through my pregnancy kept me in the best shape possible helped keep the aches and pains of pregnancy under control. I thought this tape adapted movements from the Kundalini practice well, but the teacher is a bit of a nut. Using gereralizations such as \\"scientists say\\" discredits her opinions. And frankly, she talks too much. It's impossible to concentrate with her constant yappping."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like most every aspect of yoga, you'll love this!","review":"I read some other reviews after I purchased this DVD. So I was a bit skeptical about it. But I have to say I really enjoy the entire workout. I didn't find it too difficult or too easy. I've done yoga on and off for a number of years and have always enjoyed a variety of types of yoga. The guru on this DVD uses some chanting that I hadn't done before, but I really find it quite soothing and relaxing. I would recommend this for any pregnant woman who would like a relaxing fairly simple exercise routine without the jarring workout of aerobics. It calms me and makes me feel stronger."},{"rating":"1","title":"A definite NO-NO for me","review":"I have done several prenatal classes prior to using this video. I enjoyed the classes a lot and they made me feel so good, so I want to do them at home (because it's cheaper and I can do them everyday).I tried this video, and the first time I used it, I felt slightly dizzy. The second time - I actually threw up. All that constant moving of the head makes one nauseous specially if you're pregnant. I'm already in my fourth month and I haven't had morning sickness, and since I'm in my second trimester, I don't expect to, but the movements in the video gave it to me. Also the poses are not so helpful; it's all constant moving and chanting, which is not really what I was looking for. I will try the other video which are better rated and hope that it will give me a more similar experience I had with my actual pre-natal classes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable and effective","review":"This video may not be for everyone but I'm almost seven months pregnant and I love it. If you have had some exposure to Kundalini yoga then you won't be surprised that it is not particularly similar to other yoga videos you may have tried. Gurmukh incorporates (in a soothing voice) chanting and meditation as well as some specific cardio exercises. I suffered from severe nausea for the first two trimesters and was unable to exercise, so when I finally started to feel better and was able to begin this video, I found it enormously helpful in bringing my body back in shape a bit and in relaxing me and preparing my mind/body for birth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much talking","review":"Overall, the exercises in the video are good. I enjoy the gentle stretching and moving, but she talks WAY TOO MUCH!!! It was fine the first few times I viewed the video, but hearing the same things over and over and over gets very annoying during future viewing. Now, I MUTE the TV and play a relaxing CD while doing the yoga exercises."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much music!","review":"The music was very distracting it was hard to hear or think over it. I guess I could have turned down the volume and just watched... :) I would not recommend this to a friend though.. :( :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Chanting and shrill voice make it hard to relax","review":"I was extremely disappointed in this DVD. I've done yoga from DVDs before and have never been so annoyed at the instructor as to actually stop what I was doing and fast forward through. The instructor is too out there for me...Telling me to imagine squatting in a forest to give birth while I'm squatting on the mat? Asking me to chant her name? I enjoy connecting with my body and baby but this is just too over-the-top. I can't believe this was ever marketed to the mainstream - even the editing is bad. The primal dance scene is pretty funny, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"non-functioning dvd","review":"This DVD didn't play, either in my DVD player, or my computer. Returning it was a hassle, and I was still charged for shipping. These DVDs should really be tested at the factory, or wherever they are burned, to make sure they function properly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Earthy-Crunchy","review":"I bought this dvd because I had read an article about Gurmukh and some pre-natal postures she had suggested in Shape magazine. I've done yoga on and off for several years now and thought I'd really enjoy the workout. She talks during the ENTIRE dvd, there's no chance for you to just stretch and breathe by yourself b/c you can't tune out her voice. I bought both pre-and post-natal dvd's and now really wish I hadn't. I still do the workout twice a week (I'm 5 months along) and do find I enjoy the stretching, but it really is boring and for anyone who has done yoga before, you'll find there is very little actual yoga in the sequences. I take a live pre-natal yoga class once a week and we actually do more than sway and \\"grind\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Prenatal Routine!","review":"I really enjoy this video. The exercises are clearly geared toward pregant women, and the stretches give immediate relief to the back pain and other discomforts of pregnancy, not to mention a fantastic energy boost. Please note, however, that this is not what you might expect if you're used to hatha yoga. I was an avid practitioner of hatha yoga prior to pregancy, but these poses are much better geared toward pregnant women (especially in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters) than the traditional poses in a video like Power Yoga. Also, there is a great deal of focus on the meditative side of yoga. This focus has been a turn-off for many reviewers. I admit that the chanting may make you feel silly at first, but it is very relaxing if you give it a chance. If you don't like it, don't chant! The advantages of doing the rest of the workout far outweigh the silliness you may feel from the \\"new age\\" stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"This was not a workout at all. I was so disappointed because I have truly enjoyed many Method workouts for years. It was all non-productive free body movements and chanting. I only ran the video once. I also bought Crunch Yoga Mama and Prenatal Yoga with Shiva Rea and totally loved it. Doing even half of these 2 videos was more worth while and enjoyable than running the entire method video. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This video helped me greatly.","review":"I laughed at how \\"L.A.\\" this video is, but the more spiritual aspects of it didn't bother me at all. In fact, I found that the chanting, visualization, dancing and meditation parts were ultimately as useful (if not more so) than the physical stuff. This video manages to be both relaxing and physically challenging at the same time. I was in labor for 18 hours and -- partly because of the mental and physical confidence I gained from this video -- I gave birth without any drugs or medical intervention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I have done yoga with previous video tapes but was not sure what stretches I should and should not do once I became pregnant. That is why I bought this video specifically for moms to be. I should have known when the instructor appeared wearing a turban that this video was going to be \\"out there\\". I wanted structured stretching and relaxation. This video included foreign chanting and free style stretching. You are instructed to just let your body move freely to the music. I felt I was doing some kind of tribal dance. After my first viewing and attempt at participating, I immediately went for Amazon's return policy on videos. I was disappointed to learn that for videos, once opened, can not be returned. I think I will donate this one to the local library. My husband still comments on what a waste of money this purchase was."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT YOGA!","review":"This dvd is really bad. I didn't believe the reviewers who said it was too new-agey and goofy, but I wish I did. I have no problem with the concept of new-age, or even a teacher in a turban, but my biggest complaint is that this was NOT YOGA! It's some kind of random assortment of movements (not poses) designed to \\"massage your baby.\\" I could have made this up on my own. Go for the YOGA ZONE: Postures for Pregnancy instead -- it's real yoga with careful instructions and a good (not overdone) attitude."},{"rating":"1","title":"A long, tedius workout, better for those in very good shape","review":"This workout takes nearly an hour, which is far too long for anyone who has other things going on in their life. Also, I find the postures pretty fatiguing. Instead of making me feel good, and relaxed and stretched, this video made me feel out of shape and sore. I didn't feel like the instructor really understood the challenges of moving and stretching when pregnant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very new-agey","review":"I got this as a gift from my yoga instructor and thought, \\"It must be good if she recommends it.\\" WRONG! This is a very hokey video--lots of chanting, which I'm not all that into. I'd been doing yoga for about 2 years prior to becoming pregnant for a frame of reference. Half of the stuff you do during this video isn't really yoga at all. I'm currently looking for a new prenatal yoga video..."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAY out there!","review":"I was interested in Gurmukh and her yoga style before getting pregnant, so this seemed like the perfect video to get for my prenatal workouts. I couldn't get through it even once! I found it boring, boring, boring! I'm guessing if you're a devotee of her style of yoga, the chanting, bongos and Gurmukh's breathy whispering might be enjoyable. I preferred Crunch's Yoga Mama by far. I found having a pregnant instructor was very helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too far out there for the non new ager","review":"The chanting was a bit much for me, as well as the visualization segments. They were too far out there for the average mom-to-be. In fact, my husband would laugh uncontrollably if he we to pass by the room during certain segments as they refer to a very primitive methods of birth. Definitely for the more new age/alternative life style group."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chanting...not for me.","review":"I really wanted this DVD so that I could stretch and relax my back during my pregnancy. However, I could not get past the chanting. It is just not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy.","review":"I was not at all happy with this video. The instructor seemed like a joke and all of the chanting was rediculous. I was very sore for a few days after and dont feel like most of the excercises are fit for a pregnant woman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughter is best for relaxation","review":"This DVD is not very good for Yoga, but if you want to feel better though laughter pick it up. It doesn't take long to get a good giggle going and you'll feel better about yourself in less time than it takes to complete the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Method, No Yoga","review":"I really didn't like this yoga DVD at all. I tried it a couple of times just to give it a chance. There's really no actual Yoga poses. The teacher also has you do movements that I disagree with, movements that I think if you have a bad back can injure you. Also it is a little too 'New Agey\\" for me. The teacher is dressed in a turban and long white robe which would have been fine if there was actual yoga moves involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creepy","review":"I watched for 10 minutes and I had to stop. They make you chant at the beginning as a part of the workout and it's really creepy. I was looking for a nice workout, not an introduction to a new religion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Helpful exercises drowned in silliness","review":"I was looking forward to a gentle challenge for my last month of pregnancy when I popped this video into the VCR (It was a hand-me-down tape from a friend). After losing my patience with the turban and muu-muu wearing instructor's long monologue that opens the tape I fast-forwarded until I saw the typical exercise-video setup.This was the beginning of the end for me. I resisted completely turning off the tape but couldn't help laughing as I watched some of the overly-enthusiastic participants writhing around while the instructor croons \\"Your baaaaby loves to mooooove this waaaay.\\" It made me feel ridiculous.The reason I gave it two stars is that there are a few truly useful exercises that can be learned if you can ignore the instructor, participants, and music to get to them. If you're interested in trying this video, see if you can borrow it from the local library before you spend any money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Age Non-sense","review":"I am pregnant with my first and bought this dvd along with Leslie Hartt's Fit Mama while looking for an exercise routine. I started out with Fit Mama and was having so much fun, that I didn't try this one for several weeks. Well I finally opened it and was surpised in a very bad way. The instructor is just rediculous. I skipped her intro, so I could be wrong, but she certainly doesn't appear pregnant (although most of the audience looks to be near 8 months). I will admit that I broke a sweat doing her exercises, but her ridiculous chantting and new age comments are extremely annoying. Also, I think she is probably pushing pregnant women who did not work out regularly before pregnancy a little too hard without suggestion on how they could still use her video. (Leslie recommends only doing certain chapters for instance)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely a NO-NO for me...","review":"I have done several prenatal classes prior to using this video.

I really was not into a more spiritual approach with chanting, etc.So, that said, this was just not for me. I watched it through before doing anything, as suggested. The music, chanting and tone of the instructor was a bit distracting, since I need a more direct approach to communication. I'm not a dancey kind of person, and that portion of the video was blah. I was also not always exactly sure of the correct positions, and since all of the women did it a little differently, they were more confusing than helpful. I did appreciate that all of the women were real-life people (read-normal).I have now ordered a tape that received great reviews and seems to be more what I would like. I wish I had checked out the reviews of this tape before purchasing, it would have saved a lot of money. Oh well, you live and learn!"},{"rating":"1","title":"wacked out yoga, not a workout at all","review":"me and my unborn cannot stand this video.

In my sister's own words, \\"Oh Annie, the yoga video turned out to be absolutely awful. Too bad. The yoga \\"teacher\\" appeared to be a total head case, having the students chant her name and wave around in the wind like we are trees in a forest with our babies! Really bad!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"WAY out there!","review":"I was interested in Gurmukh and her yoga style before getting pregnant, so this seemed like the perfect video to get for my prenatal workouts. I couldn't get through it even once! I found it boring, boring, boring! I'm guessing if you're a devotee of her style of yoga, the chanting, bongos and Gurmukh's breathy whispering might be enjoyable. I preferred Crunch's Yoga Mama by far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scary Towel Lady Yoga","review":"I'm going to have to give this DVD an F. I was looking for a yoga video that would provide a workout with some relaxing music, not some turban headed new age woman's opinion of what I should be doing while I was pregnant. I have used other yoga videos in the past, and I was so underwhelmed with this video that I only watched it once, and I'm sorry that I had my mother waste her money to purchase it. I would have returned it if I could, but the store would not allow it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This loony tape isn't yoga!","review":"There is chanting (the instructor sounds like a banshee), dancing and flapping of the arms but not much real yoga.If you want to do prenatal yoga, try Crunch's 'Yoga Mama' or Living Arts' 'Prenatal Yoga.' I purchased them after buying (and laughing at) 'The Method' tape."},{"rating":"1","title":"a waste of money","review":"I totally agree with the previous reviewer. The singing/chanting was totally distracting and bizarre. And I didn't think the stretching and exercises were all that great. I expected a better workout rather than free-form belly-dancing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad you can't use the mute button","review":"I have no yoga experience, but did Pilates before my pregnancy. I found the exercises wonderful. They were a little challenging at first, and continued to feel good as I did them more. I skipped the chanting from the very beginning, and didn't mind listening to the leader at first. After just a few times, however, she started to really annoy me. She doesn't shut up the entire time! I found that very distracting. I'll still use the disk when I need an easy workout, but I don't really like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Was confident during delivery","review":"Orginally when I started in my 7 month I thought it was a bit new agey and did only certain parts. I than thought I would try all sections and I am glad I did- I found that if you allow yourself to loosen up the intructor has many words of wisdom that I took with me during my labor. I found the endurance section the most powerful and being my first child my labor was under 8 hrs with less than 20 minutes of pushing- Forget the lamaze breathing- This tape gives you relaxing techniques along with strengh- I was not in any type of shape and I did this tape 3 to 4 times a week up to the day of labor.I can only think with the strengh, flexibility and mental training that my labor was as quick. I also felt it helped with recovery and I look forward to doing Baby and Me yoga- postnatal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great preparation for Natural Childbirth","review":"I enjoyed this video immensely. As someone who used to teach yoga, it is not as strenuous as I would have normally liked, but it was great preparation for natural childbirth. The instructor was calming, supportive, and focused on centering yourself with in pregnancy and labor. It is a bit on the \\"New-Agey\\" side (begins and ends with chanting), which was good for me. I liked it so much I am buying the post-natal video that the instructor, Gurmukh Kaur Khalsa, also made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for labor prep","review":"Kinda silly looking as I guess it's \\"look\\" is quite outdated now. But this video is wonderful. It's very gentle and easy but felt great when I was 7 months and beyond during my pregnancy. I feel it's focus is much more towards preparing and opening a woman's body for birth rather than a typical yoga workout.Retrospectively, it was this video and all the yogic philosophy that goes along with it that allowed me to birth naturally."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"out there\\", but good","review":"I definitely agree that this video is a little bit \\"out there\\". The woman leading it wears a turban, there is chanting, there is a \\"free form\\" section. However, for someone who has never done yoga before, I found it to be an easy-to-follow, enjoyable workout. I tried other videos and the aerobics got my feet all twisted and the other yoga videos were too structured for someone who didn't know any poses. If you are looking specifically for pregnancy yoga poses and already know some yoga, this might not be the video for you. If you're looking for a fun, relaxing workout, this could be it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing like regular yoga","review":"This is an okay workout, and I enjoyed seeing the blissful and beatific looking pregnant women (especially since I haven't been feeling too blissful or beatific so far). But it's nothing like the hatha yoga I'm used to; hardly anything on this tape is recognizable to me as yoga, based on the yoga classes I've taken. And although I thought I'd enjoy the chanting (because I did enjoy it in a yoga class where we used to chant at the end), I actually found it silly and annoying. Plus, I found the instructor's silly-looking turban and \\"zoned-out\\" manner distracting.ZenMama with Rainbeau Mars: Prenatal Yoga Workoutis much less flaky and more like normal yoga, and is also good because it shows modifications for all three trimesters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe not for first trimesters....","review":"I've done lots of pilates and dance pre-pregnancy, but this is my first experience with yoga. I thought it would be a good, stretching, low-intensity workout, and it would--if it didn't make me nauseous every time. I haven't had much m/s overall, except when I try to do these moves! Too much rocking and circling. The chanting I found a little annoying (maybe it's just her voice), so I fast forward through that. I think I'll try to pick it up again when I'm feeling more sea-worthy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get past the chanting","review":"Okay, maybe I was just unaware of what Yoga was, but I watched five minutes, the chanting bugged the heck out of me and I never put the tape in the VCR again. I finally gave the tape to Goodwill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too easy!","review":"I am NOT a yoga guru, but am an active person who wants to stay in shape during my pregnancy. I just started taking yoga classes once I found out I was pregnant, and have really enjoyed them. I bought this video looking for an \\"at home\\" alternative workout for days when I could not make it to my local yoga center for classes. This regimen was just too easy! I never felt like I had gotten a really good workout when it was over. Plus, the chanting was distracting, and I felt silly doing it. This was a disappointing purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst video I have ever seen","review":"I could not relax or meditate because the instructor talked throughout the entire video. She did not clearly explain the poses and the chanting was thoroughly disturbing..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A compelling bio of one of Hollywood's most fascinating men","review":"This bio of Billy Wilder is a totally fascinating one, filled with both world and cinematic history. Billy Wilder, a Polish Jew, proves to be a man of unique intuition and fast thinking as he rises from the ranks of stringer journalist to screenwriter in pre-World War II Europe, escapes the Nazis, gets a U.S. resident visa and, without speaking English, is hired to write for the movies. The author beautifully captures the ambiance of pre-war Europe and a Hollywood filled with emigres. Ultimately, the book left me sad, as Wilder ages, his friends die one by one, and he is unable to keep up with the times in terms of the types of properties to which he's attracted, how Hollywood works, and what the public wants. However, there is no denying his fantastic track record, his six Oscars, and the amazing legacy of brilliance he left behind. The rollercoaster ride of Wilder's life is well chronicled in this very satisfying, thought-provoking book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reading about a remarkable character and his work","review":"A large book tracking Wilder from Vienna to Hollywood through most of the century. When I finished I wished there were more of it it read so well - though there probably wasn't much more to write about. A good thing about unauthorized biographies is that one has to dig and dig to come up with the material rather than kind of ghost someone's memoirs. And like all good biographies this encompasses a lot more than Wilder - Hollywood at its grandiest and gaudiest. I never cared much for his movies and, after reading the book, of him but he's a fasinating subject and Sikov does a terrific job. I gave it 4 stars because 5 star biographies always seem to blend into fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"There were printing and binding errors, considering the cost this should not be.

Apparently they had the same info. as the product page, and verified it was a 6-pack. When the package arrived, there was only one plate! I called customer service and a very nice person fixed everything. She refunded the price and said to keep the plate (thank goodness I don't have to pack it up and return it).

Each plate should cost between $2 and $3 dollars (check other vendors not affiliated with Amazon!) and NOT $11.99. When Amazon itself fills this order, they COUNT each individual plate and sell it to you at $11.99.

There was nothing wrong with the product. This was a problem with Amazon that they had previously been made aware of and apparently they have done nothing to correct the way they fill their orders. This lends to an unpleasant shopping experience, and I have found these dishes at a competitors site where I can purchase them in sets. Read the advertisements carefully at Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plates are great.. but be careful of buying from Amazon.","review":"My husband bought me these plates for Christmas and I love them. They are perfect for downsizing your portions!Now, about Amazon and these plates. We read the other reviews about them not listing them properly or sending the right number of plates. So, we very carefully read the description. These are usually sold in lots of 6 and the weight of the product is 4 pounds leading you to believe that all 6 plates are in the box. The price also indicates multiple plates in the box... who would pay $24 for one Corelle plate? Guess what... we got 1 plate in a box! Needless to say, they went back and we ordered from another supplier. Amazon gave us no hassles, but really, after all the bad press you'd think they would fix it! I just checked and they seem to have stopped selling them in house.Best of luck and try the Ace Hardware link. They shipped quickly and we got all the plates we ordered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Correlle 8.5 inch luncheon plate","review":"I do love the Corelle plates. These plates aren't the same size as the smaller plates included in the 16 piece Corelle Set. They are actually a nice size inbetween the dinner plate and salad plates(?) included in the starter set.

Hey, I remember that song when I played it, I heard it at a hotel in Cancun and that's awesome. In my words, buy this album or keep on goin with the series but do not buy the Wild Nights but if you like them then that's ok. There not my favorites. My other advice:If your a huge DJ and ya gotta get some good techno music, buy Wild Vol. 8 and if your not a DJ, then keep on dancing with these club classics for forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great introduction to BFF","review":"I bought this as an impulse purchase at a brick-and-mortar store. I'd only heard a handful of BF/F songs before, and it was a decent price, so I figured what the heck. It's a DVD that will make you get up and dance (just try to sit still during \\"Kate\\"), and make you sit down and zone while lyrics spin around your head (\\"Brick\\"). This DVD converted me--I'm now slowly creating a BF/F CD collection, and tell anyone who'll listen to check it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Ben Folds Live instead","review":"I bought this DVD on the strength of the new 2002 Ben Folds Live CD/DVD (Ben solo). West 54th was made in 1996 I believe, and all I can say is what a difference 6 years make! On W 54th Street Ben seems tentative with his keyboard playing and is somewhat nervouse throughout. He also is constantly looking at his bandmates to cue them as if they have not rehearsed enough. On BFL, he's awesome.. totally in control and displays his keyboard talent to such a greater degree. On W 54th street on a few of the tunes they try to do a hip hop/ rap beat which just falls flat. I know many fans would disagree, but BF did the right thing in firing the band."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the first time I've ever bought anything by BFF","review":"This perfomance of Ben Folds Five really made a fan out of me, It is truly amazing how many differen't musical styles and sounds that can come out of only three musicians live. I must admit I was only familiar with the song \\"Brick\\" but that was enough of a reason to buy this DVD and give it a chance and to my surprise every song on here is AWESOME! the picture and sound quality is perfect and the performance is enough to make an instant fan out of anyone. So if you're into Rock, Jazz, Polka or whatever, this one is a MUST!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ahhhh, the memories.","review":"I am purchasing this DVD for the second time, as it somehow got lost during my last move.

It has even more special meaning to me as it brings back such a fantastic memory. buy it !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but ...","review":"I love Ben Folds Five so obviously I love this DVD.BUT: I have found the same thing as one of the previous reviewers - on some songs there is a slight (but annoying) delay between sound and picture. It's probably not a coincidence that, like the other person who saw this problem, I'm in Australia.

Highlights: \\"The Last Polka\\", \\"Song for the Dumped\\", \\"One Angrey Dwarf and 200 Solemn Faces\\", \\"She Don't USe Jelly\\". It is great. The \\"Spare Reel\\" is also quite good, andqute funny.

The song selection is perfect (I was never crazy about the Reinhold Messner album) and the sound and video is exquisite. The Spare Reels extras are a little grainy but it takes nothing away from the performances. The trio was dead on sharp for the taping: harmonies perfect, instrumentation tight, just an awesome show. To paraphrase the Sessions' host, if you've heard BFF you're already a fan, if you haven't, after seeing this you will be. Now, if only Ben Folds would come down to Florida on his current tour, all would be right with the world!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's Maxi?","review":"After listening to and finally realizing it is MUZAK and not MUSIC, I was a little bothered but listened to it anyway.

Similar items include Black and White (which was good but a bit too greasy for my liking), Dax (far too industrial), American Crew (waste of time and money) etc etc etc. Murray's has fantastic hold even if you add a pea sized amount. Which is what I would advise. If you want your hair to be greasy, buy American Crew. Don't pile in Murray's as your hair will become stiff like action figure hair. If you want a hairstyle with lift and hold, but with a more natural look, go for Murray's. Unless I find some huge flaw, I don't think I'll turn back.P.S. Murray's has stayed unchanged since 1925.

I love the track Accidently In Love by the Counting Crows. It is a great playful song, and it is one of their best in a long time. I also enjoyed the duet by Eddie Murphy and Antonio Banderas Livin La Vida Loca. It is a very funny version of the Ricky Martin hit. I think their voices sound pretty good together too. Butterfly Boucher does a great job singing the David Bowie classic Changes. Her version sounds more upbeat than the original to be honest. Little Drop of Poison is a good song to do tango dance to. Funkytown is a good classic dance song and a nice addition to this soundtrack. I love Jennifer Saunder's voice. Her delivery on the song Holding Out for a Hero is so great. People Aint No good by Nick Cave is a pleasant song to listen to. His deep voice sounds sexy. Shrek 2 has a great variety of songs on it. I enjoyed it very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool collection Shrek or no Shrek","review":"I have to say that I liked this collection very much. It's not enough to top the first Shrek soundtrack though, that one's better. However, the cd has some of the most important songs used in the movie and the collection's diverse enough to be enjoyed whether you're a fan of the big green ogre or not. I liked Shrek well enough but am not crazy about him. The cd however plays regularly on my car. I especially like some of the older songs on it (\\"Accidentally in Love\\" is cute and cool but dangerously close to being overplayed) but enjoy it all. It's actually one of the few cd's that I can play in its entirety without skipping over any songs. If you liked the movie, you'll like these songs reminding you of your favorite parts of it but even my boyfriend who hates all thigns Shrek liked it too so that made me believe this really is for everyone.So just give it a little try, borrow it first if you're not too sure, I think anyone can like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun cd!","review":"this cd is a lot of fun, the songs are great! the fairy godmother song is hilarious, even more so in the movie. however, i wish that rockin the suburbs by ben folds was on this cd, as it was in one of the commercials, but it has some curses in it so i can see why it isnt. great movie with a great soundtrack!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worse Music than the first movie","review":"I liked the sound track for the first movie a lot better (the songs were better).

All the tracks are different genres, ranging from funk to rock. It contains some excellently written material but also some tracks which the writers can't really be proud of. However they do well in the film and would fit in at a disco.Overall, i would say that it is worth bying just for the last 3 songs (Fairy Godmother Song, Livin' La Vida Loca and Holding On For A Hero) as they are by far the best from the film. In general a very good soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry - this book sucked","review":"I bought AN ALIEN LIGHT by Nancy Kress because she mentioned it in one of her How-To-Write books.I love Sci-Fi, so I thought I would learn a thing or two from this book.

Esto le da al disco una increible disposicion para el baile.Los metales tocan melodias en un estilo que recuerda a maestros del pasado como Tito Puente, y al fin al cabo terminan sonando como si los metieron en una maquina del tiempo en 1970 y salieron en el an~o 2000.Otra cosa que me gusto es que en estos dias de tantos grupos copiando exitos del pasado(spanish harlem orquestra, sonora carruseles, y miami's band), las canciones en este disco son originales."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont buy this mattress","review":"Don't buy this mattress.

The bottom has an outer ridge all the way around that is 8 inches wide and is 3 to 4 inches in depth which makes the center portion of the bottom hollow.

It has all the elements we love to watch...sports, coming of age stories, humor, sadness, interpersonal struggles and romance. I loved this season in particular because many of the favorites from the early seasons return to Dillon and provide the viewers with a sense that you know \\"where they are now\\" and how they'll turn out as adults.

Its a really good workout - you are definitly sweating by the end of it. But the instructor does quite a bit of new agey stuff [which I fast forwarded through] and she gets a little annoying. As mentioned previously, my baby did not like the workout part [being used as a weight, etc]. However, she *really loved* the 'baby yoga' and massage towards the end and we enjoyed that together frequently. I think it was really great for her. She also liked watching the other babies on the tape, which I thought was cute, too. I ended up doing this workout mostly while my baby was napping though. I think this is a good way to get in shape after delivery, but you have to kind of ignore the instructor at times and fast forward through parts that aren't working for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money and time","review":"To begin with the instructor did not even have a baby with her. You are suppose to do yoga with your baby next to you for the most part. You are to perform the postitions around your baby. When I went from the triangle to the cobra, my baby grabbed my hair. When I lifted her overhead, she drooled on me. When I rocked on my back with her between my legs, I almost bonked her. At the end you are suppose to walk around the room holding your baby. I can do that while I do housework. This video is goofy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Money","review":"What a waste of money! The introduction was a waste of time to listen to and it didn't get any better after that. I thought I could do some Yoga with my baby, but that was only for a couple of minutes. My baby was lying down most of the time, like all the babies in the video, since there wasn't much techniques to incorporate them. I can't stand the instructor's voice, which sounded like a nagging tone. The session ends with everybody holding their babies and moving around and she calls it dancing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Great Yoga","review":"I am sure if you just want a pregnancy or post natal workout that these are fine.

Most of the poses she offers are things that can't (or shouldn't) be done holding a baby, and she doesn't even bother to suggest how one can incorporate the child in the routine. On second thought, it should be called \\"Mommy ignores crying baby while doing yoga.\\" Terrible, terrible video. Shame on this company for trying to market it as a mommy and me offer - aren't new moms subjected to enough marketing ploys??"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you are a student of yoga-don't bother","review":"I took prenatal yoga at a studio through my entire pregnancy. It was the greatest thing ever and prepared me for a beautiful easy labor and birth. This on the other hand was a waste of money. I wanted something to do with my child along the same lines as when she was in the womb. The instructor on the video was incredibly annoying. I have had spiritual yoga teachers with very relaxed voices before, but she must have been hitting the hooka with Mary Jane if you know what I mean. Also, her style of yoga was more about repetitive movement versus breathing through your pose and letting breath bring you to your goal. If you have taken a yoga class before, you may not enjoy this at all. If you don't like people who talk like they are high, you may not enjoy this video either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby & Mom Postnatal Yoga","review":"A little slow to take off, the instructor's voice is boring and a little creepy.

To get it to synchronize is very hit or miss - if you dock the phone and hold it it at the right angle steadily for a few minutes, if the wind is blowing the right way, and the stars are aligned correctly etc. etc. it may sync ok. I've found slipping a couple of business cards behind the phone in the cradle sometimes allows it to stay connected properly so it can sync.But it does work fine as a desktop charger and the charging of the spare battery is a good feature for those of us on the go all day who need the back-up battery handy so it gets a star for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Charger GREAT battier HORRIBLE","review":"The charger/sync cradle is really nice and works great.

Also, a lot of the diagrams are meaningless, and it seemed to me a lot of the times they were here only to make the book thicker.

There are many weaves that Mr. Goodhue covers that are not covered anywhere else. This is a personal collection of patterns, stitches, and weaves that he's collected through the years.

I treat it like a one-on-one teacher, going through each technique at a time and testing myself by completing a project on my own without looking at directions, then I move on to the next.

Admirable from all standpoint. Fortunately for us, in the second half of the century XX there was a sudden interest about his musical legacy, that allowed to many ensembles as this fabulous and relatively recent (1979), or Andrew Parrot soloists have made possible the rediscover of such appreciated and many times forgotten gems of this Period.Perfect tonal balance and aristocrat musicality characterize this excellent ensemble.

It gives a rich sense of who those people were then and what they became in later years. It also gives a good feel for what was and wasn't changed by that famous summer project. It's also a good book for anyone who's thinking about creating a politically inclined grass roots school from scratch. It's honest, well observed, practical in many ways. A good historical reading for anyone interested in grass roots community work in general. Also a good reflection piece for people who want to think about what education's all about.

I love historical romance and I thought this might be too frivolous. Boy was I wrong! Ms. Wynn was able to tell a delightful tale about a female elf trying to seduce a human male to win a dare by her elfin brother. Well known for their beauty, this elfin maid embarks on this adventure, certain that she will win the man's heart, but unaware that she will lose her own. The characters are well developed(and surprisingly believable!) and the story line is very interesting, yet it is a quick-read just right for the holidays. What could have been a silly story is in fact a heartwarming tale full of humour, adventure and romance. I recommend this book for anyone who enjoys a light-hearted, entertaining tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basic guide for single, divorced, and married individuals.","review":"Upon reading this book I found the author inter-twined the holy writings of the Baha'i Faith with the point being made.

Would be great for a group study and/or presentation."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite magazine!!","review":"I've been a subscriber since the magazine debuted and have always looked forward to it's arrival. Articles are submitted by some of the top names in Egyptology and are both factually strong and immensely readable.

Not only is there a lot of \\"fluff\\", but the author frequently presents the results of studies in such simplified terms, that it would be easy to draw the wrong conclusions (and conclusions which might be sexist, racist, classist, etc) from the information. There are also little \\"observation quizzes\\" and \\"things to think about\\" listed in the margins which were so subjective or irrelevant that I found them insulting. My favorite was a comment on breastfeeding, when the author suggested it was a good idea because it was less stressful on fathers, especially at night! I had to look back at the cover of my book to double-check that it was really written by a woman! That's just one example among many that I found very insulting in the book.

I just got this cd in the mail yesterday and I cannot stop listening to it! Many songs take you into a dreamy jazz world with Leonor's voice as your guide. It can be playful, smokey and meloncholy all at once. Sometimes I swear I can hear the scotch hit the ice in the glasses in the background of some of the songs.

The label try to calificate that like something very alternative and even jazz, but... Being honest, they are copying of Fiona Apple work. See now, they release a new record called Automatic Imperfection, and Fiona Extraordinary Machine...Well, in the other hand the cd is a good work, correct made, with songs quite good as Madness who inspiress me to drive crazy along a road... There are another songs that are quite beautiful, even one that's close to Tim Burton's universe.If you like Fiona, probably you like this... But Leonor Watling not sings so well as Fiona."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived plot points, too long-winded","review":"I was really disappointed in this book. I found many of the plot points contrived (out of the blue, Tallasee just HAPPENS to have a friend in the attorney general's office!), and too much of what we learn about the BIG MYSTERY we have to learn by way of explanation as opposed to action. Similarly, the author relies too much on digression and background information to form his characters and to explain their motivations. The end result is that I felt distanced from the characters and the plot, such that it was difficult for me to care about what happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"compressed disc plays at too fast a speed","review":"great to have lone on dvd at all but this dvd is obviously compressed to some degree because everything moves unnaturally fast. lone speaks too fast. it's not you're not getting the real show. it's compressed at a rate of 130% or something. the episodes open with the full song, the middle ones open with like an abbreviated opening (which is ok because we watch more than one) and don't close with the ending song until the end of the disc so that the episodes average out to 23.5 minutes each so i am thinking for a show from back then it has to be sped up so they could fit more eps on a disc. don't know what disc is better yet, really. the one from cracker barrel i think i remember might be better. the hopalong cassidy volumes don't seem to be so bad. anybody know of a better not compressed lone ranger disc than this one? will post to a discussion on here when i get a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Family Entertainment","review":"We enjoy clean movies, and particularly those that portray the correct role models for our children.

It will pay for itself many times over!"},{"rating":"2","title":"almost perfect","review":"I really like the speaker's styling. They are very compact and sturdy as well as being very easy to carry. The 9-volt international adapter with a folding plug is a very nice addition. I don't have a major problem with the sound quality. High notes at loud volumes may vibrate a little. Bass reproduction is weak. But speakers deliver a clear, sharp sound even if it lacks depth. I'd pay more for portable speakers that delivered a more robust sound, and it's a little surprising that Sony and other manufactures aren't offering a richer line. You would think with all the minidisk, Ipods, and other portable devices on the market there would be better options."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a dandy little set of speakers","review":"I am not a techie person, so I was guided to buy these speakers based on what some of the other reviewers have said.

Perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound quality","review":"I may have received a damaged unit. But I find the sound quality awful (I use it with an iPod).

These speakers are discounted at Amazon making it a superior choice over the Sonys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Travel Speakers","review":"While I haven't compared these to other travel speakers, I can compare them to your average PC speaker, and there they compare very, very well, and yet are considerably lighter and more portable. I have used them traveling for my laptop, for a CD player, an MP3 player, and even the Yamaha Silent String travel guitar. For all of these uses these are great speakers. Of course they should not be compared to full size Boze speakers or high-end headphones, but for the purpose of a portable speaker they are outstanding. As noted, the speakers have their own carrying bag and the AC power supply works for European power. I wanted something to provide good sound on the road and these definitely are the ticket for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have Speakers, Will Travel","review":"The size of these fold up speakers is great for travelling and they offer plenty of sound for presentations in small to mid sized conference rooms as needed.

I cannot believe I paid almost $30 for this home video! It is shot in her home with a tarp behind her, she seems nervous and unsure of what to do. There are multiple people talking in the background. I did feel like I could cut bangs after watching it but as for doing a real hair cut... no. I have two boys with short hair, so watching a demo on a long haired little boy was not beneficial.

Although you may not need to read every one of the 35 chapters, you will surely get your money's worth and learn very important things you need to know. Highly recommended to anyone building a house. This book is not full of hype and presents tons of information in a no-nonsense manner that is appreciated.

If you want to learn how to install drywall, then this is not the book for you. If you want to get a general idea of how it is done, but want to learn more about specifications from an owner's perspective, then this is the book for you. Some of the best advice in the book is really in the chapters on builders (how to select them, and how to work with them).

It was,but Quentin Tarantino has a sense of humour and he doesn't keep his characters down. The bad luck that Sean Penn was experiencing just tied me up in knots. Nothing good happened in the movie. The ending was too predictable. The only good thing in the whole movie was Jennifer Lopez."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sean, I love ya honey, but this just isn't gonna cut it.","review":"Setting this movie in a dry, dead end town parallels the story of this movie perfectly.

Gut-wrenching sadistic hand-mutilation. Insanity in every direction. Is this what Hollywood really thinks small towns are like?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"It's nice to come across movies of this kind once in a while. Too much of what Hollywood produce is formulaic crap, straight off a production line.There is an weird eeriness to this movie. Penn, as one would expect is superb as the slightly less than likeable main character. Jennifer Lopez is not only stunning (what a babe!)but also a talented actress. She is convincing here as a manipulative femme fatale. One feels sorry for Penn because who wouldn't like to be manipulated by Lopez. All in all a memorable movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't miss it!","review":"I thought this was one of the greatest movies ever made. Why were people annoyed with all the camera angles? I thought it was pretty cool. I do have to admit that it started to slope down after about an hour, but picks itself right back up when Grace (Jennifer Lopez) offers Bobby (Sean Penn) to kill her husband. Very intense near the ending when they get pulled over by the sherrief and all sorts of crazy things start happening. Very twisted and sick ending, but I like that in a movie. Best money I ever spent and even if you don't like the actors in this movie, you'll like the movie, I gurrantee it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It starts off great! What happened?","review":"First 3/4 hour: 4 Stars Middle: 3 Stars End: 2 Stars.U Turn gets off to a great start. A guy's car breaks down in the middle of a hick town and he has to try to get out. When he's meeting hicks in the town, it's hilarious. But then it suddenly starts getting silly and feels like they were making it up as they went. But gripes aside, Claire Danes is very funny as the local moron."},{"rating":"1","title":"How long can this go on?!","review":"One expects self-righteous, pretentious, holier-than-thou from Stone. What one doesn't expect is sheer, torturous boredom. This movie never ends. You'll know how it will end very soon into the movie. Unfortunately Stone feels it necessary to use the Chinese water torture on his audience and make them slowly suffer. I give it one star because I can't rate it lower and because Nolte and Billy Bob Thorton give amusing turns."},{"rating":"1","title":"More depressing than a British train","review":"Some films, they're depressing and miserable, but you can see that they're good and enjoy them on this level. This one, however, is just so full of despair and misery that the rest of it is irrelevant. I came away from it wondering why I just wasted a couple of hours of my life on it. Even Jennifer Lopez in skimpy costumes does nothing to lift the flagging spirits. Never watch this film if you're miserable to start with; it could just push you over the edge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oliver Sone is a druged up hippie!!!!!","review":"The guy from Australlia who reveiwed this was right!!!!!!

The camera was shaky all the way through. I tought it was stupid that Jennifer Lopez was having sex with her own father, and her acting was and still is corny. Plus, she shows of her breasts in that movie, which is totally sick, and unrolemodelish. Claire Dane's character was funny, and I found it funny that everytime that man kept trying to get away, something else would happen, and he would have to start all over again.The end was awful, and you see that everything that happen in the movie just kept going in circles. I thought that was pretty funny. All in all, do not go see this movie. It is stupid, and really makes no sense. Plus, they kept playing all this weird Indian music that was really creepy.What a blah movie, with such good actors, too. What a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Illegal \\"U-Turn\\"","review":"\\"How come Patsy Cline don't make no more records?\\" That's a tough one. Bobby Cooper's (Sean Penn) car breaks down in an Arizona town and he meets the weirdest people. A blind Indian (Jon Voight), a fat, extremely greasy mechanic (Billy Bob Thornton), a goofy sheriff (Powers Boothe), a dumb-as-a-doorknob girl (Claire Danes), her boyfriend (Joaquin Phoenix), a mystery woman in a red dress (Jennifer Lopez) and a moldy old man (Nick Nolte). There are too many characters and nobody to care about. A murder plot devises and incest happens. This is a diseased movie. Going to the morgue is more pleasant compared to watching this Oliver Stone mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"STAND UP OR I'LL BEAT YOU WHERE YOU SIT!","review":"Oliver Stone has crafted an amazing, dark, atmospheric, visual head trip. Where to begin? You have GREAT music, performances by Billy Bob, Sean Penn, Joaquin Phoenix (in one of his FEW good roles), and Claire Danes. Superb choices in location as well - Arizona looks dry and dangerous here. It kind of drones on in some spots, but this is definitely one that measures up well with repeated viewings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tantalisingly seedy","review":"This one has all the trimmings: a seedy, noirish atmosphere, pungent eroticism and a gripping plot. Oliver Stone's visual direction is nothing short of perfect. The treatment is expressionistic, dead-pan, sometimes gruesomely lyrical, e.g. a close-up shot of a cat mangled on the road, a woman's corpse with a laughing rictus, alternations from black-and-white to colour. The cast of cynical, hilariously irreverent characters -- played by Lopez, Nolte, Penn -- make this film one of the very best of its kind. Still, it's a film for the few, since some scenes are so bizarre that even hardened viewers won't be able to help being pleasantly shaken by them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stuck in Nowhere Arizona","review":"Excellent movie that keeps you interested until the end. Arizona views are authentic and you feel the heat and the dryness.There are lots of surprises for our anti-hero who did not expect that so much would be happening in a sleepy little desert town. The relationship between Nick Nolte and his wife is not new, but the plot works. You almost feel sorry for Sean Penn."},{"rating":"2","title":"This isn't a Film for Grandma and Grandpa!","review":"I'll just get started by saying flat out I love this movie. I mean it is one hilarious, sick, twisted and violent beast. Probably not a movie for the over 60 crowd. The performances are all top notch from Sean Penn all the way down to the cameo appearance of Bo Hopkins. And then of course the scene stealer Jon Voight in one of his best performances in years. And I also have to say Jennifer Lopez has her best role to date going the full range from sexy to sympathetic to sinister. The picture quality on the DVD is great and really puts you in the great American SouthWest. Same goes for the sound. Why are you reading this when you should be buying this truly unique film experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"totaly werid","review":"This Movie is in some parts....funny (TNT), Sad(Lopez's story), Sexy (just Lopez), mad (the twisted events that happen to these peoeple)....and overall I think it's STRANGE, and it realy gets you thinking and wandering....."},{"rating":"1","title":"I must have missed the point","review":"U-Turn is bloody. It's sick, too. Even hilarious in some parts. I'll tell you what it most definitely is: dead boring. The story was established early and effectively but with a limited ensemble of off-beat but uninteresting characters my interest in this picture dissipated with each passing scene. Oliver Stone's direction of this film is nothing special. I feel he was trying to capture the dark wit of the book upon which the film's based. Sean Penn gets to mouth off some great one-liners and Nick Nolte has his moments too. 'U-Turn' is too shallow for my tastes, despite the obviously camp performances and shoddy production values. Not horrible, still watchable but not one I'll be watching again in a hurry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very powerful and suspenseful but horrible and gory","review":"Very powerful and suspenseful but horrible and gory. The plot is extremely clever and full of surprises. I would have given it three stars except that occasionally the camera is hand-held and shaky, and i always take stars off for that deplorable trick."},{"rating":"1","title":"YOU MEAN DEAD END!","review":"This was one of the worst movies of the year! The whole plot was stupid and the execution and direction made it worse. No one should be more embarrassed than Jon Voight. This is verifiable evidence of a low point in his career. Everyone else in this film should leave it off their resumes as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bad Movie Or An Excellent Dark Comedy?","review":"I enjoyed this very dark comedy, after spending many years in Superior, Arizona.Memorable local characters emerged as I viewed the imaginary ones so wellcontrived by Director Oliver Stone and portrayed by a top notch cast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stone tries to be Tarantino; fails miserably.","review":"I enjoyed approximately two minutes of this movie...the two minutes in which a talented and under-rated actor was on screen. The rest of the time, I was just waiting for Sean Penn to die."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fall from Grace","review":"A lot of Wim Wenders, quite a bit of Tarantino, and an actor and director I don't really like. I saw this just after viewing the amiable but minor comic film \\"Fled,\\" and of course U-Turn is also about fleeing, or in the case of the character very well played by Sean Penn, TRYING to flee. Plenty of U-Turns here, and most of the characters, in every case better than expected, are impressively evil. The \\"hand of the master\\" is very much in evidence, you don't want to know ANY of these people, but you can't drag your self away from them. Take it on the level of \\"Reservoir Dogs,\\" but with something of a moral tale mixed in, and you have a highly watchable, though appealingly nasty, couple of hours. Even the director, a bte noire of mine, gains a minor place in my pantheon."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst DVD in my collection","review":"This is the worst DVD in my 60+ collection. It should have been one of the best. With Oliver Stone directing, Sean Penn, Nick Nolte, Powers Boothe and the curvaceous Jennifer Lopez acting - it all sounded like a recipe for success. But the directing is aimless, the acting is b-movie, and the editing is lazy. Even jennifer Lopez is made to seem unattractive. Don't say I didn't warn you."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor, irritating imitation of \\"Red Rock West\\"","review":"I bought this film based on several critic's favorable reviews. I was very disapointed with it because: 1) the film is cut in a annoyingly jerky manner, 2) all of the characters are two-dimensional and lack any development, 3) the performances are unnecessarily over the top, and 4) all of the flashbacks are scenes we have seen already, making them completely unnecessary. I couldn't wait for this one to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Melodic rock..","review":"This Best of Glay album (Review) is great, compiling all their earlier works together. Definitely a good buy.

It is even noticeable if vibrating on a dresser! The tone feature is almost inaudible though, it's actually louder on vibrate. The band is not much but we replaced it with his preferred velcro band. It will be interesting to see how long the batteries last with this strong of a vibrate feature? The six alarms are a big plus as we needed them all.

It is about a father (Corey) and a kid named (Steven) who are poor and can't afford anything. This is a great book by the way Gary Paulson creates the plot. The father and son need some money badly. Corey's friend was also poor until he became a priest and also became very rich too. Their friend owed them a favor, so they used and got an old army tent. They went to a hotel and stole the bible a very tricky and clever way. They started in little towns and started getting money to pay needs. They are also doing this illegaly. This book is very interesting and once you get past the beginning it is very hard to put down. It is vey exciting through the beginning and the end, read it and you will find out how good it really is."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Tent","review":"I read the book The Tent. The story about finding a tent, getting money, and having church services was kind of boring. It isn't my favorite book in the world.On a scale from 1 to 5 I would probably give it a 2. I don't like it because all it does is repeat over and over again. There's never anything real exciting. It's all just the same stuff, just making church services."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!","review":"I love John Grisham novels. But none of his novels ever featured African Americans in a lead role. Simon Says can stack up against any John Grisham novel. Colleen Dixon went all the way out in writing this intriguing story. I liked the way she spared no detail in mapping out Alex's background and giving the reader a taste of what his life was like growing up in the ghetto of Washington DC. Some readers may find this part drawn out, but when you read on, it all ties in. The writer then maps out Alex's college years and finally his professional life after graduation, where things really begin to heat up. The \\"good\\" mayor of Washington DC turned out to be a great villian. I don't normally cheer for the bad guys, but this villian is a villian's villian.

I even called the manufacturer to ensure this condition. While 75% the size of a traditional keyboard, the reduced footprint is because the board does not have a keypad.

The acting as many have said is really bad. The filming isn't as good as I thought it would be. Most of the time, it looked to be like amateur was filming with his bad camcorder.If you were thinking there was going to be any nudity based on the cover, you would be wrong. I was hoping there was some. :The worse thing this movie did was at the end, the was the ending. It doesn't make much sense. There were two cops going around trying to solve a case, for this corrupt sergent. But at the end of it, the case seemed to just resolved itself and the cops just disappear completely.

Even if I was drunk, the movie still would suck. I have lost 87 minutes of my life and the only enjoyable part was watching the one male in the room suffer and beg for this movie to be turned off.

My favorite song on the whole album is \\"Wine red No Kokoro\\" and \\"Koi No Yokan\\"- (the two first songs on the cd.)The melodies lean towards meloncholic (This is why I give it four stars; I was hoping for a more upbeat album-).It has a definite 80's sound to it, which I am enjoying, and it is very easy listening. I never grew up in or lived in Japan, so my viewpoint on it is probably much different than someone who has lived in Japan.I would say it has a soft-rock/easy listening feel to it.If that is what you re looking for then this is a good cd to purchase. Overall, a good cd, glad I found it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Instrumental pot-pourri mixes too many flavors","review":"Presumably Blind Pig has more instrumental material in its catalog than what it presents here, and it might have been better to issue a couple of blues instrumental albums each with two or three tracks from each artist rather than this hodgepodge with its jarring transitions, for example from Charlie Musselwhite to Deanna Bogart, or from Chubby Carrier to Magic Slim. The recording quality varies widely. As for truth in advertising, the CD isn't as bare as it claims; the very first song includes a vocal chorus.

He is even treated to nights at the Folies Bergere, where he finds both fleeting and enduring love. The great achievement of the novel is that it is a spellbinding story which also manages to say something important abour our age, about lost love and high ambition and artistic rivalry, about the difference between striving for the greater good and striving for baser, more egotistical and ephemeral works.

I did not have any experience with Unix scripts prior to this book, after finishing it I came away with a very good understanding of the Korn Shell.Book is well written and covers the basics: command line editing, setting up your environment, up to process handling and debugging. One flaw of the book is that there is not enough examples. Also many of the examples later on in the book are built based on examples from previous chapters.

I cannot recommend this book either as an introductory tutorial or as a reference. The first problem is that topics seem to be jumbled together, so that things are hard to find and to follow. Secondly, many subjects are either not covered at all, or are given the proverbial lick and a prayer. Even worse, the indexing is terrible. I find too many cases in which important things (like dot scripts, for instance) are simply not in the index, if they are covered at all in the text. Fortunately, there are alternatives to this book which I find much more satisfactory. By far the best is \\"The Korn Shell User and Programming Manual\\", by Anatole Olczak, an Addison-Wesley publication. It's pricey (about $50), but it's well-organized, complete, and very competently indexed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Desk Reference for ksh","review":"This book is a good desk reference for the korn shell. It starts off with the basics and eventually gets to more complicated stuff. As a whole, the organization of the book leaves a little bit to be desired. However, if you know what you are looking for, it is just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Helpful Reference to KSH","review":"I found this book very helpful in learning to write scripts for the Korn Shell. I keep it on my desk all the time now, even for other shells (Bash/etc). It's an invaluable reference to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad organization and Bad explanation","review":"This book is poor organize and bad explanation. The example is not clear. Hard to understand even though, I had a unix background."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad target","review":"absolutely junk product. The size is way smaller than expected. Picture is very deceiving. Would not recommend this product to anyone"},{"rating":"1","title":"A practical start with one part missing.","review":"This is a practical book which covers key issues such as managing change (without it killing you) and how to include quality in each stage. If you have a complex realignment of the business to deliver, this is good value.However, there is NO direction as to HOW to determine the needs of the customer in terms that will fit the value/supply chain factors.The direction to do this is paramount in the book, but alas there is not much on how to find and assess customer value determinants in ways that these can fit the supply chain drivers.My PhD is on this need to retro fit customer value to a supply chain - I got a few good set up quotes but no direction as to how to make it happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book for beginers with sufficient references.","review":"It's not a bad book for beginers in Supply chain management (SCM). This book introduces you to the basic fundamental with sufficient references. Not this book or any book in the world is comprehensive or plug-in formulation. So, don't expect to buy one-but-get-million. Since this book is only 200 pages, you can finish it in one night with sufficient knowledge to do more research including some URLs for the web-surfers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The book is theoritical and does not provide new practical ideas. It reads like an implementation methodology book more than a management book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Awesome Rolling Pin","review":"I've had this rolling pin for 4 years now and just love it. I am a avid pie maker and it is the best. I am ordering another just because I dropped mine on my cement driveway during our move and chipped the ends.Enjoy your purchase, it is well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Item","review":"Nice heavy marble...pin rolls well. Has a stand for display. The only problem was the way it was packaged...one end had poked through the box and the wood handle was all smudged and dirty. I was able to remove the blemishes. Should have better packaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice heavy weight rolling pin","review":"I owned a marble pin for years before I had to replace it. This replacement does the trick. The marble is smooth and the handles sturdy. Have had this pin for a couple years and only wish the handle was made of something other than wood, because that is the part that will go first, after several washings. Wood and water don't mix. But so far, It has performed very nicely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Christian Rocker to ever walk this planet","review":"Want to hear what Christian Rock could have been if it hadn't turned into the canned music it is today? Larry Norman is the most musically gifted Christian Rocker I've ever heard. I've seen him live twice - he's a genius, alone or with his band. He does not fit a mold, does not cater to the so called \\"Christian music community\\", but is a real artist. Some songs have a strong message some are just about life and love - like it should be - without forcing a canned message into every song like most Christian Rockers do...The \\"bonus\\" tracks on this CD are corny - he obviously threw them together - don't know why, but you've got to hear his original stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Christian music should be","review":"The gospel message should never be out of date. Sadly, however, Christians let it grow stale repeating their same old slogans without making them relevant to the world today. Larry Norman does not fall into that trap. His lyrics and presentation were always relevant, edgy, and challenging. Some songs are best understood in the context of their original intent as another reviewer has so well explained. But all have a timeless aspect that makes them powerful to this day. It was Vietnam then, but the message is consistent for Iraq now. It was the loss of direction in the music business then but true of the music business today.This is one of Larry's most popular albums and a perfect place to start your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Larry Norman was not who he said he was","review":"I was very sad to read the news that Larry Norman fathered a child out of wedlock and never took care of him. That makes me feel that the music is not really coming out of a true heart. How can you do something like that and sing about Jesus?I will never buy anything else from Larry Norman again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Used as a Sunday School study book","review":"Our Sunday School class is utilizing this for our current study, so it is mostly non-seminary students using this book. While it has been very difficult to read and grasp everything (I have to underline a LOT and read and re-read), it has made for a very interesting and interactive Sunday School! It has been VERY beneficial to me personally. Unfortunately, in my years in the church, I learned more about WHO Jesus was than how I should relate to him. This is really helping me clarify that. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because it can be challenging reading. I definitely recommend it though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book of theology","review":"This book was an excellent book with a different view of approaching theology. The author makes sense in His fresh approach to understanding God and theology. I have greatly benefitted from this book both personally and academically and highly recommend it to all who are thinking of reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall great buy - perfect for home use","review":"As other reviewers have mentioned, it is quite a bit smaller than 8x8. That being said, it is an excellent substitution for renting if you only have a few small children. I'm not sure what others purchased it for, but on Oct. 6, 2008, I paid $149.99. The next morning I logged on to check shipping and saw it had been changed to $74.99! I immediately called customer service and thankfully got a very helpful man who refunded $75!!! For $75 (with free shipping and no tax), this was an unbelievable deal!We've used it only a few times, so we cannot really comment on the long-term quality, but for size, ease of use (very easy to set up/put away), and price, it is definitely a great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful","review":"I found the Y-seam method easier than traditional setting for LeMoyne stars. The instructions are pretty clear even if you're new to quilting, like me. I had to look them over twice to make sure I was doing what I was supposed to, and it worked great and is easier than it looks. I checked this book out from the library and would like a copy of my own, it really is useful. I'll have to buy her new book too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money & met the expectation","review":"I have played this game few years back and wanted to buy a new CD and have fun - this CD that I bought for 8$ (including mailing), was worth the cost and game is fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"The graphics are archaic!!","review":"This may have been a good game 5 years ago, but compared to recently released games, it is pitiful!! The graphics are terrible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Designed, Almost Perfectly Executed","review":"The CS4 represents the ideal balance between functionality, weight, and size. It contains a full set of daily-life tools along with some specialized items that can serve multiple roles depending on your personal creativity. The tool feels sturdy and comfortable in the hand, though out of the box it starts its life fairly stiff. However, day to day, you will find dozens of uses for such a well-designed companion.My only negative comment with the CS4 is the same one I have with almost all models of this style of Leatherman product line. The smaller screwdriver blades are extremely difficult to pry loose from their resting places, and when you do, they are of just the right length and sharpness that they frequently (four out of five times for me, and I'm being careful) open into the flesh of the same finger with which you're extracting the tool (right at the top joint, just beneath the fingernail)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handsome and well designed","review":"I recently purchased the 'Juice' for my 15 year old. It's a scaled down version of my indespensible 'super tool', (with some handy additions). Well designed, comfortable to use and actually quite handsome looking. The one drawback is the lack of any kind of locking devices on the blades which is my reason for a less than perfect 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"BB King","review":"This DVD helps break down the great BB King's style and riffs.

I highly recommend this seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skips on DVD","review":"I bought this DVD to use in my music classroom, and was disappointed that the first viewing came along with a few skips where I had to skip through some parts of the show. Too bad - The students were disapointed as well.This was a manufacturing problem rather than an Amazon problem. Amazon has always been reliable in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommend!","review":"This DVD gives new meaning to the word \\"percussion.\\" Having never made a live performance when STOMP was in town due to my hectic work schedule I decided to order the DVD. Certainly no substitute for the real thing but the DVD was highly enjoyable and well produced. Highly recommend!!M.A. Noel"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rhythm Beyond Words","review":"STOMP is truely a group whose talents for syncopation, timing, and rhythm are nothing short of phenomenal. The ability of the cast of STOMP to create such dynamic and wonderful sounds from mundane objects is remarkable. The range of sounds that they can extract from trashcan lids, basketballs, brooms, wooden rods, and a kitchen (yes the whole kitchen) puts them on a level with some of the greatest permormers of all time. And the rhythms that they create are so mind-bogglingly (bit of artificial word usage here) complex and perfect, that it is a wonder that a group of human beings can create something of this magnitude, without a single mistake. Anyone who has an appreciation for music, dance, and comedy should own \\"STOMP OUT LOUD!\\" Buy this DVD with all haste!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very talented people doing great rhythm.","review":"I had seen these people on shows like Mad About You. That was just a small spot. I saw their show on Arts & Entertainment chanel and was completely mesmerized and totally drawn to the T.V. These fine artists keep a beat with anything but the conventional percussion instruments.Just shows you all the different kinds of sounds an artist can get out of just ordinary objects. Love 'em. Going to see them on May 02. 1999 at Cumberland Auditorium here in Fayetteville, N.C. Can hardly wait!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Percusión al límite","review":"Impresionante mezcla de sonidos percutivos.

It is a short DVD but quite a lot is introduced in the performance. I highly recommend this DVD if you can't make it to the live show. But if you can get out, go see the show live. I think it's better than the DVD! So, either way, enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent entertainment and a great teaching tool!","review":"I used this video with my 4th and 5th grade students to illustrate how far rhythm can take you as well as how there are no boundries in music. 417 students give it a huge round of applause!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"If you can't see the actual show, this is the next best thing.

The DVD is as good and more. No one leaves the room when this is playing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I'd hoped for","review":"When I saw the Vegas show in December 2008 I was floored! I bought this DVD at the souvenir shop at Planet Hollywood expecting it to be the show I'd just seen. It's not, being exclusively NYC based, much shorter and lacking the humor and audience participation that made the show so charming. If you want a video that better represents the live show then buy the \\"Stomp Live\\" DVD, available here on Amazon for about $20 ($10 less than I paid for \\"Stomp Out Loud\\" at PH.) I just watched it and it's great! I still prefer the Vegas production which had a larger stage & cast, it seemed more lavish. Unfortunately the Vegas show has closed."},{"rating":"2","title":"What an awesome rhythmic experience for people of all ages!!","review":"This tape opens your eyes to all the places that music can be made, even with the most ordinary objects or parts of your body. The way the Stomp ensemble combines dance,theater and percussion is an experience that NO ONE should miss, not just musicians!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Entertainment!","review":"I bought this video to show students!

I would like to see this performance off broadway!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"Absolutely amazing! If you're not familiar with Stomp, it is choreographed routines using \\"found\\" percussion instruments such as broomsticks, kitchen utensils and basketballs. There is no music, just the rhythms and natural sounds of the \\"instruments\\" used. i inspired my class of Year 8s, who thought it was \\"wicked\\" and \\"cool\\". If you're not a music lover it may not be for you, but I have viewed it at least 10 times and found something I had missed with each subsequent viewing. Thoroughly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUST BUY","review":"i had the opportunity to see them performing live in kuala lumpur, malaysia on 20 sept 2005. it was an awesome show. wished that this dvd was a whole lot longer and had more of their performance.but buying and getting to keep this dvd is an added bonus since during the show, nothing was on sale except for the t-shirts, percussion sticks and souvenir programme book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trash Can Band","review":"WOW! Stomp Out Loud has to be one of the most original and entertaining films I've ever seen. Today, most of the movies coming out follow a general trend - great graphics, no movie! Stomp, however, is filled hypnotizing music done with trash cans, brooms, or anything you can think of! This is a feat in itself, but also making the film highly entertaining and suitable for people of all ages is icing on the cake! If you like great music, buy this video! You will not be disapointed! I promise!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show! Awesome skills!","review":"I only gave it four stars because of the presentation of the scenes. It was a little too scattered for my personal tastes. Progressing through the streets of New York, to the kitchens, elevators, on and off the stage, the show is interesting and the things that these people do with percussion is just amazing. Dropped my jaw from the get-go, and it nearly came off my head.Some of the scenes were unnecessary, I thought, and some weren't given the air-time I would have liked. Myself, I could have watched their entire stage-show and been entranced for as long as they went on.But it was a great buy, and I heartily recommend this to any and everyone who plays, has played instruments (real or air-based). Warning: This may leave you listening to random noises and trying to match the beat. It's pretty amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly as good as the live show","review":"After seeing this show in Las Vegas, I really wanted a video that captured the same energy and humour so that I could continue to enjoy the show as home. Sadly, this DVD doesn't come close.The energy is not there, the skits were not nearly as funny and some of the sets were distracting. I missed the simplisty of the stage and fast movement between skits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed it","review":"Good video. Thought it was going to be a taping of one of their performances, but were please to find that it was not. Made it more interesting in that there were things on the DVD that could not be done on a stage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Topology for everyone","review":"Jeffrey wrote this book with the high school student in mind, but even as a second year student in Mathematics I found this book quite informative. Most textbooks in Analysis or Topology do not give you an intuitive feel for the subject. I recommend this book for anyone taking a course in Topology, even Graduate students.This book is well written with many illustrations and exercises to help you get an intuitive understanding of 3 Dimensional manifolds. This helped me a lot in my second year Analysis class as I had an intuitive notion of manifolds taught in class.At the same time the book is easy enough for high school students who always wondered what a Mobius strip or a Klein bottle was but did not find any books on it. This book would make Topology interesting for everyone. I give it a five star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting book","review":"This is a painless way to learn some advanced topology--or at least to gain insight. It's almost a picture book. Most problems include solutions and require only a few minutes of thought. They are also worth solving.Now that I understand what is meant be a certain topology of the cosmos, I'm astounded that anybody actually considers it possible. Fascinating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kaempfert in Concert : une Archive admirable !","review":"Cette cassette vidéo offre aux adeptes du \\"Kaempfert sound\\" une chance de découvrir le Maestro aux prises avec sa propre musique.

The writing was beyond dull and seemed to deal with trivial matters that had nothing to do with understanding the characters, the plot or the overall theme. Not Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Disappointment","review":"This is the first Nicci French book I've tried. It took me every ounce of my willpower to finish it. Totally not a page-turner! I was looking for something a lot more exciting. But instead, this gave me a boring life of Jane, unnecessary/useless details, and a few pages of a murder story told by a person, not even a real-time murder. I didn't like it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not their best work","review":"I've read nearly everything that Nicci French has published and I have to say The Memory Game was so disappointing I couldn't finish it. I rarely put aside something I've started no matter how bogged down it gets. I think I only had 30 pages to go and I just didn't care how it ended. I found the main character so annoying and frankly, stupid, with her chain smoking and rambling on at her therapist's office. The Martello family was insufferable. I just didn't get it.I will say this, if you did not like Memory Game DO give Nicci French another try with one of their other books. They are great. I don't know what happened with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"For the first time ever, I stopped reading a book. Made it through 136 pages. This book is just pointless. Wish I had read all of the reviews before I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Murder - the victim being the book itself","review":"The only thing that made me finish this book was knowing that I could write a review warning others not to waste their time. This book made me cringe. It seemed as if the book was completed, and then the author decided to go back and add a meaningless adjective to every noun, in a feeble attempt to revive a literary corpse. Some innovative use of the word \\"very\\" was a real highlight. By the tenth time a character had a \\"gulp\\" of some beverage, I seriously contemplated mailing a thesaurus to the writer. As I write this review I realize that maybe I am being too harsh. But then I take a very, very, very big gulp of my icy cold refreshing drink and put it back on the smooth old mahogany desk, and light up a long thin relaxing cigarette, and have another gulp and think.... naaah."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too drawn out","review":"I have never read anything by Nicci French before and I found the book by chance roaming around a Barnes and Noble one afternoon. The synopsis really pulled me in, a mystery, bones found in the backyard, deep family secrets...I thought it would be a good read. Well I thought that before I started it obviously. I really was tired of the book about halfway through. Too many characters, too much unnecessary back story and Jane really was annoying after a while. I felt like the book was more about her divorce and fragile state of mind then what the plot was really supposed to be. I almost gave up on it half way through but decided that since I suffered through it that far I might as well finish it and find out the \\"who done it\\" at the end. The idea of the book was good but the finished product, not so great."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Look is Okie but It's not comfortable","review":"I bought this product few weeks ago, the style is okie but It's hurt my end toes...I'm thinking to return it...but I don't know they're going to accept or not b/c I'm already wear it.

The dialogue and characters are so unrealistic (not to mention unlikable). It seems like Goldsmith wrote this book in hopes of having a screenplay created...it reminded me of a \\"Waiting to exhale\\" copycat. I kept hoping the book would get better, but sadly, it got worse! Don't waste your time on this book. Goldsmith seems like she is trying to inject humor and wit into the characters, but the entire book is flat, dull, and if you liked Goldsmith's other works, you will be thoroughly disappointed. Makes me wonder if Goldsmith is running on a deadline and selling out like one of her characters in \\"Bestseller\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly and unsatisfying","review":"What begins as an interesting premise falls apart due to childish dialogue, a silly heroine, an even more annoying villainess and an arrogent, overbearing husband. There was nothing truly new, exciting or interesting. Without giving away the ending, I could only say at the end of the book \\"Who cares?\\" Don't waste your time on this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ridiculous but highly entertaining","review":"I've read 3 of Ms Goldsmith's books and so far, I've not been disappointed. Although any reasonably intelligent person would realise that the plot is rather ridiculous, the story and writing itself was extremely entertaining. I enjoyed this book thoroughly. Once in a while, you need a book like this to soften the reality of the Grishams and the Baldaccis. An enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look for the upcoming movie!","review":"While Switcharoo certainly isn't the book to choose for enlightened reading, the absurdity of its characters will keep you entertained. It reads like a screenplay, which may be the intent, given the big screen success of \\"First Wives Club.\\"It's a great way to spend a rainy Sunday, but don't look to add this one to your book club reading list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother to read this book!!","review":"First, let me say that I loved her books Young Wives and First Wives Club, but this is simply unrealitic and to suspend belief this much gives me a headache. Just say NO! and go read something else that's what I am going to do. I stopped reading halfway thru when it did not get better but took a turn for the worse. The only person I can see really liking this book is some poor misguided soul that is a \\"chick on the side\\" hoping for a storybook ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed as well","review":"I wish I had read these reviews before I bought the book - read The Bestseller and Flavor of the Month, then went out on a hunt for more Goldsmith books. I can't believe this is the same author - something is very wrong - did her editor write the other two books ( which were by the way excellent even though a bit contrived)when I got to page 100, I threw it away very sad"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I've ever read","review":"It's hard to believe that any publisher agreed to publish this book. I felt like a real jerk for buying it and actually taking the time to read the entire thing. It's got an outlandish premise and the characters are silly and shallow. A complete and utter waste of time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hilarious story!!","review":"This book hooked me on the first page. It combines humor and realism in order to give a great perspective on what can happen when a couple begins to take each other for granted in a marriage after many years of being together. In a way it was a man bashing story-one of the main characters-Bob has an extra marital affair and this story is of how his wife and his mistress get together and plan revenge. But it also gets deep into the emotional \\"mechanics\\" of how this affair came about and the effects it rendered on everyone. I would recommend it for men and women, married or single. Its an eye opener on what not to do and has a lot of insight on feelings that result when one parter strays."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money, or your time which is more valuable","review":"I would give this book a BIG ZERO STAR.. If you like Olivia Goldsmith's books please, please skip this one like the plague.. but I recommend you read her book \\"Marrying Mom\\" it is hilarious, you will smile, chuckle, guffaw and finally cry with laughter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fluff has its place...","review":"Sometimes, it's just nice to relax with a quick read and Goldsmith's target audience tends to agree. However, the most overtly annoying aspects of Goldsmith's style I find is that she takes herself too seriously and is too self-indulgent in her style. Perhaps it is the blatant didacticism which is distracting, the predictable \\"moral\\" at the end where everyone learns a lesson and everything goes on. At other times, the reader can practically hear Goldsmith gloat over sentences and passages she particularly likes. But, what author doesn't? Overall, it is charmingly quick and predictable. Jane Austen, she is NOT, she lacks the subtleties and character developments which make Austen classic literature and Goldsmith, well, best seller beach book material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, please NO MOVIE!","review":"I was extremely disappointed in this book. It was fluff, just like \\"Marrying Mom\\". It read like it was dashed off because of a deadline, not because Oliva had a great idea. It could have been so much better, however, none of the characters were engaging. I found myself wondering why? why? why? Then I wondered why I finished the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's supposed to be funny, but actually it's a sad story","review":"The funnier the author tries to be on this one, the stupider and more pathetic the book becomes. All of the characters are totally unlikeable, shallow, arrogant, and stupid. I don't think that these particular personality traits are funny, and I don't see how Ms. Goldsmith ever got this implausible, sorry book published. First Wife's Club it isn't!"},{"rating":"1","title":"O.K. but might as well wait for the movie","review":"I enjoyed \\"First Wives\\" and \\"Bestseller\\" as good beach reads but I found this one only mildly amusing.

I remember reading all sorts of classics when I was in high school about dysfunctional heroes who end up failing. This book was a pleasure to read. The only thing not dysfunctional is the soul of the teenage heroine: she lives in chaos and lawlessness; she has a handicap that she constantly needs to compensate for. Despite all that she becomes the leader and savior of a band of people.I couldn't put the book down. When I finished reading it, I felt inspired. Next to this book, The Catcher in the Rye, Lord of the Flies and Brave New World pale by comparison.

I consider her one of the world's all-time best authors. If you've never picked up a Butler book and you're into fantasy or sci fi, you're shorting yourself of a great experience. She was such a fantastic writer that the reader swears her created worlds and characters are real...somewhere, sometime. In that light, reading this book ripped me to pieces. I am tempted to say I didn't like the book because it is quite believable that this could be our future. Yet, it is superbly written. If you're prone to depression or emotional reactions to books, you might steer clear of this one and go for \\"Lilith's Brood\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is this what the future holds?","review":"Parable of the Sower is a look in to the future. Octavia E. Butler imagines a world of rampant crime and endless homelessness. Lauren, the narrator, lives in a walled neighborhood in southern California.

What is that all about? We have a destiny in the stars? I guess when the next meteor comes by, a spaceship will land and all the EARTHSEED people will board. The future Butler is predicting is only 25 years away. That means many of the people alive today will be alive then. Will most of the people really no longer know how to read? Would I not teach my children how to read even if there were bald people with painted heads around? I don't think so. Who is printing all the money they need?

An account of a young woman's journey away from the dangerous neighbourhood of her childhood, and of the perils and the people encountered in the search for a safe haven, this novel is about the triumph and resilience of the human spirit. Although I felt it would have been just as good without its religious element, reading this story was ultimately an uplifting experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasant surprise.","review":"This is very very good.

Still,its an excellent read with some material worth keeping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stranger in La La Land","review":"Not since Heinlein's Stranger in a Strange Land has a novel had such a intoxicating mixture of religion, future dystopia, and science fiction. Butler has an uncanny eye for taking our present troubles (even if the novel is a few years old) and extrapolating a realistically frightening future. The burgeoning religion philosophy of Earthseed by the protagonist, Lauren Olamina, is done skillfully and with spirtual power. I recommend the book - an excellent read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Religion, science fiction and a dreadful possible future.","review":"When I first read this amazingly gripping tale about Lauren Oya Olamina I was still a teenager, struggling with questions about religion and how dreadful the future was going to be (hey, that's what kids do these days). The effect this book had on me then, and again now that I've just reread it for the 4th time, is indiscribable..... It gave me a sense of hope, of beauty....but most importantly Lauren Olamina's words rang true to me. Aside from this brilliant fusion between religion, science fiction and this dreadful not-too-impossible future, Butler has yet again amazed me by her brilliant writing style, her wonderful descriptions and beautifully rounded characters. A must read, I've recommended it (and gave it as birthday presents) to most of my friends. Not only a terrific read, but it may affect you in a way you hadn't thought possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sowing","review":"A new book with a small remainder mark on the bottom.

Butler, this book was the first of hers I read, and it wasn't worth it. The idea is OK, but not enough to carry the book without better writing. The writing conveys action, and some thought, but not much more. The plot starts off well, becomes slightly implausable (but still able to be carried of), and then abruptly ends. I found out a couple years later that a sequel came out, and thus explains the abrupt ending that basically dumps any buildup from the plot out the window, in order to set up a sequel. Without the plot dump, it would be a decent book. With it, it's not even worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"parable of dispair","review":"this was the most depressing book in the world. luckly i didn't buy the book by choice but only as part of a book club.

I suppose the ultimate message was to keep plugging along depite the negativity, but who needs that lecture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh, never again.","review":"This is my first time reading Octavia E. Butler and it will most likely be the last; I was coerced to read this novel for one of my classes in college--unfortunately. The book falls flat and is more bland than anything else. The writing style is as follows: cause and effect, cause and effect, cause and effect. It is uninteresting and uninspiring; also, the main character, Lauren, her religion or silly \\"philosophy\\" is weak and has more of a floating effect than something that is concrete. All through the book she mumbles: \\"God is change\\", but Butler does not even attempt to go any further. I fail to realize what Lauren actually meant: oh, and the ending is horrible. Do not read this book: it's a slow read and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly depressing","review":"I have read many sad books and novels with depressing themes, but I have never read anything so terribly upsetting as this book. There is nothing positive or happy in the entire novel- NOTHING. The action described is so horrific, I actually had a nightmare about what I read. I hated this novel more than anything I've ever read. I can't think of one good thing about it and I'm typically a very fair person. I would never recommend it to anyone and I just wish I hadn't wasted my money on it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"empty","review":"I found this alternately depressing and empty, not connected enough with today's real world to be inspiring on an immediate level, yet not far-out enough to be inspiring on a far-out level.There's a lot of adolescent-like musimg about the meaning of life, which might be paraphrased as \\"God is change, that's all I know, I can't explain it any further but I know it with a passionate certainty...\\" There's too much \\"I can't explain it but I'm really really sure.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Who knew the apocalypse could be so boring?","review":"The narrative has no sense of pace. It just plods on from event to event, told in mechanical prose. We went here and this happened. Then we went there and that happened. No building of dramatic tension, little development of theme or character progression. A flat recording of events.Odd that the novel posits a new religion but draws its title and its ending quote not from the new scriptures written by the protagonist but from the Bible, which the protagonist says she doesn't believe. The chapter headings are drawn from the protagonist's new scriptures, so why isn't the novel's end-note?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good read from Butler","review":"If you have enjoyed her other novels, buy this book. I think it is one of Butler's best works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Classroom Book","review":"I've used this book for the past two years in a junior-level college course on community economic development. As an accomplished lawyer, Frug is able to quickly summarize a wide variety of literatures (from the history of cities, to history of corporate law, to post modern identity theory) and bring these diverse literatures together to tell a story about the fragmentation of the modern American city.

This album, while not saying much in funk compilation terms, is much tighter than the aforementioned 16 Corners. For one thing, it doesn't have any contemporary acts mixing in on the funk. For 2nd and 3rd things, the songs \\"Let's Do it Today\\" by The Us and \\"A Day in the Life\\" by Chocolate Snow make this a solid funk buy without much further ado - plus it's got great liner notes.A super rare James Brown era funk trip through the midwest all on one album is saying something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simplistic and painful","review":"The most unbelievable thing about this novel is the dialog.

It is essentially a collection of first hand accounts from various people of this era.Since most, if not all, of these accounts were originally in Spanish, they require translation, and that is the book's one weakness: almost all the accounts read like they were written by the same person; some of the character of the individual writers is lost.Nonetheless, this is a good book, both readable and fast-moving. It is interesting that while we know a lot about the Revolutionary era and the founding of the United States, the topics in this book - which take place on the same continent at around the same time - are almost unknown. That, in itself, makes this book a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"You don't have to be an artist to like this book","review":"This book contains many beautiful drawings that illustrate the techniques in expressing the human figure. True, it is not an instructional book in that it does not provide step-by-step instructions to arrive at an end result.

The only problem is that the plastic mold is attached to a thin cardboard base that can become flimsy if youre not careful to mind that.

Instead, they're white, tans, and browns, which of course fits better with the pendant - and looks quite nice.Second, the area around it is white - in retrospect, that's what the image above shows, but I had assumed that was the white background showing through a clear area of glass.

Cook plays a seedy down at heel satan to perfection and both he and Moore's performances riff off each other well honed by their track record in \\"Beyond the Fringe\\". The pace is a tad slow and performances slightly bookish to modern audiences accustomed to the more modern retelling with Brendan Fraser and Elizabth Hurley, but this is the original and delivers quiet rewards of its own. Notable also for the brief but effective cameo by the stunning Raquel Welch who is perfectly cast as.........Lust."},{"rating":"2","title":"Class British Comedy","review":"This is one of my all-time favorite movies!

The plot involves the plight of Stanley Moon (played to nerdy perfection by Dudley Moore) who works at Wimpy's hamburger stand and longs after his co-worker Margaret Spencer (Eleanor Bron). After reviewing his personal situation in life, Moon decides that suicide is his only option. At the last second the Devil walks in (played by Peter Cook at his best) and offers Stanley seven wishes in exchange for his soul. Hopefully, this DVD will do this film justice with some nice special features. At the very least, it gives the viewer an intriguing option to the woefully mediocre remake.

I understand they were the inspiration for Monty Python and a lot of other modern British humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"A perfect film","review":"I can only hope that people never confuse this hard-faceted gem with the dreadful (in fact worst ever) remake. The star of the film is the chemistry between long-time comedy partners Cooke and Moore, and the supporting star is the script, which is intelligent, thought provoking, and hilarious. There are sight gags (nuns on trampolines!), slapstick, and more wit than the whole run of Fawlty Towers. The \\"sacrilege\\" in this film is the blasphemy of a monk, the questions of a true believer, and it's clear that Authority may be infuriating, but it is not unwise, just as evil may be foolish, but it is not petty.

This 60s british comedy is a re-telling of Faust by Peter Cook and Dudley Moore and although slow in one or two places, is fantastically well written, funny, and stylish. Moore is the suicidal burger flipper who sells his soul to the devil played by Cook. God and Raquel Welch are also featured. Hollywood, is of course doing a remake (why? why?)A definite cult classic. Cook is fantastic as the devil and was a true genious in comedy writing. Moore... well anyone who could write a title song as cool as the one in Bedazzled can't be all bad - Dudley - you were half a genious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eleanor Bron","review":"This is not really a review, it is a complaint. Why, in all the comments on this film, is the player of the heroine, Eleanor Bron, simply ignored? This brilliantly intelligent actress turns in a series of cameos in Bedazzled, each one a gem. She seems to have faded from public consciousness despite an outstanding early career, not only with Cook and Moore, but also with the Beatles and in great theatrical roles on the London stage, like Pegeen Mike, Hedda Gabler, and the Duchess of Malfi.In general she has been unjustly passed over.David Wilde."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissenting view","review":"I see from the many favorable reviews that I'm an outlier on this movie, but I was unimpressed.

Currently, Amazon may get the matter resolved by Oct. 2nd of this year.I finally got an email from the vendor telling me that they did not understand why they got a response for the sale of that printer server. They sold that item a year ago and the listing should have been removed from Amazon.If the vendor is truthful, then that means Amazon collected money for a product that was sold a year ago.

Considering the age of these films, both copies are in very good condition, although the sound is not always perfect. The main actors (Pedro Armendáriz & Andrea Palma; Pedro Armendáriz & María Elena Marqués) are all superb. The cinematography, by Gabriel Figueroa in both instances, is nothing short of stunning. A treat for those who value a great period in Mexican cinema."},{"rating":"1","title":"My mistake","review":"I ordered this DVD under the impression that the copy of LA PERLA on the disk had English subtitles.

And if there is such a version, can you name a source for me? Thank you for your attention to this request."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping Mexican Dramas","review":"These two movies from the 40s are in Spanish without subtitles. But if you are fluent in Spanish, they are a real bargain. They are expertly shot, and the plots are also well done. The video on La Perla is very clear. Pedro Armendariz, who also acted in some English language films, such as From Russia With Love, is the star in both. Distinto Amanecer is about an underground union movement against evil people in power. Though it takes place in the 40s in Mexico, the themes are universal. La Perla takes place in a small fishing village, and is about how richness (the pearl) corrupts. Although the sound on the films is not that clear, both were enjoyable, and the price makes this set very attractive."},{"rating":"2","title":"On the Avenue","review":"Mary Lou Lord has a great ear for music and consistently chooses the best songs (albeit some eclectic) to cover.

Some of the characters turn out to be the main person in the next book. Good writing I guess you would say. So far I have really enjoyed the stories and each one has had a good and differnt plot. I am used to reading Berrice Smalls books that have very erotic love scenes. I wasn't sure if I would like this series but they are kind of refreshing but they could use a little more sexual romance.

Bought every book that I could get my hands on 1. Consider Your Options Kaye A. Thomas (Harvard Lawyer - (male) ) GREAT! Excellent advise parceled out with just the right amount of depth - but gets to the meaty stuff. Really told me not only what I wanted to know - but other things that I didn't know I needed to know. Easy to read - learned - good stuff.2. Better Than Money David E. Gumpert - Not as learned a book - but easy reading and focused on the employee side. Addressed several issues about negotiation of options in a hire situation3. Pay Me In Stock Options C.E. Curtis - Hard Back - but cheap. I would not recommend - a hard read, not organized4. Stock Options for Dummies Alan R. Simon The basics - and well done - but didn't address several of the issues that I wanted to know....How to get more ....and the psychology aspect of obtaining them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pastore's book for options...this book for ESPPs","review":"I disagree with the reviews on this site. Thomas's book is good but too encyclopedic covering options, estimated tax payments, employee stock purchase plans (ESPPs), mutual funds, gift and estate taxes, what a share of stock is, and more. There are 75-100 pages in this book covering basic material. This book and Pastore's are totally different....but buy both because presumably you've got real money at stake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Covers the basics, but not strategy or advice","review":"This book is good in that it covers all the basic mechanics of stock options -- Incentive and Non-Qualified, and ESPP plans. However, this basic information can easily be found on the web or from your employer.What is sadly lacking from this book is advice on strategy on how to manage options, e.g., ideas on when to exercise and sell. Because of this, the book is quite disappointing to me and not very useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mandatory Options Reading!","review":"Barring an extensive endeavor to compile the various option programs offered by industry on you own, Thomas' \\"Consider Your Options\\" is an extremely helpful text for both individuals new to the options sphere as well as experienced program administrators to pick up on the nuances of the various qualified and unqualified differences. Definitely a must-have for either executives or financial advisors who work with executives to use as a tool to help establish a strategy to protect and enhance their wealth. A solid addition to your desk reference library. 4 Stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Consider Your Options","review":"Mr. Thomas knows how to lay your options out in plain, simple English. He has an effective and informative style that makes sense of gobbledeygook. After thousands of dollars in legal and accounting fees these were the first straight answers I have been given to the questions and scenarios I am struggling with. Well worth the price of the book. Options are nothing to screw around with. The IRS seems to have targeted this form of comp for their most evil form of torturous logic. Make an informed decision, read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mix","review":"Some rare mixes here.

I use it as a road computer when I travel for business, so its small size is the biggest advantage to me.I upgraded the memory to 2gb, which was a completely painless process (unlike with my first Averatec, a 3715, which ultimately led to its demise) and it runs like a champ. Yes, it gets a bit hot like the other reviewer said, but its someting I can deal with.I researched a lot of small laptops and for the money, this one simply can't be beat. Considered a Dell, but the fact that this one features an internal DVD drive was the deal sealer.I'm giving it 5 stars thanks to its outstanding value and portability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Averatec is horrible","review":"If you are planning to buy Averatec STOP and listen to my bitter experiences (2 of them).Mine:I purchased a prior version of this and within 8 months(1) Computer started switching off automatically due to heating problem(2) The exterior lost painting and some exterior parts came out. It looked very old and ugly.(3) As I was working on the laptop one day I lost display. I sent it to the repair facility. They took 3 weeks to find my serial number and then they said I have to pay $336 as the display is not covered under warranty. Remember I was typing an email when the display was lost. It was not my problem.My Friend's:(1) His Averatec computer simply died (may be due to heating problem) on the 14th month.

We are treated to their thought patterns. The Heavenly warriors are presented as robotic being who have no personality of their own, but only goes about to do the will of God without question.

So, on the picture, if you count the blocks that are visible in the box window - that's it - there aren't any more. Sure the quality seems great, but they are simply painted wooden blocks. Even if the paint is non-toxic, I still don't want my boys to eat it (and their little sharp teeth get anything!). I'll be buying a simple set of unpainted wooden blocks (which I can find sets with way more blocks for the same price) and let my boys use their imagination like I did when I was growing up ;).

I'm a fan of hyde and L'Arc~en~Ciel, but listening to the song done in English was not the best. The music was too loud and their voices too soft.

I do not like classic music, but i though some of the songs were ok. The movie, Final Fantasy:The Spirits Within, is alot different than the games, making the music to it different too. In my opinion, if you like classic/fantasy type music you'll like this CD. If you don't like classic/fantasy music than you MIHGT not like this CD. But, as you know I don't like classic music and I still kind of like this CD. Why? Because it has this \\"Fianl Fantasy\\" feel in it. It kind of makes you relaxed.

It's a true and incredible story, masterfully photographed, well acted, lots of great Irish accents, and.... it's boring as hell. It might have come out okay if Boorman had added pathos, but he only goes for humor (like the movie Robin Hood), and it plays so forced that it comes across as desperate and callous (to Cahill's victims). I love just about everything Irish, but this movie was impossibly boring, and its humor was forced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleazy guy featured in well-done portrayal","review":"This guy was simply too sleazy for words! The film seemed to romanticize, or at least to want the viewer to admire, this Irish mafia dude. His behavior was simply reprehensible, especially in his off-handed manner toward his wife and sister-in-law (both of whom he was openly sexually involved with) and with his protecting one of his \\"employees\\" who admitted to sexually abusing his own daughter. The movie DID hold my interest, but I was actually relieved when the General was shot to death at the end of the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the best films of the year, terrible dvd.","review":"This was the second best film of the year, and certainly the most beautifully photographed in widescreen black and white. Just don't expect that from the DVD. It contains two versions black and white and a \\"desaturated color version.\\" The black and white version is shown 1.85:1, not the original 2.35:1. The color version was obviously done on a computer, with some footage in color, while most is still in black and white. You would think you could solve the problem by turning off the color on your t.v. pre-sets, but it turns out the only available audio has all obscenities dubbed out, like on network television.

Most, if not all, of the songs on this CD have made it as chart-topping singles, and each song is indicative of Namie's reign as a J-Pop queen. If you've never heard of Namie and is interested in J-Pop, this CD is great for the expansive listener. Basically, if you're into Eurobeats, this is perfect for you. The lyrics are predominantly in Japanese, although some key chorus words are in English... if only I knew Japanese....

The use of the languare is so sofisticated that sometimes one wanders how the author with all those complicated words manages not to get wherever he wanted to get initially. Couple of stories are amusing but too long (for the content) and most of them are promising at start and dissapointing at the end.

I can recommend this to all readers aged 12 (or there abouts) and up. (And up and up ... I am 45!)The characters are fun and interesting, especially the fascinating MCC Berkshire; and one feels a certain empathy for the adolescent Ailsa, trapped in a boring life with her widowed Mother, helping out at the family shop.Ailsa meets the strange Mr Berkshire whilst doing work experience at her local library. He is in need of employment and a place to stay. Her mother is in need of someone to help in the shop.

When I, desperate to share the experience of her beautifully written story, stood in the studio door to read it aloud to my husband at the time, my voice again faltered with emotion, and we stood there, he with palette and brush abandoned, overwhelmed by its power in broad daylight.I gifted this to my nephew confined to a sickbed after an operation as well as the audiobook of McCaughrean's authorised sequel to Peter Pan. I am sure I will have occasions to come where I gift this book again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"unorganized","review":"This book is poorly written. Ideas are vague and never expanded to completion. Ziker seems adept at starting one topic, and then branching off into so many other aspects that one gets lost and is unable to follow the original point of the discussion. I never got a feel for the people or their lifestyle except for the rare generalized glimpses that Ziker offers into their basic behavior. For a man that lived among these people, he doesn't leave the impression that he got to know them at all.

The reason for this is that much of the book is merely reiterating what was said on the subject in Irving Copi's \\"Introduction to Logic\\". What makes this really bad, is that \\"Introduction to Logic\\" costs more or less the same as this, and covers a lot more ground. Do not buy this book!! Buy \\"Introduction to Logic\\" instead, for its value is much better than this one, and will teach you all that this one will and more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Value","review":"As an earlier reviewer noted, this book contains only a third of Copi's Introduction to Logic yet it costs almost as much.There is nothing here that can't be found in Introduction to Logic. This is just another example of publishers repackaging old stuff and selling it at a premium, in an attempt to rip off college students.If you want to learn logic, get Copi and Cohen's Introduction to Logic.And unless you are taking a course and thus need to do the exercises in the latest edition, save money by buying a cheap used copy of the previous edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Pricey, No Better Than Cheaper Books.","review":"I with agree most of the others here. This book is way too expensive for what it offers. I had to use it for a logic class three years ago. It's okay, as far as it goes, but the price is ridiculously high. There are several equally good informal logic texts that cost only 1/4 what this one costs. Save your money and get one of the cheaper books.

It seems the other reviewers have beat me to it. And for once, the Amazon reviewers are right. I was going to say the same thing about this textbook: It's a pretty good book on informal logic, but it's much too expensive for what you get. Copi's Introduction to Logic has everything this one does PLUS great coverage of symbolic logic. If you want a book that covers only informal logic, there are others as good as this, at half the price (Feldman, Kelley, Kahane, etc.)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but way overpriced","review":"Good intro to informal logic but the price is ridiculous. Buy it used if you can. If it weren't for the $85 price tag, I'd give it four stars, because it's one of the better books on this subject.

It seemed to be written quickly, and doesn't stand up to previous books in the series in content or flow.This story is slightly amusing (I enjoyed the heroine - her quirky talkativeness was fresh and fun), and readers who are following this series will want to read it just to keep up with the family, but I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone looking for a well-crafted story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can I please give this book 20 stars!!!!!","review":"This book is a wonderful addition to the MacAllister series!

Again and again, she felt compelled to tell us that her male hero was excited... (Do we really need to know that?)In the hands of an author that could manage to get her mind out of the bedroom and describe more than just the sexual yearnings and exploits of her characters, this could've been a really fun read.

So much so, that I stopped reading it mid-way through the book. I almost never, ever do that as most times I want to finish the book to see if it either gets better, or see how it ends. This book also seemed insulting to women in general as it goes on and on about how much the young woman in the story talks; as if women can't help but \\"blather on about things.\\" I probably won't buy another Kinley MacGregor novel after this.

And how many times must we hear how much Mickey Rooney still misses Judy Garland? He covered his undying devotion much more eloquently twenty years earlier in Part 1. Get grief therapy, Mick. On that note, the film only comes to life when discarded footage of Garland in \\"Annie Get Your Gun\\" and \\"Easter Parade\\" is highlighted. It only serves to remind viewers that out-takes of Judy is infinitely better than intact numbers from the rest of the sub-par cast.

It is actually a film made 18 years after the second with a different feeling but still very good. This film tends to focus more on a documentary feeling rather than nostalgia. That's not a bad thing. The film may be more sober but focuses more on the MGM Hollywood system that was able to bring about the amazing group of stars. All actors were required to learn to sing and dance as well as acting and elocution, etc. It is very enlightening. There are out-takes that have never been shown before and the stars who contributed do a wonderful job, including Gene Kelley who seems to be suffering from emphysema.

We didn\`t get a fourth(or a 5th, they made a 4th for cable in 1995)chapter in 2004(MGM released De-Lovely instead) and it\`s a shame, because MGM STILL have a lot of magic moments in store for us....

I live in Singapore where it is hard to find somebody who still remembers about the famous movie musicals made by MGM( or other studios). However, this collective clips of musicals made by MGM really offer me a deep insight into what was once popular and successful in HOllywood. I love all the scenes and all those dancing movements. It's a pity I have missed out on so many great musicals before my time. My advice: Forget about disaster stories or computer aided graphics for the time being and treat yourself to a world of fascinating songs and dance! YOu'll love it. Musicals are for everyone to enjoy certainly."},{"rating":"2","title":"This IS........","review":"......The BEST Earl Grey I've had in a long while.

It not only holds a day's worth of bottles for my four month old twins, it does so in less space - just what I need for an already crowded counter top.

Skip Hop is one of my favorite baby gear companies. It came looking just as I thought it would. The only problem I have with it is that I wish it were a bit more sturdy for my glass bottles. Would recommend it more for someone using plastic bottles but will still work for glass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well and looks nice","review":"The reason I'm giving it 4 out of 5 stars is that it would be perfect if I used the skinny bottles (like the Gerber ones) but I use the Tommee Tippee line, which are a bit wider. Fitting bottles and the nipples on here is a tight squeeze. Also, the brush that it comes with isn't very high quality, which isn't surprising. I wound up throwing it away after using it a few times because I didn't like the idea of a dirty/used bottle brush living so close to the baby's clean bottles. So now the rack isn't as cute with the little orange bottle brush handle sticking up. However, removing the handle did make it shorter so now it can live on top of my microwave (that lives on the counter under a cupboard).Overall, it serves its purpose well and is better looking than bottle drying racks that I've seen at my friends' houses."},{"rating":"2","title":"sturdy bottle holder","review":"it is very sturdy but the brush broke after only 3 weeks. i have searched the web and can't find anywhere to buy a replacement brush for this item so the whole thing doesn't look quite as good with a brush that doesn't match."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic cracks easily","review":"Water does pool, as other reviewers note, but my bigger problem is how quickly the plastic degrades. I've used this for about a year, and every few times when I clean it another piece of the center structure (where the sections screw together) cracks and breaks off. I don't think I'm particularly hard on this, and like very much the way it looks. But now the bottom plate has cracked in the middle. I sure hoped I'd be able to get through sippy cups and into commuter mugs, but I guess not!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Functional and stylish","review":"I love Skip Hop products, this one most especially. My little boy eats very frequently, so I end up washing bottles every other feeding. The prongs are nicely separated and sturdy, that even the wide neck bottles are easy to hang and quick to dry. Very low maintenance, doesn't require much cleaning. After taking out the dry bottles, just run hot water and flip the Splash over to remove any excess drips. Some reviews mentioned that the brush broke quickly but the one that came with mine has held up pretty well after many uses for almost 5 months now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skip hop splash - poppy","review":"Not only is it functional, it isn't an eyesore on the countertop.

Honestly, if I wanted to just store bottles, I would have bought something else!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best designed bottle holder (and good looking too)","review":"I made the mistake of buying a cheaper bottle holder first, and ended up buying this one later anyway.

Well worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Compact Design, So-So Quality","review":"I like the compact, stylish design of this drying rack, but the brush handle broke off after only a month of usage. Granted, its a minor problem since brushes are cheap, but at the price I paid, I expected better quality. If I had to do over again, I would not buy this product again but would go for a cheaper rack instead and save my money to buy replacement brushes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product, handles glass bottles","review":"After buying and returning other bottle racks that could not hold up my glass bottles, I have finally found a keeper. I really like this translucent design because it is very clean and subtle in my kitchen. The stainless steel handle goes well with my stainless steel appliances. It holds 8-9 Dr. Brown glass bottles and all the little parts and nipples without a problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attractive and Functional!","review":"I love this bottle rack! It is sturdy enough for glass bottles (though I've only used it with 5oz ones) and I can easily hold all of the bottles, nipples and other bits and pieces that I want to wash for my baby. The brush works well and it's nice to be able to \\"hide\\" it back in it's slot when not in use. The rack attractive so I don't mind having it sitting on my counter top. I haven't had an issue with water pooling that some other reviewers encountered. Couldn't live without it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Water pools and mildews","review":"I like the stylish design of this drying rack, however, a key issue is that it doesn't drain the water that pools. You end up tilting it daily, to pour out the water, but you still have to scrub it often (or else it smells). Also, nipples don't have much space on this rack. After three months, I finally retired this rack and purchased The First Years rack to replace it. While The First Years rack isn't as modern / clean looking, I like that it drains the water and has space for nipples."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Bottle Rack Out There!","review":"I absolutely LOVE this bottle rack! It not only holds bottles and nipples, but it holds medicine droppers, aspirators, pacifiers, etc. As far as it holding water like some reviews mentioned, it really doesn't. Over time you will see some water stains on it, but you can get those off with regular cleaning. It's easy to put together and take apart. The fun look and revolving feature are two of the reasons I purchased it after reading the other reviews. Now, once I've been able to use it for a few weeks, the functionality is out of this world! So happy with this purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eye pleasing but...","review":"I bought this strictly for the look of it. I have the translucent one and it goes great on the kitchen counter. It is really nice that it neatly holds the brush too. The downside is that it really doesn't hold that much. The underneath piece just isn't super practical for holding things. I dislike the fact that it doesn't have a nipple brush either, which is completely necessary when hand washing bottles. We go through so many bottles on a daily basis that I've just started using the dishwasher. This would maybe hold half of the day's bottles for 1 child...especially if you are using Dr. Browns, which has a lot of pieces to it. It is pretty expensive too, compared to other racks. My advice: go to a consignment sale and buy one of the ugly, but functional ones for a buck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid!","review":"Here is an example of the very worst type of \\"Best of...\\" collection discs: loaded up with tracks from the least popular of the albums from the period it covers and featuring only \\"bleeding chunk\\" extracts of the good material.

This could have been a great opportunity to showcase this dark and beautiful period, but instead it contains most of the WORST bits of thier early cannon. In addition, one of the strengths of thier early works was thier ability to make 20-25 minute pieces develope and flow over time, and most of the pieces on this album are brief 5 minute excerpts. And the last three pieces are all from \\"Green Desert,\\" which good as it was, didn't need to take up almost half the album. Finally, why call it \\"The Pink Years?\\" These years were DARK.

The 51 mile Comrades Run is the backdrop. The portrayal of life at that time is somewhat interesting. The development of the relationship between the two characters is not particularly believable (no, there is nothing amorous, it just doesn't ring true and is somewhat predictable.) But what I HATED was the portrayal of the Comrades Ultramarathon.

Well it's not great literature, but it is what even the title suggests.: a fast, fun action novel. This book, like Morris' other Chasteen series novels is for reading by the pool or on the lanai; or in our northern clime by the fireplace with a favorite beverage, pipe or cigar in hand and faithful dog nearby. Great fast read, lottsa fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Morris runs out of gas third time around.","review":"Bob Morris falls a bit flat in this third of the Zack Chasteen series. Missing are the bits of local history and culture that give a tropic mystery its flavor, and in its place is a frenetic pacing (there must have been a dozen chapters of two pages or less) along a workmanlike plot (the villain is obvious halfway through the book) that still leaves some final questions unanswered. Morris seems to have run out of ways to develop Zack and Boggy as characters, substituting Zack's cynical put downs of Boggy's mysticism for any real development of their relationship. In summary, a decent read on the beach or in the airport, but a weaker cousin of the first two books, which had the energy and novelty of a really promising new franchise. Hopefully No. 4 in the series will recapture the magic of No. 1."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series!","review":"I love this series.

Despite his untimely death in 1998, hide's albums seem to still be widely available, no doubt because of his talent and popularity. Psyence, his second solo album, showcases his inventiveness and versitility in the field of rock music with a variety of disparate songs that are nonetheless all of extremely high quality. From the loud, fast paced Bacteria to the soft, melancholly Flame, hide always seems to know what he's doing. He even has a gift for lightening the spirits, with the gleefully bizarre LEMONed I Scream and just plain funny Lassie. Do yourself a favor and grab this album which easily demonstrates why hide was one of Japan's most popular and talented rock artists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Star-D&D: A horrible experiment","review":"This is the most horrible adventure I've ever seen for ANY role playing game ever, and I've been playing for almost 15 years.

Each time I would hope it would somehow get better but unfortunately, it never did. It simply listed play after play and movie after movie.....and then the author would sometimes throw in one of Vivien's \\"manic episodes\\" followed by an electro shock treatment. The book made Oliver out to be this successful Prince Charming and Vivien to be a needy, unsuccessful, emotionally unbalanced trainwreck.

Otherwise, RUN!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Maybe its just the style if writing, because I know this woman had a fascinating life, but I have only gotten half way through this book because its god awful boring.

It is as bad, if not worse, than Penthouse letters or any other porn magazine. The author asks sexually oriented questions of these pathetically open women. Where did he find them? I think any time men manipulative women for their sexuality it is just wrong. And this new strain of S/M glofication, sadism and masochism, and sexual experimentation is just a throw back to ancient patriarchial views. Sexpectations, through interviews, gives graphic sexual details about women's desires. I think this type of smut should be thrown in the trash. Most women I know are not into this type of deviance.

David is certainly a student of the intracacies of prose, and for me that opened up a whole new world of ideas. Reminds me very much of G.K. Chesterton's style. I wonder if Mr. Dark has ready any Chesterton. Given his stunning breadth of knowledge in the written word, I'm sure he has.Didn't quite understand a sentence? Re-read it carefully to see how each sentence lends itself to the next. Despite its intracacies, this is a book whose message transcends the sum of its parts. Reccomended to anyone who is interested in making the radical assertion that Christ is Lord, and anyone willing to see a truer reflection of what Christ-following and Christian culture should entail, rather than what the mainstream media is willing to depict.By the way, since when was Flannery O'Connor a pop-culture icon?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Apocalyptically Excellent","review":"In contrast to the pop-theology of our time, \\"Everyday Apocalypse\\" is overdue and a welcome addition to my library.

In my estimation, if your child isn't already interested, this book may not necessarily awaken him or her (Ambrose's \\"The Good Fight\\" is better), but for your interested son or daughter, ages 8 to 13 or so, this is a useful resource. As a history it is pretty light, but it is not a bad overview, and provides some great insight into the Home Front and other non-traditional perspectives on the War.

The film never really explains the nature of Tibetian government, the rule of the Dalai Lama, what made it unique, etc. It's take on Buddhism is simplistic. At one point His Holiness is asked to recite the Four Noble Truths. Geez, I would've thought they would get past that after a week or so (and he makes the common Western error of translating the first noble truth as \\"suffering\\" instead of \\"sorrowful impermanence\\" or a like phrase). In a \\"dramatic\\" moment, he is asked who he is on crossing the Indian border, and he says: \\"the moon on the water.\\" It comes off as a Buddhist cliche.If you aren't familiar with the story of Tibet, its history, and the actions of the Chinese already, this won't inform you. The film is stunning visually, but I am somewhat tired of the MTV approach to filmmaking: if it's a good image, use it, regardless of whether it fits in the story or informs the viewer of needed information."},{"rating":"1","title":"dum","review":"This moive house sold me a movie that does not work in usa thought they would know that by address."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long, too boring","review":"I think this movie was too long, too boring and too odl day fashioned for me to understand it comepletely but I think the acting was excellent.

It took a very analytical yet unemotional look at a story which was in reality flooded with extremes of emotion.

What's more, the educational value was poor because very little was actually explained. There was never a feeling of getting to know the characters.

But that is not the only reason for watching it. We all have heard about the Dalai Lama in exile and and his wisdom and charm. But this movie is about the part of his life most Westerners know very little (if anything) about. From his testing as a toddler to decide if he was the reincarnation of the 13th Dalai Lama and his subsequent removal from the sole care of his parents to his teenaged dealing with being both spiritual leader to and student of the the elder Bhuddist Monks and their later, but still while he was quite young, flight to safety and exile from a homeland that they are clearly deeply connected to.

And yes, the frame is filled with visual splendor and Scorcese's mastery of cinematic composition and color is on full display, but somewhere along the way he forgot something called \\"an interesting narrative\\". The actual story of the Dalai Lama's struggle and exile IS in fact a fascinating tale, so this should have been a no-brainer. Using \\"non-actors\\" is always a gamble, and in this case an unfortunate decision.

Comparing it to some older textbooks such as \\"Mathematics for Electronics\\" By Forrest Barker 1st edition, it seems like these newer textbooks just list equation after equation at you without explanation. I don't have too much experience with similar textbooks, but I have a copy of Nilsson-Riedel's Electric Circuits and it seems much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"A less-than-brilliant 'best of' release","review":"This is a reasonable survey of Tangerine Dream's albums \\"Le Parc\\" and \\"Underwater Sunlight\\", with some chunks of \\"Poland\\", \\"Tyger\\" and \\"Livemiles\\" thrown in. It doesn't contain enough of any of these albums to be worth having, though, nor is it sufficiently representative (especially of \\"Poland\\" or \\"Tyger\\") to be a useful way of finding out whether or not the full albums are worth having! Personally, I'd recommend putting the money towards copies of \\"Livemiles\\" and \\"Poland\\", if you don't have those. Or, if you're interested in the \\"Tyger\\", \\"Le Parc\\" and \\"Underwater Sunlight\\" tracks, go for the 5-CD \\"Dream Roots Collection\\" instead.

The first half looks at the development of the museum and the explorers who returned with materials from various expeditions. The second half looks at the collections and the stories of how the collections were put together. Readers who are interested in museum collections and early 20th century explorers will want to read this book. There are some wonderful photos of the early buildings, assembly of dinosaurs and mounting of other specimens.

The best songs are in three categories: SERIOUS (\\"I Want in That Place\\" - parody of Backstreet Boys \\"I Want It That Way\\") HUMOROUS (\\"Choirboy\\" - parody of Kid Rock's \\"Cowboy\\") and SERIOUS/HUMOROUS (\\"Trooth\\" - parody of Santana's \\"Smooth\\").Apologetix is quite good at teaching truth with a good balance of harmonies, poignancy, humor, strong lyrics, and of course good music.

This, to those of you, is the latter. Mr Magoo, a retired idea from a retired cartoon, that neither should have made it past phase one. After you laugh at one thing (As Ebert said about Money Pit) you have nothing more to laugh at. The jokes are neither funny nor inspiring. New material is essential to the survival of a comedy. Unless, that is, you enjoy redundancy. Leslie Nielson, is one of my favorite comedians, (With the exception of the unnecessary Wrongfully accused, in which I laughed twice) and I have to say he was the best for the job.

When a jewel is stolen from his museum and he's the prime suspect, Mr. Magoo and his nephew go on a wild quest to get it back, a quest that will take you from the U.S. to Brazil, and many more places. On the way, Magoo is tricked by the jewel theif, a cunning woman named Luanne LeSeur, who will stop it nothing to get the jewel back (and who also happens to kill all of her male accomplices). Along the way, Magoo will ski on an ironing board, mistakingly sandpaper a ckicken, and disguise himself as a Brazilian gangster.This film is made for kids, but adults will love it too.

I wish the author would have expanded on the first three pages instead of going into the somewhat mundane world of a young butch being seduced by a bar owner and a lesbian erotica writer.To be frank, the book needed to have a lot more sex in it and a lot less talking. What was especially disappointing is I didn't a find the lead character, 'Bobbie' very interesting OR sexy. I recommned this book only for the first 3 pages and a scene located in the early middle of the book, involving a young woman being initiated into the ways of sapphic love . . . .

I was especially turned on by the personality of Lincoln, the sharp-dressing butch - and it was great to get a glimpse of where she'd come from and how she'd transformed herself...I thoroughly recommend this book as a quality read for women who want a real story and emotions as well as lots of description of ... girls getting it on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"Really bad.

Distorted pictures and sound then nothing. Panasonic technical support couldn't help and only suggestion was to return it (at my expense) and pay $160 to get it fixed.I have many other very good Panasonioc products but their DVD (as well as DVD/VCR) recorders are ruining their reputation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Riddled with bugs","review":"This DVD recorder gave me problems right out of the box so I returned it to Best Buy in exchange for another. The next one had the same problems. It will freeze up on you to where you have to actually unplug it to reset. It will also randomly pop up an info box in the top right corner during the middle of watching a movie or tv, pretty ridiculous. The HD channels also have bad reception which apparantly gets fixed with their firmwirm update. (You can download the update on the website and then burn it to a CD). The first time I tried recording from an external device was this week. I was using a dual layer disk and everything was fine until the third episode I was adding. After it I have tried to view the three things I have on the disc (with plenty of empty room left on it) it now no longer lets me do anything with the disk. It gives \\"Unsuported disk\\" error, so now the disk is wasted and so was my time. I can't view or record on it. Not impressed with this equipment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't do it.","review":"This item should never have been brought to market. Would you buy this device if you knew that within a few months, just after your opportunity for a hassle-free refund expired, there would be a <10% chance that your scheduled recordings would work?

No cost to me fortunately, but the tuner is garbage and the machine constantly requires a reset (note: Never buy anything with a reset button on it.

I've since found from Circuit City's owner comments at their website that many other people have had this happen.

We assumed the scan feature would be a blessing. It's a curse. The transition from one channel to the next is not smooth. The switching is annoying and keeps me awake. Also, sensitivity is non-existant. My second daughter is across the hall from us and when she woke up ill and crying last night we could not hear her on the monitor. My wife heard her crying from her room. We received a free monitor from a baby store that works much better than this one. It's a shame because the concept is very good. But they should have put more money into the quality of the monitor than the packaging of the system. Pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money!!","review":"Great concept, horrible product! We purchased this monitor after the birth of out third child, thought it was the perfect solution to having multiple monitors around the house!! Loved not having to carry monitors all over the house and the idea that they were all the same system that you didn't have to worry about interference. The monitor lost its signal and went to loud static the first night using it, and never got better, totally broken. Thought maybe it was a fluke and exchanged it for another one. The second one lasted 2 nights before it broke. Finally went and purchased a digital monitor and very happy with that, and doesn't interfere with our other monitors."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice concept, but terrible monitoring system","review":"I tried two of these monitors, hoping that the first was just a bad item, however when the second did the same thing, ToysRUs took it back. The box is a nightmare to get the thing out first of all, and they want you to return it in the box. The monitor clicks, and we did try this all over the house. We even unplugged our cordless phones and computers to see if that was the problem which it was not. It also jumps off channel, and leaves a horrible static sound. I did like the rechargable battery concept, the walkie talkie concept, and the ability to monitor three rooms, however it is just not worth the headaches. I did exchange this for the Sony which is amazing, as per other reviewers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not live up to the price","review":"We have two children that are a year apart and needed a monitor system that we could place in both of their bedrooms and still hear. On paper this looks like the perfect monitor, until we got it home. Prior to this monitor we had the fisher-price sound and lights and it worked great. This had terrible static on the parent monitor as well as how the lights lit up our entire bedroom when the lights were out. For that price we expected clarity and didn't receive it. Now we are faced with a dilemma because you can't have two baby monitors in the same house and this one didn't live up to our expectations. Many reviews said they were unhappy I should have headed their advice and not even purchased it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Back to the store with this one","review":"I bought this monitor last night, needless to say it will be going back to the store today.Not only is it EXTREMELY noisy with all of the crackling and static, but when it is quiet for a BRIEF moment, you can hardly hear the baby cry, even with the volume turned up to the max.For a retail price of $129.99, I would expect better reception.The idea is great, the execution of it is horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea but poor quality","review":"I was so excited to find this product. I have two children under 2 years of age and really wanted a monitor with two base units - and this one has three! I purchased it thinking it would be worth the hefty price tag, but unfortunately I was wrong.This monitor had a constant static-y hum and would periodically crackle loudly, which was very annoying compared to the monitor I used to have that was completely silent. I might have been willing to deal with that except I could barely hear my children even with the volume turned all the way up. I was used to hearing my son breathing over our old monitor, but with this one I could only hear him well if he was crying loudly. I couldn't believe how low the maximum volume was!This monitor was definitely not worth the price considering the poor quality - it was almost worthless! I returned it and am going to try using two different monitors instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product!","review":"This monitor is EXACTLY what I was looking for! I did read the previous reviews before buying, and decided that despite those that complained of static that it was worth a try. I'm so glad I did! I haven't found any issues with static, so I would say that if you run into that, check the environment - there's probably something interfering. The monitor has fantastic features, is very clear, and the transmitter units are inconspicuous in the childrens rooms. The receiver units are reasonably sized, and without the bulky antennae some other monitors have. I highly recommend this monitor!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"Please do not waste your time or money on this product. I have a 17month old and another due any day. We need to monitor both kids and I was so excited that I found this product. BOY WAS I WRONG. I cannot emphasize enough how irritating the crackle/pop sound every 30 seconds can be. Not to mention the loud screeches other reviewers mentioned, mine seemed to be picking up interference from my TV. We have Direct TV, I dont know if that has anything to do with it. Switching channels didnt help, neither did moving the receivers and bases. Lastly, the volume doesnt go high enough, I only heard my kid crying when I held the receiver up to my ear at maximum level. Its ashame the fancy packaging had clearer sound quality than the monitor itself. By the way, this only got one star because there was no option for no stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!!","review":"We are expecting twins, so we were really excited to find this product. We hooked it up--it has some really nice features like a walkie talkie, 2 parent sets, and a rechargable battery in the parent sets. One of our parent sets simply didn't work--all static!! Several others reviwers mentioned to simply read the directions. Well, we are pretty tech savvy, and we certainly know to have the monitors on the same channel! There is just a lot of static, and one simply didn't pick up a signal from the baby set. Also, it isn't very loud. You would have to have the volume up full blast to hear a baby cry. It also interfered with our cordless phone despite the channel we picked. Save your money and buy something cheaper!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mother of 2","review":"I thought this monitor set would solve all our problems -- ability to listen to 2 children and have receivers in different rooms. Yes, it does that but there is a lot of static and the receiver had to be turned up too high in order to hear the kids. The scanning feature was a big disappointment -- probably the biggest disappointment with this unit. The scanning feature allows you to listed to each monitor for a few seconds each. Problem is, if you are only using 2 of the 3 units then you will hear unit 1, unit 2 and then static for the unit not being used. That is very annoying. It should only scan units currently in use -- or at least not deliver static for the unit not used.In short, this unit offers more than is delivered."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Monitor that keeps me up","review":"I couldnt belive it when I saw this monitor I thought it was purfect until I got it hom then threw away the recipt (big mistake) and the box (trash day too.) This Monitor is the worst monitor I have ever seen. Sure the set up is ok and it is versible but all night it makes this anoying clicking noise. The reception is horrible! When my phone rings it goes crazy! (Click...Click....Click)This thing Has kept me up every night since I have owned it. I do not recomend spending the amount of money on this monotor.

We had a Fisher Price monitor that we used first with our Great Dane puppy then with our son that worked great until Nov. (about 2.5 years). I had put this monitor on my registry for my daughter and decided to go ahead and buy it. It worked ok for the first week although one of the receiver had the clicking sound people referred to. I was just going to call the company and see if they would replace it when the second receiver began the same thing. I'm not a light sleeper but it kept me up. The volume (therefore the static and clicking) had to be turned almost all the way up so I could hear my son in the morning. I ordered 2 of the Sony 27 channel monitors which so far have been great together. This monitor is now in the garbage along with the $130 I paid for it. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABSOLUTE JUNK!!!!","review":"Could only stand it for two days - had to return . . . Lots and lots of static, popping, and chirping. I could barely even hear the baby, even with the volume turned all the way up. Plus, the volume control broke on one monitor and a light burned out on the other monitor, all within two days of getting it home. Couldn't have been interference with other devices because I unplugged everything in my house and still had problems. Would never ever recommend this product to anyone - deserves a 0 star. I have ordered the Sony 27 channel monitor and will hopefully have better luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT IF YOU LIKE STATIC","review":"We were so excited to see this monitor on the market because we have 2 small children and a split bedroom plan. Our excitement turned into a HUGE disappointment when we plugged it in and all we heard was static. We tried it in several places and nothing worked.

I bought this one because I live in a 2-story home, and thought it would be great because I could have receivers and monitors in different locations upstairs and downstairs. Yes, that part was fine, but all the static wasn't what I needed. I tried to change all the channels on every monitor and receiver, but still got static, plus an additional beeping sound every 15 seconds. I can't get any sleep with all that noise. This is the worst product you can buy for the money.

The multiple units and walkie talkie feature is a great idea, but it's too bad it doesn't work. The constant static, clicking noises and lack of sensitivity all contributed to me returning this product to the store today.

I too thought for this price I really must be getting everything, but all I got was static."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought two, RETURNED two!","review":"This seems like the perfect solution for those with two or three children they want to monitor at the same time. It would have been great if it actually worked. I had nothing but static for a majority of the time. When there wasn't static there was this odd clicking/popping noise. The first night I used it, it woke me up at 2 AM making this horrible SCREECHING noise. The only way to make it tolerable was to turn it down, so there was no point in owning it. Thinking I had a faulty model I exchanged it for another one, only to have the same problems with the second one so I returned it as well. Another downfall is that if you only want to use 1 or 2 of the monitors you will get static in place of the ones that are not in use since the system is designed to scan all three.

However, the monitor was ideal for our 3-level town home and we thought that we'd give it a chance, hoping that the problems mentioned in the reviews would not surface.Unfortunately, the first night we turned the monitor on, the problems started. The clicking on the receivers started as well as the loud, consistent static, both difficult to sleep through (most of the nights we turned the monitor off).Less than two weeks after we bought the monitor, at our earliest convenience, we are returning it!! Happy monitoring and believe the reviews you read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Monitor I've tried","review":"I have had three children and three monitors. This is by far the worst I've ever had. It doesn't hold a charge even when the ac adapter is being used. It also makes an annoying high pitched distant noise; very unnerving for those that are trying to get some sleep before their baby wakes again. I would have given it 0 stars if it wasn't for one cool feature; it doubles as a walkie talkie and you can speak to those close to the second receiver. The best monitor I've had was the Sony 900 mhz. The Summer video monitor works well too, but the antenna is fragile and not to be used around toddlers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea, poor execution!","review":"We are expecting our second child soon so we will have 2 under the age of 2. I was so excited to find this monitor. It looked like the answer to our monitor needs. Unfortunately.... I will be returning this monitor today. The sound is terrible. It has some static but the problem is mostly that it not sensitive enough for me. My son has to nearly scream for me to hear him clearly. I was previously using the Fisher-Price 900 MHz and I could hear amazingly clear. I'm so glad I tested it out before I had to use it with my newborn. I am not comfortable with the very poor sound quality of this monitor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, bad product.

My son was only two when my daughter was born and I didn't feel comfortable transferring his monitor to her room, as I couldn't find another system that would allow me to listen to multiple locations as this set does. Fortunately, my husband found these monitors and we couldn't live without them! Even on the lowest setting, I can hear the kids, and the light display shows when there are detectable noises as well. I also love how the monitors can be detached from their cords so that I can move freely about the house while still listening for the children. I have had these monitors for a year now and have had absolutely no problems with them. Furthermore, I would be purchasing another set today if they were to break. Definitely a must have for families with multiple small children!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissappointed Parents","review":"This product was given to us for our baby shower, we were so excited about it that we decided to try it out that night.

(we currently have a fisher price Sounds and Lights) But much to our disappointment, proved to be incompatible w/900 mghz phones and whatnot - even when not placed near phones. There was so much static - no matter what we did - as well as loud buzzing. I should note we live in private house - so there was not interference from neighbor's monitors. You have to monitor 1 or 3 zones - can't just monitor 2. Also, the most wasteful packaging I have ever seen for a product of this size!

I'll be returning it ASAP for a refund and will go back to using 2 different (less expensive!) monitors instead.

I returned it the next day. The reason you are paying so much money for this monitor is the packaging. The packaging alone for this monitor is atleast $25 of the cost. Any way dont buy it,it doesent work. I have no idea how long my poor baby was crying that night. I wouldnt recommend this piece of garbage to my worst enemy.

Even with the volume very high, the sound was too faint (except for static). Also, I did not like the fact that the scan feature must scan all three monitors, you can't have it scan only two rooms.

The top support clips the phone right at the slot for the memory card and doesn't seem sturdy enough to keep the phone in the holster. With an expensive phone like a Treo 650, I just don't get a secure feeling from this holster that it will keep my phone safe and on my belt. I refused to take that chance and will not use this holster. In fact, I already purchased the leather TREO holster manufactured by PALM for about $20.00"},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"This is exactly what you need for non-stick pans, firm handle is better for flipping and scooping than the weaker/flimsier brands."},{"rating":"2","title":"turner","review":"It is able to turn things and not melt when touching a hot electric grill.

Just a little smaller than I expected but good design. It's a spatula. It works.Ok. After having it a while I got more to say. Firstly, the tip of it has places where it melted and now has rough edges. Secondly, the grip has begun to come loose and pops out of the handle from time to time. Not enough to make me replace it... yet. But far below the standard I've come to expect from Calphalon after using their knives (I have a calphalon cleaver and chef's knife that I *LOVE*) and their cookware (Bought my mom some pans that are super sturdy and she likes them very well). Moral: Calphalon makes great pans and knives but (in this instance at least) fall a bit short of the mark on their spatulas. Won't stop me from buying their products though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well - don't expect it to be perfect though!","review":"This Nylon turner is great. A few other reviewers mentioned that it doesn't handle high heat well. This is true. If you are scrambling eggs, removing cookies from a cookie sheet, flipping pancakes, or most other kitchen tasks, you will not have a problem. If for some reason you decide to leave it on an extremely hot surface for longer than necessary, yes, it will melt. This is actually a replacement for another Calphalon turner. I made the mistake of using it to grill with (and leaving it on the grill) - my own stupid mistake (it melted).For high heat cooking, buy a metal turner. If you don't want to scratch your non-stick surface, learn to flip more carefully.I gave it 4 stars, not for lack of quality, but only because this one was smaller than my last, and I didn't notice any size spec to let me know it was smaller. This turner is honestly a great buy.

The Rubik's Professor Cubes don't turn well and their stickers peel off after only a few hours of cubing. You have to twist them slowly or pieces will break (a center piece broke in half on mine). I would be more merciful on this cube if it were the only 5x5 available, but it isn't. You can buy V-Cubes here on Amazon or Eastsheen 5x5 cubes on eBay. Both are better than the Rubik's ones.Don't buy this because it's cheaper than the V-Cube. The Greek-made V-Cube 5 is, like, infinitely better than this. It's worth the extra $10."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoddy Construction","review":"Puzzle is interesting but shoddy construction makes it less useful than it should be.

When I took it out of the box I noticed how unstable it seemed compared to the 3x3 and even 4x4 Rubik's cubes. The layers needed to be 100% aligned in order to turn. Even when the layers are aligned, it still takes a lot of effort to turn. I contacted Winning Moves complaining about this product. They sent me a new Rubik's 5x5 cube, but it was poorly constructed just like the first cube. I was very disappointed with this product and highly recommend that you do not purchase this product.

I figured this would be no different, yet challenging. It uses many algorithms from the 3x3 and 4x4 so you almost feel like you're solving one of those. Pieces do tend to try and pop off, but if you're gentle and don't force it, they'll go back into place. It says it isn't intended for speed solving, so if you just do it for fun at a good pace then you'll be fine. I've had no problems with it falling apart. Great toy, would definitely buy from this company again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great cube, but don't get this version","review":"My biggest problem when I opened this cube was that it was really stuff. The stickers tend to peel off really fast and chip off. It's not really that great. It can be very fun. Once you learn how to solve a four by four, you'll be able to figure this one out. It's a little challenging and I still have problems with it. Took me about twenty minutes to figure out. Really fun to play with, but very fragile.After about four days of playing with this cube, it's already starting to fall apart. It's not good. I'd just shell out the extra ten bucks and get the 5x5x5 made by v cube. That is an outstanding cube--not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrendous Service","review":"Extremely bad service.

I had read the review here and other places stating that one needed to be cautious when turning the puzzle. However, our major problem with it was that the orange stickers (within ten minutes of playing with the cube) began to peel back and fall off. We tried using glue (they had no stick to them) to put them back but it was not long after that the green stickers began curling back and falling off as well.The major problem is that these turned out not to be \\"stickers\\" after all, but rather colored squares of vinyl adhereing to additional stickers beneath (all white) by means of static. They fall off easily.This is a nice puzzle for show (impressive on the desk) but not for actual continued use. Hopefully, Rubik's can use proper stickers or adhesive in the future and maybe even tighten up the design so that this can be used as a fun puzzle."},{"rating":"2","title":"5by5 Rubik's Cube","review":"I bought this for my daughter.

Get a V-Cube 5x5x5 if you want a much better product. What really drives me crazy is that whenever I move the center layer, the top layer moves along with it. Also, the top, bottom, and middle layers don't move very well, although the inner layers move okay.

What I'd hoped to get, what I'd PLANNED to get, was a fun educational toy which my math-whiz son would love. But what I got instead, unfortunately, was simply too much of a good thing.Beyond the increased difficulty of the Rubik's 5X5 Cube, which of course is a given, the extra squares make the toy harder to manipulate and simply more fragile to work with, especially for adults with large hands or kids without patience or an understanding of delicacy.I will say, though, that the Rubik's 5X5 Cube looks interesting sitting on my son's bedroom shelf.
