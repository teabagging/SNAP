Since then, my prefered version is the matchless Berganza/Abbado recording in DG, certainly the most beautiful and stylish of all. A friend recommended the Reiner recording and I was curious enough to buy it. This is an old fashioned Carmen, that takes us back to the 50's when Carmen was thought \\"a Grand Opera\\" rather than an Opera Comique with dialogues. To me, this sounds too much like Cavalleria Rusticana, loud and a little vulgar. For a more stylish 1950's Carmen, I much prefer the Victoria de Los Angeles/ Beecham recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bring on the coffee","review":"This is a book that I \\"needed\\" for class.

She has the talent to create interesting lyrics, beautiful music and the ability to fuse them together to make great music. However, her latest album is a bust. There are a few songs in this album that show her potential (In this Life, being one.) All the rest of her songs seem very uninspired. The music is very boring, and old and her lyrics and music just don't go well together. Before she used to explor multiple themes in her albums. This album is only about love. I hope that her next album is more inspired with some of the passion she has shown before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"Although i like Sarah McLachlan the best, Chantal is probably the most skilled musician out of all the canadian women artists.Whereas Sarah's songs are mostly cryptic and somber with lyrics that are open to your own interpretation, Chantal is mostly upbeat and direct, but still original enough to leave an impression. I would recommend all of Chantal's albums.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Continued excellence","review":"It is rare to find an artist who consistently provides albums filled with wonderful sound and spirit. I am an avid Chantal fan and must say that this is a superb addition to her already amazing list of albums. It's a shame that she's probably more recognized from movie soundtracks than from her own hits on the radio, since she's got a lot of great material that most people never get to hear.I would recommend anyone to give this album a listen. It's a little fresher than some of her previous works, but I'm having a hard time saying this is the best (I've listened to the other two far too long to swear allegience so soon!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not As Good As Previous CD's","review":"I ordered her new CD directly from Canada with high anticipation, as I loved her first 2 CD's and saw her twice live.

It seems her 3 year layoff didn't help her with songwriting."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of the same","review":"Chantal's 1996 debut, \\"Under These Rocks and Stones\\", showed her promise as a talented singer/songwriter. Then, with 1999's \\"Colour Moving and Still\\", she collaborated far too much with her husband and the end result was a boring and pretty disappointing album. Unfortunately, 2002's \\"What If It All Means Something\\" is pretty much the same. Chantal and Raine Maida might make a great team as a couple, but as songwriters I fail to see how they click. Also, Chantal's singing is quite annoying and scratchy and I honestly have a hard time listening to her. I am sure most Chantal fans will love this, but I've lost respect for her as an artist with her latest album."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok","review":"If you like the radio-friendly pop songs ofChantal's...this is a good cd for you -\\"In This Life\\", 'Time\\", 'Julia\\", and \\"Mrs April\\"are good songs.Otherwise...if you don't care for the music onthis cd, check out Chantal's other two albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"when i bought this cd today,i knew it would be good for i had recognized track s1 2 and 4 as songs i had loved,and i had read the other reviews for it.but i had no clue....its amazing,simply amazing.i could listen to it over and over and over and not be tired of it.all of the songs are excellent and i highly recommend u to buy this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"this cd is AWESOME. i think chantal kreviazuk is REALLY talented. i have all her cds. well under these rocks and stones is burned but i bought the other two and they're AWESOME. she's sooo good. shes also pretty underated which is good cuz when singers like these hit main-stream is when they start to get all poppy and annoying (because certain songwriters ::the matrix:: take over their writing and BLECH) that's what happened to Liz Phair...lets HOPE it doesn't happen to chantal kreviazuk. she's SO good. i think her and her husband (lead singer from our lady peace) should do a duo together! heehee so what are u waiting for?!?!

The first time I did it I felt the burn in my lower abs for a few days after. Since then I have not been sore, but I still feel it working when I'm doing it. I really like the first section. I have only done the second workout a few times because I don't really like it. (Because of it I would actually rate this a 3 1/2.) I think Denise does the yoga postures far too quickly to get the benefit of the stretch. If the moves were slower I would like it better. Overall, however, I would recommend this video to anyone who would like to get started in Pilates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this video","review":"I tried this video as a supplement to my weekly pilates class and was very dissapointed. Denise whips through the exercises without giving much direction on form and modifications - this is especially true for the second workout which is more yoga based. I think my pilates and yoga instructors would have trouble recommending this video. I also did not feel like the video provided a total body workout. Pilates stresses \\"core strength\\" but also involves all of the muscles in the body. However, this video focuses mainly on the abdominals. For anyone new to pilates and/or yoga this tape would be too difficult and possibly unsafe. Also, I found Denise to be very annoying and condescending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good instruction","review":"Do not buy this... Dangerous for beginners and not challenging for intermediates.I purchased this video as a beginner and have since started instruction at a pilates studio. At the time I first tried it, I thought it was ok, but now I know that the moves are dangerous and incorrectly performed. Austin does a very bad job explaining the tecniques, which are crucial in getting the desired results and more importantly, in protecting you from injury. If you know what you are doing, you could do this workout safely, but I think there must be a better workout out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pilates Video- Fair Yoga Video","review":"I just purchased this video. I really liked part 1 which is only pilates (part 2 combines both yoga and pilates). Part 1 has a good pace which allows you enough time to complete the exercises. Part 2, however, seems to speed through the exercises a little bit too fast for my taste. I own several yoga videos which are strictly yoga and I enjoy them better. However, I cannot stress enough how much I like Part 1. She did a great job and I really, really can feel the ab workout that it provides! Again, however, she includes a lengthy introduction before she gets into part 1 of the tape--it would have been much better to put it at the end because you are left fast forwarding it everytime. Overall, I would recommend this video to my friends. Parts 1 and 2 make a great workout and really strengthen and tone your abs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Beginners","review":"I don't agree with other reviewers that this is a beginner video. The second workout has some advanced yoga poses with little instruction. The Pilates workout also contains some advanced Pilates exercises. Denise is calmer in this video than other videos. The production quality is also very nice. A great introduction to Pilates on video is Stott's Essential Matwork and Lynne Robinson's Body Control. Even better take a class and then try the videos at home."},{"rating":"1","title":"This video is a joke","review":"I've been doing pilates and yoga for six months now and I have never seen a poorer approach to these two types of exercise. Denise does not seem to know what she is doing, nor is she able to explain these exercises to the viewer. I'm not sure why she is so popular, she talks to the camera like her audience was a bunch of 4 year olds and she has poor form in both of the 20 minute sessions on this tape. In the pilates section she does a number of basic pilates exercises and a couple more advanced ones, but her constant breathy and airheaded commentary ruins your concentration and focus on the breath. I was unable to contain my laughter when she would say ridiculous things like, \\"Thats gooooood, you are like a ballerina!!\\" And the yoga section is a total mess. She does a poor version of sun salutations with out explaining the movements.For anyone who is seriously interested in practicing pilates or yoga, you are better off spending your money elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying, too fast, and bad technique","review":"As someone who does yoga regularly, I was struck with Denise Austin's terrible technique, at least in the yoga section (I am less familiar with Pilates). Her speed does not allow you to actually get into the poses and her constant chatter is highly irritating. A beginner would not get the instruction he or she would need and may even learn bad technique. I will not use this tape again and would not recommend it to anyone I care about."},{"rating":"2","title":"can't wait","review":"I started this video three weeks ago. I am an ex-aerobics instructor and have exercised the old fashioned way for too many years to count. When I say old fashioned I mean exercise equals jumping around vigorously in some form of aerobics and/or lifting weights. I am thrilled with this video. I started off doing the video every other day. My body is starting to feel tighter particularly the tummy and the stretching, breathing, and the general feeling is wonderful. I am so excited that it does not feel like exercise and I have started to do it daily. Such a great tradeoff for only 20 minutes a day."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a faker","review":"I was lent this tape by someone new to Pilates. I have been doing Pilates for 6 years and was amazed to find that D. Austin (who is an Aerobics diva) has a Pilates tape. Her technique is horrible and she does not come close to hitting on the \\"core\\" needed to complete the excerises correctly. The sequence in which Pilates movements are completed is extremely important and Ms. Austin jumps all over the place. Not knowing much about Yoga I do know that one does not rush through the movements and that proper positioning of the body is crucial. I do not beleive this is accomplished. There is a great web site out there where one can purchase tapes and small Pilates equipment from the leading manuafacturer of Pilates equipment. Do your body a favor and find a great Pilates tape on a Pilates web site! P.S. My sister is a ballet dance, did the tape with me once and Ms. Austin drove her crazy with her voice tone and \\"ballarina\\" lingo! I must concur!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pilates","review":"I have never had a Denise Austin tape before so I purchased this one and I love it. I do it 5 to 6 days a week.

Pilates is not something one picks up in a minute. it requires extensive studying and practice. None of these qualities are visible in this video. It gives a distorted idea of what the Pilates philosophy is about."},{"rating":"1","title":"More like 'Pilates takes aerobics'","review":"Denise Austin is usually great, but her aerobics background is definitely a minus when it comes to Pilates. I've watched a few Pilates tapes, and smooth careful movements are usually emphasized. In this tape, Ms. Austin goes through each exercise quickly without the usual care about stretching, moving to lengthen the muscles, etc. I guess this is a good intro to Pilate's for the aerobics croud, but it seems to miss the point of the Pilate's technique!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginners","review":"I thought Denise Austin would have a good work-out for people just starting pilates/yoga, but I was wrong. Luckily, I had already been doing yoga for a few months and knew how to safely do the poses in the yoga section of this workout, but it made me nervous how fast she was taking it and with very little instruction. Yoga is more than just getting into a position. It's linking movement and breath and balance. I have not done any other Denise Austin work-outs, but I get the impression that she quickly learns every new fitness fad that comes along so she can do her own video/DVD of it. I would rather learn the pilates method from someone who has studied and practiced it for years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Denise Austin-Mat Workout Based on the Work of J.H.Pilates,","review":"I am a certified Pilates Instructor and I think that the quality of the instructions, not to mention the demonstrations are very poor. Whoever buys this video tape to learn about the Pilates method will get a very distorted picture of what this philosophy is about. The way the exercises are being performed leave a lot to be desired. The full body awarness is missing here.The question of quality control arises. If there is none, anyone can record a video tape. When people buy an exercise VHS they expect the instructions to be the highest quality they can get.They trust that the person making the video is highly qualified to do so. Recently there has been a disturbing number of \\"cases of bad Pilates\\". It is very unfortunate that this fine method of exercising that requires the instructors to go through an extensive trainng is being devaluated by people who do not care about quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this tape","review":"I was looking for a tape on pilaties and when my favorite fitness guru put this new tape out i snached it up on the spot!!

Suprising when you think that your are just lying on a mat but i swear you do sweat!!I recomend this tape to a friend and she absoulty loved it. A great tape for beginners who are new to pilaties. You dont need any special equipment that alot of pilaties moves require it is just simply a wonderful video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying","review":"If you like Denise Austin, then stop reading right here. I love the Pilates workouts, and was hoping that with a video instructor I could get some better tips on form and movement since there are no Pilates studios where I live.

It's still sitting on my shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a \\"must-have\\" for your exercise video collection!","review":"Normally Denise Austin isn't one of my favorites. (I had seen her on TV and thought she was WAY to perky. However, this video was so good--and she has toned down her perkiness and put out a great video. The Mat 1 session is my favorite, although the yoga in session 2 is okay too. And I LOVE the additional workout featured in the bonus selection, too! Every time I do her workout I feel longer and leaner. I'm walking tall and feeling better. I highly recommend this to people looking for a good stretching and toning video to compliment their other higher impact aerobics videos."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it..","review":"I am not usually a D.

I'm going to try Pilates for Dummies and see how I like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging","review":"I found this tape very challenging. It is all based around strengthening the stomach. I found this to be much easier than yoga. She makes it very easy to understand all the moves. I actually sweated somewhat. This is a great tape dispite Denise Austin's ability to go on and on forever. You kind of have to tune her out but it's the easiest and most effective tape I have found so it's definatly worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I did not know Denise b4 I bought this","review":"I had know idea that this woman was so annoying. I loved the workout. The moves were great but after a few times I worked out with her on MUTE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Denise is not a certified Pilates instructor and it shows. She sometimes does not have proper form, and she performs some moves more than necessary. In the yoga video, she is quite wobbly. If you're interested in Pilates or yoga, you will get value for money from videos by Ana Caban, Moira Stott, Hilary Burnett, Jennifer Kries (who combines Pilates, yoga & dance), and the Living Arts yoga videos, among others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Workout","review":"These are two great workouts for your abs and legs (you'll feel it if you aren't in great shape already). Unfortunately the second 20 minute section is frustrating at first becuase Denise fails to mention to switch legs or relax (and if you are concentrating on holding a certain position, it can throw you off). But the workouts are good and the bonus workout (Shape your buns, thighs and hips) is a nice 10 minute add on for either segement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fitness buffs","review":"Mostly I am writing this in defense of Denise from a previous reviewer who admitted she doesn't know much about yoga but slammed Denise anyway. I have been studying yoga for 23 years and the form that Denise uses in this video is called Ashtanga and it is a form of yoga wherein the 'poses' are done in rapid succession. It is more for fitness than for spirituality. The classes are taught by you following along, the poses are not demonstrated first. People who are fitness oriented and are looking for a good workout from yoga in the manner they are used to follow this path. My only intent was to clear up any misunderstandings from the review stating Denise does the yoga badly. Otherwise, it is a very nice tape, different from Denise's other more 'active' ones. If you would like a combination workout that is challenging, this is very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"surprisingly nice beginner tape for annoying denise","review":"I bought this tape about a year ago, when Pilates became popular.I wasn't really sure what to expect from pilates itself, and denise introduces the workout, and she isn't sooo annoying in this one, she doesn't talk too much.This tape has 2 sections: the first one is a pilates workout, which focuses more on the abs, eventhough there are a couple thigh sets at the end, but barely worth mentioning, and the second part is a yoga workout, which is a bit more challenging than the pilates (but i've never done it).Overall, this tape is a good value if you want a quick (20min long each) sections. The tape is well made with a few back-up women who don't stop smiling...but who cares, your abs will hurt too much at the end to even notice them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the Best","review":"This video is definetly for the begginer. I like that she completely takes you through everything, so that you never get lost. Yet, I didn't find that it had a lot of effect on me, probably b/c I'm already a dancer. So, if you're familiar with pilates, I don't recommend it. If you are just looking to start, it's worth a try.

I have to admit that my first experience practing pilates using Denise Austin's video were disappointing. This video is not for a full body workout. The emphasis was placed mostly on the abs. For a serious yoga student, that is not the goal. I was looking for a total mind and body workout. If you're looking for a quick routine to work your abs, this is the workout for you. The 2nd mat workout with yoga was pretty horrible. The poses moved too quickly and were poorly explained. Calling it yoga must be a joke!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The WORST pilates/yoga video EVER!","review":"This has to be the worst fitness video I have ever seen.

In the 2nd workout, she has you bending and twisting in so many directions so quickly, it would be a miracle if the average person didn't hurt themselves. Unless you've had formal ballet training or are in great shape, this video is not for you. I've played a lot of sports in my life and consider myself active and coordinated.

We used to do these exercises during the floorwork section of an aerobics class before AFAA and IDEA took over and started restricting allowable exercises.

Doing the teaser, she uses momentum to \\"pop\\" into the position, which is not only bad technique but is dangerous and will not use the muscles the exercise is designed for. The 2nd workout includes a lot more yoga than Pilates, and some of the poses are very challenging. With Pilates, it is important to do the exercises correctly, and I don't think Denise Austin really understands Pilates technique. I recommend the Living Arts Pilates videos or Jennifer Kries's Method workout videos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this Pilates workout","review":"I purchased this originally back when vhs was the rage.

Found it and so happy with it. I love that her videos are approximately 20 minutes (there are normally 2 20 min workouts on her videos) a piece b/c with 2 small kiddos, I am always short on time. I can get a workout in during afternoon nap time. It is a nice flowing routine. I had never done a workout utilizing pilates before this one.

The book does have a wealth of black-and-white illustrations reproduced from period sources, and these are outstanding. Ms. Hartley's interpretations of medieval dress, however, are not always on the mark...page 103, for example, has a drawing of a \\"sleeveless coat\\" which is actually a mis-interpretation of a fur-trimmed sideless surcote. Also confusing is the \\"loose side piece\\" in her diagram of a hunting tunic on page 57...nothing in the period illustrations would indicate a garment cut and worn that way, and it just doesn't make sense.So...like a lot of other costume texts published in the early 20th century, don't take everything in this book for gospel truth, and double-check the details against other sources if you're looking for true authenticity."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a good start to begin from, but the flaws tend to make it a bit strange.","review":"For years I've had a photocopy of this book that I've lugged around, so I was very happy to find this as a reprint edition. One of the great things about this is that the author has done her research, and tends to construct the clothing from simple shapes -- namely if you can sew a straight line, or hem, you can make these costumes. The bad part is that there are some very odd items in here -- one tunic has a flap that ties in place, and the woman's gown is constructed in a very odd way -- you 'can' do it, but the seams look very out of place. Still, the price is good for a begining reinactor, and will instill confidence to go on and make more complicated items."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent resource","review":"this book has been a good addition to my medieval garb bookshelf.

I could type just as fast on these 3/4 sized keys as on a regular keyboard, and its rugged case made it a solid product.When I finally got my Palm Portable Keyboard and tried it out, it wasn't as good, primarily because it was somewhat flimsy and had a noticable delay during my typing.The GoType's not perfect (sometimes you slip on the small keys), but it's very effective as a laptop replacement for word processing."},{"rating":"2","title":"almost a homerun","review":"The only reason my review was four star not five, is that the key stroke feel is a little better on the Palm V GoType, and because the right shift key is a little small and out of place so that you tend to hit an arrow key when you reach for the shift key with your right pinky. I have sort of large hands and found this slightly reduced keyboard just fine for touch-typing, even for extended periods.

Sonically it is one of the finest discs ever to come out of the Real World Studios.

But it wasn't meant to be.Unfortunately many of the songs are over-produced remixes of songs already found on Up, Gabriel's latest studio album (which I do enjoy). And that's too bad -- it's a misuse of the amazing talents of Gabriel's back-up help, the Blind Boys of Alabama, who appear on both albums but are singing the same song(s) on both. Probably even the same cuts. Which is what makes this album feel so unoriginal...If you already own Up, and then buy this one, you're making a mistake.

When I contacted Bushnell for a refund, all they would do is give me half credit. Again, the 7x21x40mm model light gathering capacity is very poor as the viewing lens is quite small.

You can only do a few tricks that are bad in itself. It lacks the depth of GAMEPLAY, that a lot of designers are forgetting to work on these days. Put some effort into these games. All I have to say is that they could've made a better game w/ more moves and deeper gameplay"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Lousy Game","review":"I've played so many games on the Dreamcast that are worth spending your money on...but not Trickstyle. I agonized to get through this game. The graphics are excellent, but the gamplay is awful and totally unfun. I can't even explain why, but this game just made my stomach turn. It sounded cool, but ended up really anticlimactic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I did not enjoy this game. I rented this game for a 5 day rental. Took it back on the 2nd day. The graphics were of course gorgeous, but the gameplay just wasn't there.For hard-core board enthusiasts who want nothing else, this may be adequate. For \\"casual\\" gamers looking for a few hours of enjoyment, this will be a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost its apeal after about 5 minutes. Save your cash.","review":"This game could have been made a lot better. The graphics inthis game is less than par. I do not really have a lot to say about this game. The game play is boring. The moves and tricks are extremely limited. If you want to play a decent game, check out Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. Unless you can find this game at a bargain..... save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont be hipnitized by the graphics","review":"This game was one that i was expecting to be good.Seeing all the previews at websites made it look awsome.But i realized quik when i bought it it was completely different.Some of the visuals are very well done,but wheres the fun?It seemed like they forgot to put it in.This is a game that is all graphics,no game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Futuristic Racing it is, Fun its not!","review":"A title such as Trickstyle has great potential but suffers for designers with little vision! When playiing this game you WILL get the feeling that it needs more. You will go away feeling short changed. The graphics are cool but the control is not. this game is basically flat with little replay value, the tracks are TOO SHORT and there is no real element in the game that makes it a worthy purchase.PLAY BEFORE YOU BUY!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible game!","review":"This game is total trash. Avoid it like the plague. The frame-rates are terrible, the control is sloppy, and the game is no fun. Parents shopping for their kids should avoid this one! The only good thing about this game is the music, which isn't saying much. Don't listen to the hype or the person who gave this trash 5 stars, this game is a waste of money! There are so many quality titles coming out for DC, don't bother with this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks different than the picture","review":"Purchased this for my daughter and it's a lot skinnier than the picture portrays it and the face looks distorted.The bosy is plosh, but the eyes are really hard. I did not give it to my daughter because it was not all plush. Not very \\"Elmo\\" like."},{"rating":"1","title":"This toy looks more like a red Cookie Monster then Elmo","review":"This toy looks more like a red Cookie Monster then Elmo. And since it has no other function, and it's point is to be a soft doll that looks like Elmo, it was pretty dissapointing when I received the doll, and it didn't look like Elmo. I ended up getting my daughter one from toys r' us. It was more expense, but worth it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong collar; color is a bit lighter in person","review":"My Jasper was always breaking thru his snap collar if I needed to chain him for a bit, so I decided to go with a belt collar and boy, this is the way to go! My only<not really> complaint is that the color is a bit lighter in person so the collar is a little more feminine looking for my boy than I would prefer, but his black hair covers a lot of the collar anyway, so it's not a huge deal. Someday when I have an extra $10 lying around and decide that it really bugs me, I'll buy a darker color collar, but for now, I can live with it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good, Great introduction to the subject.","review":"A very good book, breaking down the concepts behind that hunk of silicon sitting on your desktop.

I wanted to write and let you know how much I am enjoying it and certainly will be a big help for me in my studies as a Computer System Specialist. So easy to understand and it puts everything in a more clear picture on how the working of a computer really operates. The CD was great and really enjoyed how it was presented on each topic. I wish this was one of the main books we are required to have in my course at school. We are studying Networking and your chapters of this subject which was Peer to Peer, Star, and Token are easy to understand and the visual effects really help to understand what a network operations really does. Again, just wanted to let you know how much I am enjoying this book. It will really help me, which it has already in the few hours I been studying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hope the editor went unpaid.","review":"An interesting and informative if not substantive book. This isn't a complaint, I knew this when I bought it. What I did not know is that it would be so rife with errors. I am on page 52 of the book and have found no less than 5 of them, mostly grammatical.Publishing companies: please, please hire competent editors who have some background in the English language and are also somewhat familiar with the material that is being edited.Here's a real gem, pretty much indicative of the quality of information that is sometimes passed off in the text: \\"Microsoft, (upon creating windows), could guarantee that billions of dollars of software and business data already created under DOS wouldn't still be usable.\\"Think you were looking for \\"would\\" there, chief.So what parts of this book do I trust as fact and not a typo?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to my expectations","review":"Five stars for color. Two stars for content. Overall one star because of how disappointed I was. Have you ever watched a high tech movie where all the emphasis is placed on the special effects and none on the story line, the actual content? like Star Wars' latest or The Mummy. That's what this book is like. I couldn't get into it. I thought the book was useless, hence the one star. I don't recommend it. I did like the cd-rom though."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for people serious about learning the subject","review":"I already found several other reviews that already say it, and I agree with them all: that this book is full of nice pretty pictures, but lacks explanation. Its more of a book to entertain, than it is to educate. Additionally, the author really shouldn't be making the predictions he does concerning the future of software, as that is clearly outside his area of study."},{"rating":"1","title":"How this book doesn't","review":"Hopefully some of the kinks are out of this series of books. I admit I have an earlier version. The index is usually wrong, the information scant and the overall knowledge gained minimal.If you like pictures you'll like this book. If you want to learn something significant - keep looking!The only reason I didn't give it \\"0\\" stars is because I couldn't choose \\"0\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book, but stretched a bit thin","review":"I thought that this was a pretty good book. The author made it very easy to understand a lot of the basic concepts. This book is targeted for the beginner and I would recommend it to beginners. I thought that the author could have cut a few things out. I was not particularly interested in how Palm Computers work. I also thought that the author could have excluded the part about the Internet. There is a separate book on how the internet works. Overall, I thought that it was a fairly decent book for people who want to have a basic understanding of computers."},{"rating":"2","title":"very useful for teaching","review":"I'm teacher. This graphic book is the way to comunicate for other people they can't understand only words..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional","review":"Yes, the interpretation of the piece might be a little different than you have heard before, but I do not consider that to its detriment. On the contrary, this is one of the most divine recordings I have ever heard. The interchange between Bartoli and Anderson is inspiring, to say the least. Dutroit is uniformly concise, as are the Sinfonietta. Furthermore, the digital recording retains the ranges and qualities quite well. I can understand why others might balk at this rendition, though I would urge you to leave behind any preconceptions and regard this as a singular work. It is almost scary to think what Pergolesi might have written had he not been taken from us at such an early age, though this piece would be an achievement for a person of any age. Wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too Spicy","review":"If you like Roman soup, this product will be good for you. The bowls were bigger than I thought...it took over 2 cups of water to make it.

Lliteras continues to transform Biblical figures into flesh and blood in this, his latest book in his brilliant series. But the usually smart and sensitive John Mort (see Booklist review above)seems to miss out on the strengths of The Silence of John. Lliteras has focussed in this book on the anguish of the Crucifixion's aftermath, as exemplified by the women in Jesus' circle. Each of these women is brought alive by Lliteras' art, and their pain is used to build the story gradually to an intensity that becomes almost unbearable to the reader. The plot had this reader in knots of tension, especially in the final third of the book. The Silence of John is easily the most emotionally demanding of Lliteras' Biblical series, yet because of the hope it communicates, it is also the best. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"RIPPED OFF","review":"First off i did receive the item in a fast and timly manner and i was very pleased with that, but since i had ordered this item the description has been changed when i order the item it stated that this item was a booster box and all i recieve was a single pack of cards. Also the picture of this item shows a booster box containing 10 cards per pack and 12 packs per box. If i had recieved the item i was offered i would have been very happy but due to this trickery i would not recommend ordering for this dealer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Simak. Yes, There Are Robots.","review":"One day nearly all humans disappear from earth as an experiment by God. The few men who were left behind now live for 5000 or more years without sickness, but the earth has been depleted of its resources. However, without a dependence on technology to hold them back, the humans left behind on earth learn teleportation and telekinesis. Strangely, it's the robots left on earth along with an alien visitor who search for communication with God and the way to secure a soul for themselves. Unexpectedly, a rumor circulates that the humans who disappeared from earth so many years ago are on their way back to earth."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just did not care for it.","review":"Disjointed and too many characters were presented too fast with not chance to figure out who they were and how they fit in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever and charming anti-Western diatribe","review":"A Choice of Gods covers some of the same ground as Crane's atrocious Hero's Walk and the overrated film, \\"Day the Earth Stood Still;\\" Simak suggests that humanity, or at least white people, are so monstrous that we would be better off if we were subordinate to invincible aliens. Fortunately for the reader, Simak is a charming writer, and emotionally and philosophically sophisticated (check out his complex and ambigious view of faith and religion in this book), so this novel is a good read, whatever you think of its politics and economics. Worthy of recommendation to any thoughtful SF fan, but especially to environmentalists, socialists, and people who think hunter-gatherer societies were (or should have been) the pinnacle of human development, who will love Simak's relentless attacks on industry, private property, and technology. In my opinion, not as good as Simak's City, but better than Cemetary World, the other Simaks I read in the last year or so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful reading of Shostakovich's most accessable symphony","review":"This reading by the St Louis Symphony and Mr. Slatkin has long been my favorite audio CD. Mr. Slatkin has a beautiful orchestra in the 1990's, with a powerful brass section, shimmering strings, and a polished sound. This recording of this work is far more alive than any I have heard. I had the pleasure of hearing the SLSO perform this work in 1990 or so. It was one of those \\"can't wait to the end to get out of our seats and shout\\" type of experiences. I give this recording my best recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy","review":"Would highly recommend this book for a preschool, stay at home mom, etc. Gives really good ideas if you're running out of things to do or just looking for something new."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Gem -- full of wise advice and sweet illustrations","review":"Classy hardcover guide to parenting with plenty of sound advice.

Note I double-checked my results, retracing the steps thoroughly.For a subsequent design I returned to the methods presented in the book I used for my senior-level heat transfer class (Kays and Crawford, Convective Heat and Mass Transfer), which required much less time and effort.In my opinion: 1) It takes too much time and effort to understand the theory in the book, which is required in order to use the mathematics presented; 2) The book should include practical examples of how to use the technique(s) presented; 3) There should be a thorough presentation of how the technique(s) were validated; 4) This book does not present a practical (real world) method for heat sink design."},{"rating":"2","title":"XM Review","review":"I had to purchase additional adapters to make it work with my Buick radio antenna.

It works well even on frequencies that have high powered stations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clean installation, yet no sound quality improvements","review":"The FM direct kit allows a cleaner install by moving the power supply behind the dash, but this could be done without the kit. I didn't have problems finding a clear FM station before, but the sound quality was poor through the FM modulator of the RoadyXT. I assumed (I know) that going direct to the FM input would improve the sound quality, but I was wrong. The sound is just as poor as before. Not worth the $25 in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting Yet Boring Dark Fantasy","review":"Having read a lot of fantasy novels and books with dragons, I like it when an author takes things in new directions. In his attempt to be original, Troop ends up writing something both grotesque and boring.The book is unevenly written. At times it's stiff and formal and at other times it's forid and overblown. The situations are implausible, even given the central idea that there are shapeshifting dragons living amongst us. What I found most difficult is that the main characters, who we're supposed to sympathize with, are people who callously kill and eat people. I made it about 1/4 of the way through this book before I gave up out of a mix of boredom and disgust. Avoid it at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally something new and original","review":"DRAGON MOON is a must read. Even if it is not a book that you would normally read - give it a try. This book is like no other I have read. The hero of this book is non-human and thinks of homo sapiens as food; however, you can't help but fall in love with Peter. He is a dragon who has faced many of the hardships that we face today. You cannot help but admire the man who loves his son so much even though is another species. I never read the first book and I look forward to reading it and many more Alan Troop books. There is a lot of action and suspense in DRAGON MOON but it is the characters that will win the hearts of the reader. Alan F. Troop does for dragons what Ann Rice has done for vampires."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value, crisp optics, a bit on the heavy side.","review":"I bought this for birding and general use, after a recommendation from a California Park Ranger.

First, she had to drop her son Harry off at his private school.

It definitely lacks the content and depth of most of the books we read. I found the characters pathetic, weak and self-absorbed. At some point, people need to realize that they can't blame their parents for everything that they don't like about their lives, and just move on.

Don't get this you'd regret it deeply..","review":"I was given this book and I dedicated a whole day reading it to see if there was something memorable about this story, but NO there's nothing good about this awful book. The characters are flat, no depth or character development, the story lacked passion and it has an undefined plot... This is the worst book I have read so far this year.I swear I never throw books away but this time, I tore it apart and threw it away as the worst trash ever.Imagine this 6th rate soap opera, the main character's mother left her and her father behind when she finds out that her husband's real love of his life was her own mother, that would be the main character's grandmother...No taste whatsoever and simply it's impossible to recommend.Don't get this book, you'll just feel cheated with it's trashy story and characters full of voids."},{"rating":"2","title":"great memories","review":"I was a sophomore in college when I bought this album from a \\"cut-out\\" bin - One Voice Many takes me back to those carefree days - I gave away my vinyl copy back in the '80s to another fan, thinking that it wouldn't be difficult to find a copy on CD... 20 years later it finally happens.

But I did feel much better after I threw it in the trash, thank goodness it was bought with a gift card. The manner in which Lieven waxes eloquent concerning the \\"remarkable\\" Chechens, and Shamil Basayev, the terrorist who masterminded the rape and slaughter of school children at Beslan is sickening. It would be similiar to someone of Jewish descent to read a glowing review of Adolph Hitler, or an American to read how Osama Bin Laden's actions are justified based upon our presence in Saudi Arabia. Besides, the prediction of the title shows the author had it all wrong to begin with, and obviously shows how knowledgable he is, or was, on the situation in Russia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Folklore","review":"Diakite's retelling of this African folktale involving Brother Rabbit, Chameleon, a greedy king, a magic gourd and a magic rock is delightfully and originally illustrated with photographs of intricately painted ceramic bowls, platters and tiles that tell the story in detailed and relevant images. Further decorated at the edges with mud cloth patterns, Diakite has provided two pages of additional notes at the end of the book to help clarify the patterns' meanings as well as to give some background to his home of Mali, West Africa and some language translations.While written in traditional picture book format, this book is best read to youngsters for both the joy of oral storytelling traditions which are so important to folk tales as well as because of the potential unfamiliarity of some words and the occasional irregularity of traditional English grammar. Besides, they will not be able to keep their eyes from the illustrations long enough to read a whole page! A fun family read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helping Others","review":"Brother Rabbit was being responsible by looking for food to feed his starving family.

I prefer the one piece (non folding) construction - can't put it in your pocket, but easily fits in a briefcase or backpack. Just feels solid, whereas the folding ones feel flimsy. Excellent docking base for the Palm, supports it really well.It came with some nice extras I wasn't expecting. It came with a full functioned Word Processer (complete with Spell check, a thesaurus) capable of saving in .doc format, then loading directly into Word upon HotSync. If bought by itself, this software is about the same price of the keyboard - here, it's a great free bonus. I also appreciate the fact that you can HotSync directly from the keyboard, something many other models don't do.This is a great keyboard, and truly does make the Palm function more like a mini-laptop. Well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and Useful!","review":"This product has turned my Palm Vx from a PDA into a laptop replacement. I use it to type notes, write e-mail, and pretty much everything else that requires data entry. The stylus is still necessary for many applications, but I've gotten used to it.As other reviewers have noted, there are a few quirks to work around, but they haven't seemed that serious to me. You get used to them, and the added convenience of the keyboard definitely outweighs the oddities that come from using it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh dear","review":"I saw this when It first aired on Discovery. The program is trying so hard to be like Walking with Dinosaurs but it totally fails.The main problem is there is just not enough footage and so many shots are shown repeatedly. While some of the footage is indeed interesting there are only so many shots of hairdryers thawing out a lump of hairy ice that I can take, and while them finding the first mammoth tusk was interesting by the time they had dug up the 50th I was almost asleep...There is also a problem with the CG. It is just terrible!! Whereas in walking with dinosaur you really felt that the dinosaurs were alive, in this the mammoths look horrible and dont walk relistically. The program looks like it was rushed so that it could jump aboard the Walking with Dinosaurs bandwagon.I'd recommend trying to catch a repeat on Discovery before buying this disc"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy Walking with Prehistoric Beasts","review":"This is good for watch on television once in a while. But if you want a good film about mammoths watch Walking with Prehistoric Beasts. It has just as many mammoth shots as Land of the Mammoth but are much more realistic. Not to mention all the great other creatures beasts describes. Land of the Mammoth had bad special effects. It should have talked more about cloning the creature itstead of digging in the ground and repeating the same shots over and over again. They were diging in the block but the film stops before they got to the interesting part of the block. Now it is good for hard core mammoth fans but I suggest Walking with Prehistoric Beasts."},{"rating":"1","title":"country wisdom? look elsewhere ...","review":"So why, do you ask, did I give it one star?

But she just doesn't inhabit the songs (I don't believe her) - especially \\"Love for Sale\\" and \\"Lush Life\\". I think she'd do better sticking to material she can musically handle.

Not quite as good as The Shouting Stage in my view, but close. Joan should be in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Her body of work compares favorably to any other artist over the past forty years, including Van Morrison and, yes, even Bob Dylan. She fuses folk, soul, blues and rock with overtones of reggae and calypso. Her incredible voice is the thing that stands out the most. Her lyrics, while good, have never set her apart. But her use of interesting rhythms and melodies and her light soulful voice, often repeating phrases until they lodge in the back of your cranium, makes her best songs listenable over and over. This album stays strong from start (\\"In Your Eyes\\") through finish (\\"Shape of A Boy\\").

The song's positive vibe conjures summertime imagery such as driving, jogging, or hang gliding alongside a beach. Listen closely and you can hear exotic percussion and what sounds like simulated seagulls deep in the music.I would have liked more remixes.

I've bought every one of her books I can lay my hands on, but this one was a big mistake. I continually roll my eyes at the absurdity of the situations, expressions and personalities of these people. Without even looking at the date this was published (1984), I knew it had to be a very early attempt at writing. It's like something I've written in my spare time and I've never been published. Neither do I believe the tripe I wrote in my late teens, early 20s is any good. Just as this is very poorly written. I guess we all have to go through difficult growing stages and, if anything, this book proves that Ms. McNaught has made the jump from adolescence to adulthood in terms of her writing.

Both of them are SO unprofessional.How did Lauren stay a virgin up to this point in her life if it takes so little for her to sleep with Nick? I think his reaction was probably rational if a little cold.There were so many moments in this book that resembled other little moments in JM's other books. She cannot write a totally new, original book. And she also takes up a good chunk of space in every book recounting the entire love affair during The Separation. There's always a Separation in every story of hers."},{"rating":"2","title":"CLASSIC MC NAUGHT","review":"Excellent book!

He treats the heroine like crap. Seduces her and tries to force her to continue their affair when she starts working for him even though he makes it clear he will NEVER marry her and that is all they have. Then, at the end of the book, he accuses her of something she doesn't do. Completely degrades and humiliates her as does everyone else who knows her and should know she wouldn't do what she is accused of. Then, when he finds out she's innocent, he goes to her and she instantly forgives him. This book makes me sick. I feel it is an insult to women that the heroine allows the hero to treat her that way and then just instantly forgives him. I would have had much more respect for her if she had made him suffer for the way he treated her but she doesn't. She just lets him treat her like crap and comes back begging for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book!","review":"I love all of McNaught's books, can hardly wait for a new one.

And I had a feeling it would be after the first 2 chapters.Nick was great but I didn't like Lauren in the least bit. The storyline seemed very rushed and the chemistry between the two was at a minimum luke warm...If this is your first McNaught book please take my advice and do not read this one first.

I really love Judith McNaught, but buy a different book, not this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uck.","review":"I've read many of Judith McNaught's novels, and this is probably my least favorite so far. I am not so much a fan of the contemporary romances in the first place, but I am always willing to read a J.M. book, contemporary or not, but this book was a waste of time. Aside from the fact that I was able to finish the entire thing in a matter of a few hours on a lazy afternoon, I felt that it wasn't quite up to par with her usual character development, and was just kind of... cheesy. I guess if you want a really quick read with some cheap thrills, this one's for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Original Charistian Grey","review":"I just want to say that after reading 50 Shades of Grey I told myself..wow it's Judith McNaught's Double Standards Except for the BSDM! :D"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor Judith McNaught","review":"Judith McNaught is my favourite romance author. Her books are generally witty, hilarious at points and always have good character development and a story line. Unfortunately Double Standards does not live up to that. If I wanted to read Mills and Boon I would buy that. Where do you hear that the heroine falls into bed with the hero within 2 days of meeting him. Then by the time to book carries on with the story it is half finished. I could not identify with either the hero or heroine in the novel and very little character development took place.I enjoyed all Ms McNaughts historical romances and Perfect and Paradise. I would give the historical romances a 5 out of 5 rating and Perfect and Paradise a 4.5 out of 5 rating. All to be recommended, but I will not buy any more of her books in the near future. I will have to wait until they get to my local library - then I won't feel like I have wasted my money when I don't bother to finish the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"Double Standards was the 1st book I read by Judith Mcnaught. I loved it. I was so eager to find an author that wrote books like Jude Deveraux( 1 of my fav authors). Judith McNaught is this person. I couldn't put the book down. It was great!~! I loved the co-characters like Tony and Mary they made the book more interesting. It's a great book overall and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super read","review":"This was my first McNaught book and it was the start of many hours of reading this great author. I wish she would write faster but I understand she writes slow because she wants her books to be perfect and it shows. I loved the characters esp. Nick. This book is a keeper that I pull out frequently an reread and I still enjoy it as much as the first time I read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Double Standards was great!","review":"I loved Double Standards. I thought the characters were well written especially Nick because his way of treating women before he met Lauren was a backlash from the relationship he had with his mother. I loved the way Judith McNaught tied that into the storyline. As far as Lauren goes, I thought her falling in love at first sight was cute but she was only 22 and had not yet had a serious relationship before Nick so it was a little hard to believe she actually knew what she really wanted at that point in her life. However I could overlook that because the rest of the story was so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book","review":"Judith McNaught is my favorite writer.

Dubbing was very intuitive. Despite some other reviews that said the color was washed-out, we didn't have any problems with color issues. However, the audio function was terrible. While playing DVDs (which is most of the mileage we would put on the machine) the audio sounded hollow and tinny -- like an echo chamber. Neither my wife or I are audiophiles -- this just sounded bad. We tweaked every setting, and triple-checked all the connections, but nothing helped. Finally, we just hooked our old player back up and the sound was fine. Ultimately, we returned the unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product returned","review":"I have never been disappointed in a Sony product until trying the RDRVX515 DVD/VCR recorder. I currently own and use two other Sony DVD recorders. The RDRVX515 is totally inferior to the other two. The signal and recording quality are frankly not acceptable - the definition is just not there. Also, when I tried to record a movie on several of the cable premium channels, it recorded for a few seconds and then stopped and a message came up saying that \\"you cannot record copy protected movies\\". This makes the recorder totally useless to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed too","review":"All my electronics are Sony, so I was expecting great things. My primary reason purchasing this DVD Recorder was to transfer all my VHS tapes to DVD. But, as the other reviewer noted, I have experienced quite a few problems. The disc freezes during Finalization when you are done recording a VHS Tape to DVD and you have to unplug the unit to reset it (not a big deal if the plug is accessible). I have wasted too many DVD's having to re-record them. Sometimes the original VHS tape is better quality than the DVD copy. I returned my first one and was refunded my first purchase and sent another one. I am now having to send the second one back to due to sound issue with it. Sony is no help at all, they don't want to admit there is a problem. I am having my 3rd one sent today and if the problems persist, I am done with this Sony product!

Yet, record the exact same channel on DVD and it looks great, even the slow (3 - 4 hour/DVD) speeds look OK. 30% of the time it fails to finalize or says there's a disk error after timed recording and makes coasters out of DVD's. VHF to DVD or DVD to VHS dubing is severely hindered by the poor quality of the VHS deck. Yet, if I play the same tape on my 20 year old JVC and record on the Sony, it looks great. Returned to their service and was told \\"no problem found\\" Yeah, right. I'm gonna try one last time to complain to Sony, then it literally goes in the trash, since it is not only a poor performer, but I can't count on it to work.

The VCR recording quality is terrible: murky and the sound is tinny and muted. The DVD recording manuel would take a NASA scientist to understand and then, when you finally do figure out the instructions and follow them to the letter, sometimes the DVD recorder records, and other times gets locked into the \\"Loading\\" function and simply won't read or record a DVD at all. The timer for DVD recordings is unreliable and as stated before, sometimes it records and others it does not.

Out of 12+ tries dubbing home VHS movies, only one DVD disk completed without errors, despite trying three different brands of DVD disks, including Sony. The DVD drive refuses to eject disks for up to 30 minutes, which gets REAL frustrating. It scratches factory movie DVDs. The thick manual does not help. Finally sent it back to Sony and still waiting for it, but after reading the other reviews with the same type of problems, it sounds like I bought my first Sony lemon.

The biggest problem is it has a block not to record \\"copy-righted\\" programs. In other words, when you try to record a movie or a program that contains a copy-right signal, the machine detects it and blocks it from being recorded.

Not far into the stand's assembly I realized that the top section was double-layers of the same footprint shape, the two separated by a crude swivel mechanism. To angle a TV you would have to swivel the full-size table top, but with the stand placed against a room wall (as they normally are) the end of the table top would hit the wall before the TV angled to any useful degree. The double top also made the total stand insanely heavy - over 70 lbs. of compressed fiberboard and glass panels - but I believe the finished stand would be a very durable piece.

With these minor grievances aside, however, electronica fans will probably like this a heck of a lot.

But it has rich 3D enviroments, and good definition in characters.Sound-7/10- The music gives you the scary feeling you would expect from an RE game. The only bad thing is the voice acting. It aint horrible, just not what you expected. It's better than previous games.Gameplay/Story developement-10/10- The gameplay itself is excellent. But, unlike the Dreamcast version of RE2, there is no custom controls. That would have made the gameplay better. The story continues directly from RE2 (RE3 did little to develop the Resident Evil Plot) and brings the fight to umbrella.

This isn't so much an action game as an adventure game with some action elements. It's based on the puzzles and the exposition of the storyline, so it may disappoint those who were expecting the chance to shoot more zombies. Definitely a game to play at night with the lights off (daylight tends to lessen the creepiness of the game.) The graphics are fantastic, better than anything on N64 or PSX.My only big complaint is more with the awkwardness of the Dreamcast control than with the game controls themselves. A little too big for someone used to the smaller playstation controllers.

C:V was the first game in the series to feature highly detailed polygon backgrounds, tapping into the power of the DC. This coupled with some of the deepest most challenging, frightening gameplay in the entire series, and you have a game that is a must-have for both Dreamcast collectors or those who need absolutely every RE game ever made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Control Ever","review":"I will agree that this game has probably the best graphics I've ever seen, but that can't make up for the control you have. It is almost impossible at times to fight anyone or anything and you usually just end up dead or dying. I guess I was spoiled from playing Shadow Man which is the best Sega Dreamcast game to date. The only reason this gets two stars is because of the graphics...because game control sucks monkeys. I read all the reviews on this game and I was totally psyched to get it in the mail but then was quickly disappointed. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corny...!","review":"Now before I start talking about how bad this game is, I would first like to state out the few positive things about this game. .The graphics in this game are truly stunning, and it certainly creates a truly scary atmosphere, but, unfortunately, that's about it on the positive side.This game is an absolute mess. The controls are horrible, and the puzzles make this game a tad too difficult without a stategy guide. Now for what I really wrote this review about, the game's story. It's like a jolly awful b-movie. The voice acting is atrocious, and the story is about as believable as Pat Buchanen becoming president (brrrr!). Believe me, it is extremely corny! The people who made this game could have done alot than this! Rent the game if you wish, but please don't buy it! When it's all said and done it's a complete waste of time, and a rip-off!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Scary","review":"I cannot begin to express my disappointment with RE:CV. I bought a Dreamcast specifically for this title, and when I began to play it my stomach sunk. First off ALL THE GORE IS GONE, when I first heard this I thought it wouldn't make a difference, but all in all it totally ruins the \\"Horror\\" theme of the game. Lets hope their is a code to open it up. The voice acting is still lame, but the story is pretty good, definately better than RE3. The graphics are stunning, the intro is borderline breathe taking. Unfortuantely a lot of fog has found it's way into the Resident Evil universe due to this upgrade. I'd have to say rent this first and see if you enjoy it. I can see hardcore finds loving it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thsi si a very bade gaem! @","review":"first of i wnat to say this gavme is a very bad, i find it very disturbing to shot the mummies in the head, also it should have a cyclops. it is k3wl when you kill the giant spidars too, cause i beat it already but if you are in a queer mood and are looking for some \\"fun\\" you could do a little better than this game. maybe get residant evil 2, it has vary good graphcics , bettar than theis one i think, much more realaistic, but that is persoantal prfeffrence. if you are instersted in more of my reviews eamail me and maybe i will set up a reveiew sitezor!

I have a knife and try and kill em. I somehow do it. Im thinking ugh this game is gonna be hard! What do i do? Keep playing and run oit of ammo fast and die!

It contains undocumented hearsay and very little that has not already been written about in more substantial books. Many ideas are untested guesses.

The unit is roomy and has interesting features (i.e. comes with an A/C adapter for power back up purposes). The unit worked fine at first, then 19 hrs. later failed to release the latch (correct code input, hear a whir sound, but the door does not release). The exact problem many reviews mentioned presented itself in my unit < 24 hrs. after purchase.This type of product needs to be RELIABLE!

The top shelf is perfect for a smaller pistol and the bottom holds the larger. If you have two full size 1911 pistols or similar, it'll be a tight fit. Personally, I love it though based on my needs. The safe is compact, it's not obtrusive as it fits nicely on the nightstand shelves and the dark coloring does not make it stand out like a sore thumb.

The light inside is a great addition as is the powered backup. It is very sturdy and well-built and thought out. The instructions are easy to understand and though accessing some of the programming features is a little cumbersome, you only have to do it once and it works great.

If I was in a hurry to get to my weapon, I would be dead. It takes the code every time..it clicks.. but does not open until you put in the code twice...or maybe three times. I have found that if you gently close it, it will open on the first try the next time but if you slap it closed it takes two or three tries to open. Also, it isnt as easy to attach the cable to it. The instructions say \\"Just punch out the pre defined holes\\"...well guess again...I bent the hell outta the thing before I got my drill out and drilled out the \\"just punch out\\" holes.

I had no problems with the door accidentally opening, or the door not closing properly as some others have described.

I'm one of those geeks who always reads the owner's manual, though.Installing the batteries is a bit of a trick, but again, the manual explains the entire process well.It's a tight fit, but I'm able to fit two full sized 45ACP's, my FN 5.7 plus extra clips for each gun in my vault."},{"rating":"2","title":"The bad reviews are both right and worng","review":"If the safe has a weak battery or and is not plugged in it does not work well. see bad reviews, they are telling you what happens if this safe is using low batteries.

My roomate bought NFL2K and after playing that I can say without a doubt that's the better choice to make.

Mind you, I don't do a lot of driving, and frequently wouldn't even use it, so it got very little use. One day I had it on and went over a bump and it shut off. I checked it, it was seated well - and I barely touched it and it started up again. It kept doing that - so I figured out there must be a short in there somewhere. I didn't touch it during use other than to plug it in or remove it, and I'm very kind to my electronics. It just isn't well made if someone like me that hardly used it can have issues with it breaking. I was disappointed because it was a neat little item. I did not contact customer service because some things don't seem worth my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only worth it if you don't have a cassette player in your car","review":"I bought this item so I could listen to my iPod in the car. It is \\"ok\\" for what it is. But, the sound quality is not that great. I live in a small town and just about every station has something on it - very few empty stations so it was very hard to find one that the iPod would play over. I didn't realize that you could just get a cassette player adapter to achieve the same (actually better) results. I found one of those at Walmart for $10 and the sound quality is MUCH better on it than trying to run it through an FM station. SO, if you have a cassette player in your car, that is definitely the better route. If not, then your only choice would be to go the FM transmitter route. Maybe you'll have better success finding an empty station than I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"ITOUCH FM TRANSMITTER WITH REMOTE","review":"THE Satechi FM TRANSMITTER FOR IPHONE OR ITOUCH.

The sound is great once you find the right station to tune to, which is very easy to do. The only slight trouble I had was adjusting the side arms that hold the Ipod in place. They were difficult to pull out to release the Ipod, but once in place it holds the unit securely. I recommend this and would get it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice unit, does it all","review":"I liked the unit for it's All-in-One-ness - It's a charger, a holder, an FM transmitter and a USB charger.I only gave it 4 stars because it doesn't quite fit right in my car (Camry) - I can't tilt it back as I'd like because it bumps up against an overhang above the power outlet. Other than that, it's been great. I had to take some time to find a good 'empty' frequency (which meant figuring how to manually tune the car radio...not a big deal), but once there, it sounds good and clear. The remote works nicely too. Onenote - with an iPhone, some iPod options will not work as they would on a 'regular' iPod. The play controls work though, and that's what I really wanted. I also found that the iPhone works great as a speakerphone through this.So, to sum up - very nice device, does what it's supposed to do and nicely priced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ipod car kit","review":"Great Product, Great Service and Fast Delivery, what more could I ask for.

I hope this helps save someone time searching for the \\"best\\" product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Technology fine, basic physics a problem","review":"Have owned this transmitter/charger for about a month and it's been good to me and my ipod as far as i can tell. It transmitts fine as long as there's not a stronger signal coming in (could be difficult in urban areas...), but it is frustrating to change frequencies if a signal does crop up because it changes very, very slowly (making it a dangerous task when driving). Also, the tilting mechanism is all plastic except for the bolt and, despite very careful handling, the plastic keeping the nut in place broke. It cannot handle any torque, a common problem in other reviews as well. I have now super-glued the nut to the device and it stays tilted in position as long as the road is not too bumpy. Other than the chincy construction, it works well, and I will nurse it along for years i'm sure. But there will probably be something better on the market soon, as there is a lot to improve upon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't fit Subaru","review":"I loved the quality of this product... well made.

It made all the songs on my iPod Touch 2G sound like an out of tune radio station, no matter what frequency I had it set to. The remote works if you point it directly at the unit, otherwise it doesn't, and the gear that's supposed to prevent the unit from tilting, doesn't. The part that is inserted into the cigarette lighter was broken out of the box, and the whole thing felt clunky.

Once in a while you might hear interferences from radio towers near strong signals but the sound is good otherwise when on the right frequency.

Why does the iPod turn on when the car is turned on but the FM transmitter has to be turned on with the remote? The blast of white noise from the radio is very disconcerting during this interval. And then the opposite happens when you turn the car off. The transmitter shuts down (obviously) but the iPod remains cooking and has to be shut off manually.An update; the screw that clamps the pivot to keep the device at a set angle, pulled out of its mount. The unit is trash now. All things considered this was not a good purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!","review":"Thia product is absolutely terrible.

I guess all these RF devices have pretty bad sound though.I would recommend just saving your money and purchasing a new CD player that has an 1/8in. jack for ipods or other mp3 players. This is what I will be doing. I would rather have a tape player so I could use my old tape adapter with my ipod. That works much better than this thing.I don't think I will EVER by a RF device again - I guess if you only drive around a 10 mile radius you might be okay - still the sound quality is pretty laughable... especially when you've got windows up and not much outside noise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good gizmo for the price","review":"FM transmitters for ipod/touch/iphone are notorious for being too susceptible to interference from outside stations and from having pretty bad sound quality.

Even in here there are some chords missing. A common form of D+ is not in here even though there are 26 D+ variations listed.

Flat hands severely restrict what you can do on the keyboard, and this shows in the recording. This CD comes in nice packaging with all kinds of impressive photos so that the uninitiated audience might actually buy it (thinking that it is good). Do not be fooled! The only reason Helfgott is so famous is because he poses a Holywood story: a psychotic individual with personal problems who transcended his illness through art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clapped-out pianola","review":"I recently heard Freddy Kempf play this piece in Leeds Town Hall and was completely blown away. For some odd reason, Mr Kempf has not yet deemed his performance worthy of a CD release, so I though, (maybe carried away with the hype from 'Shine') that David Helfgott might do this piece justice (I particulary enjoyed his rendition of Liszt's Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2 on 'Brilliantissimo').How wrong I was. The climax of the first movement is absolutely ruined by bum notes, such that the performance sounds as if Helgott was replaced by a four-year-old playing on a clapped-out pianola.And coundn't the piano have been miked up so that you can't hear Helfgotts heavy breathing/miscellaneous noises? It's extremely distracting and adds nothing to the performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"This isn't so great, but try some other Helfgott selections!","review":"This is certainly not the best representation of David Helfgott's ability. All the hype and emotion surrounding this recording caused David to become very nervous and he did make a lot of mistakes, but I guess that is to be expected considering he didn't play the piano for a full ten years during treatment for his mental condition. He did play this piece wonderfully about thirty years ago and won the Gold Medal at the London music academy, so he was once perfectly able. Anyway, I encourage anyone to give him another chance by trying either his Brilliantissimo or Brave New World CDs. Those are absolutely great!! Don't let this bad sample scare you away; he's still my favorite!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"Despite the rather poor quality of his performance here, I think we should all give poor David Helfgott a break! Why did this recording stink so much?!?! WATCH SHINE!! The unfortunate soul spent years in and out of mental institutions, and was perceivably out of practice for as many years. Criticize him negatively if you must; I must say I do not understand how anyone could put down something like Mr. Helfgott. I think David is simply an angel with tired wings. Please don't give him a hurricane to fly through."},{"rating":"2","title":"David Helfgott- An icon for piano lovers everywhere","review":"I own a copy of this CD, and I am very fortunate I bought it. To have David record a CD like this after the success of \\"Shine\\" is what I think makes this album so special. People will be lucky if they buy this recording of the Rachmaninoff piano concerto no. 3 because David is so commited to the piece. If you've heard a recording of this piece before, you'll either love this one or hate it. I have heard two recordings before this one, and so far this is the best. But if you're not impressed with the piano concerto, the preludes are all good. The Prelude in G Minor is my favorite. If you've never owned a classical cd, this is a good place to start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another bad record...","review":"Let's be serious and face up to the facts: bad records come in hundreds every year. Helfgott's disastrous rendition of Rach 3 may be even worse than the usual clumsy products released by major labels, but it's in no way exceptional as a phenomenon - fraud and bad pianism abound in the market as much as wrong notes on this record. I'd love to see people saving some of their harsh criticism for plenty of supposed masters whose talent depend more on hype and lavish sound engineering than on technique, profoundity and understanding. At least Helfgott has his mental condition as an alibi. If we held many of the much acclaimed pianists who made into the big industry to the same standards we hold Helfgott here at Amazon, or even higher standards since some of them are, mentally speaking, perfectly healthy, the outcome would be deeply discouraging, I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did they or I bother?","review":"The review title says it all.Sorry for not being particularly 'helpful', but if you don't buy it or have the misfortune of being inflicted with it as a gift, then my work here is done.

For example, I would have great difficulty comparing Rachmaninoff's third piano concerto being performed by Kissin and Augerich. I own both recordings and in my estimation, they are both great. But just listen to this mess! I am sure that Helfgott was once great, and maybe can be again. But this is a butchery of such a great piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want to scrape this CD","review":"After you hear this CD, you would not love Rachmaninov anymore. The performance is so weird."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pitiful","review":"It's hard to find words to explain how awful this recording is. Obviously one has to feel tremendous sympathy and admiration for Mr. Helfgott as a person and for his courage. Unfortunately his fingers are not up to the music. There are heaps and heaps of missed or wrong notes and a great deal of bizarre sforzandos and tempo changes. At some point in his life he was obviously an excellent pianist and his musicality is good. He actually plays the opening page of the Rach 3 quite beautifully, but the rest of it is best forgotten.It's a very sad recording. Mr. Helfgott is not the first pianist to have had psychiatric problems, nor will he be the last. He sounds like he is playing under the influence of anti-depressants or sedatives, nor is he the first pianist to do that in public. Listening to this is not life-affirming or uplifting. It's depressing and embarrassing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Nooooooooooooooo","review":"Let's separate the noble struggle of Helfgott the man and the preposterous notion that he can play this masterpiece. He can't. Doesn't even come close. If the novice listener was \\"blown away\\" by this performance, then it must be by what's left of the music after DH gets through it. Do yourself a favor and listen to a master --- Watts, Ashkenazy, Ortiz, Horowitz, Berman, Argerich, Gilels ---bring out the music here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ummm... C-","review":"This \\"interpretation\\" of the Rachmaninoff D-minor played here by Helfgott was my first exposure to all three movements of the concerto. Many times Helfgott seems to throw his hands in the general direction of the notes and is right more than 50% of the time. Buy it for Helfgott, NOT for Rachmaninoff. I wish I could cheaply acquire a few more Rach 3 recordings, especially the Argerich, the two final Horowitzes, any others??"},{"rating":"1","title":"A greatly hyped, but disappointing performance","review":"This is a very disappointing performance (wildly uneven would be an understatement). Today, I don't expect technical performance weaknesses to take so much away from the musicianship, but in this performance, I have difficulty listening to the musicianship on account of the technical struggles that are so much in evidence (he should have stayed with the simpler 1st movt. cadenza!). I think it is wonderful that Shine may have encouraged so many first timers to listen to classical music, I just wish it could have been to a performance that we could all agree to hold in high esteem."},{"rating":"1","title":"An awful Rachmaninoff Third!","review":"If you've only heard Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 3 as performed by Helfgott, you haven't heard the heights to which this music is capable of soaring. Indeed, Helfgott is inaccurate and sloppy. He does not pour much emotion into the Third at all....I personally was impressed by Jean-Yves Thibaudet's recent recording on London/Decca and, inevitably, Martha Argerich's on the Philips label. Van Cliburn does a decent job, too, recording his rendition of the D-minor concerto live in 1958."},{"rating":"1","title":"an interesting interpretation","review":"This is the first recording of Rach 3 I had ever heard, and after listening to it a few times I knew something wasn't right. So I bought other recordings. The cadenza and the climaxes are all bad and confusing, but there are some interesting parts. It's nice to hear different interpretations of those passages where the pianist is given the freedom of rubatto or accelerando(sp?). It's not a very good recording, but it's worth listening to for different ideas if you're interested in this piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"A for effort only","review":"Poor David Helfgott. This has gotta be one of the worst recordings of the Rach 3 available. Missed notes everywhere - it's terrible - and some notes which don't actually belong there thrown in! The tempo is clumsy and erratic, making the listener grimace in pain. For a true listening of the Rach 3, check out \\"Horowitz Plays Rachmaninoff\\" on RCA Victor. Martha Algerich (available on the Phillips label) does a nice job as well. But no matter who you select, it will be vastly better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this.","review":"This is an awful, awful recording of Rachmaninof's wonderful work. It is overblown, way way too staccatto in many spots, disjointed, etc. etc. etc. Buy the movie, that's fine: it was a great movie. But do not buy any of his recordings. They are horribly played and are exploitative. I suggest, for the concerto, the Andre Watts recording. As a musician, I am offended that people will make a pity-purchase and get this, while there are many, many young artists putting as much or more work into what they are doing as Mr. Helfgott and being completely ignored by the public. Don't let the media brainwash you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Davids father was right....","review":"..he should have stayed on the farm in Australia. The movie got it quite wrong. This CD shows that David completely lacks both technique and worst of all, artistry. I suppose we have to be sensitive to his breakdown, but I want the money back that I totally wasted on this disaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"David Helfgott mutilates Rachmaninov","review":"This CD can only be described as awful. Helfgott is no genius, he is one of the worst piano players recorded ever since Edison invented the phonograph. If I had more patience I would have counted how many times Helfgott misses a note. His sloppy \\"interpretation\\" of Rachmaninoff's piano concerto cannot be excused by the fact that this is supposed to be a live performance. In the liner notes, the word \\"live\\" is given in quotes, which indicates that Helfgott was not able to play the concerto in one take. In fact, there are several places where it appears that the recording was spliced together. Even the players from the Copenhagen Philharmonic, in particular the woodwind section, sound tired and worn out. It is sad to see so many people deceived by a film that has little to do with the real man. I have one recommendation for all the \\"Shine\\" lovers out there: enjoy the film and then buy a recording with Horowitz."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"What a great read !!! I couldn't put this book down. It was really addicting and Emily Giffin did such a fabulous job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Borrowed!","review":"I originally fell in love with Something Borrowed. I completely identified with that main character and couldn't stand Darcy at all. So when I found out that the sequel to the book was Something Blue and it focused on Darcy herself. Well, let's just say I wasn't keen on that idea at all! But I read a review stating that they felt the same way and yet they fell in love with Something Blue. So I went on a whim and bought it. I am so glad that I did! I actually loved this book nearly as much as, if not more than, Something Borrowed. Something Blue is definitely worth your purchase and the twist of the character Darcy is worth diving into to figure out. It made me relate to Darcy in a way that I didn't realize was possible. Definitely a good read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than \\"Something Borrowed\\"","review":"I read Something Borrowed and I really liked it, but Something Blue is a lot better!

I'm glad I'm not the only one who teared up at the end ;)Even though Darcy goes through some major hurdles, she still gets what she wants in the end, despite most of the story trying to show Darcy dealing with not getting her own way. Still, I loved the book and it made me like Darcy and understand her point of view."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as \\"Something Borrowed\\"","review":"I found \\"Something Blue\\" to be a poor follow-up to \\"Something Borrowed\\". Borrowed introduced us to the Sex & the City world of fashion, fun, and love. Blue turns it's back on the very thing that made Borrowed successful, but not to a pleasing conclusion. Darcy's crises are predictable, the resolutions obvious and inevitable. Where Borrowed presented some interesting AND entertaining challenges, Blue seeks to be the made for tv movie that ties everything up in a neat and tidy bow. If you enjoyed Borrowed, I would let the characters live on in your imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The premise of the book was exciting - experiencing the situation through Darcy's point of view, but quickly became disappointing. Although the book shows that people can change, it seems forced and loses its appeal about a third of the way through.It was also frustrating that Darcy never made the connection that her \`soul mate' type feelings for Ethan that \`she couldn't help' may have been the exact same feelings that Kate and Dex could have had for each other.Wouldn't recommend as a must read, would barely recommend as an \`if you have time read'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sequel!!","review":"Great sequel to \\"Something Borrowed!\\" Makes you fall in love with Darcy like you loved Rachel.

I didn't read Something Borrowed, but I absolutely love this one. The characters are flawed and real- and despite the unrealistic plot, they make it way worth it to read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok, so I liked it.","review":"I enjoyed this story as much as 'Borrowed', as both books are page-turners; however, they are page-turners in different ways. During 'Borrowed', your mouth is usually agape due to the shock of what's unfolding...during \`Blue', you get to watch Darcy Rhone's transformation. Some reviewers' say it's not believable for Darcy to change \`just like that', but what I got was that this person she became is really who she was all along, it just took her some time to become okay with knowing and understanding who she really was. At any rate, I do highly recommend both books. You should definitely read \`Borrowed' first, as you really won't fully appreciate \`Blue' not having done so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep looking","review":"If you're looking for a light weight but entertaining novel, keep looking. The main character is so shallow, unappealing and cardboard like that you are at a complete loss to understandwhy any other character in the book can tolerate her.It was a waste of the hour and a half it took to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"something new... somewhat","review":"This is the sequel to \\"Something Borrowed\\"... read that one first. If you liked it, then I would recommend this book. It's written in the same style and with the same flair and exuberance.I started reading, prepared to dislike Darcy. However, Emily Griffin successfully narrates her character's journey of growth in a entertaining way which wins you over to the Darcy's plight. It was definitely a predictable (and not too realisitic) story but I still had fun along the way. Actually, I ended up liking this book better than something borrowed because it was less about guilt and more about growth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing sequel","review":"I am very surprised at the great reviews that this book has received. The entire book seems to be told from the perspective of Rachel is she were to put herself in Darcy's shoes. The character is not believable as an actual person, and definitely did not garner any sympathy from me. Part of the reason the character is not believable is because she seems to have a lot of insight into her actions even at the very beginning. She knows what actions of hers will be unacceptable to the majority of her friends and family. In addition, it was disappointing to read the second chapter, which was pretty much verbatim one of the last chapters in Something Borrowed. Knowing that memory is not something that we can just rewind and play, this part was especially unrealistic and disappointing. I would save your money and instead pick up a book by Sophie Kinsella."},{"rating":"1","title":"over hyped!","review":"This is very, very chick lit light if ever I have read one. And what a contrived ending. I can not believe the high marks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good style of writing, lousy message","review":"Basically Emily Giffin sends a horrible message about morality in both her books regarding Darcy and Rachel. She says that if a friendship or relationship is flawed, then it's probable and even acceptable to lie and cheat. Basically your integrity is based on outside influences and not who you are on the inside. For people to sympathize or ally with either Darcy or Rachel makes me really question our society's values."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally unbelievable and boring","review":"The main problem with this book is that the lead character, Darcy, was painted in such a negative light in the first book \\"Something Borrowed\\" that the reader finds it very hard to feel any connection, or empathy with her.In addition, the plot is very weak, with no sense of realism...the whole story is just ridiculous. I don't know why some people are giving this book 5 stars...all I can think is that they must set their bar very low."},{"rating":"2","title":"ready for the movie now.","review":"I loved something borrowed, the movie and the book.

Looking forward to the movie!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sequel","review":"If you liked Giffin's \\"Something Borrowed\\" (the prequel to this book), then you will like Something Blue. In Something Borrowed, you are introduced to Darcy Rhone, a spoiled, shallow woman who cheats on her husband and is cheated on by her husband. I came to hate her in Something Borrowed, but was still interested in reading this novel to follow her journey.In the beginning of this book, Darcy was still very much unlikable, but as her journey progresses, she gradually evolves, as she is now pregnant with twins and alone. I really enjoyed this book and felt that Darcy's evolution was believable and genuine. As with all Giffin's books, this was a quick read and became addicting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down . . .","review":"It's already been said many times, but like many, I was initially skeptical and unsure about reading this book. I wasn't sure Something Blue could measure up to the excitement of Something Borrowed. But it did. In fact, I like the sequel much better. Everything is tied in nicely.Though it's been fun getting to know the characters in this 2-part series, I am glad that Emily will be coming out with a new book with completely different characters. I'm sure it will be a page-turner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this one even better!","review":"I loved Something Borrowed and I admit, I was a bit skeptical of Something Blue because it was all about Darcy (instead of Rachel and Dex). The first half of Something Blue was more of Darcy and her self-absorbed self, but when she finally is forced to face the truth about herself the rest of the story is wonderful & sweet. I found myself rooting for Darcy and I loved the ending! Don't hesitate to buy this set, but definitely get both of the books together so you can read them right after each other!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fluff","review":"I received this book last year as a bridal shower gift. It was a nice way to get away from the hussle of my wedding plans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something Even Better","review":"I really enjoyed Something Borrowed but this book definitely took the cake. It is a continuation and recap of the first book, this time taking on the point of view of Darcy, Rachel's best friend. In the beginning, Darcy has such hate and resentment for both Rachel and Dex that she literally cannot even think straight. She wants to make them both jealous and miserable by taking her relationship with Ethan even further with the father of her unborn child and groomsman from her wedding. As she becomes more obsessed with Rachel and Dex's relationship and betrayal to her, she becomes more neurotic, pushing her new relationship to break.After reaching her breaking point with her family, her man, her new \\"best friend\\" and basically herself, Darcy decides to visit her and Rachel's childhood friend, Ethan, in London.

I finished the book in one day, I couldn't put it downEmily Griffin is a great author. I can't wait go read her next one"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good sequel","review":"In this book, we get to see Darcy's side of the story. While this book will not be winning a Pulitzer anytime soon, it is a fun read and I appreciate that Darcy as seen in SOmething Borrowed is not instantly transformed into the sweet, innocent, victim. she is still as self obsessed as ever on her own journey."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Get the Draw","review":"Darcy has always been the popular, pretty girl who has it all. Then, weeks before her wedding to Dex, she admits her affair with groomsman Marcus, discovers Dex was cheating with maid of honor Rachel and then finds out she is pregnant. After things with Marcus dissolve, she flees to London to crash with her childhood friend Ethan. With her life in tatters, Darcy is forced to make major life changes and she finds happiness with Ethan, makes amends with Rachel (who marries Dex) and has her twin boys.Although I am all for a story where the pretty girl eats crow, this story was too over-the-top. No one carrying twins would go from a 4 to only a 6 at 5 months along. No one at 30 who spends like Darcy could go for 8 months without working and still buy designer clothing and fly business class to London. Ethan would never fall for Darcy given their history. Someone as selfish as Darcy never would have had the babies in the first place and Marcus was just too stereotypically lame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never closes the deal","review":"I read Something Borrowed and found the story entertaining. I wasn't interested in reading the story of the spoiled friend; however the reviews changed my mind. I should have stuck with my original opinion. Darcy is never redeemed. She is the spoiled rich girl the entire book. She never stands on her own two feet. She goes from one guy to another. She is always being cared for by some guy. She never matures in my opinion which made the story boring and annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wasn't expecting to like it...","review":"HOnestly, I fully expected this book to be a disappointment. I had finished Something Borrowed, (absolutely amazing, my favorite book of all time) and thought there is no way the \\"Darcy\\" version of the story could be anywhere as good as the first. I was pleasantly surprised. Though Darcy is a total pain in the a**, she becomes somewhat of a likeable character towards the end of Soemthing Blue. It definitely is interesting to see her take on things and try to become a better person. I thoroughly enjoyed both of these books, and while Something Blue certainly does not top Something Borrowed, it is an absloute must-read! If you liked the first, you will not be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow Start but enjoyable journey into the mind of a mean girl","review":"This is the second Emily Giffen book I've read. The first being \\"Something Borrowed.\\" I loved that book so much. Since I'm always a sucker for sequels, I had to read Something Blue.I'm giving it 4 stars because I think she wallowed in the results of the first book too much. I'm sure part of that is necessary for a sequel when some may not have not read the first book. It was downright depressing to read as her life unraveled. However, all of that made the progression of the story that much better.The supporting characters were a little hard to follow at times. Ethan seemed so much more agreeable than his opinionated version in the first book. As a first person narrative I realize it is hard to cover the transitions of the other characters.However, the ending completely surprised me in a good way. Even as it was clearly approaching, I was unable to put the book away. I will definitely be reading another Emily Giffen novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"No sophomore slump here","review":"I enjoyed Giffin's previous novel so much that I thought Something Blue couldn't live up to it. In fact, it may have surpassed the prequel.Something Blue picks up where Something Borrowed left off. Darcy has discovered her best friend and her fiance together, and storms off in a huff. When her relationship with her ex-fiance's roommate peters out, she finds herself pregnant and alone, with no real friends.Determined to make a fresh start, Darcy cajoles Ethan (her fifth-grade boyfriend) into letting her stay with him in London. He is reluctant, but agrees.What follows is a personal journey, bumpy and engaging, as Darcy evolves from an extremely self-centered person into someone who can take part in a real relationship. The book, like its predecessor, is deeper than the pink and blue covers imply.Strongly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it, loved it, loved it!","review":"This is such a fun book! I read it only two weeks after I finished Something Borrowed. I didn't want Something Borrowed to end so imagine how happy I was to see that it continued with Something Blue. The characters are incredibly real and likeable (even Darcy!).I read each of Emily Giffin's books in just over a day. I was just so engrossed and curious to know what happened next that I couldn't seem to put either of them down easily.I just also found out that the author is from a few towns away from where I live so that made me like her even more!!You'll enjoy reading this book. Be sure to read her other book, Something Borrowed, too. I promise you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"liked it so much, but it was no something borrowed","review":"I enjoyed this book a great deal. It was quirkly and uniquely sequeled in a different character's perspective. I found the self-centered personality of the heroine trying on my nerves for the first hundred pages or so, but I had the same issues with the shopaholic series heroine as well. A good book, well written and fun. I love series books. I don't think it was as good as something borrowed, but so seldom are sequels better than their predecessors. I did not enter into this expecting it to be as good as the first therefore, I was not disappointed. A good read!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sequel","review":"I had a hard time relating to Darcy in the beginning of the book, maybe because I had grown to dislike her so much in Something Borrowed. Although I didn't like this book as much as the first, it is another great story and definitely ties up lose ends. If you liked Something Borrowed this won't disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something fantastic!","review":"Something Blue is the sequel to the much beloved, Something Borrowed. I have read both books and to my surprise, I thought Something Blue was a much stronger and more entertaining novel. Darcy Rhone is the most self-centered person ever and the things she believes and says are outrageous but hilarious! Darcy is the kind of woman who judges others without a second thought, she thinks she is the most perfect person and she is not to blame for anything. Darcy feels betrayed by her best friend Rachel and her ex-fiance Dex. I won't give away too much but Darcy along the way starts to change her stubborn ways and becomes something more softer and more real. I loved this book and I love Emily Giffin's ingenious writing. Don't wait...buy this book today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Winner!","review":"I'm a sucker for tales of redemption and Darcy's story is Redemption with a capital R. So extremely unlikable in the first book, Something Borrowed, you'll somehow find yourself rooting for her by the end of Something Blue (and I even like this book much better than the first!) The author does an exceptional job of taking us to the most uncomfortable places with her characters. They are always incredibly flawed, very frustrating, and tremendously human. If you like stories about people turning their lives around then I think you'll enjoy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something blue","review":"Kind of a good book, not as good as Something Borrowed cause everything seems to be so easy to work out, Darcy decides to be good at night and when se wakes up magic is done."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Chick Book","review":"If you read Something Borrowed and liked it, then you will like Something Blue.

I am on Chapter 29 of Something Blue, let me rephrase that, I have suffered through 29 chapters and cannot read another page. This is completely unrealistic and frustrating. Let's have the main character, a complete self-absorbed spoiled brat, treat people like crap make a list of how to be a better person.

My husband was actually hiding the book around the apartment so that I wouldn't have to read any more of it. This book is chick-lit at it's poorest. The main character was flat and the plot was ludicrous.If you want to read some GOOD chick-lit please do yourself the favor of checking out any of Jennifer Weiners books. \\"Little Earthquakes\\" and \\"Goodnight Nobody\\" are my two favorites.Don't waste your time on this fluff."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't know how Griffin does it!","review":"The narrator/protagonist of this story, Darcy Rhone, is almost completely unlikeabe. Darcy is selfish, self-absorbed to the point of being clueless about everyone but herself, and spoiled. Yet, for some reason I liked her just a little bit although I couldn't empathize with her. Not sure how Griffin does this -- is it just a natural instinct for the reader to be pulling for the protagonist? I found the writing OK, not great, but this was a pretty neat trick. Obviously, Darcy changes and grows and we are happy for her and the outcome. I should have found the first two-thirds of this book agonizing, but I didn't. It's worth a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addicting!","review":"I absolutely LOVED \\"Something Borrowed\\" and couldn't wait for to dig in to Giffin's second book. I was a little hesitant at first, because I didn't want to be disappointed like I am with most sequels, but it was so INCREDIBLY good that I finished it in two days!Definitely read \\"Something Borrowed\\" first, if you haven't already yet. While you don't have to read \\"Something Borrowed\\" in order to follow this story, you'll love \\"Something Blue\\" so much that you'll want to read the first one.

Mooch off someone else for her entire pregnancy and only for a hot second admit what a conceited so and so she really is. Where is the epiphany? The revelation of conscience ... Brrr I wanted more Rachel and Dexter and what was happening in their life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the best","review":"My favorite of her books, and quite frankly my favorite chick lit book of all time.

Fun and easy reads, I can't wait to see the movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Something Unexpected\\"","review":"If you read \\"Something Borrowed\\", I suggest you read \\"Something Blue\\". Must read this book in order to complete the story between Rachel, Dex, Darcy, and Ethan. It is definitely my favorite out of the two! I was a bit hesitant at first because Darcy's character wasn't my favorite type of person, so I honestly thought it was a waste of time to get to know this character. But actually, I relate a lot of Darcy in so many ways...don't judge a book by it's cover, especially this one! Trust me, you'll love it..plus it has a lot of surprises! Definitely heart-warming and real."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something Blue","review":"This was a perfect and satisfying completion to \\"Something Borrowed\\".

A perfect couple in the end, and a fun novel to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"very modern","review":"Must read Something Borrowed first. This book is the second part to Something Borrowed, and its just as good as the book and movie. Its fun, familar and quick read. Its also a feel good book in a way. Enjoy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book!","review":"I like everyone else who has read \\"Something Borrowed\\" was hesitant about reading this book since it is from Darcys point of view. But I am SO glad I did. It helps you understand her side of everything that had happened between her and Dex and Rachel. In the beginning she made huge mistakes and was just a terrible person but after she moves to London, she changes for the better in so many ways! There are quite a few surprises in this book and the last few chapters I needed a tissue next to me because I couldn't stop crying. Be prepared for a whole new Darcy halfway through the book, your opinion of her will change drastically and you will find yourself rooting for her!If you have read \\"Something Borrowed\\" I HIGHLY recommend reading this follow up book! I couldn't put it down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Surprise!","review":"I picked up this book at the local library in the just released section. This isn't the type of book I usually read, but I thought I'd try it. What a surprise! I couldn't put this book down, finished it in two days, and didn't want it to end. Darcy is a self-centered, spoiled, shallow little rich girl who discovers what life is really about. I chuckled at her ridiculous views of the world at the beginning of the story, and was so happy for her that I cried at the end of the story. I will purchase this book and it will have a permanent spot in my library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Follow Up","review":"I read this book in less than one day. I just could not put it down and stayed up untill one in the morning just to finish even though I had to wake up at six to go to work. This book was great because it didn't just change Darcy to make her the heroine. She really went through some life changes and realized what was wrong with the way she was living. And unlike some reviewers I loved the way Ms. Giffin tied things up in the end. I always want to know what happens to everyone. All in all if you enjoyed something borrowed then you will love something blue. Happy Reading!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"All I could think about was Rachel and Dex","review":"I loved Something Borrowed. The entire time I was reading Something Blue I kept wondering what Rachel and Dex were doing. How was their trip to Hawaii? How did Dex pop the question? What was their wedding like? What about her pregnancy? Something Blue gave tidbits here and there but I still feel unresolved. I would love to read more about them.I agree with many of the two star ratings. I don't believe Darcy could change that drastically over one conversation. Yes, motherhood can change you but in the brief timeline of the novel I just didn't get it. I was also not crazy about the predictable ending with Ethan. I loved his character but they were not at all suited for one another, at least not for a long term match. I would have loved to see her meet a mix between Dex/Ethan for a long term relationship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even better then \\"Something Borrowed.\\"","review":"I loved every second of \\"Something Borrowed.\\" However, if it is possible, Emily Giffin impressed me even more with \\"Something Blue.\\" It was a fantastic story, not just about the love that grows between two people, but moreso about the love you have for yourself. It's about growing, maturing, and becoming an individual. What's great is that you create this love/hate relationship with the main character. Half the time you don't know whether you want to scold her, cry for her, or hug her.It's truly a fantastic novel that I would recommend to anyone looking for a great book in this genre. There is something so natural, emotional, and simple about the way that Emily Giffin writes. It's really an enjoyable read. I quite literlly couldn't put it down, and now I'm bummed that it is over. I look forward to reading Emily's novel \\"Baby Proof\\" as well as many more novels to come!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loveee!","review":"First let me say I did feel somewhat obligated to read this because of me reading Something Borrowed. Next let me say, this is defiantely my new favorite book. I found myself falling in love with not only the book but even Darcy from the beginning just as I had with Rachel.

This is a great novel that I highly recommend for anyone who likes easy reading and romance. I don't like reading books with long chapters or with hard words I can't understand.

Her novels are very easy to read which I love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something Blue - Didn't make me blue :)","review":"Author Emily Giffin has a way of making the characters seem like your best friends.

I did not like \\"Something Blue\\" either: It is not realistic. You just now how it is going to end, but still it is not believable. All this \\"turn a new leaf\\" thing. Going from an obnoxious person to a forgiving loving one. I don't think so. Leaving her job when she is pregnant and spending all her savings in designer clothes? Plain stupid. There is not a leading female role in this book, a strong character, a smart woman. No, just the opposite. She has no backbone (just like the protagonist in \\"Something Borrowed\\"). It is going straight to the bin. Don't say I didn't warn you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"A dissapointment. I liked \\" Something borrowed\\", but this was not worth reading.

It kept me in suspense from the first page to the last page, I couldn't put it down until I was done with it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Menh!","review":"I enjoyed the first book quite a bit. It was a fun lighthearted read and I was looking forward to reading this book because I loved the idea of reading Darcy's side of the story. The first half of the book was fun albeit slightly annoying since the character of Darcy is somewhat annoying and pathetic. But then comes this rapid shift in the book where she \\"becomes a better person\\". It was such an abrupt switch/ a quick 180 that it hardly seemed believable and that's where the book went downhill for me. For 1.5 books the character Darcy was so utterly horrible and then somehow after one straight talk she gets it together and becomes a better person. I don't buy it and feel that there are many little moments in both books that the author could have set up so that the change in Darcy was believable. Something Borrowed is worth reading. Something Blue is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"My final read of the Darcy/Rachel saga.","review":"I only survived the first half of this book thanks to others who posted reviews encouraging me to do so. While I greatly enjoyed Something Borrowed, Something Blue left me wanting more of Rachel, less of Darcy, and a more surprising plot. I'll skip the rest of this series in favor of other, more original reads sans characters who annoy me to pieces."},{"rating":"2","title":"I looooooove this book","review":"I have now read \\"Something Borrowed\\", \\"Something Blue\\", and \\"Baby Proof\\" and I just loved them all. They just hit home on so many points. Anyone can relate to something in these books.I just can't wait for Emily Giffin to write some more. I'll be the first one in line to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something Good, but not Something Borrowed","review":"I'll admit that I couldn't stand Darcy in the first book, and even wished Rachel would finally stand up to her. So I wasn't sure I'd like an entire book about the woman I didn't like in Something Borrowed, but I did. While I thought that Darcy's transformation was a bit convenient considering how she was portrayed in the first book, the story and writing were what kept me turning the pages. Darcy does redeem herself in this book, although I thought her personality change and realization felt a little rushed. Still, Giffin is a wonderful writer who gives readers engaging stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After seeing the movie Something Borrowed, I thought I would pick up with the 2nd book. The first bit of this book was a recap of what happened in the first book (or movie), so it seems doable. However, I ended up hating this book and wasn't able to get past 51% (Kindle) of the book. Perhaps I missed something in the fist book, but Darcy the main character is so unbelievably annoying that I just couldn't read any further. I tried to push through in hopes of Darcy having a redeeming quality to keep it interesting. If she has one I never saw it or made it to the point where it is showed. I do realize I may have missed something from the first book, but if you're like me and saw the movie and want to see what happens it's probably not worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it","review":"I totally like the story but it does take a long time to get truly into the book. About half way I was hooked and spent 4 hours finishing the book.... Read Something Borrowed first is my recommendation.

The continuity was great!If you're a Mr. Bean or Blackadder fan you'll be disappointed in the humor. Very dry, very insider-british.

Robert Sandstrom's book is from the Lorayne family of systems, and is set up in a very practical and easy to learn way.The manner is more pragmatic and less theoretical than Lorayne's original work - which itself was hardly full of theory. Occasionally I felt the book suffered because of this. On the other hand, reading Lorayne you certainly notice the age of the book.All in all, this book is a great place to start, and after I'd recommend Dominic O'brien for some interesting alternatives."},{"rating":"2","title":"great cd, passes the time test","review":"I bought this cd on a whim, probably in 97, and LOVED it for a couple years, then gave it to a friend who lost it.

It illuminates how the residents of Maui actually live, as contrasted with the tourist snapshot perception. Readers also get the inside scoop on the real estate business and experience the trials of tough-love parenting and failed love in marriage. I liked the use of Hawaiian words and slang throughout the book (a glossary of Hawaiian words is provided), and I liked the unexpected plot twists and tight writing. A fun and diverting read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptionally well-developed characters","review":"I couldn't put this book down. From the very beginning, you relate to and really care about the characters - no one-dimensional stereotypes here! As a fellow real estate agent, it was refreshing to see an agent portrayed as a real person, not some hyped-up caricature a la American Beauty. For anyone interested in a real estate career, the situations and people Laura encounters are dead-on - so to speak. Paying the Price describes perfectly what a real estate career is all about; sometimes exhilarating, sometimes devastating, but always interesting. Terrific job, Madge, can't wait for the sequel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A HUGE Disappointment. I hope I can return it.","review":"Bottom line the term \\"lighted\\" is a joke. Do not waste your money on this product. You are paying way more for a mirror that does not deliver appropriate light and the mirror part is much smaller. For about $30 you can get the same effect (no light) but with a larger mirror surface.To make a complicated story simple, the light is really useless. With the other lights out in the bathroom the light is so dim that I could discern no color in my face. It was all shades of gray, as one sees in early dawn or after dusk. To use it to see the back of my head as I looked in my lighted vanity, there was no discernable addition of light to the reflection than when the mirror light was off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Fighting Game Ever","review":"If you want to have any amout of fun, go pickup Soul Calibur, and leave Power Stone on the shelf.

I find that ability to use the enviroment to your advantage is a lot of fun. the only problem that I have experienced on both my demo version and full version is that after about a hour to an hour and a half the sound begins to drop away like first the speaking disappear then the background music and finally the action sounds like a punch or kick.

As a 1 player game its somewhat average. Most of the time the cpu will pound me to the ground unrelentlessly. With two players however the true beauty of this game shines through. Use lamp posts, benches bazookas, you name it to pummel the competition to submission. And if you happen to collect three powerstones you are transformed into super ass whipper. A fun but horribly unbalanced form that is nearly impossible to protect yourself from. as I mentioned before, far more entertaining with a friend than by yourself.

I wish there was a better way to line it up so that I could slice cheese a certain thick/thinness. Just have to guess. Some of the slices are too thin or too thick, but overall it works fine. Also, I wish there was a better way to clean the groove where the wire goes into. Little bits of cheese get stuck in there after using it, but I just use the sharp edge of a knife or a toothpick to clean it out with water."},{"rating":"1","title":"steph1","review":"The cheese cutter is just OK.

That's a big difference for such a short video. The 35 minute run time is printed on the DVD jewel case & on the DVD itself. I went on \\"kidsmusicalyoga.com\\" & sent an e-mail asking for an explanation or even an apology, but my e-mail was ignored.As far as the content of the video, my kids do like it for the songs which are catchy for pre-schoolers. However, I was disappointed by the lack of actual activity/yoga/exercise the video asks of the kids. It's more of a sing-a-long video...I was just expecting more movement.I just want to give other moms a \\"heads up\\" so you know what you're paying for & aren't disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little weird","review":"This video has potential with the catchy original music, but the adults in the video act strangely and seem to talk down to the kids, aaannnd whhhhaaat do yooouuuu seeeeee? There is way too much talking. And they do very few actual poses/moves. The production is very poor - lots of choppy places and clearly repeated sections.If it was just the poses and songs, and more of them, it would be much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"catchy but not really any yoga","review":"I've owned this for about two years now and am pretty much continually dissapointed with it. My two year girl old finds the music catchy (though my son was three when we bought this and has hated it from the beginning). There isn't really any yoga in the whole video and the the physical exercise is pretty much nill too. At one point 'Fairy Princess Andrianna' does a tree pose but she doesn't explain how to do it or why. The children lay in corpse pose briefly at the end of the movie but again, no explanation on the how or why. Also the 'acting' is truly, truly horrible and tends to distract from any kind of 'message' that they might have otherwise been able to get across. This isn't really worth the money or time...you're probably going to learn more (and get more exercise) from walking about the block and talking about nature than you would from this piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"I rented this dvd along with the other title Let's Go to the Jungle and am glad I didn't waste my money buying these. It captured their attention (2 and 3.5 yr old boys) but there is very little in the way of yoga and the adults are strange. Very annoying to listen to and watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Tough Sheriff","review":"I enjoyed this Documentary on Sheriff Joe Arpaio.

This DVD begins the first chapter of the \\"Kyoto Arc\\", introducing Kenshin's old nemesis from the revolution, Saito, and foreshadowing the threat of Shishio Makoto (Shishio is the core villain in the \\"Kyoto Arc\\"). If there is one Kenshin DVD that you are going to buy to get a taste of the series, this is the one. I rate this as the top of the bunch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Battousai vs. Wolf of Mibu","review":"This is my favorite Kenshin to date. It includes appearances of many important characters, such as a brief glimpse of Sojirou, the boy assassin, and the arrival of Hajime Saito, former leader of the Third Squad of the Shinsengumi and the Battousai's arch-rival. The battle between Kenshin and Saito is awesome. It is also the beginning of the Kyoto arc, which is where the story really takes off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rurouni Kenshin - Shadow of the Wolf","review":"In a word, AWESOME! This is the Rurouni Kenshin/Samurai X series at its best. This is anime at its best. Himura Kenshin did not rank as one of my favorite anime characters until I saw Shadow of the Wolf. Otaku and neophyte will be amazed by the depth of the writing and by the brilliance of the direction. We are allowed a glimpse of what Kenshin must have been like as the Battousai -- and he is not even close to what he was ten years ago! The swordfighting sequences are an acrobatic thrill. So, if you only watch one DVD of Rurouni Kenshin, do yourself a favor and watch this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Have DVD!!!","review":"This is the volume that contains Kenshin v. Saitou battle scene and it is the beginning of the highly anticipated Kyoto Arc. Now the storyline is close to the manga which is based on and you can't miss the next 30 episodes. Media Blasters has done an excellent job with this DVD. Menu design is cool looking and easy to maneuver. Cover design is great. I wasn't too sure how the overlay will look at the end of Episode 31, but they did a superb job by making it look very similar to the original one, which is included as Extras! I can't wait to see the upcoming volumes now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD!!!","review":"This is a MUST have DVD for all RK fans. This DVD begins with the second season of RK, the Kyoto Arc. It includes the Saito/Kenshin battle. This is the best fight in this anime. This is also when Kenshin leaves Kaoru and the others to go to Kyoto to fight against a guy named Shishio. The series has gotten a whole lot darker and serious now. The cheerful background music I loved so much has been replaced with mysterious and eerie music. Anyway, this DVD is great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST HAVE!!!","review":"This is a MUST for Rurouni Kenshin fans! No filler episodes here folks! The 2nd season of Kenshin starts, what Animé Works is calling The Legend of Kyoto, and it couldn't have possibly captured my love for Kenshin any more! If you love this show as much as I do then DO buy this! It has one of the best fight scenes I've seen in a long while and a touching moment that left me in tears during the ending credits. If you tend to borrow Kenshin instead of buy it, consider buying this volume ^^x"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Rurouni Kenshin DVD","review":"I think Rurouni Kenshin evolves with each new DVD. The Story gets more interesting and becomes more and more involved with the Past of Kenshin. It becomes clear that the Past has cought up with Kenshin and that he can't bury his being a \\"Manslayer\\" any longer. This is a great DVD with good animation. The Characters have developed very good over the entire Story Arc. They've gotten more background (espescially Kenshin) and are able to show more emotions than in the beginning of the Series.I can't wait for the next DVD to be released."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just One Word: Wow!","review":"Most of the other reviews for this volume are helpful at giving you an idea about how good this DVD is. Thw only thing I have to add to them is WOW!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Aku...Soku...Zan!","review":"This volume is the start of the Kyoto arc, and here the anime follows the manga more closely than it did in the beginning. There are less filler episodes from here on in, which is always a plus. These four episodes introduce Saitou, who is the last surviving Shinsengumi. He appears to work for a corrupt politician, but later it is revealed that he is serving his own form of 'seigi' (justice). In the fight between him and Kenshin, we see the true strength of the Wolf of Mibu and the legendary Hitokiri of the revolution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Catch me if You can","review":"I liked the book; it was a older book so was thrown by the few references to smoking. One of the things I really liked was the very light romance/sex scenes. Some time writers go overboard I'd much rather have a illusion of these scenes. The characters and plot were good, the book did keep me wondering who was the bad guy right up to the end and honestly I can figure out a book pretty fast. But this time had no clue and I really liked how it turned out. The one thing I did not like was the falling in love/lust instantly. But I liked the books well enough to buy next one in the series. I do recommend the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it","review":"Absolutely could not put down! Very captivating. Highly recomend this book and this author! Will definitely read more from her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and Boring","review":"I am aware that some people find sexual descriptions titillating. However,this book was one of the WORST books I have read in a long time. The sex descriptions were overly long and extremely boring. The relationships between the characters were just stereotypes and gave no evidence of the author's having ever known real people with real emotions. The events were stereotypes. I ordered two of this author's books at the same time, and I will not waste the time to read the second one. In fact, I skipped over most of this book and turned to the end and found the predictable, template ending. I was BORED, BORED, BORED!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Written Romantic Suspense","review":"Kit Colfax is an insurance investigator on a mission. Her very career hinges on her capturing a jewel thief. What she never counted on was capturing Simon Beaulieux, the chief of police, in her quest. Through a well-written series of twists and turns, Kit finds herself chasing Simon from the twinkling lights of Las Vegas to the sultry bayous of his Louisiana plantation. But Kit's greatest challenge isn't capturing the thief - it's keeping her heart safe from sexy and irresistible Simon Beaulieux. But was Simon telling her the truth - or lying to protect his family?This well written romantic suspense is a page turner that will keep readers on the edge and ready for more from Nina Bruhns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved everything!","review":"This book was amazing. If had a great amount of romance and love combined with the past issues as well as mystery and problems. The story was all over and involved in multiple things and it worked out great. Its part of a trilogy and I am on book two now. Check this author out, I really love her!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and trite","review":"I was encouraged by previous reviewers to purchase the trilogy and so I did. The books are awful. The plot is more or less the same from one story to the next, they are in the style of romance novels, cheesy and poorly written. I skipped paragraphs at a time, simply to get back to the storyline; I confess I didn't bother reading the third book as the first two turned me off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictably fun","review":"Very predictable but fun read.I picked it very randomly but enjoyed it. I don't think I will bother with any more of her books though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let this one get away....","review":"This book was a first for me - the first one I could not finish. The characters are cardboard, the plot shallow and repetitive (heroine does not want to be controlled by a man - alright I get it already!), and problems with editing. I downloaded the second book when it was offered as a freebie, but do not plan to read it if this first book is any indication of the author's skill as a writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Books","review":"Just was not for me, really reading for a woman, did not finish the book, wish I could be kind"},{"rating":"1","title":"So repetitive","review":"Most of the story was in a narrative form, with a little dialog and action thrown in. The thoughts of the characters were repeated so many times throughout the book, I just started skimming through the pages. I found it boring, predictable and frustrating. I always finish reading a book once I start it so I did so in this case, but I found I could skip pages and not miss anything having to do with the plot line. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too much hype","review":"I may have read too much hype to begin with so I expected a lot more from this book than I got.

There was nothing very interesting about the plot to me and I had it all figured out pretty quickly which is never good. I read a lot of romance novels so to be fair it takes something original to really stand out to me but this book was just so vanilla after the opening scene that I really could have just not finished it. I kept thinking that the story would develop more and get more interesting and the sex would get more descriptive and hot but it just was very very vanilla and lack luster.

Easy to put together and seems very safe and durable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lucky rocks!","review":"My 2-year old granddaughter LOVES this toy! She puts the energizer bunny to shame, and it provides her with solo, energetic activity! It takes two to install the springs, as they are very tight (a good thing, I feel), but the stirrups are made of hard plastic which I think bang her shins when she rocks hard - although it did not deter her from bouncing so hard her hair was flying! Its softness as a stuffed animal belies its sturdiness so I expect this toy will hold up well - and she LOVED the stuffed animal feel of it.The sound effects delighted her and had the adults laughing as well.Overall, a fine value for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A horse is horse is horse Of course","review":"Fine toy for the 2-4 year old. Has many fine new features not included in the one from my youth. Such as a really weird song and pleasant sayings.

She loves it and so does my 3 year old granddaughter. I still remember my bouncy horse from when I was a child as one of my favorite toys, although back then it wasn't as fancy.

Was a little out of my price range at the stores in my area."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy with one glitch","review":"I would highly recommend this...it is soft plush, not hard plastic like the others. It is difficult to put together so plan some time. We had to use our own bolts because the screws that came with it were stripped.

Very pleased overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twins love it","review":"We bought this for our twin 2 year old girls. They liked it.

I used it to bind 75, 50-sheet notebooks- each with PVC covers. It worked well for punching 2 PVC sheets at once, and for paper, I'd stick to like 8-10 sheets of paper per punch. When I used more than that, I really had to give a little more strength.Other reviews said it is really big, it's like the same size as a printer, and isn't that heavy. The instructions are really simple, and the make sure to use the guide on the left-side of the machine- that way your holes all line up. (I'd test out on scrap paper first to get it consistent.)I bought this one over the smaller models because it seemed more sturdy and like it could handle all the work. It still is working the same as the day I bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good product","review":"This binding machine produces professional looking plastic ring bound books in minutes. The instructions are easy to follow. This version of the binder is bigger than the old one my husband used for his work, and is able to make larger books with ease. The user inserts pages to have holes punched in them, and then lines up a comb, threads it, and depresses a simple lever to marry the pages to the binding. There is some chance for human error though- if you don't line up the pages exactly right, the holes will go askew and you'll have to begin again with new pages.

For example, if the book had made some attempt to explain the equation or where it came from, I might have asked, \\"What did I do wrong, because it's obvious the equation is correct.\\"This book isn't all bad, though.

He is an oddity--like Melville's Bartleby. Maybe he is Christ. Maybe the Holy Ghost. Who knows? It is baffling."},{"rating":"1","title":"For completists only","review":"Unless you have to read everything Faulkner wrote, save your time here. It's better than Soldier's Pay, Mosquitoes, and Sanctuary, but that isn't much to aspire to. Here and there an interesting thought comes up, but if you're short on time or energy, spend it working through Absalom, Absalom! That will save your soul. You can listen to Jagger sing Parachute Woman and get the same material in a better medium. Pylon, however, is a good word."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fake Pilot","review":"Not sure why this book was written except to perhaps extend Faulkner's fantasy about being a qualified pilot. Typical of the author is the use of too many adjectives and adverbs which distort the actual subject and leaves the reader wondering.Nice jacket though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Like The First","review":"This CD was the beginning of the end of his luke-warm musical career. His first CD was pretty good but this one seems like a generic attempt at R&B. There's nothing original in the music or the lyrics. There are, however, a couple nice sounding ballads but nothing to waste your money on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad","review":"This man cannot sing.

I am really tired of the same sound coming out ! Lyrically, it's the typical crap (not much meaning), and musically it lacks originality and creativeness. If his purpose was to be heard on MTV's TRL, I'm sure it will ,but I think the majority of the music on there sucks anyway :) hey, just an opinion. He had some of the most talented producers work on the album, but it ended up sounding like every other R&B release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing","review":"I own all of Elvis' DVD's and I welcomed another to my collection. I read the reviews on amazon, and bought this DVD. What a disapointment. You are better off buying the original DVD performances. I felt the whole DVD was just showing the band, not Elvis. The shots keep going to the singers, and the musican's and Elvis third. If you were there for the live performance of this concert event in Memphis, then I am sure it was more enjoyable b/c you could keep your eyes just on the Elvis screen. They also were shown photos and clips on the side screen, which we could not see. If we were able to see photos and clips of Elvis then it would have been better.No disrespect to the band members or the singers, they did a great job, but I came to see Elvis not the band."},{"rating":"1","title":"They kept interrupting the interpretations.","review":"My #1 distraction is view/listen concerts. Have in my home almost 200 hundreds of them. And I get so frustrated when someone interrupts a song just to say how wonderful the recording was, and how marvelous the engineering got, or to explain the technique used in a specific moment. People, you can say those things in the special features, not in the middle of the song. Or allow the spectators to see the concert without those verbal's notes.It is true that they did a very good job remastering the sound and Elvis never sing so good, but when you express all those things interrupting the show, it's really annoying.Not recommended for a real concert fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"ALL ELVIS >>> ALL THE TIME!","review":"I purchased this after a recent trip to Graceland.

I live in California and have never had any problem with any DVD ordered from Amazon. So I returned it after speaking with a Customer Service rep and hoped that this was an isolated problem. Not so. I ordered a replacement and received the same product-PAL written on the reverse and when placed in the DVD, it said \\"this DVD will not play on this machine\\".So I returned that one too and will just have to wait for PBS to play the show again.Has anyone else had this problem, and if so, did you get it resolved? If so, I would appreciate your help.Thanks"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money!","review":"I regret buying this. The entire DVD has subtitles, which detract from enjoying the music. Between songs there are conversations with former band members which break the mood of enjoying a concert. It is poor videos of old Elvis concerts. You would do better to just buy a CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad Idea","review":"I was as big of Elvis fan as there ever was,but, he's gone, I miss him and this was a really bad idea. It looked pathetic to see all these old (but talented) geezers, up there performing with a forever young Elvis. Not only that, but they changed some of the licks they played too. Wonder how Elvis would have liked that. Elvis as a performer was always great, even if he just stood there. But, the best way to see him is in original concert films. Course that's just my opinion. I miss him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Job!!!","review":"It was so awesome to see the original band perform beautifully with Elvis! The songs are great pics. But, I was very disappointed with the editing. This concert was about Elvis with his band at present time and yet they showed the band way, way too much!!! Some of the great scenes of Elvis were not shown due to the viewing of the band playing. Elvis should have had equal time, but this did not happen. I found myself so irritated by that! Alot of people that watch this dvd, don't know or care to see the band constantly.

They do not even really have bourbon in them (the label warns they contain \\"less than 0.1% alcohol). Maker's Mark should be ashamed by selling out its trademark on this product. As a result, I won't buy any of their whiskeys again. If a company is willing to make a quick buck by sticking their label on an inferior product, it clearly has no commitment to quality. Don't buy these. What a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just meh, nothing overly special","review":"I had such high hopes for these but, as another reviewer noted, they taste no different than store-bought maraschino cherries.

Opening Credits II and III seem to be what people wanted on Laptop's second and third fill-length CD releases. Opening Credits is a fine record. But it definitely could be improved on.Whole Wide World is great. Ratso Rizzo is the most rhythmic (ethnic?) sounding Laptop song - certainly it's immediately catchy and deserving to be a single. It's been 5 years since Opening Credits. Don't Try this at Home is an evolution of music product that sounds retro/current at the same time, while incorporating more emotion in the vocals and more varied instrumentation/programming.Other highlights here are Want In, So Funny, Surprise, Surprise, and Don't Try This at Home. Very much looking forward to the next Laptop release."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"Laptop's last two records End Credits and The Old Me Vs The New You were really extraordinary pieces of synth pop, the hooks were strong, the lyrics were laugh out loud funny, and yet the record had a feeling of poignancy that gave it some heft. Don't Try This at Home is missing all the elements that gave the previous releases such charm. It feels like Jesse Hartman is trying to hard with his music and lyrics this time, rather than the effortless charm of his past releases. Also, Ratso Rizzo could be one of the worst songs I've ever heard. Seriously. What gives??Do not start your Laptop collection with this record. Stick to the past two releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Studs is Fantastic","review":"Studs is a fantastic book. The plot was wonderful, and I was pulled into it imediately.

Overall I found this book not very useful, and do not recommend a buy if you are searching for good small business book. It has old war stories from a large organization hierarchy, which while entertaining, ultimately doesn't help the book's thesis.This book would serve a middle manager in a large hierarchy very well, but personally, I found little of use.

(Okay, the warning says to use it outdoors, and to have a fire extinguisher handy.) Cook with a wok the way it was meant to cook -- get the peanut oil smoking in about 20 seconds.

This did a much better job than I could have done any other way and my little dog, Shadow, went nuts trying to get the fallout. Very sturdy and very hot!

My only complaint is not with the movie but with Ground Zero/Wu-Tang Clan. The picture quality is equivalent to an old video tape(and this is DVD?). The makers must of had an old bootleg copy and transferred it to DVD without any remastering. I'm afraid to buy anymore \\"Wu-Tang Clan\\" brand DVD's because the quality of this one, frankly, sucks.

Live music showcasing the talents of Mr G and his wonderful band, interviews with Kenny, band members and guests, and a very good audio transfer.Complaining about too many interviews pieced in between is nonsense. The interviews come in just as the song finishes, with the applause of the crowd fading into the background. Is applause REALLY crucial? I think not.This DVD is a wonderful collection of live Kenny G music, with everything from latin funk to slow blues - a must for fans.

By the way, KG does not hold the record for holding out the longest note, Rashaad Kirk does. Only difference, Kirk played it for near 2 hours with 5 saxophones at the same time and it was in tune.

I watched half of it in Color, the other half in B&W, enjoyed both without commercial interruption, and watched the original full length movie without narration or any other added balderdash. I purchased this collection for my one and only grandchild Elizabeth. She will enjoy these movies throughout the years as I have. I prefer the B&W only because that's how I originally saw them when I was a young child. Sounds like a great new Sunday evening at 4 pm tradition to me.

I prefer the adventure part take precedence. The body count of this book--and its predecessor, come to that--begins pretty much on page one and keeps going at a relentless pace, all the way to the last. Problem is, there are so many bodies flying every which way, with bullets and brains and misiles and planes and helicopters and cars and trucks and chases and everything else--oh yeah, and there's this organization called the Coalition that's readying this conspiracy. The pattern is an all too familar one with this series: plot overshadowed by action. Pity, too--this could've been quite a good trilogy.

I hoped that Armada would be able to tide me over untill a more traditional role-playing game came out. There is practically no RPG element to this game, however, and the shooter aspect gets boooooring fast. If you want a role-player, buy a role-player, if you want a shooter, buy a shooter. This game is not much of either. ...I'm going to the pawn shop."},{"rating":"1","title":"A massive mistake!","review":"First, don't get me wrong: I love 2D space shooters and RPGs. 'Armada' is a mix of these fine genres, but it's a very poor mix. It fails as a shooter because it has bad controls and poor action; It fails as an RPG because story and characters are never developed.And here's the most ridiculous thing: this game has no end. That's right: after you beat all missions, you just keep flying on space, fighting the aliens as if nothing had happened. What's the point of beating the game, then?This may be 'Asteroids' on steroids, but that is not nearly enough to make it actually fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are You Old School?","review":"When you first play Armada, it seems like an interesting return to old-school, top-down shoot-em-ups. Then you play for a while, and realize that it is basically an old game with better graphics. Remember Life Force for 8-bit NES? More fun than Armada. I can think of others...basically, you'd be better off going out and getting an NES and some old games for less money than this costs. Basically, Armada was fun for about 2 days, then it got boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish for old atari/nes/snes shooters?","review":"Old schooler's rejoice! This is the holy grail for space shooter fans! Intense 4 player action. Fun on one player, too. However, if you want new and innovative, you might want to try before you buy. The only thing keeping this game from 5 stars is lack of online play. Hopefully Armada 2 (cross your fingers) will do for shooters what Everquest did for RPGs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gets Old Fast","review":"The missions were far too easy to get through, and there were not enough of them. I'm not sure what you could call role playing in this game, considering the only thing you really do is fly around in space shooting weird looking alien ships. All of the screen shots advertising this game come from the intro, the actual ship you control is small and disappointing. You can upgrade your ship by buying equipment with money found from the armada ships you kill. However, to get the really good items you will have to spend many, many hours of playing the same unexciting game that is honestly not worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really addicitve game.","review":"This game is great. The graphics and sound are good. Basicly you conytrol a little space ship blowing aliens up and completing missions. The missions are cool but the thing I like nost is just flying around and trying to level up and make tons of cash. When my friends and I get together and play a four player game, it makes the game several times more fun. Don't believe the people that gave this game bad ratings. After reading thier reviews I can obviuosly tell that they didn't even know what they were doing when they played. \\"There is no RPG elements whatsover,\\" my god people, didn't you realize that you gain XP and levels and can buy items.

Let me tell you that the money spent was VERY worthwhile. Although the game is a top-down shooter, it gives you RPG qualities that give you people to talk to and missions to take/leave. Allowing for your choice from 6 races adds to the replay value as well as my favorite, the co-op mode. Taking on a Big-Boss is pretty hardby yourself, so the co-op mode really shines here. No lack of Armada ships in this game; there are more than enough for you and your friends. A great game that is truly under-rated."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST BRITISH BAND THERE IS!","review":"These guys are just going from strength to strength with every release.

It tells the story of an Irish priest in Kenya and the problems he and his friends and parishioners face in the culture. What seems at first a straight-forward morality tale, with the good guys and bad guys clearly defined, develops through unexpected events to a much more complex interweaving of characters from very different influences, backgrounds and mores. Their failure to understand each others' views of reality leads to unexpected consequences, but with the dynamism and inevitability of a Greek tragedy. This book is full of twists and turns, right up to the surprising climax. A must read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too few tapes for such a long subject","review":"The professor giving this lecture freely admits that if you don't study CP in a law class or for the bar, you will never get it in practice. Still, this tape series has only 3 tapes when your typical sum & substance subject has between 4 and 6. The professor crams cp rules into 3 tapes sides and article 4 payment rules in the last 3 sides. These tapes didn't become useful until I had read and made flash cards from his Gilberts law summary text. I can't believe the most difficult bar subject has so few study aids out there. This is very frustrating. I can't even say Whaley did a bad job here; it's just that these tapes alone won't do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What do you expect?","review":"This is about what you would expect from a 1981 low budget film. The story is lacking a bit and the comedy is lousy. The fighting is good, which makes it worth buying. I was disappointed with the audio/video quality. One channel of the audio is out of phase with the other which makes it hard to hear. By flipping the + & - wires on the back of one of the speakers fixes it. The video looks like RZA hooked up his K-mart blue light special VCR to a DVD burner and hit record. This movie is obviously aimed at Wu-tang clan fans, but it's worth checking out if you're a Kung-fu buff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Fatal about this DVD except....","review":"Errors...This DVD has the worst sound quality that you can imagine.

The film is short, appropriate for small groups dealing with grief, Sunday School classes, small groups of all kinds.Kathie Sullivan does a beautiful job as the woman who loses her son.

This was no-noised pretty heavily and it's readily apparent. Mastered by Paschal Byrne, the breath in this recording just isn't there. It does state in the liner notes that it was \\"denoised,\\" but it should have a disclaimer on the cover itself. Why do a DSD transfer and issue a SACD (an audiophile format) and suck out the natural analog life with digital hiss removal? Total waste. Sounds like it was EQd pretty heavily. For some reason, the redbook layer (perhaps from the earlier transfer Paschal Byrne did for Bellaphon in 2002?) does not sound as heavily no-noised, and has more life.

I wasnt feelin 90% of the music on here. the tempo is too slow, the beats are slow, and Big Moe Singin throughout the whole album. Its almost like R&B music.

These books cover a wide area... mystery, romance, espionage, war, etc. Not too much of anything. I don't want you to think by my previous sentence it is just a wishy washy book, no plot, etc. Actually these books are much to the opposite. It is a definite page turner (mystery/espionage, etc.) but also had character developement and lots of little plots off the main one! A surprise on every page.

(I found nothing wrong with the romance.) Linda Chaikin did another amazing job to make her latest series A DAY TO REMEMBER more intriguing. I really enjoyed all of the books in this series so far. Mrs. Chaikin did great on the research of the WWII in 1940 when Hitler was on the verge of invading France and North Africa.

So when I saw Saliva's CD on sale for 8 bucks, I bought it. I'm not a fan of the whole rap/rock scene, I prefer my metal with talent and melody, hearing \\"Every Six Seconds\\" was like a breathe of fresh air. Unlike other rap/rock bands, Saliva has talent. Lead singer Josey Scott sings with a lot of emotion, and you can hear his emotion is genuine, not put on for the album like other new bands like Slaves On Dope or Papa Roach. The guitars are heavy and crunching, and have a sense of melody, even on the few occasions Josey Scott raps. All in all, this is one of the best debut albums I've come across in a while, and Saliva gets my vote as new band of the year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this CD if your life depended on it","review":"I have just finished listening to this CD which is considered a masterpiece by some. Boy do they have some explaining to do. I'd have to say \\"Doperide\\" is paying homage to every other \\"hard\\" rock band on the planet. The problem I have with these guys is that they pretty much sound like Disturbed, Full Devil Jacket, Dope, and Tool (except not as good). Anyway, their sound is pretty typical, no creativity involved. The CD almost sounds as if the producer told them to throw in some screamy \\"Yeeeaaaahhh\\"s into their songs just so they could sound like everyone else putting out hard rock CD's. That's about all for the group Saliva, spit out their CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"soul-less, forgettable","review":"This doesn't sound horrible. It's well-produced scream rock that combines the melodicism of Foo Fighters with rap-shouted vocals like Papa Roach. And some of the numbers -- especially \\"Click Click Boom\\" -- would sound all right on the radio. But it's totally forgettable. Not one song has anything human underlying it. It's got as much soul as a Dorito. If you don't have enough CDs by tattoed screamers who like images of teenage girls, drugs and violence, then by all means, taste some Saliva."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a good rap/rock band","review":"It seems that there have only been two bands in the history of rock music that have successfully combined rap and rock. One of those bands is Saliva(the other is the beastie boys, incase anyone is wondering). Unlike these other \\"rap/rock\\" bands like Limp Bizkit and Papa Roach which are really just a rapper backed by a rock band, Saliva actually manages to blend the two styles together, with a seemless transfer between the two styles. If there were more rap/rock bands like this, I would have less of a problem with it. People that say Radiohead has talent and these guys don't must be crazy. The first time I heard radiohead, their music was horrible enough to make me hate alternative music. Saliva's musicians at least have talent, unlike radiohead. So, please, stop comparing a band with talent to a band that has none."},{"rating":"2","title":"a realy good heavy rock cd","review":"this is a very good band wich folows a very good cd. they are very good i started listen to them after seeing the movie the fast and the furious. they are one good band and this album is very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Click Click Boom?","review":"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

I feared that \\"Your Disease\\" would be the only song I liked, but in fact pretty much the whole album rocks pretty hard. The only complaints are 1) the songs all sound a lot the same to me, and 2) it seems they are doing a good job of hiding that they aren't overly talented. No guitar solos to speak of, for example.

Saliva is more of the same from this years crop of nu metal bands. Pure filth, nothing but pure filth. Lyrically it's filth (click click BOOM!!, yeah that's the writing of a true poet). The guitars are very simple. As Saliva has found out you can mask a lack of talent pretty well by playing music that's uninspired and unoriginal. And once again mainstream America will gobble it up and ask for more until the next batch of \\"heads on sticks\\" comes around.If you want to listen to music that has talent and is creative listen to Faith No More, Far, Vision of Disorder, and above all Radiohead(no I take that back I wouldn't want a Saliva fan listening to Radiohead)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Bad Album","review":"I know I won't have anyone recommend this review, but I don't want to waste my time on it.

This album is so derivative and unoriginal that the words \\"derivative\\" and \\"unoriginal\\" do not do justice to how bad it is.

Unsipired riffs, bad drumming(that \\"fill\\" on Your Disease is really off rhythm), and Kid Rock style vocals round out this already mediocre package. I am not going to go into too much depth because its not worth my time. If you want good hard rock music, try Monster Magnet. At least they have talent.

Style over substance here people. A failed attempt at mixing many musical styles. This is the true definition of bottom feeder rock. Do I deny that this is going to be huge with the mainstream music masses? No I do not. This is very simple and unchallenging rock music with nothing really redeeming about it. Will Saliva be heard of in 10 years? Maybe but not as a serious rock and roll band. This is and a new version of Poison. It's 11 years later and this big dumb rock sound is just as dumb and pointless. It didn't age gracefully; it became even more ugly and embarrassing. Hopefully the next wave of great rock bands will come along and send this band back into obscurity. This is everything wrong with popular music today.

Thank god there still exist bands that have an original sound. (Nine Inch Nails, Evenescence, Stabbing Westward.) Saliva--Leave the rap to the rappers and keep BANDS out of it--rap was never meant to be mixed with metal and if you asked me there is just too much of it out of it out there (Limp Bizkit, P.O.D.,) If you want to hear some decent rap with heavy guitar check out Faith No More, but if you want to listen to the same regergitated [stuff] buy Saliva's every six seconds, because ever six seconds Saliva is laughing all the way to the bank."},{"rating":"1","title":"The price is absurd.","review":"I own a Canon ES8600 camcorder which is a fantastic deal for the price ($270). What blows me away is how Canon has the nerve to then charge $165.00 for an adaptor to charge your camcorder battery in your car. An item like that costs only a few dollars in parts and labor, but because it's proprietary (menaing you can'y buy generic parts and make one) to Canon's batteries, they feel they can justify the cost.

He tries to escape by slipping into the open door of an old warehouse, but they follow him there, too. While running from them through aisles filled with all kinds of stuff, he bumps into an old boom box. By doing that, he manages to release Kazaam, a genie who has been held captive for thousands of years. In order to stay free, Kazaam must give Max three wishes.

This film is in need for the MST3K treatment. It is now becoming notorious as one one of the worst movies ever made, and it deserves that status. Usually genie movies suck, and this one was no exception. Anything with a basketball player who tries to start an acting career as a genie in a boom bow has to be bad; and it is. It's even got the most corny sentimentality you'll ever see in a movie, and it's message about second chances in life it absolutely awful. This is even insulting to kids. I mean please people if you have any humanity left in you, you would not punish your children by making them watch this horrendous thing. It's garbage, and if easily one of the worst movies ever.

Of course, Shaq can still act better than he can rap, butt... Anyway, it has a dismal script that, while the cover-art and plot suggest a comedy, wavers more towards trying to be a drama of sorts for the 9 and under set. Few attempts are made to be even remotely funny, and the attempts made FAIL MISERABLY. Example: The schmucky kid's first wish is to get candy, so the genie rains an assortment of candy bars from the celing.

I've seen him play basketball and his acting skills are far superior. If he's a method actor, he has successfully demonstrated a new method that no one has ever seen before. I also went to NYU film school and this movie was used in class as an inspirational tool. Forget about the whole genie aspect. I mean, a seven-foot black dude comes out of a bottle and grants wishes!

The book does miss out on many emerging technologies, like sensor networks, mesh networks, etc.Also the lower OSI layers like physical, MAC lack the details and information worthy of a basic book.

I think 'Telephone Skills...' is necessary in any environment- professional/social/and casual. I will recommend my 3 nieces (14,13 & 7 -ages) read this. Ask any parent with children- the phone rings, they run to answer it. I think this book is so informally written that even a child can read and understand it's meaning of being \\"good natured\\" polite even when it's someelse fault.

When I first got this game, I played with my GF for about an hour, with matches evenly split as she would pull off amazing combos without having the first clue what she did. Lame. I see hardly any changes in difficulty when adjusting the settings, the computer basically blocks all attacks until it sees room to use the Massive Overpowered Light Beam Attack. The name changes but the BS remains the same.

Marvel VS Capcom is better on the Dreamcast than it was in the arcades, the control is easy, the graphics are sharp and crisp and bright, and the action is fast, so fast you might lose track of what your doing. Though it was overshadowed by it's superior sequel, Marvel VS Capcom is a must own Dreamcast title on its own. Also recommended is Marvel VS Capcom 2, Power Stone 1&2, Capcom VS SNK, Street Fighter Alpha 3, Dead or Alive 2, and Soul Calibur."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Game Rocks!","review":"An awesome fighting game that bring 2-D fighting back from the dead, lots of characters to choose from for an even 4plyr rumble, also includes helper characters to choose for your fight,I'm telling you this game Rocks!...still I think they should of include some more Marvel characters.But an awesome choice to buy if you like fighting games like street fighter or even if you dont, buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Misunderstood!!!!","review":"Marvel Vs. Capcom is an excellent game. I bought it last year. There are many great things about it. First, you can use classic street fighter and Marvel characters(who really cares about captain commando anyway?). The graphics are excellent. While they are not 3d, they are animated with anime style drawing. The frame rate generally runs smoothly and the super combos are awesome to watch, including Shin Ryu's Raging Demon super combo. 3d games are terrible anyway since it's usually all about hitting buns quickly then running away. Anyways buy this game, its well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shane is here again","review":"This is the 9 th book of tall, dark and dangerous. It is a classical romance-adventure book. All the good guys go somewhere else and poor Lucky is left behind with the women and children to protect them. It is Shane, he has ridden back.But this book is hilarious and wonderful. It has an episode where this Navy Ken makes a pass on a lady almost at their first meeting (! ). and then the other line he is totally shocked about an idea of someone thinking he would hit on Blue's Lucy. Lucky is Peter Pan, one who has never grown adult. This book should be called Lucky and the Ladies because other Teamten men are all some where in the bushes. I liked this book, a lot. It had humour, sizzle, romance and poor Lucky suffering in love. Forget the cover, it is awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great one!","review":"This book was excellent, and contrary to what seems to be popularbelief, it does NOT mark the end of the series...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I loved this book. I could not put it down. It is one of the best in the series. I recommend that people read the entire series if they can find them. I saw that on some other reviews people were saying that this is the last book in the series, I don't think that is right. There are still two of the original group, Wes and Bobby, who haven't had a story. And Suz introduced two new seals and re-introduced the characters of Tasha and Thomas. I can't wait to read a story about them, they've certaintly grown up a lot since the third story. Lets hope that there are many more books to come in this fine series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for all most all levels","review":"I really liked this book. Its written in a very interesting way. Very contemporary language. There are all kinds of exercises with many different types of beats. You are going to be able to play Reaggae, Funk, Bossa Nova, Country, Hip-hop, etc. Just sit down, get your sticks and don't stop practicing. You are gonna love the exercises. The CD is very helpfull too.

She is obviously a very devoted and caring grandmother, and the story she paints of her grandson's life is moving and inspirational. She is the first of thousands of families in the United States to express the horrifying impact of this disease and I applaud her for her efforts. The information about the disease and the consequences of not receiving treatment contained in this book is something that should be readily available to every parent in the United States.

This \\"coming of age\\" novel introduces us to spunky, working class women trying to find their way sexually, politically and economically during the Vietnam war era. The reader feel their victories, their pain and their anxiety as they grapple with relationships before abortion was legal, as they seek to speak out when politics belonged to men, and as they fight for their futures when women were expected to work in the factory or get married. The book rings true to the era on all these accounts.While first and foremost a good read, the book does a fine job of interweaving the issues of the time. It might well be used in high school classes as supplementary reading, to bring the Vietnam War era to life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great author, story, and illustrations!","review":"This is one of my five-year-old's favorite books. Mine too! We love nearly all of Lisa Campbell Ernst's books, as her stories are fabulous and illustrations are unique and very beautiful. This story is about a city girl's longing to be a cowgirl and her consistent pursuit to be one.

Su voz a perdido la fuerza y el brillo al que nos tenía acostumbrados. Pero con todo el espectaculo resulta grandioso. La escenografía es espectacular, al igual que el diseño de luz. La orquesta suena como una de las mejores Big Bands del mundo y el sonido en DVD es estremecedor. Ella, como es muy inteligente se ha sabido rodear de un equipo que ha suplido las pocas carencias que podría tener, como un coro magnifico que la apoya en los momentos más delicados. El conjunto es maravilloso y es un espectáculo que incluso si no eres un gran fan de Barbra, como es mi caso, no te lo puedes perder, Y si eres fan prepara una caja de clinex y disfrutalo.

With only a minor amount of creativity one can easily and inexpensively add other background fabrics from one's local fabric supply store. However, that is as far as my happiness with this product goes.The supplied tripod is nearly useless. Even with just my Rebel XTi and a 60mm macro lens the tripod sags to the side. It would also be very easy to tip it over, possibly damaging my camera.Likewise, the two lights supplied are way too weak. With an ASA 200 setting I found myself shooting at 1/4 to 1/10 second at f/2.8.By the time I replace the tripod and lights with real equipment and add some other fabrics, I have to ask myself why I bought this item in the first place. Still, I do like the box so maybe it wasn't a total loss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept - But more opaque than translucent","review":"I unpacked the kit, which was very nicely set up for portabilty. Folds flat with pockets on side for accessories. The big flaw in the product is the fact that 70% of the light is reflected off the \\"screens\\" when the box is set up and lights placed as directed. I don't know if the lights are too weak, or the material used for the \\"box\\" is too dense. Big disappointment! Please take this into consideration if you purchase.

That was the Moodies first time to play with a symphony orchestra live. Now, eight years later, \\"Hall of Fame\\" revisits the band now that they've toured the world countless times with a different orchestra in every town. Naturally, the band seems much more at ease, and the concert flows smoothly. In addition to the inclusion of three great live tracks from \\"Strange Times\\", the standards are all crisper and better mixed than their Red Rocks counterparts. The only complaint I have is the editing that went on in the mixing booth. The Overture has been cut in half and Ray's flute solo from \\"Legend of a Mind\\" is reduced to about one bar, cutting off a full three minutes of the song. Still, 14 live tracks by the Moody Blues is worth a five star rating any day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unforgettable","review":"I was lucky enough to be at the RAH on the night that this performance was recorded.

However, despite my adulation and adoration - particularly of a certain Mr Hayward - I'm not deaf to when they get it wrong, for example \\"Keys of the Kingdom\\" with the exception of a couple of tracks. I personally couldn't fault what was a memorable performance by the band on 1st May 2000. I feel certain qualities of it are missing or may not have come across as well in the recording but there's never really anything quite like being there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak sonics","review":"I was disaapointed in the sonic quality of this CD.

I saw them in concert earlier this month and it was the best show I've seen in years. (I've seen them before.) [...] It's even better if you get the PBS video of this concert, because the passion is much more evident. It's nice to see them having fun. I just wish they had more things from the new album on it. It's a shame such a great work has been so overlooked. I'd also like to comment on a previous review and say that if Justin did most of the singing, which he really already does, it just wouldn't be write. They're a band, they all write their own songs, it's only fair that everyone gets to share in it. I personaly think Lodge's voice is better than ever and that Thomas' is still fantastic.

More technical sounding than Mushroomhead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crossbreed means something.","review":"Their name \\"Crossbreed\\" has a very descriptive meaning. They're... well a cross between heavy metal bands. Blending the sounds of Flaw, with the intensity of Slipknot to the roaring guitars of Rammstein, vocals reaching that of Static X and the heaviness from Pantera comes an incredibly skilled underground heavy metal band, Crossbreed. Each song is very diverse and while the 'techno-like' jingles bring out the sound, rather than annoy the heck out of you. Crossbreed's ability to make each song diverse and meaningful is a good sign. My personal favorite song by them is 'Seasons'. It's powerful and agressive tone sets it for one of the heaviest songs on the album.Overall grade for Cross breed 9.5 / 10.0 Nothing is perfect, but Crossbreed cuts it very, very close! I highly reccomend this album to you if you like bands such as Superjoint Ritual, Pantera, and Flaw."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD","review":"Overall this CD is just awesome.... of course, some songs are better than others, but the whole cd is great.

There are NO fillers in this CD.Be aware, however, that this CD must grow on you. For me, I did not appreciate songs 6-12 for a few weeks later... at first they seem like fillers, but as you listen it becomes obvious that the ENTIRE CD is excellent. \\"Breathe\\" is an AWESOME concert song -- the song I immediately remembered from the concert after listening for a few seconds. \\"Lost Soul,\\" the last song, is perhaps one of the best on the CD along with \\"Severed.\\"If you like MuDvAyNe, you will especially love this CD.

You will not be disappointed with this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good major label debut","review":"Having heard Waterdown before and thought they were intresting, I thought I'd try em out. I wasn't let down. They play a brand of emotional hardcore with a popish twist.

Pick up this cd today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another hit from the FBI guys","review":"I find these books very interesting and informative about not only the criminals but also the work that goes into actually catching criminals. As a victim advocate, I have often been amazed that law enforcement ever manages to catch anyone...due to lack of funding, resources, and cooperation among districts not due to anyone's efforts or capabilities. Hazelwood, Douglas, and the rest of these guys have been able to track down, apprehend, and actually study/interview some of the most infamous killers in this country. Any of these books are a good read for true crime or forensic fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's The Point.....","review":"The book is presented in sections that are in themselves supposed to be complete. The problem is that they jump around for no apparent reason. There is no flow. You are reading about one type of serial killer in one chapter and in the next you are learning about why and how the author's main source of information was educated. Also there were some rather brutal descriptions of killings but at the end of the chapter there is no reason for having included them in the book. In those instances there was not a wrap up to define the type of crime and criminal. It was just gore for gore's sake.I have read other books in this vein and I found this one sadly lacking."},{"rating":"2","title":"An educational overview of the sexual predator","review":"The Evil That Men Do takes the uninitiated into the quagmire that exists inside the minds of sexual predators. It is an easy read for the non-prefessional as well as an educational tool for those of us who work in the field of sexual predators. My only regret is that Michaud appeared to concentrate too much of his time on the life and history of Roy Hazelwood and too little time on the priceless perspective that Hazelwood brings to the world of sexual predators. I would recommend this book as a must read for every woman for no other reason than that it debunks the myth that there is one way to react to a rapist. With the six types of rapists and ways to respond to each, Michaud and Hazelwood have provided invaluable information that could some day save a person from being a victim of those that Hazelwood profiles so well."},{"rating":"1","title":"None","review":"If you were expecting a book like the ones John Douglas has written, look elsewhere. The book does not focus enough on the actual crimes and more on psychological things such as autoerotic asphyxiation. The book is also not in first person, which i found to be tedious and hard to get through. I was looking forward to a case by case analysis by Hazelwood himself and I was dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Couldn't wait to get my hands on this one, but should have. There is no cohesive timeline to any of the stories and I constantly had to read backwards just to try and figure out which case they were talking about. Many of the stories have no ending, they just trail off into the next case story. Critical case details were omitted and embarrassingly gruesome \\"facts\\" were thrown in at odd moments. I was also quite appalled by the amount of typos I came across, including the various spellings of one crime victim's last name. And, contrary to the title, I did not find much psychological insight on any of the cases. I'd rather read John Douglas's narcissistic rants - at least they make sense.

Yes. Will you come away thinking you understand Roy Hazelwood any better? Probably not. Will this book be a good read?

Because she is a few years older than the other rising stars, I think Goldy has a better chance to succeed because she knows what is up, and is more mature.

This book consistently enlightens, never losing its charm. I've gone to it again and again, having reread it half a dozen times or more over the past 5 years.

It was as if he had read the Celestine Prophecy and figured he could write a best seller with an adventure set in the Himalayas instead of Peru, and using Tibetan Buddhism to get his spiritual message across. I despair when I see how this book becomes a bestseller when other more erudite books speak from the heart and experience. Try reading Annapurna Circuit: Himalayan Journey by Andrew Stevenson. There's a spiritual journey, full of the colour and reality of the experience.

For an introduction to Buddhism and/or meditation, try The Accidental Buddhist by Dinty Moore or Awakening the Buddha Within by Lama Surya Das. As fiction, it rates right up there with another example of spiritual drivel, The Celestine Prophecy. Buddhism in its purest form is one of the simplest, most logical spiritual paths one could follow, and this author bastardizes it into something almost unreckognizable. Do not waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"New-age claptrap","review":"I was quite disappointed in this book. It was billed as \\"a fictional account based on a true story,\\" but I have considerable doubts about the \\"true\\" part. I thought it would have something to do with Nepal or Tibetan Buddhism, but it turns out that after the first chapter, it turns into an account of the \\"master's\\" lectures on new-age philosophy to the eager apprentice. The lectures aren't even very factual about Tibetian Buddhism-- instead it is about \\"auras\\" and \\"psychic vibrations\\" and the \\"Atlantean schools of mysticism\\"-- that is, the usual California school of new-age philosophy. If you're into new-age, this may be the book for you. If you want to know about Tibet, or about Buddhism, look somewhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"there are far better books on this subject than this one","review":"I love books on this topic, but I hated this book in particular. I put it down about 3/4 of the way through. The author says all sorts of questionable things that made me suspicious. For example, he says that the only way to become enlightened is to study with an enlightened Buddhist master, and that there is only one such enlightened Buddhist master in the world. So it seems to me that the author is saying the the reader will probably never reach enlightenment, which for me is an overly-pessimistic viewpoint. Also, the book is too theoretical and doesn't make much effort to tie the theory into anything that even remotely relates to the real world. For a much better book on this subject, I'd recommend \\"The Book on the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are\\" by Alan Watts Another book that I also highly recommend is Robert Persig's \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Buddhism!","review":"Someone handed me a copy of this book because they knew I was interested in Tibetan Buddhism.

The first part of the book read like a high school girl's diary, then the writing style tightened up and actually wasn't bad. So too, a bit of content was interjected that was reasonably decent. Then the sh** storm started, a storm that was so incredibly logically inconsistent that it was offensive. But still fascinating. And we're not talking about inconsistent with respect to external frameworks, we're talking inconsistent within the framework in which the tale is set. Buying into that load would require extreme gullibility and the complete suspension of all of one's critical facilities.

Moreover, Lenz makes more money then any and all top pro riders (even Terje), so don't be fooled by his so-hip-Cali-pour-boy front; he's a million-dollar-poster-boy who will sell-out at a moments notice.Ask anyone who can land a backside rodeo 540 who \\"Frederick Lenz\\" is...and they'll have no clue.

The antifog eyepieces are over priced and should have a better and more secure attachement to the eye pieces.

It is not a theory item though, so it will not really give you a theory or a set of persons whom they feel carried out the murder for the most part, they will only give you the backdrop, which I feel was well thought out. This is a great subject, my book is on its way as well; take it from the Special Agent, Oswald would have had trouble shooting himself in the foot never mind a moving target; yes it happen in America, they removed our President from power, and the results have been horrible; The Vietnam War, Watergate, Iran Contra, Iraq Wars 1 + 2, 911, massive recessions, and now our new Vietnam, Afghanistan; Welcome to our world, minus common sense and rational thinking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Doc","review":"This is a great documentary of the history leading up to and beyond JFK murder. Also an in depth history of the follow-up after the murder, including the nonsense put forth by the Warren Commission. This is one of the better documentaries in that it is in depth, attempting also to connect the dots of the who and the why."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be part of every history class","review":"I will just add to the accolades. This documentary avoids the shrieking and name calliing and presents a sensational selection of news clips and reportage to present the proper context for any JFK murder discussions.Add this to the dvd of \\"The Tillman Story\\" (which doesn't mention JFK at all) and one will better understand how - 50 years later - military people will always follow orders and will assist in creating false images of people if it is in the interest of the military.There were many \\"admirals and generals\\" at JFK's autopsy. The doctor who \\"burned\\" his notes andhis original autopsy report was following orders."},{"rating":"1","title":"'Swamp Zombies' Wallows in the Bog","review":"I always want to give small-time filmmakers credit for at least trying, but after a string of lower-than-low budget zombie flicks (Quick & The Undead, Zombiez, Day Of The Dead 2: Contagium and Legion Of The Dead just to name a few), I beg the question: when will the madness end??We all know the classic zombie formula: lifeless corpses + strange expriement gone wrong = the rampaging undead. I just wish that the directors would also pay attention to a little something called pacing. I'd much rather see 70 minutes of a tight storyline than 120 minutes of unnecessary scenes and useless dialogue. Also, the acting. How do those performances EVER make it to print??It's snickers and giggles straight to the end. The real horror doesnt begin until the Special Features. Yes, those taped auditions? Downright cringeworthy. But despite all the doom and gloom of Swamp Zombies, I will say that the fighting sequences were clever and refreshing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could of been worst.","review":"For an independent low budeget zombie movie, it was still better than Day of the Dead 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"daltex","review":"I'm disappointed.

I am glad i watched it. from beginning to end i was giggling and laughing.This movie is set in the 50's. It's about lenny a 14 kid who has alot of questions about the opposite sex you know the normal stuff kissing, love, marriage but who am i kidding he's a kid in america he's curious about sex! But don't let me turn you off of this movie this is a heartwarming film as well it touches on subjects as sex and the difficulties of married life and family.But all in all this movie a great and funny film and a movie i think anyone will enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Great!","review":"Just Looking is one of those films that is pure magic. Screenwriter, Marshall Karp tells a great story with captivating characters that I haven't been able to forget. The characters are likely to remind you of people from your neighborhood that you knew as a child.Jason Alexander makes choices at places in the movie that reveal his limited directing experience, but the rough edges make the film even more charming. He paints a picture that's like a sepia-toned memory. It's warm and sentimental with lots of laughs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Knock-out CD !!

There are just too many books that are more entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look else where.","review":"I felt like I was ten years old again being scolded by my mother while reading this book. The author manages to be as demeaning as possible to adults who read it. With continous comments like are you sure you're responsible enough to have a pet? Maybe you should try a fish. Comments like this are relentless throughout the book. It was like the author wanted to make you feel like a retard or something.However, that's not to say that the book is without its merits (hence the 2 stars not just one). There's allot of information here on caring for your Japenese Chin as well as some interesting history on the species. Anyway, if your alright with being spoken to as if you were a 2 year old you can't go wrong with the price. Just be forewarned, the author is down right irritating at times.

Happy to find a seat that is comfortable yet functional."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice comfort","review":"This seat is a huge improvement in terms of comfort over the stock seat on my Trek road bike. The major downside is that the plastic housing for the springs prevents a quick-release underseat storage pouch from being easily attached. I'm pretty sure I can rig something, and it's a fair trade off for the upgrade in comfort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seat","review":"This seat came in a few weeks ago, put it on my Montague Paratrooper, and it is definitely an improvement over the one that the previous owner had. The thick cushion and springs makes things far more comfortable over longer distances.The only real issue I can see (and one that another reviewer had) is that the fabric on the seat might start to rot fairly quickly if constantly exposed to rain. The cheapest solution to that is to just toss a plastic bag or other seat cover over it when the bike is left on a rack outside. (Worked for similar seats I've had in the past.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Improvement over Stock Seat","review":"I have a Trek Mountain bike, mid to entry level, and the stock seat was making my behind quite sore after 15 miles or so. This seat has helped greatly and I'm able to go 20-30 miles with added comfort. I don't believe there is any seat that is 100% luxury on a mountain bike but if I had to choose a new seat again, I'd pick this one. This seat does have an excellent gel surround and adjustable springs for bounce or cushion but I don't use the spring ability much in order to take bounce out of my ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable and well made","review":"I am retired now and wanted to take up riding again. The standard seat on the folding bike I purchased was a torture device and my first modification was a better seat. This is a great looking, comfortable seat and it is very well made. While there may be more comfortable seats available I think this is a great compromise between a big flat cushion and a standard bike seat. The integral springs in the seat really work and it is fully adjustable fore and aft."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This product has been a great investment I believe. Before this sit I had a sit that was really skinny and I couldn't ride long distances. But this has gel base material that helps with long trips."},{"rating":"2","title":"Didn't even use yet, but I can feel the difference","review":"I got this to replace the stock seat on my recently purchased Mongoose Sector because it was doing a number on me. I haven't even got home to try it out, but to the touch, this thing feels like a pleasure. The gel seat feels like I can ride for hours comfortably as it covers much more surface area and is far better cushioned. Aside from being significantly bigger (and understandably so) than my current seat, my only concern is (as another reviewer mentioned) water. I sure hope it can withstand a little rain. I'll update later."},{"rating":"2","title":"good bike seat","review":"This bike seat really comfortable and i really enjoy it while i'm biking for more than an hour.

First time I used it, after about 2 minutes it started to rock forward and back - no good in traffic.The seat is designed so you can adjust the angle forward/back, which is good if you want to to that. But, to get the seat tight enough stay level, I had to mess with it so much that the nuts got stripped pretty badly - they're really soft."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable","review":"I returned it because the seat is uncomfortable dont get mislead by the \\"Comfort\\" in the title.

The water broke down the lycra and started tearing. Over the course of a few months, the fabric tore more and more until the whole front of the seat was exposed. the foam ripped and broke off, exposing a piece of hard plastic covered in tape. The seat was somewhat comfortable before it broke, I just wish the fabric was a little more durable.UPDATE: I purchased theSchwinn Pillow Top Cruiser Bicycle Seatas a replacement, and it has served me well! It's not completely waterproof (heavy rain can seep in through the seams and be absorbed into the cushion) but it did not take long to dry. It is slightly firmer, but I highly recommend the Schwinn seat if your bike may be exposed to the elements."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feels great","review":"Within the first five miles of riding my bike's stock seat, I knew it had to go. So in a fit of sore-backsidedness, I looked though the available options on Amazon and purchased this seat. I am very happy. This seat has been much softer to ride on, and does a great job absorbing road bumps.Based on other reviews and looking at the materials, I'm a little concerned about getting it wet. I've taken to keeping a plastic bag in my bike bag that I use to cover the seat when I park it outside."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very comortable....","review":"The seat is very comfortable and makes riding a bike more enjoyable. I just ride about 45 to 60 minutes at a time on the weekend and so far it has been more enjoyable due to the comfortableness of the seat. My seat post has a suspension and this seat has a suspension so it makes a bumpy road less bumpy. Had to get one for my significant other as well since it was really comfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Worth the Upgrade - Very Comfortable","review":"I was growing tired of the gel cover I had over my stock saddle. It would move all over the place, making long rides incredibly uncomfortable. Started looking for new saddles here and found the Cloud-9.

Sweeping, moving, the music has an almost magical quality to it. At times sounding very reminiscent of the \\"Conan the Barbarian\\" soundtrack, this is excellent music. The theme song, \\"O Fortuna,\\" was featured on Williams' Summon the Heroes CD. This CD is an excellent, wonderful, brilliant piece that everyone should own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable","review":"First, don't get any other version without reading the fine print. This one has the full orchestra, full adult chorus, full children's chorus, and world-class soloists that are called for in the original score. Most other versions cut corners. Trust me, you don't want \\"Carmina Burana Lite.\\"Second, I was blown away by this work, and I am not generally a fan of 20th century music. The opening chorus is famous, and rightly so, but it really comes into its own when heard in context, especially when it is reprised as the ending chorus.Third, the first time you listen to it, you simply MUST listen to the whole thing uninterrupted, at good volume with top-quality headphones or speakers. Otherwise, you won't be doing the work and the recording justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughtful and witty","review":"Shattock does an excellent job considering the reader in telling his story of a trip to a Buddhist centre in Rangoon.

The reason I bought this unit was to avoid creating more noise (BK80D makes zapping noise). It does succeed in trapping small flying insects, just not enough. I see the \\"swarm\\" of insects around it, so the blacklight and octenol must be effective at drawing them in. I suspect the failure is the fan isn't strong enough to suck them in (evidence is little moths able to fly in/out and around it without getting trapped). I am ecstatic with the Flowtron BK80D - its a lean mean killing machine in comparison (piles and piles of insects fall to the ground). This unit barely got a handful after 2 months of continuous operation (and diligent octenol replacement).

The new sounds are quite jarring and simply don't belong there, even if the rest of the disc is fine. Until a corrected version is released there's no point in buying this set or anything else from Rhino since we can't be assured that the same errors won't be made on other products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Animation Quality","review":"By this point in the series, it was obvious that it was obly being created to make $$$. They kept introducing new and never before seen characters so that they could make more toys and make more money. The animation quality fell off drastically to the point where some frames literally go through other frames and the picture is just this big image of nothing. At other times, transformers will literally walk through their surrounding scenery without seeming to come in contact with any of it. Really, they walk through spaceships, giant pets, and trees without ever disturbing it, or having it disturb them. The animation was horrible!The stories don't get much better either, honestly. Some of these plots are so fantastically lame (a disco club gone bad?) that the episodes are extremely difficult to sit through even for a mad-wicked Transformer fan like myself.

So, I went and picked this CD up immediately. How disappointing. The India influence was refreshing to hear, however, his lyrics have no direction and the music is scattered at best.

It's got tons of Flute on it! And, lots of nice orchestral arrangements leaving behind any remnents of the 80's sounding synths and electronic drums. There is a slight middle eastern flair to many of the songs, which works perfect with Ian's flute playing. Very enjoyable to listen too. The lyrics have a real original feel to them, with no reliance on repeating similar stylings or sections from their past works.

This album comprises the recordings for \\"The Student Prince\\" and \\"The Desert Song\\" all digitally remastered. \\"The Student Prince\\" recordings are from the soundtrack of the movie, one that Lanza did not get to star in. Edmund Purdom was chosen to star, and Lanza's voice was dubbed into the soundtrack. Baffling!

One cannot ignore her intense pain and anguish. I wanted to kick Nancy's husband in the teeth regarding the indifference he shows her. The relationship that occurs between Nancy and Louis is incredibly spooky and creepy, but still feels real.This is such a bleak movie that I wish I has spent the time watching something else.

It is a collection of pseudoscientific nonsense. I was expecting pictures of \\"ghosts\\". What I got were pictures of dust, water droplets, and (possibly cigarette) smoke illuminated by a flash at close distance. As an experienced photographer, I know what they look like. Anyone can reproduce these images without any \\"paranormal\\" assistance. I have a problem with Lenore Sweet being called \\"Dr. Sweet\\".

It gives no information or instgruction on how to photograph the paranormal. Not only that, I cannot tell you how many photos they mention in their text, you look for the photo and it is not even included in the book. I would not recommend this book to anyone. This woman also claims nothing (spirits, good or bad) can ever follow you home which is not true. She claims you cannot photograph an orb without flash which is also false.

For many days after that, I did not photograph any orbs. When I first read Dr. Sweet's book, I was astounded to discover that I may have been photographing my friend in her new \\"dimension.\\"The insight and extensive knowledge of this author kept me reading the book in one incredible sitting, from cover to cover.I highly recommend this for anyone who has the slightest interest in understanding the possible existence of other dimensions.

This is probably the worst work I have seen from Von Trier. The film is incredibly short, and still manages to seem long and grating at points. Stylistically, themetically, and in regards to acting, this film is very strong, however it is overly minimalistic to the point of being off-putting.If you absolutely have to complete your Von Trier collection then consider purchasing this DVD, otherwise I'd recommend seeking out the complete Europa trilogy and the under appreciated Kingdom miniseries.

The characters were developed pretty well, we got a good idea of who they were, however they wern't built as likeable characters. They were dull, drab, and I couldn't bring myself to care what happened to them one way or the other.I had to force myself to finish this book mostly because I wanted to get my money's worth. I kept reading hoping it would get better, it never did.

Unlike her other books that I read this book didn't capture me from the start. It took awhile to get involved in the book and the characters. The plot was a bit involved, I kept thinking what I thought would happen, and I actually liked my ideas for the ending better than how the book ended. With all that said Diane Chamberlain always writes good books, and I still would highly recommend reading this book her others are just fantastic from the start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just So So","review":"This book was about childhood sexual abuse and repressed memories.

Unfortunately this was the third in a series of three and I had not yet read the first two before starting this one. However, although I still haven't read the other two, I don't think they necessarily need to be read in order and I am look forwarding to reading The Keeper of the Light, and its sequel. I once read on the Author's blog that she puts a lot of time and effort into constructing the end, and being an \\"end reader\\" (I can't resist turning to the last page when I am about a third through a book), I felt quite guilty. I constrained myself with this book and did not read the end until the very last page. I must say it was a pleasant surprise not to know what was going to happen until then. Another superb book from Diane Chamberlain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising and interesting...","review":"I find that the more I read of Diane Chamberlain's books the more I like the author.

I read all the reviews just to be sure. One past review by (Claudia Baptista on May 17, 2010) stated she received three cases. I thought that was good deal. Boy I was wrong. As a result of contacting the seller regarding my complaint, the seller added a product feature section stating that now it was for a single case, not three.In regards to the product itself, just too major negatives, which in hindsight, would prevent me on purchasing this product.-Marble black case does not have breathable holes.-Total price with shipping is expensive.

It simply means that he has put together such splendid scores around Pedro Almodovar's movies through their longstanding director/scorer relation, that there's plenty of great material to choose from. 'Live Flesh,' like most of his other works, combines strings and reeds with elements such as harp and bandoneon to accomplish part of the dramatic stamp that is essential to Almodovar's visuals. However, if made to choose, I'd go with his score to 'All About My Mother' or 'Talk To Her' above this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sea Siren","review":"Lovely Latina Kiki Figueroa is dressed as a mermaid, advertising for her new restaurant, La Sirena, when Tino Suarez first spots her.

Luckily I paid a bit more for it from a good dealer in Hong Kong and they let me have a replacement the second day I took it back(not to be taken for granted in this part of world).

The problem is that the keys are what can only be described as 'sluggish.' Meaning that it sometimes takes 2 key presses in order to be recognized. As you might imagine, this causes a LOT of errors. Rather than being able to use the calculator as one might do, that is, without really having to concentrate on the device itself, the HP 17bII+ forces you to take your mind off your real task in order to make sure that key presses are properly registered. Sorry, but I can't recommend this product.One other thing... I DID call HP customer service about this a few months ago. They had me remove the batteries and do a complete reset of the static memory.

Some of my co-workers recommend this item so I thought I'd give it a try. My first impression is that a very light calculator and even though it looks more modern than the previous version, I thought the look n feel had a plastic feel to it that is not impressive (i prefered the old solid OEMs). About the menus I thing is very easy to use, the TVM and cash flow as well as the examples in the manual help the user to achieve the results they are looking for. Also I think the solver is one of the most powerful functions available and also easy to type calculator, bonds, date and currencies also very good to have.

I was surprised to find that HP no longer offered it for sale (big mistake; never take a classic of the market). As the new 17BII+ was my only option (absent tapping the used market) I gave it a shot. At first, the features made it look like an upgrade (currency converter, etc.) however, once I started using it I noticed one very major flaw: the new buttons simply do not work. They stick/don't connect resulting in approximately 20% of my keystrokes not registering. This calculator became so frustrating to use, I ended up trading it away to my unsuspecting office-mate for his banged-up, but still perfectly functioning 5 year old 17BII.

It is not worth the money. The buttons work poorly so you must exercise extreme care when keyboarding or you will have input errors. Today the display cracked not due to abuse but the clasp for the case hits right where the display broke. HP will not replace this calculator because they consider this abuse or customer damage versus a poorly thought out design.

There may be new features in the 17B2+, but all I really wanted was the old features. The most important feature I wanted was for the calculator to actually work.The 17B2+ had clunky keys, which I didn't like but I could live with.The 17B2+ also had the annoying habit of ignoring the first keystroke I input. Maybe they have a \\"sleep\\" function for powersaving if the calculator isn't used for a period. If so, somebody screwed up in the implementation. But, I can live with this too.Now, after about a year, the calculator is resetting every other day, so I have to re-program all my Solver functions (yes, I did change the batteries....).HP calculators were well made, from the design right through to product quality.

The 17BII+ is functionally similar to the 19BII, but much more compact, with better keys and build quality. It doesn't have unit conversions, which were quite useful on the 19B. Also, the 19BII had a very handy four line display that is missing from the 17B.Some users lament the build quality of the 17B, and believe that it is not up to the standards of the older 12C. I understand the complaint, but believe that the plastic 17B is actually more durable than the 12C, and the design and functionality is far superior.Overall, I like this calculator alot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keypad problems after 2 days of use :-(","review":"The keypad did not even last 2 days.

I've been an HP calculator user for 25 years, and am astounded at the cheap junk that they are now willing to put their name on. Forget about technical capabilities; if the damn keyboard doesn't function properly its all just academic. The keyboard on the 17bii+ is garbage. Routinely misses keystrokes. A calculator that costs $100 should be a quality item. Costs 4-5x as much as comparable TI or Casio financial calculator models. If it wasn't for the fact that HP is still the only manufacturer using true RPN I would have switched long ago. At this point, I think I'll just suck it up and forget about RPN because I'm tired of paying through the nose for a new HP when the old one breaks down every two years.

I buy anything Motley Crue. I think Nikki Sixx could fart into a tape recorder and I'd probably pay $14.99 for it. I need help. The fact that I bought this is proof.It's not so bad. It's basically a Motley live album, since all the songs (minus one) are Crue tunes. That's OK, but I'm sure there are lots of fans who would agree that it would have been much more exciting to get a live CD of mostly Neil solo tunes. I've got Motley live stuff. 99% of the folks who bought this CD probably do, too. Give me something different.I read somewhere that Vince commented that there would have been more solo songs on the record, but the tapes got lost. I don't think so. I've seen Vince on every solo tour he's done, and he hasn't performed his own material in YEARS. The last time he played primarily VN songs, Steve Stevens was still in the band.I'm going to stop writing now. I've already put more effort into my review than Vince did in this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"No one like Mick, Tom n Nikki","review":"I think Vince should find real musicians for his band. There is too much Wah in the songs, but the sound is raw with no corrections or anything, which makes a live recording sound \\"live\\". I am not very familiar with the Look in her eyes song, but it sounds good, but the rest of the songs are not interpreted with the feel that Mick plays them. Samantha plays better the drums than this guy, and tha bass I could hardly hear it, buy it to complete your Motley/Vince collection....not because it is a great cd like the rest of the Motley/Vince cds...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saturating Motley Crue","review":"I think this album should be entitled \\"Motley Crue - Live: Entertainment or Death II\\".

ALICE DEEJAY IS NOT TRANCE. The cd is just a bunch of club hits (except for touch me and sandstorm, but the way they're presented they hardly sound trance). Now, being a trance head, I don't usually listen to vocals in my music, which is the first shocking part of this CD. The emphasis on vocals in many songs detracts from the over all quality! MOreover, the transitions are pure ..., they're abrupt and create a lack of flow in the CD, once again detracting. Many of the songs are hits, though hardly trance tracks, but as mixed, do not present a coherent listening experience.

Killer club music, though I will agree with a previous reviewer about the transitions from song to song--kinda rough and abrupt. Great songs make up for that, though. Big club hits here include Darude's \\"Sandstorm, Fragma's \\"Toca's Miracle\\", \\"Castles In The Sky\\" from Ian Van Dahl, \\"Zombie Nation\\" from Kernkraft 400, Miss Jane's \\"It's A Fine Day\\" remake and \\"Better Off Alone\\" from Alice Deejay. Granted, some of these songs are played out, but there's also some other really cool tracks here, including \\"Ordinary World\\" from Aurora (now all over pop radio--a remake of a Duran Duran hit), \\"Touch Me\\" from Rui Da Silva, which starts the party off, and Kay Cee's \\"Escape\\". Almost all the tracks are club hits. Even the one clunker, Sarina Paris' \\"Look At Us\\", is only a clunker because they didn't pick the best mix.

Assembly was relatively easy, but the first sign of trouble was the router plate not being level with the top. I kept looking for some kind pf shims or spacers, but the tope was a full 3/32 off. Passing wood over the plate is not an option. I used some washers to get the top closer to flat, but this unit will be going back. I can not recommend this unit to anyone.

Leveling the router plate with the table is impossible without buying some washers and shims. Either a designer dropped the ball and spec'd the router plate insert rabbet too deep or the penny pinchers changed the length of the leveling inserts or the thickness of the router plate to save money. At any rate there is not enough adjustment to level the plate with the table top with out backing out the inserts. Every thing else about this table is nice but this is a deal breaker.

I make boxes and the plastic inserts are such low quality that nothing comes out routed evenly. They are flimsy pieces of thin plastic and even a little pressure causes them to sag as you go across them. Plus they do not line up flush with the table top so small pieces get stuck on the outfeed side. There is no way to adjust them either so you are stuck with what you have.

You can easily spend a good deal more for a table with less features.The only issues I had was that the table was hard to find locally, there was a problem with the table leveling since the table hold-down screw was cross-threaded into the leveler and there was a small chip off the top corner of the table. I was able to use a die to re-cut the threads on the screw. I didn't take the table back for the chip, since after searching all day, I purchased the last one.All in all, the table does represent a good value and it is a welcomed replacement for a previous table I owned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product Review","review":"I recently purchased the unit and thus far have been quite dissapointed. To start the assembly was easy but the materials were unsatisfactory, I was missing several fasteners and one of the panels was not square. The hole guard is a joke, I drew blood the first time I opened the door from the sharp edge.If you are interested in having a flat consistant surface to work from seek another unit. The table edging protrudes above the surface of the table which must be trimmed. The most significant problem is the router mounting plate is not flat. I have access to a blanchard grinder which corrected the problem.Essentually if your are looking for a cost effective table that produces work that has some variations, this is your product otherwise I would invest in a Benchdog. If I did it over again I would move to the Benchdog, After correcting the table trim problem I figured I was stuck with the unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"too many lips","review":"The fence indicators are not precise enough. I ended up putting on sticky measuring tape. The real problem is the excess of lips. I leveled the plate to the table but there is still a gap all the way around the plate. The insert is also not level with no real way to level it. This isn't a problem when doing template routing or edge routing, but it was disastrous to my sliding dovetails and tenons.(end grain routing) I think I'm going to sell this and get a Kreg or a Benchdog table."},{"rating":"1","title":"A piece of junk","review":"Please do not buy this piece of junk. The double screw assembly is a dumb idea. A screw stripped out when I attempted to screw it into the MDF. The table does not stay level.

It probably was touched by the hand of some some skilled RCA tech with his eye on the score.Typical of 1956-1962 RCA recordings the sound is very good indeed.The soundstage is excellent. There is no spotlighting, just a very realistic reproduction of the orchestra. In that period RCAwas unequaled in miking and recording technique (not that they were not \\"bettered\\" by Mercury, which they were.) They had much more realistic sound than, for example, either of the two big British companies Decca (London) and EMI (Angel).For instance, I'm now listening to the second movement.

I had just started playing acoustic guitar and learning all things Paul Simon but had no idea this album existed. It was all I listened to for the rest of my stay. Nearly 20 years later, I still love every song on this album...Except for \\"Cars Are Cars\\" which I hereby state is the absolute worst Paul Simon song you will ever hear. Otherwise, this album is almost perfect. One of the most underrated -- and therefore most unheard of -- songs Simon ever wrote, \\"Song About The Moon\\", pops into my head more often than I care to admit. Originally, this was to be the Simon and Garfunkel reunion album, but at the last minute, Simon decided to remove Garfunkel and release it as a solo album. Does anyone know if the tapes still exist of Garfunkel singing on any of these songs?"},{"rating":"1","title":"a few bonus songs...why not add the Garfunkel demos??","review":"Typical...they add a few unreleased and bonus tracks. What alot of people know is that this was originally to be a S&G; album and Art sang on just about every track. The record execs hated it, Art and Paul fought over creative differences again as they always do. So Simon basically Fired Art, took his vocals out and released this as a solo. You can hear a few of the Garfunkel tracks on youtube.So I say...now it's many many years later....why not release this as it was intended...with Art!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from this CD!","review":"I love John Anderson's music.

I would love to know where this music comes from. If I were to guess, I would say before his first album \\"John Anderson\\" and it was some kind of demo record. All of the rich voice of Mr. Anderson seems to have been recorded in a way that makes him sound like a Generic country singer.

When I put my 40D into the Canon bag, the camera moves around too much and the supportive padding is not sturdy to hold the camera in place. Also, there is no support strap inside the bag to lock down the camera. I think the bag should have some type of supportive strap to keep the camera from moving.

All of the zippers on the bag have malfunctioned from the first day. I live overseas and it arrived more than 30 days after it was shipped so returning it without penalty is near to impossible, even for a bag that doesn't work.

Therefore, I don't think a 10D or a 20D will either. Not sure about an XT since it is smaller. Assuming of course you have the add on battery grip like I do. The zippers absolutely stink. They are light duty and don't zip smoothly. I feel like the weight of the camera up high will force the zippers to slowly unzip and there goes the camera. I am so unimpressed.

This bag is smaller than one of the bags I was replacing. My 5D Mark II with the 24-70 f/2.8 L lens attached takes 1/3 of the space of this bag alone. Also as others have noted either remember to zipper around to the bottom every time or safety pin one end of the zipper at the bottom to force you to remember or you'll have your equipment falling out if you zipper both to the top.

I read these things all the time..and never know if the people writing are normal or not. I am just a guy who likes good value at a fair price. This is it. You can arrange the inside configuration in multiple ways. It is sturdy..semi comfortable for a loaded down pack. You can get L Lens, camera bodies, accessories (plenty of room).

My only complaint is the infamous Canon name in bright letters... I know, I know... The manufacturer wants to promote their brand. The problem is that you become a target especially when walking around third world countries... If I had it my way, the name of manufacturer would be a replaceable velcro tag.

Not quite as large as i had imagined. The slot that is designed for a camera mounted with large telephoto lens will barely hold my Canon 7D with vertical grip and 70-200. I have to tug and push to get the zipper to close. This bag would definetly not work for someone with a tall camera like a 1D series. This is why i gave it 4 out of 5 stars. I almost gave it 3 stars. Canon should have noticed this before putting it into production."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seams are poppin!!!","review":"I purchased this backpack approx. 6 months ago. I have used it about 3 times a week. The form and fuctionality of the item is fine. The quality of the construction is poor. The seams are beginning to pop at multiple points. If you are looking for a backpack for even moderate use I would look to a different brand. I am suprised that Canon put its good brand on this item.

There is still enough room to fit 3 more lenses up to 100mm each and a variety of other items. All items are held very securely and the backpack has broad shoulder straps that distribute weight evenly and comfortably. It has multiple straps for attaching tripods or other accessories that require less protection than the camera and lens system.

Not good.If I could return it today I would as a future zipper episode haunts me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for light use","review":"I have had this bag for a year or so and am not extremely happy with it. It is truly only for light use. The smaller cameras (350D, 400Xti) would work with maybe two telephotos and a flash. Also I really don't use it that much and one of the straps for securing the bag around my waste has almost come out. I am going to have it repaired and will probably try to sell the bag.

It has some cracks but still working good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon camera backpack","review":"The Canon Photo Backpack 200EG is definitely a plus for photographers. It has plenty of room for camera and several lenses, as well as room for other accessories such as spare batteries, memory chips lens filters etc. The pack is lightweight and is comfortable to wear on those extended photo hikes. The only down side is having to remove the pack to get at spare lenses or other accessories, but hey, it's a backpack after all. I would definitely recommend this item for those photographers wanting to get out and shoot pictures without dragging a bulky camera bag along with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"canon deluxe photo backpack","review":"I needed to find a camera backpack that could easily hold two cameras and all the supplies I needed to carry as well. This fills the need great. Both my cameras fit great along with cables and extra batteries. Also the extra outside zippered section made it easy to carry all the stuff normally in my purse so I did not need to take two bags. Only thing I wish is the straps for the tripod do not have quick release clips. So removing the tripod you have to loosen the straps, you can not just adjust the size and just remove it by unclipping it. But otherwise it filled all my needs and the only one I found that would hold everything comfortably."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price and function!","review":"After considering some of the more expensive camera bags, I decided to go with this one, since the reviews were good.

What I loved about it, both before I bought it and now that I own it: It holds everything and you can reconfigure the space to fit whatever you carry. Second, there is plenty of room in the secondary pockets - to the point where I can take hiking gear and my camera (with lenses) and feel like I have everything I need on my back.Where it came up short for me (pun intended) is the fit. I'm a 6'2 woman and the straps aren't particularly comfortable. They don't move easily and I feel like I have to contort my body to climb into the pack frame.I recommend the bag - it beats everything else I saw on the market, but just be aware - if you are a very tall man or woman, it is a little less comfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value","review":"This is an amazing bag given the price.

My first bag is 5 years old and is still perfectly functional. I got a second bag because the first bag worked so well and I needed more space for extra gear. The build quality is very good and comparable to more expensive models from other bag manufacturers. I regularly carry a bag full of glass and these have not failed on me after so many years of travel. The inner compartment is fully customizable. Easily fits a Canon 1D MKII with 300/2.8 lens. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great backpack for travel","review":"Just purchased this backpack and it was exactly what I was looking for. I just purchased a 70-300mm that wouldn't fit in my shoulder bag with everything else, and this backpack does that plus more. Now I can fit all three of my cameras in it along with lenses, flashes, guides, cleaning supplies, filters, laptop, tripod, and some magazines. Although with all that stuff, it can get somewhat heavy, it's still comfortable with thick padding. Strongly recommended, great price for size."},{"rating":"2","title":"A place for everything","review":"Having just purchased a new Canon Rebel XTi, I wanted a backpack for mountain hiking that would stow all my gear. This pack fits the bill. I'm able to carry all my lenses as well as the filters, spare batteries, cables, and cleaning gear in one bag. I have a small tripod that straps on as well. It has two front straps to help balance the weight. No, it's not completely waterproof, but for the price I didn't expect it to be.

There are also several places for storage of accessories, batteries, a tripod, etc. It seems almost infinitely expandable.I also found it very lightweight and easy to carry.

This pack is definately worth the money and probably just as good as other higher priced packs on the market. It is nicely padded so I feel confident lugging my camera around in it. It is big enough to fit my 20D with 28-70mm lens and battery grip attached. There is enough space to carry the 580 EX flash, 70-200mm lens, backup camera, extra compact flash cards, & batteries.

The outer and side pockets are great for cellphones, pens, keys, books, etc. It easily holds my digital video camera as well as my digital SLR with a few lenses. My only gripe with the bag is way thebag is designed, you have to lay the bag flat in order to avoid possibly spilling out all the contents. I wish there were some straps inside to hold items in place. And since I'm wishing, it would be nice to have an external strap to attach a tripod to and then maybe even a slim pouch to slip my powerbook into.

After very little use on this Canon bag, the part where the zipper handle attached to the zipper bent off and broke. OK I lived with it for awhile, and I probably could have made a make shift zipper, but the point was I barely used the bag, why such crappy materials?AND then after not so much use, the bag flap ripped at the zipper seam all the way across!!!

The dividers for the different lenses can be customized to fit your needs and there are many pockets to hold everything else.

True, it's not as quick to get into the bag when it's strapped to your back, but flowers don't move that fast so I don't have to worry about missing \\"the shot.\\"I would recommend this bag to anyone who has to haul gear long distance and want to keep it safe and sound while doing so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Backpack!","review":"I bought this at the recommendation of other reviewers as well as for the price.

I usually have to park far from location and it has been very comfortable to carry.I even used it as a carry-on on a receient flight, sticking snacks and such in extra pockets for our toddler.

Well constructed, definitely keeps equipment safe when the bag is securely closed.What I did not like was the giant zipper opening that just falls open, that does not feel secure.. To remove equipment you must lay the backpack down and remove the top \\"flap\\".

The equipment in the main compartment got wet but not damaging so (I tried to keep it covered) however, everything in the front pockets was not so lucky. This would be a awesome bag if it was better made. When I first received it, it seemed to have been very well made. It does hold everything I need it to securely, with room left to spare.

I love the adjustable storage compartments in the main body, as well as the other pouches and pockets. If I could make one improvement on the design, I would add more straps to secure items in the main compartment.

As a very novice photographer, this bag suits my needs perfectly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bag - a few minor compalints","review":"I echo what the others say about this bag. It is a great all-around bag and carries a lot of gear. I do, however, have 2 minor complaints about the bag, but nothing serious that would stop me from recommending this bag to others. The first complaint is that when you open the main compartment fully and then try to reclose it, the zipper tends to get stuck in the open position and it takes a bit of effort to close the compartment again. I feel as if I am going to break th zipper each time I close it. The second complaint is that the shoulder straps are very stiff. Only time will tell if 1) the zipper breaks from me having to get it \\"unstuck\\" from the open position and 2) if the shoulder straps soften up. Other than that, Canon makes great use of space in the main compartment and the bag has plenty of other compaerments for various accessories."},{"rating":"1","title":"The zip too easily opened","review":"This bag is ok if you don't put too much stuff in it. Because the zip opens easily all the way to bottom, if you have too much stuff, or if something (e.g, tree trigs) is catching the flap, it will be widely open in less than 1 sec, and all your expensive equipment will likely fell to the ground. That will be a few thousands $ loss. This will also happen when you are not using extreme caution when opening the bag to retrieve stuff.So please be cautious if you wish to buy this bag.

If you open it while upright, your valuable equipment may fall out. In addition, there is a chance that the pack can open if you put too much weight in the outside top pouch.Finally, if you are looking for a bag to \\"sling\\" over one shoulder...this isn't it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great bag for the 'stuff'","review":"This pack is really a great option for anyone wanting to be mobile.

And it looks really well made. Best thing about it is, just throw it over your shoulder and go. Lots of external ties for tripod and such too. And I feel confident that my 20d is well protected. This is a must have for the mobile photographer with a moderate set of equipment, or anyone that just wants the stuff easy to carry around."},{"rating":"1","title":"It should be considered a storage bag, not a backpack","review":"While this bag works great as a storage device (customizable compartments and plenty of room for a number of accessories) it should NOT be considered for use as a backpack. The straps and the bag itself are poorly designed with regards to comfort while using as a \\"backpack\\". The straps are nothing to write home about, but worse still are the inside components of the bag that, when carried as a backpack, create pressure points throughout the back of the bag and cause discomfort over even the shortest distances.If you simply need a gear bag, this will work great. If you plan on carrying your gear on your back, look for a different pack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic bag, great price","review":"I bought this bag to go with my Canon Digital Rebel XT.

It zips from both sides. When new, I had the two zippers meeting at the top. They opened spntaneously and dumped out my new Canon Digital Rebel and a lens.

So far, so good. Then, when the bag was about 2 months old, the zipper gave out totally.

You can slip your dslr right in the top with the lens pointing down or if you have a large flash and you are using a smaller lens, then you can put it in with the flash going down. So all you have to do is unzip a little and pull out the camera and it's ready to go. There are also many extra pockets that are easy to get to.

I have taken mine all over the world for my photographic work. One problem is is zips open too easy and with the CANON name on the bag it is a pickpocket attractor.I use a shoulder strap with mine when I am shooting to give me easy access to the top and pockets. It allows me to \\"quickdraw\\" my camera.Tip: when not shooting, keep zippers down and front when in crowds to make it harder for people to get in the bag without you noticing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zipper doesn't stay closed","review":"The bag is easy to use: It opens out flat which makes for easy accessing of equipment. The big drawback is the main compartment where the lenses are kept has a double zipper-left and right sides. While I was carrying a full pack one of the side zippers worked it's way down and one of my lenses fell out and crashed to the cement! Now I safety pin the 2 zippers together at the top, and still with the weight of the bag the zip works it's way open as much as the safety pine allows it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon camera bag","review":"This bag was a great deal for the price.

This bag retails at best buy for around $70-$80, and i think i paid around $40 on amazon which is an awesome deal! The bag is very sturdy with plenty of movable dividers, and straps to keep things secure and organized. Its very spacious inside with plenty of room for extra lenses, bodies, point & shoots, or w.e else you want to stuff in it. If you are like me and just getting into SLR photography this bag will give you plenty of room to grow with a price that wont take away from your lens budget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Camera Bag","review":"For this price, the bag is outstanding.

I have an EOS 1D Mark II which is a bit larger than the 20D, Rebel, etc. I didn't feel that it would be at all safe to use this bag for the EOS 1D Mark II..the sides just didn't go up high enough to make me feel that the camera would be safe and not fall out (or have the LCD get scratched). The whole bag just feels \\"flimsy\\" for lack of a better word.

If you value your equipment don't buy it. Your lens don't fit it tight with the simple velcro. There needs to be some better way to hold your stuff in there.

In fact, it's very tiny. I'm 6'3\\" tall, and this just looks weird on me. It's too bad, because despite its size, it's very well constructed and will certainly hold your camera equipment securely. I'd have also liked a better system for holding your tripod. Velcro would have made this sooo much easier. As it is, the tripod straps are hard to adjust, and in the case of my tripod, the straps are almost not big enough. It's very hard to get the tripod in and out. If not velcro, then some sort of clasp, like what they have on the front of the back pack (between the arm straps) would work. Something that you could easily open and close.Unfortunately, I had to travel right after I bought this thing, and I can't return it. BUMMER! Maybe I can get rid of it on eBay or something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Camera Bag","review":"The bag quality is good for the price. It is made of lightweight materials.

Just put my gear in it to go shooting tomorrow and it started desintegrating at the stiches. Has a big 3 inch tear in the front, where the green fabric connects to the black fabric. Yes, it is very roomy for all your equipment but it is cheap made. The funny thing is I can not return it because I removed the cannon metal logo and I put a butterfly patch in there. So I am stuck with a piece of crap that I did not used not even ONCE. I am so mad I could scream! Again, buyers beware, this bag will desintegrate. If you want to waste 40 dollars, go for it, but you were warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price, easy to work with..","review":"I love this backpack! It's lightweight and is multi-functional. I love all the pockets and straps to hold everything you need.The one downside I feel is that the camera body pretty much has to be placed at the top of the bag. The top area doesn't have much padding around it and makes me feel like the camera body isn't as protected as the rest. Having the camera up top also makes the bag top heavy. I tried rearranging it to have the camera loose w/out a lens attached, or changing the placement to have the camera on the bottom. But the velcro dividers start to go past the zipper mark if you place the camera at the bottom.If anyone else figured out a better way please let me know or post pix. Other than that, it holds all charges, batteries, lenses, filters, and I even have a spot for my manual for emergencies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good bag with an excellent price","review":"This bag fits your DSLR and much more and is reasonably comfortable and convenient. Removing the camera from the bag is simple and safe with how the zipper curves at the top to try and make sure the bag doesn't open and dump everything else out. The buckles to hold around waist and chest are useful. The front strap-web pouch is useful for non-camera stuff like a water bottle. For recreational use without a ton of lenses and accessories I can't imagine spending any more on another bag and noticing much of a difference. I'm a weekend warrior so my experience may not translate to someone who needs to use it every single day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the photo essentials.","review":"I bought this backpack for my Canon 40D a while back.

It's also really well padded.It's big enough to hold all of my equipment (everything except a normal-sized tripod).

With over $4500 worth of gear to put in it, I promptly returned this pack when I saw the horrible quality zipper on the main compartment.First off, this is a very small pack... for a larger person like me, the pack just didn't fit right (I almost ran out of room on the pull straps when wearing the pack). The zipper on the main compartment was defective and kept coming open (from both the zipper pulls as well as from the opposite end.

And I'm a fairly serious semi-pro photographer with Canon 40D and 50D, bunch of lenses, strobist setup, and studio lighting setup. This Canon pack is marginally \\"okay\\" as a camera pack, and just \\"okay\\" value for the price. Before you buy, compare to (look at and touch) packs with more structure and protection, safe ease of use, and better suspension. I was given this pack, yet I spent money on a couple different LowePro packs to use for actual jobs. The Canon 200EG is \\"okay\\" for very lightweight duty or storing extra lenses and gear at home, but if you want to really get the job done, spend twice as much and get one that'll keep you happy as you use it, be comfortable to wear, protect your gear, and make it easy to get your camera fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great backpack for the beginner / moderate photographer!","review":"I currently own the Canon Digital Rebel XT, and I tried using a standard camera bag and the holster bag, but none of them could carry all of my kit.

Chargers, batteries, lens cleaner. i had to make two modifications.....the handle at the top is just a nylon strap that cuts into your hand if all loaded up with camer equipment. The other one is the space reserved for your DSLR is at the top of the bag.....this is fine probably the safest place, but is lacking pading to protect your LCD...I added a couple of pieces of padding from another bag here to protect the camera a bit more...just in case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning!!

The pack made for less expensive and therefore lighter lenses even when one lSeries only ounces.

Not only did the velcro dividers come undone when packed (unable to hold weight of lenses) but small items such as polarizer lens cases and lenscaps slide freely underneath dividers so that you have to dig around constantly to find what you need. Also very difficult to strap tripod onto bag and when it's strapped on you have to take it completely off again in order to access anything else in bag.I am in process of trying to get a full refund on bag and trying to work out issue of damaged lens with cannon as well, and will be more careful in choosing a new bag that is better designed to replace this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"great bag holds all of my gear nice and secure","review":"this bag is awesome! holds both bodies plus 4 lenses and a 430ex flash with room to spare in its interior and exterior pockets..its extremely comfortable and easy to carry around. i can shove cokin filters colapsible softbox and water bottle in its pockets and then some..i would highly recommend this bag to any one with a small amount of gear that they may need to lug around.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I thought it would be","review":"This backpack is very good and bought at a really good price compared to other sellers of the same backpack."},{"rating":"2","title":"canon deluxe phto backpack 200eg","review":"i like it. look just like a regular backpack. lots of space to hold lenses, batteries and such. had it for 2 mos and still enjoying it. recommended to a few friends and they're interest in getting one for themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon Deluxe Photo Backpack 200EG","review":"I love it.

A must have for all classical muci lovers, and a standard for the clarinetist."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Performance Lacking in Taste","review":"In these performances, Richard Stolzman offers us phrasing that is so overdone that it is offensive. While I do not favor the bloodlessly cautious interpretations that are to be found in several other recordings of these works, Stolzman goes tastelessly in the opposite direction.He has a pleasant tone and good intonation, but these are wasted on readings which do Brahms' music a disservice.

While the recording quality is indeed far superior,the changes in arrangement and pacing of the titles from the original album, and, the additional selections here just don't cut it musically. Do yourself a favor and buy volume 1 of the \\"Le Mystere Des Voix Bulgares.\\" It is much more absorbing and lively, despite the poor recording quality from an earlier time."},{"rating":"2","title":"From Bulgaria with Orpheus's Touch","review":"What a CD? I was exploring deeper into other cultures when I came across this CD newly placed on the shelf. I remembered Bulgarian music as one of the most unique. After listening, I felt as if I had no need to acculturate myself with the Bulgarian culture any further. The music comes from the ancient land of Thrace, where the mythical musician Orpheus was said to have originated. This has been the first foreign adventure into cultural music since 2001 and I have found a new addition to foreign music. The women's choir has the ability to bring a chilling mood to its listeners evoking the world of color, beauty, harmony, and religion. A song such as Polegnala E Toudora has the ability to sooth its listeners as well as other tracks. This music comes from Bulgaria with the touch of Orpheus; thus, nothing negative can come about of this music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Voices","review":"Mr Culver's review is certainly opinionated (and unfortunately expressed as fact) with respect to the producton of 'Voices of Life'. If he truly was up on his facts he'd know that Eddie Jobson didn't produce anything by Yes, but rather he is foremost a talented multi-genre violinist and keyboardist (UK, Roxy Music) as well as producer; but not for Yes. Eddie Offord was Yes' producer of choice for a time.Fine production values do not lessen or dilute this performance. In particular, the version of Polegnala E Toudora presented on this work is wonderfully emotional, and I feel the ambient quality of the recording enhances the experience. Some other recordings I've heard of this song sound a bit flat by comparison.Perhaps a 'purist' would differ, but this is a finely compiled work that I keep going back to."},{"rating":"2","title":"my western ear is stretched","review":"I love this recording, and I love this music. I don't have anything to compare this too since I don't own any middle-eastern style music, but as a lover of classical music it is interesting to hear the types of music that existed even before then.

Then you just send the proposal to agents/publishers and, if it's good enough, bam! you'll get a big advance. Um...no. Unless you're a celebrity or an expert with a HUGE platform, good luck getting a publisher to give you an advance for a sight-unseen work. It's almost irresponsible to suggest that it can happen.

The concept in and of itself, composing a book of 3:16 of every book of the Bible that contains the said verse, is unique. And the word art is truly wonderful touch. And the overview of each book of the Bible being covered is great.I don't necessarily agree with every single thing that Knuth says here, but generally I found his comments to be very deep and insightful. Knuth here shows that many of the good attributes of a computer scientist can be applied to Bible study, with great results.Truly one can be a man of faith and a man of reason, logic, and science. I highly recommend this book for any interested Christian who also is involved in Computer Science. If for nothing else, it is a worthwhile on the basis of the scripture word-art alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Book for pastors and layman alike","review":"I am impressed by this book. Donald Knuth is a great computer scientist, maybe a giant with few peers. How would I know that he is also a great Christian! I have seen some excellent Bible interpretation books before and was wary before I started. Then, I got hooked into it.The explanation in the book is generally accurate, clear, and easy to understand.Prof. Knuth explains thing so well that it becomes a joy to read the text. The only possible shortcoming is its breadth. If I want to prepare a talk, this book can be very useful. But it alone might be insufficient. One might want to use it in conjunction with a book like George A. Buttrick (Author), Charles M.

She has 2 mysteries to solve: who killed the mistletoe man and what is wrong with Ruby? Her new husband helps out with the hit and run case and China is pulled in as a friend of the two sisters who supply her with flowers and are in a land dispute with the victim. Add to the mix, their slightly nutty aunt who believes she has been abducted by aliens and suspicious neighbors down the road, so there are many suspects. When their new British cook gives her notice, things become even more complicated. There is quite a bit of humor in this novel and China manages to straighten things out by the end, even managing a theme for the Open House.

We followed all the instructions and watched the accompanying video regarding safety and turkey preparation. After I vetoed my Dad's suggestion we fry the turkey on his wooden deck, we set up shop on the front lawn. The Pennsylvania weather was well below freezing on the day after Christmas, so it took some time for the (vegetable) oil to reach 350 degrees. A 13-pound turkey is supposed to take 45 minutes - my Dad and my brother removed it from the oil after 30. They had used the meat thermometers and thought it was done - it was, except for the drumsticks. If I hadn't been inside the house, I would have pushed for 35 to 40 minutes fry time.Verdict: this was the juicest and tastiest turkey breast I can ever remember eating!Highly recommended, and a fun experience for the family, huddled around the propane tank and the 30 quart, bubbling, steaming pot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A whole in the bottom after 1 use","review":"We used it once and the metal was so thin that it burned right through the bottom.

My parents played nothing but classical music as I was growing up, and I've heard both of these pieces many times. Nothing, however, prepared me for Richter's rendition of the Appassionata here, he is simply on fire. It is inhuman. The Brahm's Second Piano Concerto is one of my all-time favorites, the way it slowly builds tension toward the climax is like, well, you can figure it out, and Richter's performance shines here too. Hearing Richter's interpretations here was like hearing these pieces for the first time. There is not a flawed moment on this entire disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential recordings","review":"There are other great recordings of this concerto (e.g., Gilels with Jochum conducting), but this is one of the best concerto recordings Richter made. The sound (the recording dates from 1960) is excellent. The Appassionata is nothing if not impassioned, but I would call attention to the wonderful slow movement, a fine example of Richter's power to draw the listener into a piece of music with rapt concentration and superb fingerwork and voicing. After the hushed revery of the Andante, though, hold on to your hat as Richter gallops to the finish!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Richter live with Munch, repeated with Leinsdorf","review":"I heard Richter play both the Beethoven #1 (another amazing performance and available on CD) and the Brahms #2 with Charles Munch at a benefit concert for the BSO in the 60s. Everybody knows about Richter, and most people know about Munch (and admire him extravagantly, as I do). But I at first found Leinsdorf (who followed Munch as MD of the BSO) pedantic. Gradually I learned that his technique--keep an even, steady beat, and build the emotion inside it--was incredibly effective. I attended a concert with the BSO at Brooklyn Academy where his conducting of the march from the Tchaikovsky Symphony #6 produced a 15-minute ovation (I timed it). If I had had my wits about me, I would have started a chant of \\"Again! Again!\\" Herr Leinsdorf merely modestly acknowledged the applause--again and again--and, when we had worn ourselves out, went on to play the fourth movement.I just bought this CD, which I own on LP. Obviously I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent compilation","review":"Not much two-step is available in the States these days, though much is on the way.

Fans of producers like Timbaland, Jermaine Dupri, and the Neptunes may be interested to find out where that 'hiccuppy' style of beatmaking originated. Doesn't matter if they won't admit it, one listen at this genre or even it's history will tell the truth.This album starts off with the 'flagship' stars of 2-step himself, Mr. Craig David and Artful Dodger's \\"Re-Rewind\\". It then journeys into more obscure classics. Definitely alot more interesting than those two step albums where all the tracks are just two-step remixes of American Music.The mixing could be tighter but all in all this album is fun and entertaining. If you like this then I strongly reccomend music by So Solid, Craig David and Artful Dodger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a book for a beginner","review":"While Mr. Bennett clearly qualifies as as authority in celestial navigation, this book is not well suited for beginners. The narrative is a bit to succint, forcing the reader to try and and \\"fill in the blanks\\" in order to understand what the author has stated. Modern publishing makes it easier to present tables and examples with the narrative; however, in this book the tables and examples are at the rear of the book, which makes switching back and forth difficult.

The effect of the coned piston is that it exerts a sideways force on the meat and the result is that the meat is extruded out past the piston due to the large clearamce between the piston and the housing. I've replaced the piston cone with a flat design and have a lot less meat squeezing past the piston.Also, I have broken the medium size stuffing tube and can't find a replacement. Most other manufacturers offer replacement and the option to purchase stainless steel tubes. Are you planning to offer such replacements?"},{"rating":"1","title":"sausage press is not a good design","review":"If there would have been a choice of no stars I would have chosen that.The press looks good in pictures, but the practical design is not good.The nozzles do not fit properly, they do not attach to the press in a secure manner. The press ram does not fit into the meat cylinder tightly enough.Therefore, the press meat(s) squeeze out improperly through unintended gaps, making a big mess.The unit will also need to be mounted to a board, or a table/counter top to allow the proper leverage to push the ram through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible machine","review":"I was using it for venision and the meat would not go through the funnels.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes this fits the XSI !!!","review":"OK so I have looked everywhere for this type of hood and wanted it from Canon. Thanks to Amazon I got it and a great deal. The hood does fit the 58mm lens on the Canon XSI and does a great job at blocking extra light even with the long range lens I have. It pops off and on easily for both lenses and flips backwards for storage on the lens. Works with filter and end cap.Thanks for a great deal amazon. Not bad for 23 and change. Half of what other camera shops wanted to charge me.A plus for all XSI owners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expensive","review":"This lens hood is awfully expensive for a piece of moulded plastic that probably cost no more than a few cents to make.

I've heard great things about his work and was excited to delve into this one. I appreciated Chopra's insight into the human heart and emotions. The stories he uses to highlight his points were useful, comical, and educational at certain times. I could certainly see myself in a lot of his characters.At times, I found his writing to be quite cerebral, littered with theory. I found myself having to read certain chapters over again to feel like I was getting the true sense of what he was trying to get across. It's certainly not a sit back and read at the beach type of read for me... but rather a text that I felt compelled to delve into and study."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced!

The book looks like a bunch of photocopies in a glossy paper paperback binding, the learner's guide is not actually a book but a spiral-bound collection of A5 photocopies, and the CD's look like they've been copied at someone's home. They actually have paper-stickers with the lesson numbers on them!Not to mention the lay-out: this item is written on a typewriter!!!Please save your money on this way too expensive language set by Audioforum.

All of the solos, fills, mandolin, alternate guitar tunings, and in some cases organ/synth parts are transcribed as well. From album III - V there are detailed notes on each song in the beginning of the books that give insight into how the band recorded the song and sometimes some pointers on how to play the song when there are guitar parts being played through several tracks at once. All of this collection comes in a sturdy box that holds the 5 books together nicely. This set should keep one challenged for years, and will provide great insight into one of the greatest bands ever. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Step into the musical world of Led Zeppelin","review":"This is a beautiful box set that includes 5 books, for each individual zeppelin album (I-IV, and Houses of the Holy). Every song is incredibly detailed, with both the musical score and the guitar tablature running parallel to each other.

It is broken up into five seperate books for easier use. The books give a brief synopsis on how the song's came about and some explainations to how Jimmy played them. This collection shows you what great guitar playing is really about.

Thurston Clark combines elements of geology, sociology, history with a wealth of insight to create the story of the San Andreas fault and the Californians who live above and along it. The author provides an excellent and detailed narrative, and, despite following many entertaining digressions, keeps it all together and focussed by the creative use of different themes - the trail of an ancestor who led men across the Oregon trail, his personal search for an earthquake to experience and someone to forecast it for him, and of course, the pursuit of the California dream. In particular those who like eccentrics will find a selection of the best California has to offer - their stories tied together by the author's skillfully highlighted ironies and ambiguities which are themself such a big part of any true California story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book review by Baryon Online--Reviewer Barry Hunter","review":"Blane invites his best friend Bob on a fishing trip in order to catch up with what's going on in their lives since they both retired four years earlier.

When you view it as an on-demand Amazon Instant Video, they show it to be 52 minutes long. The movie stops abruptly in the middle of a scene, effectively cutting you off from watching the last half hour of the film. DON'T BUY THIS AS A STREAMING VIDEO!!! You'll be disappointed that you can't actually watch the whole thing. As I can only comment on the first 52 minutes, the movie seems good so far...I'll let you know if I ever can watch the rest.

This is a flimsy plastic hood with a metal ring adapter which screws onto the front of the lens. Canon probably gets both pieces manufactured for pennies.

So, 1 star for cool looks and 1 star for trying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Canon f/1.8 Users Beware","review":"I would suggest anyone who is considering purchasing this hood to strongly reconsider. A rubberized collapsible hood is the way to go.While the 50mm f/1.8 is an exceptionally affordable lens and produces great photos, it has substantial weak points due to its plastic construction that prevent the use of a lens hood. The lens hood is very susceptible to sideways knocks which are exacerbated when the lens hood is attached. I bumped mine and as most people found, the front element dropped off. The interior of the lens is held together by four plastic clips. One or more of the tabs will be broken and while it is possible to re-attach it, the lens will be wobbly or have a much grittier auto-focus noise.So, buyers beware: The increased leverage on the front element produced by this lens hood will break apart the lens upon a sideways impact especially when the front element is extended."},{"rating":"1","title":"$25 for a hood on a $70 lens","review":"Boy, this is way too much to pay for a hood on this lens.

Other than that, this thing is a piece of s**t that broke a month or two after I got it. The clip-on mechanism is poorly designed and hard to use even when it's not broken. Why don't they just make it screw-in? I'm not sure if this is the only option for this lens, I haven't looked yet. You have to use a hood so I might be forced to buy another one, but I would stay away from it if at all possible.Update 4/24/07: I bought a rubber fold-up hood on eBay, and it's infinitely better than the Canon. It screws solidly into the hood adapter, and folds up out of the way when not in use. I highly recommend getting that instead of this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Canon needs to redesign!","review":"Hello All,Lens hoods are pretty much a necessity, but this has to be the mostly poorly made hood I've ever used. Unlike other hoods that screw on, this one requires you to press to opposing clips and then slide the hood one, and release the clips. This leads to problems of alignment, meaning both sides of the clip need to be perfectly aligned in order for the hood to fit right. Although it's a pain and I hate...I don't really have another alternative. Either go w/o a hood, or take this one. Either way, guess I'd rather have a hood on the lense than not having one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely non-functional design.","review":"Despite many photographers making fun of people that leave their hoods on the lens reversed, I personally like doing that from time to time. That was the main purpose I bought this over the cheaper Photodiox hood. However, the design of this hood makes it unusable.Please see my pictures to clearly see the problem. You press buttons on opposing sides to retract tabs in order to secure the hood to the threaded lens attachment; but pressing the buttons compresses the hood making it extremely difficult to attach. This makes de/re-taching the hood a very frustrating task. And because the hood is free-floating on the ring, you cannot remove the hood from the lens without first removing the hood from the attachment ring.This design was so poorly implemented, I'm really surprised it is sold. This will sit in the box on my shelf. I wouldn't accept this if given to me for free. Get the simple Photodiox hood for less money and better design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it seems","review":"This looks like a nice ring in the picture on the site, but in reality it's really rough.

Like another reader who has posted a review, I was expecting great things after the initial book in the series, The Legend of Banzai Maguire by Susan Grant. I adore Susan Grant's books and intend to read them all. However, this book is dreary and very slow-moving, kind of like Ethan Frome in the 23rd century, and I have had to force myself to finish it so I could move on with the series. There is very little interesting or likable about either one-dimensional character other than being hard-working and dedicated. The novel cries out for romance, tender words, humor, and at least a few more sympathetic or interesting characters. Even the main villain is boring and forgettable. This almost seems like a book written by a man, lots of action and confrontational dialogue, interspersed with occasional bouts of lusty sex with no romance. Hopefully the next book in the series, by Liz Maverick, is more my style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Cool Concert, Great Croud","review":"This is no doubt a great DVD.

His replacement Brian is under 6 feet tall so when he is onstage he doesn't make Malcolm and Angus Young look like underfed runts.This concert features songs old and new from the band but after 30 years one DOES grow weary of seeing Angus Young dressed like a 14 year old schoolboy when in reality he is a middle aged man.I give this DVD 5 stars because I do like the sets onstage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent video but ........","review":"Not as good as Live in Donnington!

However, it still doesn't even come close to the energy displayed in many of their earlier performances. If you really want to see an amazing show, buy Let There Be Rock on VHS. In No Bull, Angus sounds great, but there's an obvious difference between Angus in his 20s (Let There be Rock) and Angus in his 40s (No Bull). Same goes for Brian, he puts on a good performance, but no where near his performances of the early to mid 80s....Still, this is a good show, so buy it if you like some of the newer stuff better, but for a jaw-dropping performance, with showmanship just not seen anymore, watch Let There Be Rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Director doesn't have a clue!","review":"Don't get me wrong, I love AC/DC, which is why I bought the DVD. The concert is amazing, and that's the whole problem. The camera work and editing is so disjointed and frenetic, you never get to watch the band in action. The entire concert is filmed with switches between cameras almost as fast as the music, and I guess that is what the director was going for. But there is never focus on the band as a whole, or their interactions, let alone concentrating on any one member for more that 1 second.Huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so much the sound....","review":"Does the director of this DVD suffer from A.D.D?

All in all, it was disappointing for two reasons. First Brian Johnson's voice did *not* sound good (and post-production obviously couldn't help afterwards) and second, the nice long set was diminished by a lack of stage show. Angus Young running up and down the stage is entertaining for the first couple of times, but grows old quickly. Apart from the bell and cannons (gee what a surprise), that was the sum total of the show.I give the movie 2 stars. I will have to be very bored to watch it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO BULL?

I say that because I have all of the major ac/dc in concert video releases, and this is the poorest-produced one of the bunch. The instruments have a \\"distant\\" sound, for some reason, unlike Live at Donnington. Sooooooooooooo, since the sales of No Bull originally were poor, they thought they'd release a \\"director's cut\\" of it to entice hard-core sales, but guess what? It STILL sounds the same, only now there is 2 hours of it! If you don't own any ac/dc concert dvds and you perhaps, are a new fan, get Live at Donnington.

Act three takes place in a cheap fleabag hotel room.Modern designers and directors only want to stroke their own egos by destroying the artistic achievements of others. Apparently incapable of understanding the concept of legend or myth, they reduce everything to the tawdry modernism, but they cannot even do this as well as true artists and thinkers such as Samuel Beckett have done it.

The direction is really obscure, and it does nothing to highlight the emotion of the drama or the subtleties of the plot. The staging is also unatmospheric and confusing.Meier is a good but slightly under-powered Isolde. West's Tristan is not on the same level, his singing often off-pitch and ugly. Lipvosek is miscast as Brangaene. The other roles are merely adequately taken. The orchestral playing is rather lifeless, too.A rather disappointing production."},{"rating":"2","title":"MEIER'S BEST ISOLDE ON DVD","review":"Waltraud Meier is currently my favorite Isolde, and Marjana Lipovsek my favorite Brangane. For me, those are the two stellar performances of the production. Meier sings the finale (the \\"liebestod\\") like somebody dissolving in oceanic transcendence. Unfortunately, Jon Fredric West is not my ideal Tristan. But the biggest problem with the production is the clownish staging and costumes, which do everything possible to undermine Meier's FANTASTIC performance. Meir is simply a legendary Isolde. In my opinion, she's even better here than in her two Barenboim performances currently on DVD.

Watching this I realized how much the middle movement relies on the clarinet soloist, the whole orchestra pivots off this instrument."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like being at the club","review":"This album (is that word still usable?) is a recording of a nightclub tribute to the music of William Finn, one of our best current composers of musicals. The songs are excellent and the singers fantastic. You don't get the polished sound of a studio recording but instead the feeling that you are there listening to an all star cast sing some wonderful songs. You also get some of the banter between Finn and the singers as he introduces them. Finn sings a few tunes, and while you wouldn't cast him for a real show, his sense of humor makes his performaces in a few mostly comic tunes a delight as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent recording!","review":"What a wonderful cd of Bill Finn's live concert! The voices are incredible, and not only that, but we get a smattering of Finn's best work (if only he included \\"I Feel So Much Spring\\" from his A NEW BRAIN). The standouts on this CD include Mary Testa on \\"Set Those Sails\\" and Carolee Carmello in \\"When the Earth Stopped Turning.\\" Stephen DeRosa's interpretation of the East Milford Community Center's production of FALSETTOS is nothing short of hilarious! Definite must buy for anyone that loves Finn's work or modern musical theatre!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!!","review":"This cd is a great intro for anyone to William Finn's music. I was a little hesitating in purchasing this cd, but I can honestly say I'm glad I did. This has not left my cd player since I got it. Standout performances from Wanda Houston - The Music Still Plays On, Liz Callaway- Sailing and Infinate Joy, Mary Testa and Carolee Carmello and a hillarious version of The Baseball Game makes you wish that you could have been there to see these amazing performances to this wonderful music."},{"rating":"2","title":"FINN's newest finn.......Joes' pub","review":"absolutely brilliant..and a great idea...we get to hear the voice of Bill....behind the songs...we have his actors performing his numbers...there are old songs..new songs...and all great songs...this album is a treasure...feel lucky if you have a copy...I have two copies..real lucky!"},{"rating":"1","title":"(Not so) Infitine Joy to fans's of William Finn","review":"When I first saw this recording I was SO excited....afterall I saw March of the Falsetto's off Broadway and then Falsettos on Broadway and it changed my life. My biggest beef with the recording of Infinite Joy is it sounds like everyone who was there for that evening at Joe's Pub had a grand ol time but it doesn't translate well for the listener at home. Two of my favorite all time Finn songs are also omitted, What Would I Do & What More Can I Say...I would have loved to have heard another rendition of these songs. Maybe one day we can get this incredibly talented ensemble to record FALETTOLAND in concert. I hope I'm not being too tough, I just expected more JOY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ukelele-playing Israelis Beware!","review":"As ever, Mr. Finn rhymes, for example, ukeleles and Israeli, a forced and excrutiating example of his unremittingly poor lyrics. His music, because it displays so little training and discipline, has a quality of wildness about it, which many people mistake for originality. In truth, it's clunky and awful. Mr. Finn writes with sincerity, directly from the heart, for which he should be applauded, given the state of theater songs. However, sincerity and emotional directness alone aren't enough. It seems as if--going all the way back to Falsettos--he bangs out a number in a day or so, then doesn't revise; certainly his music is anything but thought out. His lyrics have always seemed as if he'll shamelessly combine any words, even if they don't really come close to rhyming, or make any sense. Two stars for sincerity; none for beauty or skill. And by the way, I hadn't heard--HAS he taken up residence in Israel?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks white in photo but is really medium GRAY","review":"The photo of the item makes it look white but the actual item is a medium-dark gray.

I just produced it with my high school kids, and everyone loved it - cast, crew, audience. Really successful. We almost didn't do the show, however, because this recording is so appalling. Julie Andrews shines in her first Broadway show, but it's almost like they picked everyone else to be really bad so that she would look really good. The men are decent, but the women just make you cringe. If you're looking for a cute little show for community theatre and high school, this is it -- but don't buy the CD!Incidentally, Julie Andrews is producing a revival of this show for Broadway for the 2004 season.

These are my definitive versions of the 9th and 5th, with the 9th being particularly sublime. Every single movement he (and the singers) just nail. Perfect sound quality, wonderful recording. You can often find the individuals symphonies on single CDs, but it's nice to have them all together. The included Overtures (Egmont and Fidelio) are just OK, not my favorites by a long shot, but decent enough for a free-be. If you just need to have the nine symphonies on CD and don't want to spread them out over different conductors / orchestras, you could do a lot worse than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why buy Used when New can be had for same price?","review":"Sheet music plus has this and the music tree teaching books, newest editions, for similar prices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Padded Hangers","review":"These hangers worked so well I ordered a second set.

Along came Nightclub and I was there, forking over my hard earned all too eagerly. Expecting the usual dark brooding 'tinging' (talk/singing) that she does so well, and her unique interpretations of jazz standards I was most disappointed. This album no doubt, is a well executed, beautifully recorded jazz piece that captures that late night ambience she set out to do. It just lacks the dynamism and originality her previous albums have had. Also, because there is a greater emphasis on the singing, which she ain't great at, it just tends to annoyance. I didn't even listen through when usually I'm planted on the couch from start to finish. Her best work in my opinion comes from CDs Companion, Modern Cool and Cafe Blue. These rate 10 stars on a 5 star scale. She can be awesome but this is a 2* effort compared to previous releases.Cheers, Kendrick"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a great artist and great music","review":"Patricia Barber has been around and is still one of the best Jazz singers around.You want to relax and hear some great tunes buy Night Club, you wil love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Lilith Fair Session","review":"Her voice is just too thin and \\"folky\\" to do these songs justice.

The film gets a big boost from the actors who in most cases are way better than the likes of this film, but know how to laugh at themselves and just go with it. It's a short little \\"dumb dumb\\" of a movie only clocking in at about an hour and fifteen minutes, but I found enough here to keep me chuckling for the most part. I also applaud the political incorrectness, because I'm a little tired of filmmakers walking on eggshells all of the time.

In comes singer Steve Overland, probably the best AOR singer ever, definitely in the top 5 of the genre. They had a minor hit with \\"Frozen Heart\\" but for some reason they were unable to break into the mainstream. I believe this is an AOR classic and should not be missed. Also, chek out \\"Tough It Out\\", their second album, I believe it is better but this cd has more punch to it. Start your FM collection with Tough It Out and Indiscreet, you will see that Steve Overland was the best singer of the AOR genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apps?

It was quiet although the motor started making a random rattling noise the last year of use, taking it apart and oiling the motor only helped a little so I think that was the start of its eventual failure.Overall a decent fan if you can get one cheap and want to use it in a smaller room."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what i thought","review":"it is a long listing of all things you can collect from harry potter.

Now, oh heavens. I would have liked to hear 'Little Drummer Boy,' but Avalon's 'Manger Medley: O Come O Come Emmanuel / Away In A Manger / O Little Town Of Behtlehem / Silent Night' definately makes up for that. Besides, Joan Jett does a fine cover of the Drummer Boy....I like the production value of Winter Wonderland. The balance is of professional value, and it's matched by good ears. This is a great album for the kids.I like cheese, this album is cheese, but like really good cheese. It makes sense though, I mean, why do you have brie around Christmas time?

The only downside, and it is because I hate cleaning my turkey frier and get impatient, is that the oil takes a very long time to drain through the funnel.

It makes using the view finder more comfortable. I gave the item only 2 stars because it slips off too easily. Nothing broke, they just came off. I was fortunate to find the missing piece twice, but on my last outing, the rubber piece was lost again. The piece will slip off from the camera body just rubbing against my side when I have the camera strap over my shoulder, or from the camera rubbing against my camera bag when I'm removing it for use. I'm very disappointed that Canon hasn't figured out a more secure attachment method. I will order a third replacement, but this time I'll use a little glue to hold it on.

Even more, its brought right to your home so you can watch it any time! All the classic stars were present at the event so it makes you feel as if you are there. Every act is filled with loads of talent. It seems that the performers are filled with an extra burst of passion becuase they are singing THEIR favorite songs.

That's why I only gave two stars. Mainly for Chita (too bad she was'nt allowed to or couldnt throw her legs in the air, but she's still got ist somehow).FUNNIEST MOMENT: Michael Mc Cormick and Michael Muheren (before this DVD unknown to me) are really very funny in their rendition of the original song \\"BRUSH UP YOUR SHAKESPEARE\\". I had to laugh out loud and actually applauded (sitting in front of my TV-set!) at the end of the song.EMOTIONAL MOMENT; Julie actually kinda sings two lines from \\"THE RAIN IN SPAIN\\". Not that she does it as she did before. But everybody seems so surprised and happy thas she more or less sings. I felt two tears rolling over face. The ovation of the crowd is really understandable.These two moments for me) are two very good reasons to buy this DVD.

I was surprised at first, but I love it more and more. It is a dramatic presentation of the Christmas story- from prophecy to fulfillment. It is wonderful to hear the entire Christmas story through song. I love to listen to it with my children. It has a variety of styles but all of them fit perfectly to move you through the story. Crystal Lewis as Mary and Donna Summer as Elizabeth are incredible. The songs seem to really bring the moment to life. All the other Christmas CDs are empty and shallow compared to this one. Child of the Promise reminds us of the only reason for our hope- the coming of the One who brings peace on earth. That is why we celebrate Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"A babyshower by the father for the son","review":"I really enjoyed this CD...of course, the birth of Christ is a time for rejoicing...but it often seems so stiff and formal.

This seems to bring the laughter and warmth back into the story; that makes it endearing and delightful."},{"rating":"1","title":"An astonishing thesis that disregards the music!","review":"Are we really to believe that the music of this man does not speak for itself? Was it really his \\"political connections\\" and \\"who he knew\\" that led to his success in 19th century Vienna? Are there really other Beethovens running around out there who just haven't gotten a break. A nice parlor exercise perhaps, but really.....how about a serious listen to what he actually wrote down! What I am suggesting is a serious listen. Why, for example, does his work seem to have a much higher density of sheer thought (form if you like) than that of any other composer? Why are his thematic constructs so intellectually exhilarating as well as emotionally moving? Why does he exemplify the most startling development of style of almost anyone you can think of in the arts? What is it about his almost extra-material universal appeal? Listen to the music. Maybe the answers are found there."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Pits!","review":"The reasoning in this book is so full of holes that anyone could drive a fleet of Mack trucks right through it.

This book is amazingly bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"perhaps unintentionally awry","review":"The author states more than once, in one way or another, that she does not mean to detract from Beethoven's greatness as a creator, but the effect is peculiar nonetheless. As the other reviewer of this book exclaimed, listen to the music! The IMPRESSION the author perhaps inadvertently gives, anyway, is that the world as we know it after Beethoven did his work might have been a world instead impressed by the greatness of Pfart, or whoever that circle of Viennese influencers otherwise settled on. Whereas someone totally unaware of Vienna and its doings would still have taken amazed note of Beethoven, then and since. Some folk are not that enamored of B even now, but they certainly know his power."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story, unsatisfactory pacing.","review":"This book started out enjoyable and its' characters were likable, but the story lost its attraction in the last few chapters.Barebones plot:Hero and heroine meet under awkward circumstances and the heroine gives conceals her true identity. But they obviously like each other. Late, they meet again in Town, and the heroine is too scared to reveal her true self.I wish the denouement had occurred 2 or 3 chapters earlier, so that we'd be spared repeated example of Lady Jane hiding herself from Wintringham. The ruse went on for far too long. And then, in the end, the Earl got over the deception so easily that it made me want to throw my kindle against a wall.

This is ridiculous. He should seriously see a psychiatrist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Common Sense","review":"I felt like I wasted my money purchasing this book. In general, it was mostly just common sense for anyone who is really serious about applying to graduate school - ie talk to professors, talk to grad students, research the programs you are interested in. Basically, it said that if you do not have excellent grades, you need to have other areas of strength. Obviously.I did find some parts of the book to be quite humorous. It was published in 1997 and talked about using the internet to research schools as a novelty. It just shows that the internet is in use much more than it was when the book was published.Additionally, the book was too long (and too expensive for its quantity and quality). The information could have been summarized in 20 pages max.I really wish I had not purchased this book, but at least Amazon allowed me to return it and get my money back.If you are looking for a book about applying to graduate school, I suggest looking elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for calming nerves","review":"If you're someone who doesn't have the prescribed 3.25 or above, someone who is just eeking by the minimum requirements for most grad. schools, than this book is a must-have. For me the biggest struggle in applying was coming up with enough courage and drive to just do it without procrastinating or rationalizing that I could continue to wait or that my very average GPA made even applying not worth my time.Sure this book has some common-sense advice but even in this advice there are at least a few tidbits/different perspectives that will have you looking at the whole process anew, feeling prepared and above all else, CONFIDENT. Good luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative. A welcome addition to our Career Library.","review":"The book offers the prospective grad student a straightforward guide to the admissions process.

I was skeptical about hearing a soprano in the role of Carmen. I needn't have been; Price does a wonderful job. Her voice is velvety. Franco Corelli also sounds good in this recording. I am not a Corelli fan; nevertheless, I thought he did an excellent job here--and what high notes! The only small negative is Robert Merrill, but he was, at least, OK. This compilation gives you 74 minutes of music. I bought a used copy for a couple dollars. What a great deal!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A predictable \\"Fatal Attraction\\"","review":"This was a disappointing read and I was happy to see it end.I give it 2 stars, rather than 1, because the author did succeed at creating an element of suspense that kept the story moving along at a nice pace.Other than that, though, the characters were flat, the storyline was predictable, and the ending was a quick descent into mediocrity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so Thrilling","review":"THE INTERVIEW ROOM is supposed to be a psychological thriller, but I didn't find it very thrilling.I found all the characters in this novel to be largely flat and difficult to relate to. In particular, the lead character is more like a philosopher than a real person, constantly over-analyzing one situation after another. He's not very admirable, or even that interesting. His marriage is oddly unpleasant, almost leading the reader to hope for a divorce instead of a reconciliation.The plot of THE INTERVIEW ROOM is pretty sluggish at the beginning, then moves into hyperdrive in the last third, with too many implausible events happening all at once. The ending is pretty standard, the type of violent showdown I've read in hundreds of other books of this nature.I do believe Anscombe is a talented writer. Much of the prose in this book was quite strong. But the shortcomings in both plot and characterization make this a difficult book to recommend.Two stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truth doesn't have to hurt","review":"Although I was brought up Catholic, I could never quite buy intoany organized religious doctrine.

I recommend this book to anyone needing to bring light and love into their lives. Don't we all?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Medium, Not so Great Book","review":"I watched Michelle Whitedove on a TV show about America's top psychics in 2007. She was excellent. She won the competition and I was very happy for her. She is an incredibly talented psychic medium and is full of positive energy. Sadly, she is not as good a writer as she is a psychic, and it appears that she did not make use of a professional editor prior to publishing her book. This is unfortunate, because the grammatical errors weaken her message. However, if you can get past that, the book is full of lots of interesting information and stories. If you like books on psychic mediums, angels, auras,dreams,animal totems, karma and free will, you will find this book to be very interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"A Refreshing Outlook On Spirituality\\"","review":"I have read so many books on Spirituality, and I have to say this by far is one of the best. \\"She talks with Angels\\" gives an \\"easy to understand\\" guide that everyone can learn from.

The first two chapters warm up nicely to that idea. I started off rather encouraged. Unfortunately that appears to be where the author reached the end of his storytelling knowledge because a large portion of the book veers off into leadership styles, branding, group dynamics, etc. He connects it all with the word \\"story,\\" and while I understand how a brand can be, metaphorically, a company's \\"story\\", its really not storytelling. Its a lot of meandering chapters using the word \\"story\\" in ways that aren't particularly insightful and distracting from the main topic. Really I blame the editor or the publisher. Its bad enough that they should have caught it and given him some advice.

Product Pitches, Value Propositions and Logical Arguments do not convince a Buyer in denial to change. In fact, the Buyer needs you to be wrong to protect the status quo and survive.We provide the Salesperson with the right message delivered through mini-stories to help the Buyer discover that the status quo is no longer acceptable. These stories work because they present a scenario that allows Buyers to develop awareness through their own sense of discovery. Buyers trust this discovery because they made it and they begin to trust the Story Seller for telling it. When the Buyer can picture the issues in the real world scenario, it helps them see how the results may apply to them and they start to make sense- they gain insight.

First off, the sound is only dolby 2.0 ... not what I was expecting for a DVD released this recently. Secondly, Ray seems a little out of it ...

This concert just left me ... well ... blah."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical and Marvelous","review":"This may be the concert of a lifetime. A 73 year old artist who is in his \\"prime\\". The riches of Rays' vocal interpretation, as well as his spiritual commitment to each song, makes this a rare offering. Here is an old, seasoned veteran that uses all his tricks without overstatement at any level.The stunning orchestra and beautiful lighting, set an impressive and unforgettable scene.For those who know Ray's life, the songs are an articulation of the high and low moments of his career. \\"This Songs for You\\" is filled with pathos. One senses Ray singing it to his wife. In many ways, this offering is his final testament.For those who know the young Ray, this offering of the older Ray will distance them from that immature and searcing voice, and make them wish for more of the old Ray.

One to play, and one to keep for your grandchildren."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"I've been a Ray Charles fan since my college days, but this was not worth the effort.The concert was given to help the blind, had a huge orchestra to back him up, but he lacked the backup singers he always used. Without them, forget it....like \\"Hit the road Jack\\" wasn't even there. He did some of his famous tunes, notably the one he received most honors for(Georgia on My Mind), including the president of the U.S. but you could hardly hear him. He did one number with Diane Schurr which I thought was terrible.Had he some backup singers like the old days, I would have liked it 90% more, but he didn't.Still, I'm glad to have it, but just as a souvenir. I couldn't even watch more than 3 or 4 tunes. But if you're expecting the old Ray Charles, forget it.

Pinochet's fall from grace via CIA collaborated murders in Washington?To the extent it is truly a documentary, it tended not to emphasize the degree to which Pinochet and his allied officers were schooled in the School of the Americas. Strangely missing much on the involvement or non-involvement of the Church in the takeover by a wealthy military secretive subset of society in a largely catholic country.Re-opens chapters I had forgotten, and aspects I never knew.

Also there are online chats with Rosie, that gives you a clue to how her humour works. I loved the book. But I think you need to be an inquisitive fan of her to do that. You want some questions answered. If that's who you are, buy it. If you only want pictures of her, then this is not the right book.

(The most recent of those, issued on two separate CDs - rather than being packaged as a set - is the better of those two.)

I cannot praise the lens high enough, but that is no reason why Canon should rip us off, asking $40 for a piece of cheap plastic!! Why don't they follow Nikon's example and start shipping their lenses with hoods. After all, good and pricey lenses are for people who are serious about photography, and people who are serious about photography want to have hoods on their lenses!! So Canon, stop being greedy...I give it a rating of 1/5 simply because the quality/price ratio is terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"expensive but a fine product","review":"Yes, the lens hood is pretty expensive for what it is, you have to take in account a few things:1) You'll take better pictures with it than without it, especially in a bright lightbox or sunny day. I've bought hoods for all my lenses now.2) Its about the same price as a good-quality UV filter you would use on your lens to protect it while not degrading image quality (ie: not the $10 tiffen filter Amazon is hawking on this page). I personally use both the hood and a B&W; UV filter.3) The lens is almost $500 as it is. $40 isnt the end of the world, especially when you consider what the next step up for Canon macros costs.4) The lens hood makes the lens look pretty impressive, adding 3-4\\" to the length. Yes, that's just my opinion, but felt I would share it. ;-)Anyway, Genuine Canon products are usually pretty pricy, but given the poor-quality third party knockoffs I've tried (shutter release cables, etc) its worth it to just spend the extra money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expensive, but a Must Have for I.Q.","review":"First of all, I think if you spend this kind of money for the lens, it should some with a lens hood. I guess I'll never understand why Canon is so stingy in this regard.The hood works as described, exterior plastic does scratch easily (like all Canon lens hoods) and, as another reviewer pointed out, you have to remove the lens cap before putting on the lens hood. Also, I wish there were a way to use the hood in conjunction with the MR-14EX ringlight flash, but it's one or the other.When I first got the lens, I tried to do without the hood, but was losing some contrast and getting some interference from other light sources, the hood fixed that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fits snugly","review":"Well made and fits well with the lens.

It is a greatlearning experience and the children love to have theirown books! Taping pictures and having an adult printletters in a composition book works fine, or you can getmore fancy.The main goal of this book is NOT to teach the alphabet.The goal is to teach very young children an appreciationof US heritage.

This bookis a great springboard for discussion, songs, and other books.My children and I appreciate the book very much. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cuddling","review":"The illustrations of AMERICA: A PATRIOTIC PRIMER are quite exceptional. The messages of patriotism and history are especially poignant now, when our country is in such danger.Nonetheless, I liked something else that's best about this book, and that's the experience it triggers. Sitting with a child on your side, or better on your lap, reading this book produces a unique kind of closeness.Together, you're identifying the illustrations. Together, you're reading the words. Together, you're learning American history. And, if you're lucky, together, you're experiencing how wonderful it is to be an American.So I guess I'd recommend the book to those who want to: a) get closer to their child and b) have that child learn why being an American is such a joy.If you aren't interested in these two, get another book.If you are, though, AMERICA's for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"outrageously selective,factually inaccurate propaganda","review":"As other reviewers have pointed out this is an outrageous and blatant attempt to rewrite history for young people in the USA.Native Americans? Central America? Nuclear tests in the Pacific...proud moments they may not be but our kids should be told the good and the bad.McCarthyism would have been a good thing to think about including- particularly since the second lady is apparently keen on her own brand of black listing.One of the indicators of any repressive regime is the extent of their attempts to eradicate any traces of opposition. Part of that takes the form of rewriting history. Stalin and Hitler did it. Now the Bush regime takes its turn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn. Yawn.

Deliberate use of smallpox to infect Native Americans ring any bells?Not only is Cheney selective she is also a dreadful writer- her prose style has all the attraction of wading through raw sewage.

The Emancipation Proclamation did not free any slave anywhere. Lincoln had no authority in the Confederacy and he had no authority as President to free any slave.

My niece said the book was \\"too busy.\\" I agree with my niece as there was too much confusion. When we got to the letter N and my niece thought it would be for Nation. When I told her it was for Native Americans she said to me \\"we were mean to them.\\" I did not expect that.

She loves playing with water. We also bought her a Aquaplay water toy too. Although the Swedish made Aquaplay canel set is better quality over all, it was twice the price (on clearance at TJ Max). We love this water set b/c it is MADE IN THE USA! The quality is still good enough for as young as a toddler. My little one has been playing with it for 2 weeks now and hasn't managed to break it yet. It did come with a lot of little pieces to put together, but it only took about 10 minutes or less to put together. We paid just under $15 for the toy - GREAT PRICE! I don't think I would pay more the $20 for it though.Overall a great toy for the price and a bonus for supporting Made in America products.(side note: although I didn't purchase the Aquaplay set on Amazon, it is a great toy. Especially that you can expand it. We got one of the smaller sets and my little one has fun with both water sets)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of fun","review":"My almost 4 year old son has a blast with this toy. He loves to play with water, so this was ideal for him.The play set is a nice size and fits perfectly on our play table in the living room. I just put some plastic under it as some water splashes out. The toy overall feels sturdy; it's made of thick plastic and it's easy to empty the water out when you're done. Ours came in blue, with orange and green parts.The set up was easy and fast. We used scissors to snip the parts from the frame and used the photo on the box to put the pieces where they belong. The main tub comes as one piece, so water can't leak. Be aware that once you apply the stickers, they are impossible to peel off and replace, so I did them myself.We are very happy with it and I highly recommend this toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont bother","review":"I paid $9.00 for this at toys r us.You get what you pay for.SO many tiny pieces. It's one of those toys where you have to snap every tiny peice from a big plastic sheet. It leaves some sharp plastic edges on some of the pieces. It would be a better investment to pay 10-20$ more for a different one. I do not reccomend this to anyone looking for a decent water and sand toy for their little one.

This gives the wrong answer, 0.3846.In the same chapter under the section \\"Order of Operations,\\" it incorrectly states that multiplication takes precedence over division and addition takes precedence over subtraction.By the way, the correct answer is 37.5 and multiplication and division have equal precedence, as do addition and subtraction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barron's How To Prepare for The Nursing School Entrance Exam","review":"Overall I did not care for this book.

I must be missing something. Maybe \\"Pronto\\" is one of Leonard's lesser efforts, and it would probably behoove me to try him again, since I thought the novel was slow, unoriginal, and rather dull. Leonard occasionally comes up with some snappy things for his characters to say, but the characters themselves didn't warrant my attention, and the story they were involved seemed pointless.

Instead, this film showcases a male rock band, trying to hit the big time in the music biz, during the late-60s. The band goes through quite a bit, as they struggle to become well-known pop stars. They have to contend with a ruthless, greedy manager, internal squabbles amongst the band members, living on a meager income, their own drug abuse etc., etc.Though this movie is not the most exciting rock film in the world, it's entertaining in a hokey sort of way. The band plays some pretty decent garage/psychedelic rock, and they give-off an energetic vibe. There are many scenes in this film, that show the band frolicking merrily outdoors. In this way, the movie is similar to an episode of the Monkees. For those who are nostalgic about the late-60s rock scene, this movie will suffice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Errors on study cards","review":"Hello, fellow suffering students preparing for the GRE.

This means that serious gamers who invest the time to master moves are simply not rewarded for perfection in timing and skillful execution. Secondly, the balance of defense and offense is off. A person could go wild on offense and the veteran who tries to defend will have a tough time countering and reversing.

I played the game and found that \\"turtling up\\" and waiting for the right time to attack or throw is all that it takes to succeed and it even works on the higher dificulty settings.My major gripe about the game is the dark and demonic story lines. No God fearing person should touch this \\"demon sword wielding\\" game (I began to discover the different plots after I played it). I'm not trying to sound like a fanatic but come on why all the demon intense plots in a generally evil game.

The backgrounds are so detailed that it seems real (and I mean the REAL THING)! If you aren't a fighting gamer then you'll still love it! The mission battle mode will change your perspective on fighting games. It really raised my standard of a fighting game. The only thing I though that was stupid was the endings.

This 1973 recording of the Rachmaninov Sym. #2 is a bit unfair to him; near the end of his life Ormandy's concentration and rhythm became feebler. There's no snap or bite to the rhythms here; it's all a smooth silky flow.That suits the Philadelphia Sound, which isn't overly lush here but agreeably flexible. If you don't want Rachmaninov to sound lush but not too melancholy, here's the recording for you. Even as a non-fan, there were moments of such gorgeous sonority from the orchestra that I sat up with admiration. It makes me wonder if Ormandy has an earlier Rachmaninov Second still available on Sony from a time when he was stronger. He certainly shows his love of the music on this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great songs","review":"I grew up with country music.

It took me awhile to actually decide to buy it. I kept listening to the samples and thinking it was nothing new and nothing that I didn't already have on other CDs by Suzanne Ciani. The only track that really popped out at me as being something different was \\"The Velocity of Love\\", which is arranged in a manner that kind of makes me feel like it could be part of a Disney soundtrack--particularly, something like Aladdin! But I LOVE IT! So, eventually, I broke down and just bought it--most especially for that one track! Well, true--it's nothing new. True, we--as Ciani fans--have heard these pieces before. But as another reviewer said, \\"Nothing New Can Be Good Too\\". Consider it a \\"best of\\" collection if you must, but with new arrangements that add just enough to make them feel fresh and current. I think that's what I like most about this CD...the arrangements feel updated and current. It just works!

This can help you understand some of the more complex topics.The reason I gave the book four stars is because the topic of pipelining as introduced in the book is confusing and may require most readers to go back over the topic several times before it clicks.I also think that having a course in digital fundamentals prior to taking a course that requires this book would help, too. It used to be that colleges would require undergrad computer science students to take a digital fundamentals course (or equivalent) before taking and organization class. It seems now that many schools have dropped the digital requirement and have students take one computer organization class.

Concepts are not put forth in an orderly and understandable manner.You'll need other companion books to support the contents of this book.Your only hope of getting anything out of this course and book is if you have a good instructor.

Explanations are top-down but eventually rest on lower level facts unkown to the student or unmentioned by the authors. (e.g. 'explaing' PC-relative addressing with a 1 sentence explanation of what the PC is). The effect is heightened by the frequent uses of straw-men and half-truths which must later be emended, further confusing the student. Having written assembly and then taught assembly and assemblers for 20 years, I can read paragraphs and even pages before discovering what the authors mean to say. It can take half an hour to discover that something in a summarizing list or table has not yet been explained.

The book could be commended for being very comprehensive and thorough, but don't expect to speed-read through this one. The author for some reason decided that it would be a good idea to teach you the concepts presented in the book backwards, tell you \\"oops, just kidding\\", then explain how you really do it. This can lead to hours of confusion and frustration, trust me. Also, my instructor (thank god for him), often times told the class to skip over relatively large sections of the book on a normal basis, because true to form, it tends to be entirely thorough with information that is not entirely pertinent. Often times even when very clear about what was presented in the chapter, you'll find yourself confused after reading 15 pages, in which a simple idea was presented.

The SM58S falls into this category for me. The microphone is built strong, works well and the best endorsement is that no one comments on the sound being anything good or bad. In other words the Mic doesn't distract or diminish the performance. It is what people expect the sound to be. As always Amazon fulfilled the order quickly and correctly."},{"rating":"2","title":"In love with my first cardioid Dynamic Microphone","review":"I agonized over whether to buy a dynamic mic or a condenser mic for my first \\"serious\\" home recording studio purchase that had a USB connection.

Reading lots of reviews of everything on Amazon was a bit overwhelming, but ultimately decided on the Shure SM58 because overall the ratings are quite good.LIKESIn love with my first cardioid Dynamic Microphone and my vocal recordings so very professional.DISLIKESNone really.

It captures live sound from interviewees and rock star singers in a crisp and clear manner without costing too much money. It's got a solid design, omnidirectional capture, and good pickup from a distance. Every broadcast news reporter and singer should be using this microphone for live-action sound. I wouldn't use it in the studio for recording or voice-overs unless you have to. You will be satisfied with this microphone--it's a Shure thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hissssssssssss","review":"I know singers rave about the Shure SM 58 but this product really blows.

Also, the gain dial of my device looked defective and if I dialed it down just a little bit I would lose an incredible amount of feedback.Maybe this is just not a good product to use on Windows (I have Vista 64-bit), or maybe this device was just defective, but whatever the case I am extremely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD, BAD, BAD","review":"It arrived broken and we are yet to recieve our money back:( This company has not gotten back with us.

In a live setting, the SM58 generally resists feedback and produces an honest reproduction of lead and backup vocals.On a side note, this microphone is basically the one you need (or the BETA 58) for beatboxing. The SM58 gives you those nice kickdrum B pops and that cool \\"coming-out-of-your-stereo\\" lip snare. The inward K handclap comes out well too. If you are doing hi-hats, use lots of air, as these sounds are softer compared to the kickdrum and lip snare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as.......","review":"I have had the first Hampton Xmas cd for some years (What if Mozart Wrote \\"I'm Dreaming of a White Christmas\\") and I and my family enjoy it immensely every year.

Well, it is too boring, predictable, and unspectacular to be a disaster. At least a disaster would have some entertainment value. This has neither musical nor entertainment value.If they have any talent, it does not show here.If they have any respect for Mozart, it does not show here. The arrangements are not even worthy of Mozart as a child. Mozart was a genius, and these arrangements were done by a hack. They all sound the same, and are horribly trite and repetitive.I guess this was an attempt at humor, but just comes across as an incredibly low quality performance.The lackluster performance is well suited to the arrangements. Even the miking and recording makes it sound one-dimensional.If you buy it, keep it with your Andrea Bocelli, Charlotte Church, Sting and Il Divo Christmas albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST FOR VEGETARIANS","review":"This book is fabulous! Cresent is wonderfully creative with her dishes. This book is great for the vegetarian who is tired of the same food all the time, and perhaps, misses those memorable meat dishes. Her recipes are creative, innovative and just plain wonderful. Her stories before each recipe helps the reader envision the dish, and what it is best suited for.I have never been disappointed with a recipe. While I may not find each one to my taste, that doesn't mean they aren't good. My family loves all the soup recipes. They are hard to beat.

I think her philosophies are wonderful and inspirational. I also love that the book is not simply recipes, but also lots of cute anecdotes and stories. And, while I think this book has a lot of potential, I must say that in 8 months of owning it I have only made 3-4 of the recipes it features. Many of the ingredients it calls for are either extremely difficult to find (and I live in New York City!!) or very expensive (I am a poor student). I mean, where do I find Umeboshi plum vinegar or mung beans, or fenugreek seeds and do I really want to buy them for one recipe?? Additionally, most of the recipes require you to refer to another recipe to use as the base, topping, crust, sauce etc... Making a dish from this book requires an enormous amount of effort and commitment, neither of which I have. For a much simpler- yet just as tasty alternative try the Moosewood Restaurant books."},{"rating":"2","title":"just wonderful","review":"If I had to pick just one cookbook out of my collection and toss the rest, it would be this one.

Each one has been fantastic. And this book is huge, so there is so much to explore here! You could cook for years using this book alone and dine very well indeed. I've served the recipes to my omnivore friends and they have liked them too.The author does a good job of explaining the recipes and drawing attention to ways to save time, suggest alternatives, and ways to use the recipe in other ways.The author is personable and writes quite a bit--some have said she is \\"wordy\\". However, cooking well is more than following a set of ingredients and instructions. I personally find her narratives before each section and recipe entertaining and informative.

The video quality I would have to rank a bit sub-par but are watchable, the reason I ranked it as only four stars vs five. I think the actors all do a very good job and the scenery is beautiful.

I watch all these videos with my Bible open to the appropriate text, which is why I would highly recommend \\"Joseph\\", but \\"David\\"'s writers take way too many liberties with scripture, and in the end, it simply is the Hollywood version of David, and not true to scripture at all.

It was disappointing to see the producers would lower themselves to worldly ways to make a point that would have been just as powerful without showing such filth. It was wrong.

It is very light, simple and has a nice stable base with low center of gravity. Only drawback is it is not adjustable - only one position.

It looks pretty good and it is quiet. What sucks is the knob on the front. I have to hold the thing from the back with one hand while i turn the speed dial because it's too light. I kind of turn if i don't have to hold it from the back, but usually it just slides out of position on my desk. So, producers, put the controls on the back as pushdown buttons, or put some rubber grips on the bottom. Also, and this is the only reason I give it 4 out of 5 stars, there is only Low and High speeds. Low is way to fast and is not comfortable on a desk because the aire just dries out your eyes. I have to turn the fan in another direction where I only get a small amount of wind. Luckily there is a wall behind me, otherwise my peers would certainly complain of wind. And this is on the Low speed.Still, cheap, quiet, nice looking, small, but doesn't rotate, so gets 4/5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much of an air mover.","review":"I purchased the Honeywell to replace this fan.

The Honeywell, on the other hand, can be pointed straight up for use as an air circulator. Go with the Honeywell."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW, delivery driver SUCKS","review":"DID NOT get my item on time because (if you can believe THIS) the delivery driver didn't know how to enter the gate code EVEN THOUGH THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE ABOVE THE INTERCOM.if I could, NO STARS"},{"rating":"2","title":"SMALL BUT POWERFUL!","review":"If you need a small fan for a small space, this is the perfect choice. I needed a small fan for my kitchen counter which is not very big so the fan had to be compact and still provide a good breeze. This Duracraft fan fit the bill perfectly. It took up very little counter space and so far I have only used the low speed setting. It blows a strong, cool breeze on the low speed. The high speed is great if the fan is going to sit a bit further from you, but I have it close to me on the counter so I don't want it blowing too strongly on me. I'm very happy with this little fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got some good power","review":"I bought this fan for my desk at work and I was surprised at the blowing power.

The fascists."},{"rating":"2","title":"This little fan is great!","review":"I purchased this for my desk, and I've been pleasantly surprised by it. It's just the right size. This is the first fan of this size I've bought, so I can't really compare to another similar one, but I think the airflow is pretty good.The actual fan doesn't really look like it does in the picture though. The finish is more of a flat gray. No biggie, just FYI."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap and poorly designed.","review":"I bought this fan for my desk at work. It moves air just fine, but it's very cheaply made. There must have been a part loose in the fan because the second I turned it on, it started making a rattling noise--nothing too loud, but just loud enough to be irritating. The placement of the control knob (on the front) is also poorly thought out. Because the fan isn't very heavy, I kept knocking the fan off the table when trying to turn it on.Returned for a refund. I'll probably just buy a cheap old fan from Walgreens instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"These Fans are the Best!","review":"It's a shame that this fan isn't available on Amazon at the moment. I've had this fan since I was a kid back around 1998 and used it almost every night since then. The noise and airflow is soothing and helps me sleep. Sadly, after dropping it multiple times off a loft in the college dorms, it began to develop several cracks that cause the plastic to vibrate and make annoying rattling noises. However, it STILL works perfectly to this day. I'm really hoping to buy a new one at some point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Item pictured is not an eye cream","review":"This item pictured is not an eye cream.

I think it was intended as a showcase of the artists on the Narada label. There are some forgettable tracks, but about about 5-10 great songs on these CDs. All the songs use guitars in different music styles like jazz, folk, experimental, latin, etc. It might even be a bit of a weakness from a commercial perspective that the set covers so many styles of guitar. The one commonality is guitar instrumental, though. Some folks will like some tracks, but not others. My favorite songs are on CD2. Probably the best thing you can do is go the MP3 route, and download the ones that sound good when you sample online. I like the artists Randy Roos and Billy McLaughlin. Other people will like others. After you listen to some of these, you can also buy the individual artists' CDs separately. This is what I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy Hood","review":"Lousy hood. It is difficult to insert and remove. It does not stay on well.

Canon specs the discontinued ES-65 hood for this lens. The great thing about this ET-65III is that it is longer, so it blocks more stray light without vignetting on full-frame or 1/6-frame slrs. The interior on this mark III version is also flocked, providing a bit more light absorption.I've used those collapsible rubber hoods before while in college, but this hood is definitely worth the investment: well built, fits backward on the lens for storage (but too long while the lens is on the camera), and provides good protection for the front of the lens (it's quite deep).Note that this will NOT fit the newer 50mm f/1.8 Mark II version (all plastic mount with no distance scale)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly overpriced.","review":"This part is over priced for its ability to actually remain mounted on a lense. Tends to slip off or sideways. Should cost about $5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't really lock into place","review":"First, I have always thought the 85mm lens should come with a hood. But, alas, it didn't, so I had to buy it. My first impression was good. It's a good fit, and as good a build as any of the other Canon hoods (though I think Canon could learn a lot about caps and hoods from Nikon). I also like that it incorporates the pinches on the sides to make sure it stays on. The real problem is that it doesn't lock into place like every other hood I've ever used. It doesn't really affect the quality or anything, but it just bothers me that I can't just lock it into place and be done with it. It just spins around.But, it's a heck of a lot more convenient than Nikon's 85mm f/1.8 hood which just screws into the filter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I expected","review":"This hood is easy for me to use. With the hood attached on my 85/1.8 lens, I can easily get on or off the lens cap. It's not that bad as someone put on their negative comments. I am a woman and my finger size is normal. It might be a different experience for someone with quite big hands."},{"rating":"2","title":"XTi Lenses","review":"I just tried this out on my 35mm EF 2.0 and it works fine with no vignetting, because of the aps-c sensor size difference. I got this hood for my 50mm because with the size difference thats what it would be rated to. Clearly they make them a little wider than they have to, because it works great on a 35mm with the XTi body and smaller sensor size. Comically large, but effective. I really like the results it produces. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that you have to keep it clean, the velvet anti-reflective coating on the inside tends to collect lint and debris easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"ET65III Hood Review","review":"Con's:Flimsy attachment mechanism requires a thumb and forefinger to press latch on both sides to remove and attach.

I am never worried that this will fall of the lens or if I hold the lens by the hood it will fall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I expected","review":"After reading reviews on the Canon lens hood I wasn't sure if this purchase was worth my time or money. I ended up buying it anyway and am very pleased with what I got in return. The shipment was very fast first of all. I got this the day after it was ordered. I had read that some people have trouble putting on the lens hood, but I have not encountered this. It has been very easy to put on and remove.

The choreography and costumes were outstanding. I found the minor updates to the original charming and not detracting at all.

Products like this should not be put on the market. As this was my introduction to THE GONDOLIERS (a bad mistake, I found out later, as the majority of the songs had been re-written), so it was quite irritating when I had NO IDEA what was being said, due to an operatic chorus that over vocalises and throws away the consenants, and the fact the the whole thing sounds like it was recorded in a tin can.From getting to know the show later, this visually seems to be a good production, everyone looks their part (particularly the two *extremely* dashing gondolieri), and I have no quibbles with a man doing the Duchess of Plaza-Torro--BUT I STILL HAVEN'T WATCHED THIS ALL THE WAY TRHOUGH BECAUSE OF THE AWFUL, AWFUL SOUND!AVOID AT ALL COSTS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kentucky Fried Chicken?????","review":"Okay, so I'm a purist -- within reason. I don't care a fig when directors want to update the production by locating it in 21st century China or precolumbian Mexico instead of Venice. But I care a great deal when W. S. Gilbert's clever and delightful words are thrown away and substituted with ridiculous new lyrics mentioning, of all things, disco and Kentucky Fried Chicken. This might have been a fun antic for a cast party but it makes this production excruciating to watch. Ugh.

Execute your plan.\\" (Gee, makes me feel like I'm in Mission Impossible.)Impractical: \\"Take a shower outside with your love. Make sure to have plenty of towels and buckets of warm water.\\" (In my neighborhood, this would probably be followed by dinner in jail after being arrested for indecent exposure.)I must admit, however, that my wife and I enjoyed a very fun couple of hours laughing at the book's suggestions before I returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid!","review":"This was a horrid book! I couldn't do any of the ideas it offered, except the petty ones (as in the example above, 'sneak your own snacks into the theater').

Christian music","review":"If there was a standard for Christian music, Switchfoot in my opinion would be it. They don't attempt to copy any other group or conform to a stereotype, they just make great music. I love 'New way to be human', but this is by far and away the best. Funky, fast-moving and faith-energising tunes make this album one of the best of the year.Keep it up lads !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Collection","review":"Learning to Breathe is a very enjoyable album. It contains some very interesting and good music along with good vocals and positive lyrics.The words in this CD are definitely focused on the Creator of the Universe. Here are some examples of lyrics:Learning to Breathe - I'm finding that You and You alone can break my fall.You Already Take Me There - You meet me where I am, forgive me where I am.Love Is The Moment - Why God gave His life to put motion inside my soul. It's bigger than cold religion. It's bigger than life.There are really no bad songs in this collection. Two that are real standouts are Dare You To Move and Learning To Breathe.If you like Christian music, this is a good album to get. If you like Switchfoot, it is a must have. If you are not in either of the above categories, I'd recommend it anyway. It is a very creative effort and you will likely enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"As a matter of fact, make it 11 stars!","review":"I LOVE this CD!!

The members in the band have great talent. I find all of the songs well done and uplifting. Whether you've gotten the other two albums and are wondering about this one, or have just heard of Switchfoot, this is a good one to get. In my opinion, it is their current best album. And to all of you Switchfoot fans out there, a new album is comin' out Jan. 21, 2003. The album is called \\"The Beautiful Letdown.\\" If this one is as good or better than Learning To Breathe or New Way To Be Human, you can expect great things from it. Anyway, I highly recommend this album! also look at New Way To Be Human!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The legend of Switchfoot","review":"Switchfoot never disappoints - in fact they always amaze. The new album is no exception. For a college student who likes intelligent art, both musically and lyrically, there's no better find than Switchfoot. \\"Learning To Breathe\\" dives right in, tackling the tougher issues of life, and like the opening song declares: they \\"dare you to move.\\" They dare you to live life like it's the only one you've got, \\"like today never happened before.\\" Music fans need to have this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to breath","review":"Switchfoot is one of those bands that give christian rock pop music a good name. For the last few years they have lead the way in simple melodies and a raving taste of raw rock. They have always seemed to take their music some place the listener was never expecting and they always seemed capable of creating a great product. Although learning to breath has fell off the chart. This album seems consumed by the over played production of current contemporary christian music. The album does seemed over produced and almost to the point where the producers were afraid of using something called, Distortion. The album never reaches a peak and never creates the sensation of good rock. This album may have had more potential if the simplicity of previous albums were here. Learning to breath in my opinion sounds much like every other contemporary christian artist without any unique twist."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delight to listen to","review":"I recentally got learning how to breath and i am loving every song of it. it is a different feel from the other albums but still a pleasure to hear. i had the oppertunity to see Switchfoot at rock the universe andgot my picture taken with them and their autographs, so this really made my day to hear their new stuff. This one gets more into the 'i know this is relgious music' lyrics unlike some songs on the other albums but i like it that way. a definate addtion to your switchfoot or CCM collection"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best album I own.","review":"No contest. Every track here is worth the cash by itself, from the hauntingly beautiful rock of \\"Love Is A Movement\\" to the tour-de-force of punkish vibe that is \\"The Loser\\" to the building, sweeping epic that is \\"Living is Simple.\\" From the ticking clocks that start off the album to the last chord, this is an upbeat rock classic that dabbles in the genres of punk and pop, but it's always rock, always driven by Jon Foreman's amazing vocals, and always awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learning to Breathe","review":"I bought this cd because I saw the music video for \\"You Already Take Me There\\" and I liked the song. Over all this is a good cd, but you might have to listen to it a couple times before you start to like the songs. I think the best songs on this cd are: \\"Dare You To Move\\", \\"You Already Take Me There\\", \\"Erosion\\", and \\"Living Is Simple.\\" If you like Switchfoot's other albums, then you'll defenitly like this one.

Their website is www.switchfoot.com so you can read more about them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learning to Breathe... is awesome!","review":"This CD rules, it's definitely different than Legend of Chin and New Way to be Human, but in a spiffy way. Fans of Switchfoot will not be disappointed! I almost expected not to like it, just because I figured it would be 'different'. But I was blown away. Switchfoot comes back in full force with realistic sing-along-able lyrics, great tunes, and very creative musical feats -- they have turned many 'normal' instrument sounds into catchy little sounds that don't detract from the music at all! My favorite songs are the title track, Poparrazi, Innocence Again, Playing for Keeps, and Erosion. And don't forget to pop the CD into your computer, it includes the *sweet* music videos (in almost-DVD quality) for New Way to be Human and Chem6A.

You'll never find your place. (My book club agrees.) If the stories were related in some way, it would be justified, even intriquing, but one has to really stretch to find a relationship.

If that isn't all bad enough, the murderer felt that God helped them comes up with the lies about the murders. The author goes back and forth in time, but when she is in the present time she writes facts about the murder trial in present time.

Anita Shreve is a marvelous writer. A first rate story teller, she draws you into her books. But the Pilot's Wife, though well written, was melodramatic and depressing--much to much so for me. The Weight of Water, although it deals with heavy issues like death and adultery, had me completely immersed. Her train-of-thought method of relating past and present events kept my interest until the very last word. Here is a book I found hard to put down.So if The Pilot's Wife wasn't your cup of tea, give Ms. Shreve another chance with The Weight of Water!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Enjoy this One","review":"I like Anita Shreve's writing as a general matter, but I found THE WEIGHT OF WATER to be disappointing. In particular, all the modern-day characters were unlikable and thinly drawn, which made it difficult to emphasize with any of their problems. The flashbacks to the historical period were awkward, and I found the ending of this book quite jarring and pointless. The pacing of the book is plodding and lacks any true suspense.Overall, I found this to be a depressing, unsatisfying read. For those interested in trying Shreve, I recommend trying THE PILOT'S WIFE instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing Ending - a very emotional story","review":"Thos book has so much going on in it; I love the way Shreve switches back between Maren's letters and what is going on in the narrator's life. The historical parts of this story (the murders, the trial, the evidence) make it a great read for anyone who enjoys crime/mystery.The ending shocked me - and while I dont want to ruin it for anyone - I must say I was not expecting it to end that way for Jean. Maren, well, I guessed at that somewhere in the middle.Anita Shreve is becoming one of my \\"it\\" authors - I hope she continues to provide such excellent novels as \\"The Weight of Water\\" and \\"The Pilot's Wife\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Other work of author better received","review":"I really had a hard time with Weight of Water. Very choppy and hard to follow..had to re-read parts of previous chapters to find out where I had left off and where the story was going. However, the story was interesting. I read it for a book club and I really like Anita Shreve's other book, The Pilot's Wife. Try this one and you will see where her technical skill developed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Billie's a cipher","review":"Too many cold-detached characters; we don't even care about the child. No emotional depth in the characters. Even the author seems cold and detached. Too much energy spent on descriptions that go nowhere. The plot is held down by the weight of water and contrivance. Yawn, yawn. The end, thank heavens. (A book club.) We gave it 2 (not one) star because most of us read it to the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely torn about how to rate this.","review":"The ending of the book was so horribly sad that it came close to ruining the whole book for me. That is what I should stress - if sad (kind of pointless too) endings are not your thing - you won't like it. But this is a tragedy and if you know that going into it you'll be fine. I did love the evocative way the book was written. I really felt I was there. I felt the claustrophia, the depression, the hopelessness, the suspicion,,etc. I liked the abrupt switching back and forth between time periods. I thought it was really well done. It was slow going at first, but it was worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable and Beautifully Written","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The plot and ending were a bit disturbing, but it was an interesting read and I couldn't put it down. I have not previously read Anita Shreve, but I will read her again. She writes beautifully. I found it interesting the way she switched between past and present to keep two stories going.I couldn't wait to find out what happened in the end, which was unexpected. In my opinion an unexpected ending is a good quality in a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Weightiness of Anita Shreve.........","review":"The Weight of Water is written in a very detached way.... there is no depth of feeling. It is impassionate, hazy. Shreve worries too much about what she thinks is the beauty of her language, and not enough about character development (there is none) and plot (thin, predictable, uninteresting.) The language should be the strength then, but it's overwrought and pretentious. Written annoyingly in present tense, Shreve lets her protagonist wander around in some kind of detached, poetic stupor. The off-in-space look on Shreve's face on the picture printed on the back of the novel is appropriate. The Smutty Nose murders are a great topic for a novel, and I even approve of the direction Shreve takes this. However, she feels the need to attach a dumb modern co-plot, and ruins the whole thing anyway with her so-so very lovely prose. Avoid this book at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"a dissapointment","review":"I wanted to read Anita again because I loved her book \\"The Pilot's Wife\\". This book had some interesting characteristics but it took forever for me to get me hooked, unlike her other book. Once I read to the middle of the book I figured I better finish it, the end was weird, didn't make any sense. And as a mother, the loss of her child didn't seem real, she wasn't affected as I thought she would. It was an ok read, but it didn't compare at all to her \\"The Pilot's Wife\\". Her sentence structure I found to be really confusing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting tale","review":"Heard the taped version of THE WEIGHT OF WATER by AnitaShreve . . . this is a haunting tale about a photographer who comesto a small island off the coast of New Hampshire to shoot anessay about a famous crime that took place more than a centuryago . . . Shreve, rapidly becoming one of my favorite authors,manages to adroitly capture the lonely lives of the victims--and thenrelates them to what is being felt by the photographer (whosemarriage is falling apart) . . . the ending, while very sad, isnonetheless quite effective . . . Frances Cassidy's narrationwas quite good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down!","review":"Engrossing! From the minute I picked this book up I couldn't put it down. It was enmeshed in the lives and the times. It certainly wasn't a \\"light\\" read - but, I found it to be fulfilling."},{"rating":"2","title":"SURPRISES GALORE","review":"When I began this book , I was slightly put off by the rapid switching of present to past. However, once I got the flow, I was powerless to put this compelling book down. I read it straight through in a day, and was shocked by the final outcome. Everytime I thought I had it figured out, I didn't. I love when I can't unearth the mystery in the early stages, and even more so when I am literally reading the last page in shock with my mouth agape.Anita Shreve writes very well.....her use of similies, dialogue and character developement is unique and that's a plus. Her command of language sends one to the dictionary, and that too is a sign of brilliance. In honesty, I didn't care for \\"The Pilot's Wife,\\" but I feel Shreve's redeems herself in this page turning book. A MUST READ!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"I have three gripes with this book: 1) Its annoyingly self-centered characters for whom you can't muster even a smidge of empathy, let alone sympathy; 2) the melodramatic tone of the modern-day storyline, which is completely unjustified by the humdrum events; and 3) the unnecessarily sordid, pandering climax to the murder mystery that is unrealistic in light of what we have come to know about the characters.I don't say things like this often, but this book is truly not worth reading. If you're wanting an introspective \\"women's\\" book that you can really chew on, read \\"The Poisonwood Bible\\" by Barbara Kingsolver or \\"The Wide Sargasso Sea\\" by Jean Rhys."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Slow and Painful Read","review":"This was a horrible read for me. I found that the author spent so much time on detail that I forgot what she was explaining. I often found myself sleepy after just a couple of pages. I did not have a problem following the different time frames as I have heard many people complain. I was originally attracted to this book because of the true murder content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho Hum","review":"This novel SOUNDED so interesting and I really looked forward to reading it. Unfortunately, my hopes were dashed. Obviously a lot of people enjoyed the book, so maybe I missed something, but I wound-up skimming the last third of it just to finish the darn thing. I still can't decide which story--the one in the past or the one in the present--was more boring. Perhaps if more people had been axed . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"tedium","review":"I must say I was initially intriged with the plot of this book and am normally fasinated with plots that mix mystery and self imposed dramas from one's life. However, I could barely stand the writing style of Ms. Shreve. She hopped, literally, paragraph by paragraph from present to past and back again, to a point where I finally had to put the book down. The plot was very interesting and was the only thing that held my interest in the first 100 pages. However, I must confess that I finally gave up and will have to guess how the book ended based upon the other reviews of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Traumatizing","review":"I enjoyed the story that took place years ago much more than I did the current day one. Also I was so upset by what I viewed as the unnecessary tragedy of the ending that I could not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Modern Fiction's female misogynist strikes again","review":"As in A PILOT's WIFE and now in THE WEIGHT OF WATER Anita Shreve continues her latent hatred of the male species by combining the likes of incestual love,the killing of an innocent man and the basic distrust of all that is not female.She treats her male characters as \\"in the way\\" of women becoming self-actualized (or perhaps it's a longing to be male and she's just so angry that she doesn't enjoy the same \\"privilege\\" given them in society).I couldn't stand the protagonist. I wished her husband had thrown her overboard and gone to bed with Adeline. The story would have been more interesting. And as for her Smuttynose story,Maren seemed like a spoiled baby at times and deserves to die with a heavy heart. Anyone who could take an ax to someone with no teeth does not deserve any compassion.The ending was a horrible copout.Jean and Adeline should have run off together. Much more interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Melancholy Weaving","review":"We selected this book for our discussion group this month. And I started reading it several days ago. The first half of the book went slowly; it was confusing and uninteresting. The second half picked up with some tension and interest. And the ending just triumphed with sadness and melancholy feelings. I watched the Patriot/Broncos game while reading the story. And the storyline followed the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite historical fiction","review":"Shreve is poetic, but the storyline of Weight of Water is silly and farfetched. I loved the description of the emotions felt by Maren the Norwegian immigrant as she lands on the desolate island of Smuttynose in the 1870's. I hated the back-and-forth between Maren's story and the present day. The attempt at parellelism didn't work, and ruined the story. The contemporary characters were annoying and the ending of the book is ridiculous.Readers should understand the real history of the Smuttynose murders. The Weight of Water would have been better if it simply raised speculation of a different set of circumstances around the murders and let the reader decide. Instead, Shreve implicates a real person who, now in their grave, was most likely an innocent victim of a miserable life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great promise, but details go awry","review":"Shreve weaves a compelling story, sucking the reader into the vortex of threatening and dangerous jealousy. Her ability to shift between time frames shows immense writerly control, and her descriptive language is arresting. Less successful is her handling of the \\"murder mystery\\" details. What actually happened that night? Since Shreve writes so meticulously, the reader feels let down by details that are not logical. For example, if it was so cold outside, why was Maren lying in bed without covers? What happened between Thomas and Jean? The ending seems oddly truncated and uncentered; the horrible tragedy is reduced to nothing more than a sense of disorientation and malaise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Violence and intrigue!","review":"Anita Shreve is one of my favorite authors. The story is about a couple who need to find out if they can support each other and if they should stay together. She is a newspaper photographer digging into old ax murders. Interesting surprises. Unexpected twist and turns in the plot. Two separate time lines that she keeps well aligned. Excellent read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Shreve; dislike this book","review":"I was vastly disappointed with this book, the Weight of Water, indeed weighty, hard to get into, with unsympathetic characters. The oddest plot twist to me was the sort of lesbian touchy-feely passage between Maren and her sister-in-law. Most odd was that Maren did not cover herself up or pull down her nightgown after falling asleep. It was freezing in that house, and when a person is cold, they generally wake up and then cover up. Her sister Karen was so horrible I felt she was a cardboard character. But it was the above scene that made me roll my eyes. How could Shreve, such a fine author, have come up with this? Odd, too, that Maren killed Karen with one blow of a chair!Beautiful writing depicting scenes in Norway and off the coast of Maine. Good research, too, but she just didn't pull it off."},{"rating":"2","title":"The WEight of Water","review":"This book is fascinating. I was enthralled. I loved the history intertwined into the plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"helainebinstock&yahoo.com","review":"Easy-to-read, flowing prose. On photo-essay assignment off coast of New Hamshire, to reasearch a brutal l871 murder, narrator juxtaposes past with present. Familiar passions and emotions, clearly described, makes for mezmerizing reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW - not to be missed.","review":"One of the best books I've read in a great while. Lyrical and compelling. Cause for much pondering......a GREAT book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intiguing story with the past and present intertwined","review":"The book at time seems a little slow, but as you delve into the pages, its well woven story, with the past and present intertwined, starts to grip you with its intrigue. It's a book well worth reading, and its story will 'stick to your ribs'. Anita Shreve writing style is unique and commendable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A quick read, dark and emotionally satisfying","review":"Shreve's novel is emotionally satisfying in the way that going through old photos can be. There's a bit of the voyeuristic pleasure in it as the reader witnesses taut relationships played out in the confines of a boat.You get wrapped up in the story as it seamlessly weaves the present and the past, both fraught with explicitly female tensions. I bought it because I wanted something dark and full of emotion with a story that was easy to follow. I was not disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book!!","review":"I loved this book...it instantly made me an Anita Shreve fan. I've since read the Pilots Wife, Resistance, Eden Close. I'm sure I'll read all her books at some point! highly recommended. Lent it to my Mom, and my sister..they both called me to tell me how much they enjoyed it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't hate this book--I just didn't like it!","review":"I really liked Anita Shreve's \\"The Pilot's Wife\\" so thought that \\"The Weight of Water\\" would be another interesting read. Was I wrong! The book is boring and depressing--both the present story and the one that took place in 1885. Whenever I read a book, I like to be moved; either to tears or laughter. But, there is no laughter in this book--not even a smile. When I finished this book I needed something light and happy; you will too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Every word conveyed sadness.","review":"An overwhelmingly disturbing, depressing, dark novel. You might want to take some Prozac before beginning this book....you'll surely need it by the book's lonely ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well done story, a pleasurable read.","review":"The language used in this book is sometimes mesmerizing as Shrieve moves us from past to present and back again. The unanswered questions don't detract from the quality of this highly recommended work."},{"rating":"2","title":"What was her mysterious illness at age 12?","review":"I enjoyed the book; I read it in many sittings and found myself constantly scanning what I'd read before. So perhaps that is why I feel the question is- what happened the night her mother died that she developed a strange illness that was perhaps more psychological than physical and lasted two years? Was she raped by her brother? They were found holding each other in bed when her father returned. Was this incest then \\"repeated\\" by the modern day advances to the brother in law? Are these parallels or just loose ends? Great story, weak ending but by the middle of the book I could not put it down. A good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's in the telling","review":"It goes without saying I enjoyed the book's plot, mystery, and historical aspect. But the thing that truly impressed me the most was the format and style in which it was written. It was refreshing to have the \\"flashbacks\\" interwoven with the contemporary setting without so much as an extra paragraph break, let alone a new chapter! It really kept me on my toes and kept things suspenseful. I have read one other book by Anita Shreve, Strange Fits of Passion, and was impressed with its unique format also. (First person accounts from several different characters, under the guise of being interviewed for a magazine.) There are plenty of good stories out there, but what can make the difference in which ones you spend your time with is the manner in which its told. Keep them coming!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice blend of historical speculation and romantic suspense","review":"The author traverses nimbly between the known facts of a famous murder case, speculation on the lives of the principles, and a tense summer vacation which sets the stage for an unraveling marriage. While Shreve occasionally overreaches, and her theory of the unsolved murder is somewhat irritating, the rich texture of her writing compensates for these shortcomings. Recommended"},{"rating":"1","title":"Two storylines that at times leave the reader confused.","review":"The writing style was totally different from \\"Pilot's Wife\\". Was disappointed that so much time was spent telling a historical story when I expected a current story line with just references to the 19th century events. Had to force myself to finish the book in hopes it would get better. --"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting....but.....","review":"As much as I enjoy reading mysteries, I found THE WEIGHT OF WATER to be a real struggle. I can't fault the technical aspects of the novel since Ms. Shreve is obviously a meticulous researcher and skilled grammarian. Where she lost me was with the stream of consciousness approach. I found it disconcerting and more than a bit distracting. I also failed to develop any affinity for narrator and the other prinicpal characters. I found little about them which appealed to me personally. Half way through the novel, I finally gave up the fight and turned to the end. Needless to say, I didn't like the conclusion. It isn't often that I'm so disappointed. Sorry, Ms. Shreve, better luck next time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother","review":"This book was like a long painful trip to the dentist. There was no emotional attachment to any of the chararcters and the story dragged on and on. The ending had me throwing the book out, which is unusual for me. I would never inflict this book on anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed after reading The Pilot's Wife and Where or Whe","review":"Did I miss something in The Weight of Water? I was very disappointed with this book, especially after reading The Pilot's Wife and Where or When. Both the story lines in this book were weak. I wasn't even moved by the ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Crime Becomes Fiction","review":"Jean, a photographer working for a magazine, is assigned to take photographs of Smuttynose, an island off the coast of New Hampshire that was once home to an ill-fated family of Norwegian immigrants. It was here, in 1873, that Maren Hontvedt became the sole survivor of a vicious ax-murder that claimed the lives of both her sister and her brother's wife. Although a former employee of the Hontvedts was accused, tried, and executed for the crime, Jean stumbles upon shocking evidence that points to a completely different culprit. The novel alternates between Maren's and Jean's points of view as the two women narrate their stories. The novel isn't perfect. The \\"Jean\\" storyline isn't nearly as interesting as the \\"Maren\\" storyline, and Shreve comes close to revealing the plot twist with a few ill-placed hints. However, Maren's story is a sympathetic and compelling one, and will keep the reader turning pages until the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not such good luck","review":"Based on these three positive reviews and I did order this bra.

While it is designed for the student, it can be read at many levels, and will be useful for researchers, systems designers, consultants, LAN administrators, and the sophisticated salesperson.

It clarrifies a lot of common misconceptions, and has helpful discussions of both basic and advanced topics.Any manager who does not want to be bamboozled by the techies needs this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Overview; Poor Quantitative Examples","review":"This book presents a good, functional overview of networking and current technologies. However is does a very poor job of providing any quantitative examples in the chapters.

There are also several typos in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jonnie Jacobs is a series to follow...","review":"I just finished this book and must say I really enjoyed it.

Sometimes mysteries are way too predictable or, the opposite end, impossible to figure out - I found this one nicely balanced.

Jordan always wanted to win and he did. In the dvd, you have 5 programs that explain what i just said and many other things, 5 great programs.

I haven't tried multiplay yet, but I'll see if there are still folks playing it online.On a sidenote, there's no such thing as a .22 gauge shotgun. A .22 is a tiny little bullet.

We get to see Christopher Walken once again parade around as a megalomaniacal nutcase, somewhat out of place in this movie, and with a bad hairdo to boot. The then-budding young actress Anne Heche plays the lead role of a Bank Clerk by day, Prostitute by night. The plot gets slightly confusing and contradictory, but the acting is pretty decent, and the plot, despite its faults, is somewhat clever.

The always strange Christopher Walken and Steven Bauer flesh out (pardon the usage) story, such as it is. I give it four stars for Heche, who can't really act, but did look good; I might have given it five, if Chen had shown more, other than that, ok, but not great.

If you want quality peripherals (namely Sega's), email their support area and tell them that you want Sega's version of the blaster released in America.

Rather than deal with InterAct's lousy warranty situation, taking the risk that the gun would be just as bad after \\"repair,\\" I bought a Mad Catz gun.The Mad Catz gun is MUCH better. Besides the fact that it actually works reliably (a big plus) its auto-reload function doesn't have to be manually configured for the number of shots. The Mad Catz gun is more comfortable too."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works.","review":"The StarFire serves its purpose well. Autofire and reload are very nice features. In House Of The Dead 2 there is a lengthy pause to auto reload, but this may be caused by the game, not the blaster. The only thing I didn't like about it is that it has a rather cheap feel to it, and the trigger is a tad uncomfortable. I may end up filing down the ridge that runs along the perimeter of the trigger for a smoother grip. It is not very ergonomic for using your index finger to fire (your hand fits on the handle too high). It is, however, more ergonomic to use your middle finger to fire. As paintball pros know, your middle finger can fire faster than your index finger, so this gun will train you better for playing paintball. In that sense, it is educational."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Gun is not very intelligent as they claim","review":"I tried this gun and got frustrated because it is not accurate for one thing, it also didn't work when sitting far from the television.

The lives of important characters such as Ekin's mechanic/friend, girlfriend, and father add to the drama of Ekin's seeming sudden change from punk into Luke Skywalker-esque hero.To be fair I'll rate it 4 stars, but I've probably seen this movie a dozen times, and still love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled","review":"i love asian films, so i rented this with very high hopes after the reviews i'd read, i was so dissapointed. its just not that good of a film, i can't understand the high star ratings some give it. as far as being compared to F&F, well, imo this flick doesn't come close. its just so bad, he looses his girl and never really seems upset by it. oh yea, breaking limbs if you loose a race? kinda silly. and the stupidist thing is a guy goes to attack the star of the flick with a needle that is infected with AIDs. thats just bad tasted. the only reason i gave this film 2 stars was because of the EVO and WRX. although the race scenes don't delievry the same sense of speed as F&F, it wasn't bad to watch. i recomend renting before buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baseball Piggy Bank was a hit.","review":"As in other reviews, I'll say again.

The words \\"large\\", \\"small\\" or \\"jumbo\\" really are not relevant.That being said, the child this was purchased for liked it and everyone present at this family gift exchange gave him coins to put in. It was a hit, especially since his dad is a huge (does that relate to anything?) baseball fan and the child's room is decorated in MLB decor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harmful used to Authenticate Iatrogenic DID DX","review":"I was given this book, among many others, by my doctor who insisted I was MPD and needed to fully embrace my diagnosis and increasingly horrific memories, if I wanted to heal. (He also suggested that if I didn't, quite possibly, an evil alter would \\"come forward\\" to kill my young children.)Books that are sensational and salacious - claiming to be true stories, yet not substantiated, should not be read for validating the DID diagnosis or veracity of the cult activity contained in this book. Reading these fabricated stories should be for entertainment purposes only. Otherwise, it's part of the problem pertaining to the circulation of misinformation regarding repressed / recovered memory therapy.P.S. The posts left among some of my book reviews by Anonymous are erroneous and spiteful. I own the book and read the book. The paperback \\"Suffer the Child\\" continues to be in my possession, (ironically) personally inscribed by aforementioned \\"doctor.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"eh","review":"good, but not a page turner...was hard for me to be motivated to read it, so it took me a long time to get through it... 'Michelle Remembers' is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing, Beautifully Written Novel","review":"A friend let me borrow this book about 4 years ago. Since then I have desperatly searched to find it. It has been an obsession. I found this book to be incredibly dark, and odd. I think this book is incredibly interesting, and I would recommend highly to anyone that is interested in the inner workings of the mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complete from A to Z","review":"Most books leave the reader with a longing for more extensive knowledge of the healing process. Not this one. Judith Spencer does an excellent job of taking the reader from discovery of the abuse, denial, DID effects, and therapy. The details of the abuse can be triggering but also affirming if there are any doubts about the memories of Ritual Abuse. The long search for adequate help within the counseling community was down right disturbing as she was misdiagnosed over and over again. The most informative part of this book is the intimate detail of the therapy relationship and process. Her therapists were absolutely commited beyond the norm to her emotional health. READER BEWARE: don't expect to find similar therapists, they probably don't exist. My only disappointment was the lack of information about the relationship with her husband. As a primary relationship, it was certainly overlooked or intentionally avoided."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Tool for Discipleship","review":"This is a classic tool (and series) used to disciple effectively men & women at all ages and stages in their relationship with God. We're using it mainly with adults but it can also be used with Jr. High and High School students. This one-year program can transform men and women into more mature believers who can reach out to others (both Christian and non-Christian). You will have a solid walk with God and \\"tools\\" to disciple others for the Kingdom. You will be equipped to lead investigative Bible studies in your neighborhood as you live a lifestyle-evangelism focus or teach through this program.I have used it for 10 years with consistent results as the Holy Spirit empowers the process of growth.Best done in a small group of 5-9 plus the facilitator."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Very insightful and challenging. Just started the book and am already loving it. Highly recommended for any Christians that want to grow closer with God."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally...","review":"This man gets the attention he deserves...sort of. I was really happy to see a box set release of various songs and videos. And everything in this set turned out amazing. So much great stuff, and I recommend it to anyone who's a fan, or even just beginning to look into Fad Gadget/Frank Tovey... However, I think I would have liked better maybe a 4 disc comprehensive set of ALL songs he has done. The 2 CDs include nice demos and fan favorites and a few others, but if this is supposed to a retrospective set, it should have included a lot more. It would have been more expensive, but I would have paid for a nice set of all his material, as its not too easy to get your hands on much else of his in stores. But back to the point, this set is AWESOME, the videos are worth the price alone! Get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Frank's influence, no passing Fad","review":"Frank Tovey was one of the most unappreciated artists of our time. He was an extremely diverse and multi-demensional arranger of sounds, and talented song writer. Martin Gore and Dave Gahan of Depeche Mode both cite Frank as an influence in their careers.Most of the videos, and especially the live performance videos, are obviously low-budget. But this 2DVD/2CD set chronicles Frank (Fad), from his beginings, to his abrupt conclusion in the early 2000s. Whether making strange electronic pop tunes, or creating catchy folky songs, he consistently demonstrated brilliant song writing and arranging talents.I, for one, wish the rest of the world had had the fortune of knowing this brilliant artist's work.May he rest in peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story to Teach Children about Geology and Earth Scienc","review":"It is clear the author wants to engage the reader into seeing the excitement of the geologic cycle, and to teach earth science to children using scientific terms. The book is beautifully illustrated, and exceptionally well written It is clear the author has an excellent background in geology.When I read the book to my grandchildren, they want it read again and again. Looking at rocks, the children and I have a new perspective of what a rock really is and how it came about.I look forward to other books by this author!"},{"rating":"2","title":"excelllent book - wish it was in print!","review":"My mom bought this book for my son several years ago at a small bookshop. It has been one of our favorites ever since. My son has enjoyed it from 4 years old to 11 and now his 3 and 4 year old brother and sister are enjoying it. This is one of the best. It is geology with a slight spritual undertone - I think anyway! I wish this book was available new to give as gifts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book!","review":"While working at elementary school and public libraries for a number of years, I noticed there were very few interesting picture books on geology for grade school children. Earthsteps meets this need and children love it! The pictures are gorgeous, and following the rock as it journeys through time not only presents an easy to understand introduction to geology, but also keeps kids interested as they find the ever diminishing rock in each picture!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Earthsteps - a great book for budding scientists","review":"Earthsteps - A Rocks Journey Through Time, is beautifully done. My grandchildren loved reading it and they have taken a new interest in rocks. I would recommend it to anyone who would like to bring the beauty of science to their children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Introduction to Geologic Time and Processes.","review":"The story and pictures are so much fun AND educational that I bought 5 copies and donated them to my childrens' school libraries. The story's main thesis is that Earth's crust is in a constant state of erosion, deposition, and upheaval. Over geologic time (i.e. millions of years), the cycle repeats itself again and again. It is an excellent primer on the concept of geologic time and earth processes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating and funny insight into the French","review":"A truly excellent film which is both funny and insightful. As always the French are the masters of capturing the subtlety and strengths of human psychology. Highly recommended to all who enjoy French cinema and the exploration of human relationships in all their guises."},{"rating":"1","title":"It really looked good, but...","review":"The subtitles did not work properly, with only about 20% of the dialog being shown in English. Perhaps I got a bad DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good at all - Get the Conze (1959) edition","review":"DO NOT buy this text! The scriptures are not organized in anywhere near the intuitive fashion as the Conze version, and it is missing a whole host of sutras, most notably, EVERYTHING about the conversations between King Milinda, and the Bodhisattva, Nagasena, which are absolutely critical in any study of Buddhism. Lopez's rambling and unhelpful inter-locutions throughout the text are distracting and unhelpful, and really break up the blow of what little original text he didn't butcher. Seriously, buy the 1959 edition by Conze and you will be much happier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Order took too long to arrive.","review":"The book took soooooooo long to get here that I had to reorder another from another person who shipped it in 1/4 or the time it took this one to get here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rocky Anthology","review":"I was really impressed seeing this movie but not for fighting but the perfomance of realistic nature of human beings.

My son was very thank ful.Thanksm"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rocky 1 and 2 are timeless masterpieces: after that it gets blurred","review":"Rocky 1 and 2 are pure masterpieces from beginning to end. The music and overall work is near perfection of the movie experience. These two movies never get old and indeed I have watched them several times before. Starting with Rocky 3, there becomes a problem, as if they should have never been made, and indeed a pure terror to watch. Near impossible to sit through these messes. Rocky 3-5 are way hokey and don't work at all. In other words maybe Stallone and gang weren't \\"hungry enough\\" for Rocky 3-5 and just looking for a payday. Still the set is worth having as Rocky 1 and 2 are strong and up there with other top of the line movies ever mad; which indeed are few and far between. The essence of Rocky 1 and 2 are of the cosmic battle of man to overcome barriers, and self to make a good life in their world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Amazon did a great job . It's the first time that I purchased something from there and I must say it was speedy service. I love Rocky but then who doesn't. I don't think I have to explain a whole lot about that, but the DVD's that I purchased are excellent quality and i definetley would purchase through amazon again. Oh yeah, Rocky 1-5 to see it is a must for the fact it has Awesome fights, training, romance and excitement. It's a must. I had to watch all in one night it was so good I couldn't stop watching. I have seen them before but it is always good to repeat lots of times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great up until part 5","review":"Absolutely one of the greastest underdog stories ever told. Sly does a create job in each picture. The only negative would have to be Rocky V, mainly for the simple fact that it isn't anything to do with Rocky boxing in the ring. If it was possible to make Rocky VI take the place of V I'd give it 5 stars, but it's still a grand collection to own."},{"rating":"2","title":"The American Movie","review":"The Magic that was Rocky, it lives again in a boxed set! I'm watching them with my kids, who've never seen them. Each time I see the training \\"Gonna Fly Now\\" segment, I get cold chills and I find myself bobbing up and down with Rock's one hand push-ups...and when he runs the steps victorious, I stand and jump with him. I cry at the end when I hear ADRIAN!Rocky II does not disappoint, though it doesn't approach III. Rocky's \\"Eye of The Tiger\\" when he gets the spark back to defeat Clubber Lang is pure genius. Of course Rocky becomes the larger than life symbol of America in IV, and it's back to the streets in V. I'm looking forward to VI!Never has their been a more inspirational, motivational, feel good movie. Rocky may well be THE AMERICAN MOVIE.Did I mention that I love it? The boxed set is the way to go folks. This movie dynasty is an national treasure!

I'm not a movie fan in general but the Rocky series is defintely endearing. 5 of the all-time best movies packaged in one set. Unbeatable. I own the VHS collection, so I'm probably even missing out on a few extras on the DVD set, but I can't complain.Seeing the original Rocky for the first time was incredible. It was a great film to watch, as it allowed me to piece together exactly how much Rocky had changed through the series, going from local Philly fighter to national megastar and back. An excellent ride indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Time Favourite - CLASSIC","review":"Five of them are superb !

Overall great transaction and product as described."},{"rating":"2","title":"The come back kid box set","review":"Box set containing all 5 of the original rocky movies (minus the newest, sixth, movie releasted in 2006). This set is great if you just want to sit back and enjoy the movies themselves. These movies were produced in the 70s and 80s so like many other DVDs of movies of this time frame, the discs are not packed with special features or lots of extra like newer movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"Watch them all over again, introduced by kids to the story and they loved it.Just wish Rocky Balboa the 6th one came with the set, we ended up buying it also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome Series","review":"I luv all 5 Rocky movies. It was by far one of the best series I have ever seen; along with all Star Track, Star Wars, and Lord of the Rings!!! I just finished watching them all this 4th of July weekend when and most of them I watched twice!!! It was an all day Rocky Fest on AMC. I watched them with my girls and they loved it just as much as I did. The movies had a moral to every storyline althrough sometimes repeating itself...It was still good. It was just like I saw it for the first time. I luved it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NO BONUS FEATURES","review":"Fans heed warning: If you're anything like me, you may have asked yourself, \\"Since this is an updated box set from the LAST box set, what are the new features?\\" Answer: NONE. No trailers, no deleted scenes, no outtakes, no featturets -- NOTHING. Only get this if you have a HD TV. If you're looking for ANYthing else, get the old box set. The old one was LOADED on the first film (though only had trailers on the rest). The only thing you get here are subtitles. I can't believe I sold my old set in anticipation for this thing. MGM stinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHERE's The Bonus Disc ???","review":"I know it's Not Amazon's fault, BUT - Where is the Bonus Disc ?? Some people say they got it, Others say they didn't ?

WE all pay the same amount for the Box Set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the correct set...","review":"The \\"Rocky V\\" movie was missing! Instead in it's place they put the 6th Rocky movie (which I already own). It may have said it in the description and I missed it, but still.

You get five hard hitting knock out movies on everyone's favorite hero Rocky Balboa! I have spent a good part of the weekend watching them and believe me these are movies that get you into the action! Great knockout price too!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rocky Box Set Review - Almost perfect","review":"I give the anthology set of rocky 4 stars because there was one small thing that bothered me and that was the art on the discs.The first two movies had art and that was great, but why didn't rocky 3-5 get any art? Seems weird to me and is aggrevating to me because as a collector of rocky products, I feel that I didn't get the best rocky set ever and I really like having art on discs. Yeah, it's weird but thats just what I like.But on to the good stuff, the movies looked and sounded great. The quality of the movies on dvd is amazing and I would suggest getting the dvd set. It is lacking in special features though, that could have been fixed. But, if you like rocky and it doesn't bother you not having special features and disc art then this is the set for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makalu Trekking Poles","review":"These are great! They help so much with stability and really do increase your work out. After I had knee surgery I did not feel at all confident on the more difficult or steep trails. After I bought these I could go much faster and much farther than I could with out. I was also pleasantly surprised at the workout my arms got, especially that difficult area on the back of the upper arm in women."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Helpful","review":"I used this map when I traveled to the Yukon in the summer of '99, and I'll depend on it again when I go in February of '01. Very good detail, especially when defining roads which are all year, or winter only, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Commentary? Perhaps. Witty? Definitely Not!","review":"After having read the positive reviews, I was rather disappointed that this book fell flat of my expectations. While the concept is an appealing way to relate the changes in higher education, the book lacked the wit it promised to deliver. Often, the anecdotes seemed too simplistic and one-sided; the writing often seemed to lack subtlety and craftsmanship need to enhance the content. My one consolation: I did not buy this in hardback."},{"rating":"2","title":"It should be 4 and a half stars!","review":"This book was almost as good as Lord of the Rings. The characters were more realistic, and man was it darker than LOR. LOR is my favorite, but this one is worth noticing. When characters died in this book, I was saddened, like they were real people! Did you ever eat a whole bowl of popcorn before you even considered stopping? Well, I read this from cover to cover and didn't even think of stopping. I started it a second time and I can't get over the depth of the story-line. You have to read this. IT IS INTENSE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantasy","review":"Enjoyable 'time travel' tale of mistakes trying to be rectified. As usual Lena Headey gives a fine performance, would recommend it for some 'light' entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dianne of Enfield","review":"This is an excellent romantic comedy about being able to go back in time and change the mistakes made in a previous relationship. It is extremely funny in places but at other times very sad. It stars that wonderful British actor Douglas Henshall(Angels and Insects) who plays the main character of Victor Bukowski. He is desperate to stop his ex girlfriend Sylvia from marrying another man. He is given a chance to go back in time change the mistakes he made in their relationship, but it doesn't quite work out as planned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love's Passion","review":"I own this album and I never get tired of it! Deborah's voice is crystal clear, strong and moving. Her music style is somewhat varied which keeps the album interesting. She has a way with words that captures something deep in my heart because of the depth of meaning carried in her lyrics. This is by far my favorite album, and everyone that I have shared it with has fallen in love with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attention, logomaniacs!","review":"It must be said that if you are looking for a serious reference book to boost a lacking vocabulary, look elsewhere. Using Mr Elster's words may earn you some extremely strange looks. But for those among us who are non-scopophobic and thrive on strange looks, as well as those of us who love the English language, this book should provide endless cachinnation. The blend of true words and nonce-words created from various prefixes and suffixes may at times aggravate those who want to be sure, but how could a real logomaniac be angry with that? Those nonce-words, when they become real, are reminders of exactly how great are the possibilities of this language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extreme obscurity","review":"This is not, as you might hope, a list of mildly exotic words that you could add to season your speech with precision and interest. Rather it is a collection of esoteric and obsolete words so obscure that no one without a dictionary (or even with many dictionaries) will be able to understand them."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY bad","review":"I have never given a one-star rating to a book before, but this book is EXTREMELY bad. If you think this book will help you get specific, eloquent words for you to use, think again! It is just full of boring stories which contain \\"grandiloquent\\" words. The author tries to make his stories funny and amusing, but they are a BORE! Save your money and your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"UN DISCO INTENSO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Recomiendo ampliamente que adquieran este disco. Sean te regala melodias que te mueven el craneo y el corazon. Es impresionante la calidad musical y la gran revolucion ideologica que trae este genio. El DVD es una super produccion, que si no lo has visto, no tienes ni la menor idea de lo que veras."},{"rating":"2","title":"Left me hungry for more.... wonderful","review":"I purchased this mostly hoping for a surreal music DVD. I was not disappointed. I loved the DVD. It was fun and surreal. (So refreshing from the onslot of \\"T and A\\" music videos I often see on cable.) What's better is that I loved the music even more than I expected to. It is one of my favorite cd's. It is just great stuff. Especially if you just listen to it for what it is without the seemingly obligatory comparisons. If Sean does another one like it, I will be the first in line to eat it up. It is melodical, kind of dreamy with some nice slightly haunting feel to some of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, melodic","review":"Nice melodies throughout, and his voice sounds better than before. But the arrangements are VERY similar throughout, especially if you know how diverse his first record was. I'd appreciate some that are more stripped down, or even crazier, but it's fairly normal \\"alt-pop\\" stuff.The songs are very good, but not very emotional, or dramatic. They grow on you over time, especially as he knows how to use melody and chordal progressions. Rare nowadays."},{"rating":"2","title":"Try to stop comparing","review":"Every singer/songwriter in this generation is influenced by other sounds, including (and maybe especially) by the Beatles. If it weren't for the fact that his voice is similar to his dad's, nobody would be comparing Sean's songs to John's. Ask yourself a simple question before writing a review: \\"do I like it, or don't I?\\" I heard some of this album on an NPR interview, and decided to buy it because it is exactly the kind of music I like. If I felt like comparing, rather than judging this album on it's own merits, there are other bands that I think have had a stronger influence. But the album is a good piece of work for a young artist. Mellow but interesting. I look forward to hearing Lennon's future work, provided he takes his time, lets his ideas ripen, and doesn't start trying to pop out an album every year or two. With this genre of music, I think quality is more important that quantity."},{"rating":"1","title":"I DONT WANT THE DVD","review":"Your first name is Sean, NOT john so you have no right to expect people to shell out this much for your very average music. How arrogant. NO option to buy just the music, you have to buy with a DVD. How come Beck just did this and charged half the price??? I am not paying this outrageous price for a DVD i could care less about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nepetism Sucks.....alot","review":"Dude, let me start off by saying that I HATE the beatles, and I HATE that hack Yoko Ono (as in oh,no...). That being said, I heard the piano solos on the homepage of his website, and I thought this CD would be cool....It's not.It sucks.This album is Horrible with a capital H. I'd be embarrassed to even print it, much less market it.Whatever you do, WHATEVER you do, DO NOT buy this album.Dude just sucks....but I think he'd be cool to have over to the house on a quiet evening with friends and just let him play his slow, soft piano music (which he offers none of on this CD)...he should stick to that and ONLY that.If you HAVE to buy a CD today off of Amazon, instead of this one, buy Apex Twin selected ambiant works vol.1.Much, MUCH cooler than this drivel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply enjoyable.","review":"We're so used to either heavy-handed rock or flashy-overdone pop that when something even-handed and quietly inventive comes along, it takes a while for our ears to adjust. If you're not convinced by the short previews available here on Amazon, do yourself a favor and go over to YouTube to the \\"seanlennonofficial\\" channel and watch (or listen to) the videos.This is really good stuff.And don't read the bio here - it puts way too much emphasis on who his parents are. This guy is his own man, doing his own music. It's much more like some of the best of his contemporaries - say Elliot Smith, Kings of Convenience, even a bit of Stereolab-ish or non-manic Cornelius than anything from his dad's generation.He definitely stands on his own as one of the more intelligent, rich, creative contributions to music in recent years."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great CD stays with you...","review":"OK, Sean has given his fans a wonderfully melodic if melancholy treat here. I'll listen to it for a while, then put it in the drawer. When I am amassing CDs for my car or for a business trip, I ALWAYS find myself putting this one on the pile. THAT gives a CD 5-stars. More than one song will stay with you, and I love the chording on \\"Dead Meat\\" the best. Listeners will get their money's worth here, and the DVD is also really cool. I won't pick apart each song here as others probably have already, but if you were 'curious' about this CD (like I was), just BUY IT! You will wonder how you missed such great songs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Solid Second Album","review":"I must say I was a bit suprised how lovely this album is. Being a HUGE Elliott Smith fan I got the same kind of vibe when I listened to this cd. I could very easily hear Elliott doing these same songs. Headlights is easily my favorite track and in my opinion is a catchy 3 minute pop masterpiece. I'm sure the old man is pretty proud of what his kid accomplished with the release of this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sean Lennon's Friendly Fire review","review":"I bought the deluxe version- which contains the CD and DVD movie(s).This is truly a work of art.The songs and the movies are really great.Glad I got it.Sean is very talented and \\"Friendly Fire\\" is a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"friendly","review":"just a heads up that this cd is another great cd of sean at his best great orginals well worth buying if u like beatles type of style Sean is all orginaland very hard working."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Album","review":"I have really been enjoying this album...\\"Into The Sun\\" was a good introductory album, and \\"Friendly Fire\\" was the right progression forward. It showcases Sean's songwriting ability. The production is decent...I think if Sean was paired with a musician like John Frusciante to produce his next album, the music would really take off to another level.I think it's pretty retarded for people to shy away from comparisons to his father. It's a double edged sword, either your're ripping off your Dad's sound or you don't meet John's standards.There's a reason there is only one John Lennon. His son has done his legacy well with \\"Friendly Fire.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"an average cd","review":"Sorry, but this is just an average cd that few will buy. Most buyers are Beatle freaks and I understand that. Nothing against Sean. I am sure he is nice guy and a kind person as is his mother whose musical talent he inherited. I am just not convinced music is his future. His voice seems to drone on and on. The songs are okay but nothing special. I bought this because of who his parents were. Nice to hear a couple of times. If he sticks with it he may grow as an artist. I hope so. His father wouldn't have Ms. Lohan involved in any projects, that's for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cringeworthy.","review":"The songs themselves might be listenable with another vocalist. He has the vocal abilities of his mother."},{"rating":"1","title":"hard to listen to but an effort for Sean","review":"I tried to listen to this one a few times and even watched the video. It did not move any mountains for me. The songs were an endless drone of the same note and same type of song for each track. Sean is definitely not a rocker and does not hold a candle to his big brother Julian who was born and raised in England and has a genuine British accent. Julian can sound like his father but he can change it up. Sean just drones on sounding like his father every note of the way and puts on a \\"scouse like\\" accent, when he was born and raised in New York City. However, he spent some time in Switzerland going to a private school. Some people call this album \\"dream like\\" but I call it depressing. Sean needs to rock it up and there is a LOT he can learn from Julian, even though their styles are a 180 degrees apart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lennon Junior","review":"Lo primero que se me viene a la mente al escuchar este segundo disco de Sean es a su papa, es inevitable, ademas creo que el tiene mucho mas derecho en imitarlo, o mas que imitarlo, en seguir ciertos parametros de su musica. Si en el mundo de la musica son muchos que los copian, porque no el hijo.\\"Wait For Me\\" se podria decir que es la version de Sean de \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\", solo le faltan las guitarras al reves. (aunque creo que las hay). Es un album agradable al oido, en particular me gusta mejor que el primero, es melodico y suave. Aunque hay que reconocer que muy en el fondo buscamos que se parezca en algo a John Lennon, por nostalgia o no se que, pero muy aparte de ello el disco es digerible. Si lo compras trata de escuchar el disco tal y como es, sin hacer comparaciones, es lo que hice despues de la segunda pista, y no me arrepiento. No solo heredamos de nuestros padres algun parecido fisico o de caracter, tambien heredamos algo de su arte."},{"rating":"2","title":"You just HAVE to like it","review":"That being said,I -however unjustified my reasons may be- love this album, and would like to encourage everyone to give it a try. In order to keep this review short, I'd like to mention some things I've noticed. Jon Brion plays a pretty important part in the production. I won't lie, Sean's album would sound fairly hollow if it weren't for the beautiful composure and steady hand of Brion. Meaningless is Brion's album, and would also like to encourage people to listen to that underrated masterpiece. Lastly, the Beatles influence is very prominent on certain tracks... an example being \\"Wait For Me\\", which is essentially \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\" with different lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Really a Biography","review":"Shall We Dance is not really a biography of Ginger Rogers. It is only 96 pages, with many photographs and limited text. The photographs are well-chosen and well-reproduced. The book does well with Ginger's early (before Fred) career, with many photographs I have never seen elsewhere. Unlike some other reviewers, I did not find the book to be particularly unflattering to Ginger.Alternatives to Shall We Dance are Dick Richards somewhat limited biographyGinger: Salute to a Starpublished in 1969 and Ginger's autobiographyGinger: My Story. I recommend Ginger's autobiography as the fullest account of her life.Of course, the best way to get to know Ginger is through her films, many of which (including all her films with Fred AstaireAstaire & Rogers Ultimate Collector's Edition) are available on DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snidely Whiplash","review":"'Snide' is the term I would use to describe the tone of this book. I settled in to read some tidbits about the personal life of a legendary star, who has brought many hours of delightful entertainment into the life of my family. Instead, I found this book to be very unbalanced in its treatment of Ginger Rogers; I do not recollect that one kind word was spoken about her. Surely a lovely woman who brought such beauty into the world deserves a 'thank you'; she does not deserve to be referred to as a cranky old bat in a wheelchair. Extremely disappointing, and a poor quality book with many typographical errors. I will continue to have great respect for Ms. Rogers, and I will keep searching for a biography with a kinder, fairer treatment of her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shall We Dance Around The Truth","review":"Why would someone want to write such a mean spirited book about a beautifully talented actress and dancer who has brought so much joy throughout her life to others? Who would buy this book but a fan?... Save your money! Mr. Morley writes this book with cruel intentions, his facts can not be substantiated by anyone who is alive, so he can say whatever he pleases. Funny how he waited till the year she dies to get his nasty book published. If you already purchased the book like I did... you can cut out the nice pictures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's Call the Whole Thing Off","review":"This is a true hack job: all the nastiest and most spurious anecdotes and rumors about Ginger Rogers ever dished up anywhere, disguised as a biography. Like many opportunistic entertainment historians, Morley lacks any real understanding of how movies actually get made (and what the people who make them are really like) and instead serves up malicious gossip in a snide tone that passes for wit. Ginger Rogers had a hugely successful career in show business that lasted over half a century, but you'd never guess why from this shallow, nasty, misogynic book. Get Arlene Croce's \\"Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers Book\\" instead -- still the last word."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst biographies I have ever read","review":"I could not believe how bad this was. I have been a fan of Ginger's for a long time & saw her recieve her award at the Night of 100 Stars in London just a few months befroe she died. I was shocked at how mean & unpleasant this book was. It skirted through much of her career & life, & was a incredibly dismissive of all that she had done-ironic considering she was a highly skilled actor, dancer, artist, comedienne & athlete with a warm & affecting singing ability & a feisty & fun personality & real professionalism. Whilst i do not need hagiography, this biography seemed to simply want to demlosh her completely. The photos were a treat though, but i reccomned reading her own autobiography or Homer Dickens' Films of...If you are already a fan, you will be angered & disappointed by this book, & if not you will not get any true idea of her talents from it. Ultimately, a totally pointless exercise in vitriol."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ginger & Judy-Terrible Targets","review":"This gentleman is one of the nastiest writers around, he has done a horrible job on his bio of Ginger Rogers, mean spirited and such clap trap, no true fan of Ginger would want this added to their library unless of course it is a library for trash. Mr. Morley also wrote a horribly angry nasty attack book on Judy Garland a few years back, real filth. This man cannot stand true talent, especially the wonderful talents from the golden age of film. Bottom line....why bother?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Condescending rubbish","review":"One can only imagine the author Sheridan Morley obtained his employment at The SPectator and on the BBC due to who his father was and NOT because of any talent or insight he has about actors and acting.

I was reading some reviews on some copys/knock offs for the canon lens I had.

I thought my EF 28-135 took good shots before... I was pleasantly surprised at the results of using this relatively cheap add-on. In a bright environment lens flare can be present in a subtle way, taking out some shadow depth and \\"bleaching\\" out a shot. This hood helps prevent that and really had an impact on my shots.The hood itself is well built, made of high end plastics and the inside has a soft fabric coating to absorb light and protect your lens. It locks onto the front of the lens quickly and is easily removed when not wanted. You can also use this hood in conjunction with a lens filter, so you don't have to compromise between the two.Again, you can't beat the bang for buck value here."},{"rating":"2","title":"works like you would suspect","review":"One can't get overly excited about a lens hood.

It is made of sturdy plastic and I expect it to last a long time. I haven't tested it with outdoor photos yet but if it functions like other Canon hoods, I expect it to be fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"indispensable","review":"A lens hood is indispensable for so many reasons -- to protect the lens, to keep flare from ruining the pic being the two most important -- but a properly made one is even more so. The way this Canon lens hood is cut prevents the hood from getting in the way of the picture, and it gives you easy access to get the lens cap off or to even rotate a polarizing filter (you still have to be careful so you don't slip and get a fingerprint on the filter).The Canon lens hood goes on and off in just a second, and it's easy to store in your camera back if you take it off and turn it around, then place it over the lens. On the occasions I forget to bring it with me, I have to change the way I shoot or have my husband act as a lens hood! So yes, I would say it's indispensable, and at this price, a no-brainer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Great to cut the glare and protect my lens!

It also affords a little extra protection for the lens. It's already helped save my lens from a fall once.

Helps protect lens from scratches and damage. It also increases the quality of your photo by blocking out unwanted glares from the sun or lighting.."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have For Quality Pictures","review":"It is the Canon OEM lens hood for their EF 28-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM lens. It fits perfectly and has three main advantages:1. Cuts down lens flair2. Improves contrast and image quality - two for one3. Offers some protection to the front of the lens.As has been pointed out in other reviews, this is an expensive piece of plastic and given the cost of Canon glass should be included with the lens purchase. But that is not the case. There are other options available. From some of the reviews I have seen of the knock-offs they do not always fit and/or work as well. So for me, given my Canon investment, I just bite the bullet and add the final piece I feel I get better results with. After all, I could buy cheaper glass.This hood can be reversed on the lens for storage on the lens, but it will require a larger lens case for storage on the lens, if you use that option. And finally, it is a little tight getting the lens cap on/off with the hood in place, but it is doable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential item","review":"Good fit, works as advertised, stores on lens.

Kept me up well into the night. Highly recommended read. Staub has the ability to write a well thought out mystery that keeps the reader guessing until the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilling read","review":"This was the first Wendy Corsi Straub book I had ever read, and I was not disappointed. The writing style is nice and concise, with a interesting mix of characters and minor conflicts (aside the major one, of course) make for a very interesting tale while you wonder about just who some of the characters are and their motives.I felt bad for Jenny because she lost her friend, but this was a rather thrilling book. I could not stop reading it and finding out just who was behind all the crap that was going on, and just who on earth would want to hurt poor Jenny. The person who is after her... well, I don't want to spoil it for you folks, but it certainly wasn't anyone I would have *ever* expected, that's for sure. A solid, thrilling and enjoyable read, two thumbs up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent !!!","review":"This review is for all of Wendy Corsi Staub's books. The first book I read by this author was Lullaby and Goodnight, which was maybe a year ago. I loved it so much that I went and bought all of her books and read them all in a month. I just finished her newest one \\"The Final Victim\\" and even though it is a long book (474 pages) once I was done with it I was left wanting more. I know she is working on her next novel, but I just wish that she would write faster:) Anyways go, buy and read any of her mystery (except Dearly Beloved). I guarantee you will fall in love with her style and you'll be left wanting more. Just for a reference, I like mystery books where cops and detectives are not involved a lot. My favorite authors are, of course, Wendy Corsi Staub; Mary Higgins Clark, Patricia MacDonald, Carlene Thomson and Sidney Sheldon. Good luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay Book, Inspite of Obvious Mistakes","review":"Kiss Her Goodbye was okay. I didn't find out who the killer was until the end, but some of the mistakes confused me. Maybe they were typos. For instance, first the young boy from Jen's high school was supposed to have been shot and killed, then, later in the book you read that he was found stabbed to death. There were numerous other mistakes. I noticed that everyone is comparing Wendy Corsi Staub to Mary Higgins Clark. Mary Higgins Clark still reigns as the Queen of Suspense as far as I'm concerned. The only other writer that I would compare to MHC is Patricia MacDonald, and even she is not ready to take MHC's throne."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old News","review":"Like the other say it's way outdated.

The actor who protrayed the main crime boss is the kind of guy you love to hate (I think he was Sheng from A Better Tomorrow Part 1).Anyway , on to the technical aspect. The subtitling is built into the picture and is a so-so legible quality. Half the time , some of subtitles are outside the viewable area , so I just zoomed out using my dvd remote. The subtitles are also replete with spelling and grammatical errors.The sound quality is okay (though mono). It's better than some fake 5.1 mixes i've seen. The picture quality shows its age but is workable. For people who can speak Mandarin , there is a Mandarin dub.The extras are rather lousy. They have a trailer for First Shot and some other flick. There's also some bios but nothing too fancy.Bottom line , definetly worth a rental if you like HK action movies or Ti Lung. The main theme alone is worth a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great new talent!","review":"Idalé Burgos is a puertorrican singer songwriter who used to be a back up singer of the very popular rock band Viva Nativa. In \\"Perdidos en el Edén\\", she displays 11 songs, which 9 of them were composed by her. The album can be classified under the latin rock category, but it presents a lot of different rhythms like flamenco in \\"Báilame Idalé\\" and arabic in \\"Yo Te Amaré\\". Some great rock songs in the album are \\"Perdidos en el Edén\\", \\"Baila la Luna\\" and \\"Quitándome el escudo\\". The first single released of the album \\"Entiédeme\\" is a beautiful, very deep ballad.

Certainly the glory must go to Toscanini for making this complex work such a joy to listen to. He produces some of the most beautiful tones from the orchestra that perfectly matches with the glorious singing of Valdengo, Nelli, Merriman, Elmo, Guarrera and the others. I can't think of a single negative thing about this recording.Giuseppe Valdengo was in such firm tone and his acting is just right on the money. All the women of the piece are also excellent.

So, I placed the order figuring I was ordering the right type of cable and expected at least one core. What I got was NO CORES. I got a plain old USB cable with the proper ends on it. You can argue whether or not the cores are of any value (as dCables did when I called them to make arrangements to send these back) but Nikon sees fit to include them on the standard cables they provide with their cameras and when I ordered the Nikon part, I expect that part number and matching item. dCable shouldn't be selling these for what they are not!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a Nikon Product.

Many words contained vague definitions, and a few had incorrect parts of speech. But I thought that was an isolated incident and that their MCAT cards would be much better. I was wrong.

That said, I felt that these review cards were really usefull for test preparation. Certainly they are not meant to be primary study tools, and of course they lack the detail needed to learn the grand scheme of things. But for a fast/portable reference tool, nothing beats these things. I used them mostly to jog my memory and to fill in gaps in my knowledge base. I would take a stack of 50 or so and review them while I was waiting in traffic, during my break at work, or while on the bus/train ride to school. They are portable and you can go through them really quickly.

First, they're full of information that simply won't be tested on the MCAT -- plant biology, constants that don't have to be memorized, and nearly useless formulas and definitions. Second, there are several errors, and there are at least two pairs of cards that are exact duplicates. Third, they're not nearly in-depth enough or specific enough. They don't help you remember the hardest MCAT material -- the hard-to-remember formulas aren't tested, and the difficult details aren't asked for. They'll only give you a false sense of security. I don't recommend buying these cards unless you actually want to hurt your MCAT score. What a waste of $11."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good... if you want to lower your MCAT score","review":"I should have listened to Paul Mansour's advice.

The back of the card says \\"A fraction which expresses and equality between 2 units of measurement and can be used to convert from 1 to the other\\". No kidding. There are a few decent biolgy and physics cards for definitions and equations, but there are NO cards for organic chemistry. I guess you get what you pay for.

Parker was at one time a very gifted writer, and he hasn't completly lost the gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stripped-down Western","review":"I had just been introduced to a couple of Parker's Spenser books when I caught sight of this new Western. I'm a Western fan as well as a crime fan.Parker does a reverse Elmore Leonard; moving from crime fiction to the Western. Leonard was one of the best Western writers ever when he moved to the crime genre.As some have pointed out, this book has a pretty standard western plot with the laconic close-to-the-line gunning lawman. But I like Parker's tight, stripped-down prose, particularly the dialog, which reminds me of Leonard's first-class hardboiled Westerns."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Old West thru a Parker shaped filter","review":"I'm a long time Parker fan and even had a chance to meet himsometime back. In my view, he's one of our greatest living writers and the Spenser series simply has to rank as one of the finest detective series ever.After reading everything he's written in the last thirty or soyears it's hard not to see some familiar themes come up throughout the books.Honor, friendship, commitment, and love are all Parker mainstays and some people would say cliches.You could make a case that the characters of Cole and Hitch areSpenser and Hawk in different clothes. (Or Gus and Call from Lonesome Dove ,for that matter) All that aside, Parker has written a gritty, straight foward tale of the West with his usual ear for dialogue, humor , and compassion.

This is a poor effort by an otherwise talented writer. The big gunfight is a poor rip-off of the OK Corral tale, the characters are not well developed, and the book ends with a thud. The only good thing about the short chapters and wide spacing is that the reader has wasted less time with this hollow core of what should have been a good story. Read \\"Ride the Dark Trail\\" to see what a Western should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read. Much better than 'Gunman's Rhapsody\\"","review":"Mr. Parker has just taken this reader on a very enjoyable trip out west. 'Appaloosa' is surely one of Parker's better books as of late and is definitely better than his other two Westerns - 'Gunman's Rhapsody' and the Spenser Western 'Potshot.'Rather than going into a detailed description of the plot, let me say that it is your typical western (town terrorized by bad guys, two drifters come into town and fight to save it) plus a whole lot more and a few extra plot twists. It's got lots of Parker's great lines - if you love reading the dialogue between Spenser and Hawk in the 'Spenser' series, you won't be disappointed here.My only complaint is the last page of the book - I thought it ended a little out of character for our two heroes. For that, I dropped it to 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laws of the Heart","review":"Robert Parker's \\"Appaloosa\\" was not just about two Marshals upholding the law in the old west.

His writing is pared to the bone by now, as spare as the desert. Nothing new thematically (i.e., a man's quest for honorable behavior in a hard world), but brought off with terse vigor. Much of it borders on parody (e.g., the occasionally almost caricatured laconic/iconic dialogue, like Gary Cooper on quaaludes), but the conviction of Parker's writing pulls it off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Appaloosa","review":"Good as it gets!!

However, while Appaloosa has all the elements of a good Western, the novel left me not caring at all about the characters.Parker's lack of knowledge about horses is painfully evident, as when he refers to a \\"buckskin with a LIGHT (caps mine) mane\\", which is genetically impossible.There are severe editing problems with the text, especially when the Appaloosa stallion appears. \\"Appaloosa\\" is capitalized in one sentence, then not in the next.I particularly resented the publisher's trick of using large font size and double-spacing to make the reader think they are getting more book for their money than they are. If this book had been printed as most are, it would have come in at well under 200 pages.I was really disappointed in this book. Worse than being a terrible novel, it's just mediocre."},{"rating":"1","title":"What kept me going...","review":"What kept me going on this book comes down to two points...1) I did want to know what happened in the end.2) The book was so easy to read fast...I felt like I was not losing out on my time.Number two was probably the problem. I went into this story with high expectations. I saw Ed Harris on late night T.V. sometime last year, and he said that he wanted to make this book into a movie. I admit, this is my first Parker novel-but it will be my last. The writing style is not for me. I feel like if he left out the f-word and the sex-this could have been a pre-teen story. Also too much \\"Cole said\\" \\"Virgil said\\", it really disrupted the flow of the story for me.I gave the two stars because the story was ok-although I have seen Tombstone and this was definately parallel to that one.

Please read \\"Lonesome Dove\\" (see: Blue Duck); also \\"The Stand\\" (see: The Walkin' Dude); also \\"The Possessed (Stavrogin) to learn how to create a truly believable, evil villain. A book like this needs someone we can really hate, and love to see our heroes destroy.

Behind what appears to be caricatures, are people with some subtle nuances---the hero has some tragic flaws, the loyal sidekick is far from being a sycophant, and the saloon sweetheart certainly has no heart of gold.

Strongly criticizing the theory that women are supposed to sacrifice their lives for their children, Spencer shows how damaging this behavior is to all persons involved. Drawing primarily on psychological insights, she makes a strong case for her position.The author critiques the conservative Christian and religious right movement and its part in perpetuating female subservience and the mother's ultimate responsibility for her children's development. However, she ignores or is ignorant of the impact biblical egalitarians can have as they both model and teach mutual responsibility of parents for their children.This book is a good basic introduction to feminist theories of mothering. Heavily footnoted, it whetted my appetite for delving into the work of many other writers.(This review was previously published in \\"Daughters of Sarah\\" Jan/Feb 1986.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super price!","review":"I went to a auto parts store (A national chain that claims to have the lowest price).

I find them equalled by three groups : the Amadeus, Lindsays, and Emerson. In the Tokyo's #s 12-14, they are also equalled by the Quartetto Italiano, who falter in this last quartet. The Tokyo sounds most similar to the Lindsays; they are less ghostly and febrile than the Amadadeus ( a great reading) and a tad less driven than the Emerson.

ON a visit to Prague the greatest condcutor of Shostakovich and the greatest player of shostakovich got together; the results are incredibly fine. Mravinsky and Oistrakh get much more passion and bite out of the Shostakovich first than any other pairing, so much so that I can overlook the boxy, cramped sonics.

I think Rutger Hauer is a phenomenal actor, but the movies he's been in over the past five years really stink. The film is bearable but don't expect too much.

There is no aspect of this movie that even approaches quality. A fairly good cast do the best they can with the script, but have obviously received poor direction and the film is cut in such a way that the acting comes across poorly too. The military screens look like they were library footage from the 70's and the special effects look like reject footage from the A-Team, yet the movie was made in 1998, years after Jurassic Park and Terminator 2 where ironnicaly the films star Robert Patrick played the liquid Terminator.

They will not stick to a cardboard box, a file folder or even a plastic container. So sorry I ever bought this garbage at this point. I've tried a number of times re-printing the label, wiping the surface off and sticking it on again. Not even ten minutes later and it's peeling up again. The labels look fine the print is crisp and sharp, easy to read. I just can't seem to get the tape to adhere to anything I put it on. The tape can be slightly difficult to handle.

Some facts are flat-out wrong, dates often have transposed numbers, entries are repetitive.Some of the entries are misrepresentative of censorship trends. For example, there is an entry on Voltaire's \\"Candide.\\" However, the only time \\"Candide\\" was ever censored (as far as my research can tell) is once in the 1930s when one shipment of French copies was stopped in American customs because of the pictures. So it's the *artwork* which was being censored, not the novel. Additionally, much of Voltaire's work WAS actively censored, both during and after his lifetime, but Karolides and crew fail to mention that.My college Censorship Honors Seminar course used this book as a textbook and we spent most of our time wondering if the editor was asleep while proofing the text. It was horrid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended","review":"Karolides, Bald and Sova have produced one of the most informative books regarding censorship. The format of their chapters is clear and concise. They separated the various sections on \\"Literature Suppressed\\" into four parts: \\"Political,\\" \\"Religious,\\" \\"Sexual\\" and \\"Social\\". After a brief summary of the book in question, they provide a history of the text's censorship, and a list of further readings.If there is an interesting and informative reference book on censorship that you want to add to your shelf, I would highly recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Breton sound","review":"I first heard Christian LeMaitre play when he was part of Celtic Fiddle Festival and was captivated by his fiddling style.

The present BBC Legends disc is the most \\"official\\" and recent incarnation. Unfortunately, and surprisingly, the transfer has some technical shortcomings: stereo balance and frequencies are distorted, apparently in the attempt of \\"improving\\" the bright sound on the original master.

I recommend a search for that disc, which, unfortunately, is deleted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neither Horenstein nor Mahler in the best light","review":"With a seismic crack on the very first note of the tenor horn solo, some badly garbled playing and insensitively rushed tempi, and murkier sound in this \\"official\\" release of a bootleg recording than the Music & Arts \\"unofficial\\" release of some years back, this one is strictly for Horenstein (and Mahler) completists who are willing to overlook a lot for the sake of an allegedly \\"legendary\\" live performance. Both the conductor's memory and the composer's music deserve more. For a showcase of what Horenstein could achieve in concert, check out his pairing of the Bruckner Eighth and Ninth Symphonies in this BBC series, from roughly the same time period (1969) as this comparatively dismal effort. As for the Mahler Seventh, it's better served by Bernstein, Inbal, Abbado and, especially, Gielen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubber came off pretty quickly","review":"The rubber came off pretty quickly (just like for the original release platform this one replaced).

(R.E.M., Ramones, Black Flag, ....)Some of those bands set the tone for the end of the 20th century. Rapture is as fresh and potent and they will surely take us back to a new renaissance of independant creativity. Their minimalist approach to playing real instruments, sounds like they just invented the concept."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"\\"Out of the Races and On to the Tracks\\" is an awesome collection high strung tunes ranging from the dancy self-titled track, to the angry, raw, and powerful track entitled \\"The Jam\\". The songs all seem to fade into eachother as if the album were one long trip through groovy depths Hell (The album is in no way satanic, just chaotic, and that's why I say hell). It's dance, it's hip, it's poetic, it's artsy, and chaotic, what can I say? I really dig this album. But it took me a while to have the patients for it. That is why I give it 4 stars. Overall...it's an amazing album."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Sound","review":"By now most people that are in the know about music have heard some form of dance punk. However, most people dont realize that the Rapture were one of the first bands to take the beats from the disco bands of the 70s and add the attitude and simplicity of discos rival punk to make some of the most interesting music of the new millenium. get this before echos, it will make you apreciate the rapture so much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A passionate recording with the unique Toscanini stamp","review":"Doubtless, the ninth remains one of the best musical pieces of all time and, alas, one of the least performed in public. Indeed, such live performances were, and still are, so infrequent that George Bernard Shaw deemed them \\"extraordinary events separated by years\\". It may be that it is difficult and technically demanding (but then all Beethoven music is), but it is most likely because it's so passionate and emotionally demanding. You must have abundant personal and professional attributes to conduct a magnun opus the size of Choral Symphony and Arturo Toscanini has them both at his best in this 1952 recording. Although he was 85 years old at that time, he vigorously projects beauty, warmth and youth aplenty. It is a magnificent recording, one you cannot listen to and feel the same afterwards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Canon Remote Switch","review":"Unlike the less expensive wireless switch for the Rebel, this has a very short cord.

Sell it at a competitive price. Then, sell accessories for it and sell them at a 1000% markup. Be sure to patent the product so that no third party can produce a less expensive version. Want an example? Try this Remote Switch for instance.Here's how it works. You connect it to the camera. Press the button half-way, you get focus, exposure metering, etc. Press the rest of the way, you have a photo. Pretty simple stuff.Functional? Yes. Practical? definitely- a must have in fact for tripod users. Worth $50? No way. This product gets 2 stars from me because I'm insulted that I had to pay so much for it given its value.Want more examples? Try a Canon lens hood for $50 or a rechargeable battery for the same amount.

This allows me to make better use of my tripod."},{"rating":"2","title":"It does the job, but does it have to be so big?","review":"I have always been a big believer in cable/remote releases. I use a tripod whenever possible and a remote trigger is essential when you want to eliminate any chance of vibrations. I have been experimenting with a technique known as HDR (High Dynamic Range) where you take between 3 and 6 shots of the same scene at different exposure settings (see my humble example under \\"Customer images\\") and merge them together into one photo. For this, as well as many other situations, a cable release is absolutely necessary.My only complaint (more of a question) is why, in this age of digital circuity, is this thing so big? It could easily be the size of a thumbnail but it is fairly large. Anyway, I am glad that I have it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works on both Canon 50D and 7D","review":"When I bought this remote, I had not anticipated buying the 7D.

The plastic mold was too thick to allow the pins to connect to my 7d, so you would have to hold it against the connection on the 7d to use it (which defeats the purpose).

But, over $50 for this bit of plastic and wire? I have bought generic versions on EBay for about $15 shipped and they work great... No frills just a half shutter, full shutter, hold shutter slider button... much like this one. There is no denying that a remote switch is very useful especially when taking long exposures on a tripod or where even the button press could change the cameras orientation too much. But for $50 it should either be wireless or offer some sort of intervalometer feature. If you're the type who always buys Monster cables instead of generic, then maybe it's worth the premium to you. And even if you can't find a generic available, you can always use the timer feature of your camera as an alternative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good connector","review":"With any RFU adapter for any system, you lose more than you gain. Everything comes out of one connector pin - video & sound - and the amount of qulaity loss is substantial. The video quality is hampered in that it becomes really, really dim, the colors bleed, and it doesn't have the crispness that hi-res games should have. The audio is in mono and at a low-fidelity. The standard connection is with A/V cables (where video, left & right audio each have their own wire); check to see if your VCR or tv has these, it's much improved over RFU. The BEST possible connection is with S-Video (a video cable where color information and brightness are seperated), but not many smaller tv's have this.If you have to use RFU, then by all means buy this product.

I agree with the other users about the potential arm stretching safety issues but if you follow the directions and use the product carefully, it works very well.

And you're selling it for less than $8.00? Get serious. You can buy a good used car for $949. This is about the falsest advertising I've ever seen. Trident Cool Rush is excellent gum, but it is not worth $949."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not get this item","review":"I did not receive this item. I don't know what happened, I did not get any explanation from the seller."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Most Unique Tag Ever!","review":"I got a new puppy for Christmas 2010 and when I saw these tags on Amazon I knew it would be the one our boy would wear. The company sends a request for information via e-mail and if you choose to provide your information this way the product arrives very quickly. Ours arrived within two days of ordering. If you don't want to order your tags via email the company can also send you a kit to fill out and mail back to them. I love that you can add up to 2 personalized lines on the tags along with your information. Our boy is a miniature dachshund (only 5.6) pounds currently so the tag does tend to drag along the floor a bit but otherwise we love our license plate/drivers license tag. In fact we loved ours so much we ordered two more as Christmas gifts for family. No one will have anything like this and everyone will ooooh and ahhhh over these cute little tags. I'm sure we will be ordering lots more as gifts and I would highly recommend them to any animal lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Cute!","review":"Emailed 1 Cute Pooch the info for my Dog Muttsie and had my custom Pet PL8 in just a few short days...and did I mention it is so Cute!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Cute.","review":"So I was debating about getting this or not, because it is a little pricy for a dog tag. But ultimately I decided to do it, and I am very happy with my decision. Like other reviewers, the seller contacted me on email and allowed me to give all our information that way. On top of that, they printed it in German for me! Ultimate customization. And it was here within a week of ordering! My dog's little photo is so adorable and I can't wait to walk him down the streets in our new home. I hope it holds up over the next couple years. Will be back with an update.***Update***It has been over a year and the tag is still in tact. I'm very happy with my purchase. The only reason why it isn't 5 stars is because it's on the pricey side.Even so, I think I will order a new tag with our current address."},{"rating":"2","title":"tales of a female nomad","review":"HIGHLY highly recommend!!!A book that you don't want to stop reading even when it ends. I laughed and was prfoundly sad. I still carry the stories Rita painted in my mind. I was fortunate to meet Rita a few days after I read the book. She was just who i thought she'd be. Warm, concerned, generous and full of life. An uplifting book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and limited","review":"Rita says at the beginning that she is a person who makes excuses for herself and for others. You get that in this book. I admit I quit reading while she was in Guatamala but I was so frustrated. There are so many possibilities for her self that she stiffles. I had been looking forward to this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Courageous and eye opening adventure.","review":"I thought this book was wonderful. I loved learning about the different cultures and reading about Ms. Gelman's spiritual journey. I thought it was facinating how she immersed herself in the culture wherever she traveled. Ms. Gelman's writing reminds us of traditions and rites of passage that have dissapeared from our own culture. I feel she has the courage to live a life many people only dream about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!!!","review":"If you love Eat, Pray, Love you will love this book, too!!! I bought this book before and loaned it to someone and had to buy it again, it's that good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great adventures","review":"Great, wow! I loved this book. My daughter saidI could ‘nt leave her. I really loved reading about someone who did have that opportunity. The writing and descriptions are incredible. I really felt like I was there too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"makes you long to travel without a plan","review":"As scary as the thought might be of traveling alone Rita Golden Gelmans experience inspires you to seek out your own adventure and set yourself on a path of self discovery. This book haunted my soul, stirred my dormant need to seek adventure, and put me in a pensive state of mind.You don't just read her book you experience every thought, action, and the moments with her. Her writing style is relaxed and thought provoking. Gelman brings a compassion to the people she visits and takes a part of their worlds with her when she leaves. I loved this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting events written uninterestingly","review":"Although I honor Rita Golden Gelman for her intrepid spirit in traveling alone to exotic locales, and although I can relate to her background (I too grew up in Bridgeport, Connecticut), I agree with the other reviewers who found her writing banal. I have not yet finished the book (after starting to read it one month ago), though I've tried mightily--because her style makes the most interesting events seem bland and boring. For her next outing, I would suggest Ms. Gelman acquire a ghost writer who is able to describe characters more imaginatively (all of the women in her book have \\"shiny black hair\\", and all of the men are \\"around forty\\"!)and who can create a more vivid sense of place and purpose."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:E,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"card-container"},O=["disabled"],M={key:0},R={key:1};function H(a,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return o(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",B,[(o(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(o(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(o(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(o(),i("span",R,"Loading...")):(o(),i("span",M,"See more"))],8,O)):b("",!0)])}const j=d(x,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-84dbf9b7"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/14.md","filePath":"people/14.md"}'),N={name:"people/14.md"},P=Object.assign(N,{setup(a){return(e,n)=>(o(),i("div",null,[v(j)]))}});export{L as __pageData,P as default};
