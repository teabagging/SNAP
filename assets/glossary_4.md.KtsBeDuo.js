It works well for what it is intended for. We have a 1 year old and we use it to clean up the crumbs and mess he leaves under his high chair and all around the kitchen and on the carpet as well.

Our 1 year old loves to push it around as well which makes cleaning even easier!"},{"rating":"2","title":"To prevent over charging","review":"Overcharging will kill a most types of rechargables. A good charger like on a cell phone won't overcharge but a less expensive like this one can.Use an mechanical light timer the type with a little plastic insert to set the on/off time. They are $4-10. Remove all the \\"on\\" tabs. Set the time to noon and put the \\"off\\" tab at midnight. Plug the charger into this. When you want a charge twist the dial around to noon and flip the little knob to turn it on. In 12 hours it will turn off and stay off till you reset it."},{"rating":"2","title":"works well","review":"While this is not a sweeper intended for carpet, it will pick up small messes.

Didn't make any difference whether it was bare floor or area rug.Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY Disappointed","review":"I received this product as a Christmas gift. It worked great after the initial battery charge and I really loved it. But, after the 2nd charge it started stopping after less than 1 minute of use.

Please do not waste your money, this product is defective."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is only good for light housekeeping.

It is ideal for touch up cleaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great in a pinch","review":"I bought this to replace the older version of this same product because we had somehow lost the cover to the dust collection tray. This one has more power and even works on very low pile rugs in the kitchen. It can't be relied upon for heavy duty cleaning, but is nice to get big crumbs off the floor in a hurry. Our battery charger seems to have some issues, but I have the charger from the old one so that has not been a problem for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enjoy it while it lasts!","review":"I have purchased this item 3 times now. Shame on me! When it works it does the job quite well. The problem is it doesn't work for very long. Either it breaks or the battery dies. Either way, you spend more money on something that has a life expectancy of something less than 6 months with any type of steady use. I would actually pay a little more for it if it was built to last. Look elsewhere or plan to replace 2X a year or more."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is junk","review":"Be warned,do not buy it is a waste of money. battery does not hold charge.I know it does not get deep dirt out of carpets. but it bogs down and stops on my wood floor. do not buy........."},{"rating":"1","title":"Original, Old Model Swivel Sweeper","review":"Sorry I bought 2 of these but I went with the original, old model because the shaft is stronger than the newer G2 model. Ours snapped right in half.What I forgot about was with the original, old model it is a pain to dump the waste because you have to take the bottom tray off and dump it into the garbage can, hoping you don't spill it all over the place.This doesn't happen with the newer G2 model. With it, one presses a button, the bottom opens and the waste dumps out.And another thing the original, old model does is that it can easily flip itself over when vacuuming dumping the contents all over the floor that you just vacuumed up! This flipping does not happen with the newer G2 model either.Swivel Sweepers are handy for quick vacuuming, nothing heavy duty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Picks up very little...","review":"The Swivel Sweeper I purchased only picks up very small things and often will pick things up and spit them back out.

I showed it to friends who went out and purchased it too. Now...it does not work. The retail store has stopped carrying the product (good for them) and the company that makes it requires you to pay shipping costs both ways to fulfill the warranty...essentially repeating the cost of the bad purchase you've already made. Maybe I recharged the battery too long; realistically, who has patience to monitor recharge times. If you want something that will last more than four months, don't buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved at first-didn't last long.","review":"I loved my mother's sweeper so much I bought my mother-in-law and myself one. I just loved the product for quick messes with four children. Needless to say, good things don't last long. Within 6 months, all three sweepers no longer work. I could say that maybe I used it too much (once to twice a week) but I know the other two were not heavily used. I loved the product but the price is too high for the short life."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Cheap Imitation","review":"This swivel sweeper was advertised \\"As Seen on TV\\". It is a very shoddy imitation. It is very noisy compared to the real one. It doesn't empty like the real one. AND it is not as sturdy as the one I had purchased two years ago. I used it once and threw it away. I should have saved the packaging and returned it, but I had already disposed of the packaging by the time I had charged the battery. It also took the seller about 12 days to get it in the mail according to the post mark. I live in HI so it was a long time coming. I would recommend everyone to stay away from this seller and his product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Money thrown away!!!!","review":"VERY SIMPLE REVIEW: This does not pick up anything from carpet.

Loved it and used it alomost every day until it no longer would hold a charge. She had been looking for a new one for several months so I purchased this one as a Xmas gift. TERRIBLE QUALITY. The new one has about half of the bristles of the old one and sounds like a \\"stone crusher\\" it's so loud. Does not pick up nearly a quarter of dust/debris as the original. I don't know who made the decision in the company to \\"improve\\" this, but plesae go back to the old formula."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this little Sweeper","review":"Being disabled and not so young anymore it's so much easier to use than a broom in the kitchen and bath.And does pick up rather well on carpeting in other rooms. I use it every day and now only have to drag out my big vacuum cleaner about once a week. And around my computer desk which is also carpeted it works great! I bought mine from the infomercial on TV, getting 2. And now plan yo get 2 more to keep in other rooms of the house always ready and waiting to go. But think I'll get the new ones from Amazon. Saving nyself a couple bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product, picks up everything !","review":"I have had the Swivel Sweeper for several months now and use it practically everyday to clean up my hardwood kitchen floor after the kids. It works like a charm, it picks up crumbs, cat hair, little pieces of paper, cheerios, dust, you name it. I was skeptical at first from reading these reviews, but i tried it for myself and it really does a great job! It beats having to take out the big vacuum or the broom and dustpan. The only complaint I have, which is minor, is that the outside of the sweeper gets super dusty, but it you take a wet cloth it cleans right up. The dustpan is easy to take on and off and the battery holds a charge no problem, just be sure to charget it overnight.I defintely recommend this product to anyone who has small kids and is constantly cleaning their kitchen floor! I would say it works better on hard floors than on carpet, but still worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What You'd Expect","review":"This sweeper can only pick up a little bit of dust and dirt at a time. The area containing the dirt is no bigger than a deck of cards. That means that if you have pet hair, you can only make a swipe or two before it is full and you need to empty it.It may just be me, but I expected this to have some suction or something. It does not. The battery powers the brushes and that is all.I didn't feel that it picked up well and I was just using it to run over our hard wood floors each night.I ended up returning the item. I thought it was junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery is horrible!","review":"I was so excited to have a swivel sweeper. I watched the infomercial at least 100 times before I broke down and bought one at Smiths Marketplace. I charged the battery as directed. It only worked for maybe a minute the first time, and about 30 seconds every time there after. I called the customer service line, and they told me to take it back to the store. I did so, and charged the battery again, thinking I had a defective one. It only lasts for maybe 30 seconds if I am lucky. I guess I am lucky in that I only have it to vacuum my small bathroom floor, so 30 seconds is enough. It's sad, because when it does turn on and work, it works well."},{"rating":"1","title":"It does not live up to its name.","review":"I have purchased five of these same sweepers and I loved them, but the one I purchased on Amazon is almost worthless. I am thinking they are now cutting costs and making them in a cheaper way. The power is very low, maybe they changed the wattage. Does not work well at all. So disappointed because I loved these sweepers prior to buying this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Things I miss about the old","review":"Two things I didn't like about the changes made to the swivel sweeper, it no longer has the magnet to hold the base flat to the handle and the dirt tray is not attached to the sweeper. Everything else is great.sweeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Just what the title says. Don't waste your money.I bought the buy one get one free on the website. One doesn't work and it's not the battery. I gave my neighbors the one that works and they ended up giving it back to me since mine didn't. They said it doesn't do anything anyway. It's true. It does nothing but make noise, it doesn't pick anything up. Some people say it's basically an electric dust pan. Perhaps I'll try using it on that. I was hoping for something that would make vacuuming up the steps easier. Nope! 70 bucks down the drain. I never return anything, but I will write a review so no one makes the same mistake. You thinking of buying one? You can have mine for free. I don't even want to see them anymore. Oh, what a waste!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Paid for new, got used.","review":"The sweeper works but I paid the 29.99 for a new unit and what I got was a used unit that someone had made a poor attempt at cleaning.

Horrible product!!","review":"I see many have already stated the obvious. This thing is trash. It worked for 20 good minutes the first time I used it.

Don't waste your money on this piece of crap!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good sweeper","review":"Sweeper works pretty well. Sometimes I have to sweep from left to right instead of forward and backward to pick something up, but it usually gets it. I'm amazed at all the dust bunnies it gets!

It's not like a heavy vacuum, but I didn't expect it to be. As for the battery, I've had one for four or five months and have only had to recharge the battery once. I just gave one to my daughter for her dorm room. She couldn't use a vacuum because she's physically handicapped-they're just too heavy. She loves it. As for the price and shipping, I bought mine at Bed Bath & Beyond for about $30, with no shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible...","review":"This item is flimsy and close to nonfunctional. During its first use in what was supposed to be a quick 5-minute bathroom and kitchen pickup, the sweeper stopped working five times for unknown reasons, making it necessary to take it apart and restart each time. I will try to return it. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I bought this sweeper about a year ago. At the beginning I was very pleased with it. I bought it for those quick pick-ups in the bathroom and kitchen, so I wasn't expecting it to work like a big vaccuum cleaner. Worked great. After using it maybe 4 or 5 times, I noticed that the battery would not hold a charge for very long. Now it won't hold a charge at all. I charged it according to the instructions and never over-charged it. I wrote the company twice and to date have not received any reply and that has been 2 months ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best thing ever","review":"I have a small apt. and two cats... This machine works great; it gets just about all the cat hair off the tiled kitchen floor, and all the cat litter! It does pick up most stuff off the carpet, but it can't replace a vacuum. Bottom line, if you hate sweeping then this is the machine for you. It does a better job then I can with a broom, but takes half the time. It's light and easy to maneuver around furniture, and even gets under the kitchen table with out me having to move all the chairs. It has made sweeping the kitchen floor a tortured job of the past. Do be cautious though, their are specific directions for recharging the batter pack. If you over charge the battery, it shortens the battery life, so you can't just leave the thing on the charger when you're not using it. All in all a great buy and worth every cent."},{"rating":"1","title":"very light but very flimsy","review":"I have had my sweeper for several months and found it to be handy for cleaning up bird seed around my parrot cages.

Company doesn't stand behind their product!","review":"This could be a wonderful product but the rechargable battery is a very big problem. Like so many others who have written reviews, I have had problems with the battery not holding a charge in a sweeper that is less than six months old. Calling the company does absolutely no good so don't even bother.Both the rep and her supervisor told me that because they are not the manufacturer,they cannot offer any guarantee at all for the battery - BUT that they will replace it,if I pay for it. In other words, I have to buy a new one!! This is definitely a fly-by-night outfit so save your money by not buying a product that the company won't even stand behind."},{"rating":"1","title":"worked for a while, then ended up in the trash","review":"it worked great for a while for crumbs, but never good for hair as it would tangle in the brissles, then I would spend 10 minutes detangling...but it did its job for the most part til the battery stopped recharging, which really only lasted maybe 6 months or less....so I knew it was not worth buying a new battery so the whole thing ended up in the trash. I would rather pay more for better quality and not fill the landfills with more stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this!!! IT'S TERRIBLE.","review":"The trackball in this thing is only 200 DPI. and it's a pain to browse windows with it. And the keyboard requires line of sight to the receiver. I mean it has to face the receiver straight on or it won't work ughhh. And the receiver has the activity light on even when i'm not even touching the keyboard or trackball. I think that's eating up the battery. Battery life is horrible. After 3 months of use, i have to struggle to move the cursor with the trackball. It's worn down even though i rarely used it because it's a pain. It's expensive too. I got fed up with it and threw it on the ground.

The notes are somewhat condescending. The major problem is with the selection of secondary and supportive literature. I bought this, expecting to read essays on Melville by Thomas Mann, Hannah Arendt, Robert Lowell, Camus, et al. What I found was one page selections from these authors (in the case of Mann, just a few sentences saying he wished he had written as well as Melville - how is that informative or valuable in any way?). Sorry to have to say it, but the editor, Cornell professor or not, is an idiot, apparently. Will try to return this and get the Library of America edition which at least gives you more Melville for your buck."},{"rating":"1","title":"borrring","review":"this book was extremely boring. Good story line though. Maybe Melville should have stopped after his bad review of M.D.Billy Budd has many symbolic meanings but just never could keep my interest.

For a romance it didn't really get to me on an emotional level all that often, but I have to admit that despite all of the years I've been a romance novel addict, I've never read one quite like this one. Ryan gets bonus points for originality and chosing to take her plot down roads less travelled. It wasn't emotionally gripping for me, but I was impressed by the writer's ingenuity.Still I have to confess I found Ryan's Secret Thunder more emotionally satisgying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully different and absorbing.","review":"I like it that this isn't another wimpy romance story. Both Martine and Thorne had to face several challenges which made them stronger and better people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best","review":"Though I read other books from this author, and loved them, I found this one to be very long and drawn out. The characters did not draw me in. I felt I could have fallen for Thorn if he would have just been a little more aggressive with his feelings. It was just too long. I was not fond of Martine at all. The story needed more heat between them. Hopefully the sequel will be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Insight into Firefighting","review":"Loved the Firefighting series. I was drawn in.

You basically get 2 hours of pure Dave, which is always great. However, when I first heard of the release of a live cd way back when, I was hoping for an Everyday live. Instead, just think a blend of Red Rocks, with the adlibs of Listener Supported with electric guitar instead of piano breakdowns. Once again, the music is nothing less than impressive, but don't expect anything you haven't already heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice work","review":"Hot show. Performance warrants 5 starts, but song selectiondoes not. Guest artists are great, great, and, uh, great.Sound is even greater."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many songs that I have heard before!","review":"Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge Dave Matthews Band fan, it is just that I am getting the feeling that I have heard these songs played over and over on each CD. There are probably 20 songs that have been repeatedly put on CDs. There are a few riffs and adlibs that are different on each CD but I feel as though there arent enough songs of the group to be putting out another live CD. They truly have a lot of songs that would be nice to have on a live CD, like: I'll Back you up, Song that Jane Likes, Spoon, Crush, Dreaming Tree, Pay for What You Get, Let You Down. It does make sense because the fact that these songs are not played much at concerts, but the material being put on these CDs do not have that new feeling when you hear them anymore. This CD did really nothing new for me, with the exception the Maker, all are on other live CDs, Red Rocks was awesome, would recomend that for anyone over this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid CD from Dave Matthews Band","review":"Overall, Live in Chicago was a awesome CD. The Last Stop, What Would You Say, Rapunzel, The Maker, Jimi Thing, So Much to Say, and Watchtower really make the CD. The solos are totally worth the money. All I ask is that the next live CD has some Lillywhite songs, which is a great CD, and some Everyday songs. The same songs seem to be appearing on their live albums. It's time for a change. But overall, it definitly appeases me after the Everyday album...Glen Ballard should go back to his stupid pop groups. Keep the Dave Matthews Band jamming and making sweet music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but......","review":"The album is good. I am a big Dave Matthews fan but some things were definitely missing in this album. The Lovely Ladies' abscence on Stay made the song lose some of its electricity. Watchtower was kind of drawn out with no real energy in it. So Much into Too Much was awesome and so was Lie in Our Graves, my favorite song. I would have to say that this album is a little subpar as compared to Listener Supported or the best album ever, Live @ Red Rocks. It's still really awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great... but I've heard it!","review":"As with all Dave Matthews Band material, this is nothing less than amazing. Great music, well put together, just all together an excelent CD. The only problem is that there isn't really anything new. The Maker is the only song that has not been previously released on CD.Although there is a great version of Jimi Thing and So Much to Say, the rest of the 2 disk set is pretty much more of the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Live One","review":"Well, another live album very similar to Listener Supported. A few of the treats include The Maker, Christmas song, and Tim Reynolds on the electric guitar. The songs jam out for quite a while, but do it nicely. While its no Red Rocks, at least it was before he let his marketers sell him out with Everyday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dave Returns to his Roots","review":"For too long Dave Matthews has gotten away from his \\"Jam Band\\" roots. That is a shame because Dave and the boys are one of the best around today. If you were dissapointed by \\"Everyday\\" and \\"Live at Red Rocks\\" and you want a return to the days of extend jams and a wide mix of musical styles this album is for you. It is a good mix of old favorites and new soon-to-be classics. The most important thing about this album is that he gets away from the 3-4 minute pop songs that his new album and to a good extents his recent concerts are all about. In this album you will get to hear Dave do what he does best, jam and get the audience going. I would recommend this album to anyone that is a fan of Dave Matthews live shows, it really captures the band in their essence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over and Over again","review":"For anyone who calls Dmb a jam band well you are wrong. Over the summer i started trading and i stopped after about 2 months because the band seems to like playing the same old jams over and over again. I mean its not even funny anymore there is no variation or anything. I have to say that I do not lke this cd at all the songs are a ll standard DMB songs. They are all played out to the same tune that they always have been. THe best part of this cd is listening to victor Wooten of the Fleckotnes, this guy is amazing. If u want Jam i suggest u pick up the flecktones cd Live Art it is the best cd I own period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dave's done it again","review":"Another live album??? As much as I love DMB, I thought that you could only put out so many live albums/videos/dvd's before it all becomes the same.This is not true. Once again, Dave and the band show us that no matter how many times you've heard his songs, you haven't heard it. Every song pumps the energy that we have become accustomed to, and you still want to ask for more.I'd rate this against his other albums, but that's just not fair. They're all #1.Now maybe we can talk him into putting out an album in 5.1 surround?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure sound from the best Live act!!","review":"DMB isn't DMB unless they are live and doin what they love. Expanding every song into thier own mix, blending transitions from one to another effortlessly. They are just too good. This cd was mixed perfectly, they made sure Dave's guitars, Boyd's fiddle, Carter's kit, Leroi's Brass', Stefan's bass all sound loud and clear. The set list is a good one with them playing alot of popular hits and ending with thier trademark rendition of \\"All along the Watchtower.\\" But the best part about the double disc is you get your money's worth with over two hours of music. And do forget it was recorded here in Chitown."},{"rating":"2","title":"great concert album","review":"Having grown up in the 60's and 70's I have seen and heard some of the great concert bands. Too much of what I hear today that is popular and called cutting edge is boring and bland. For a long time I resisted liking the DMB. But, after hearing this cd, I was won over. A good mix of jamming, rock and jazz. DMB is original and a cut way above most of the other stuff out there today. This cd is fun to listen to. The musicianship is great and Matthews voice is an instrament itself.I also liked \\"Remember Two Things\\" very much as well.Who knows, maybe next I'll go out and see these guys live myself. Couldn't hurt, might even have fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't blast them for jammin'...","review":"Although I must say that this live CD is not their best, it is so much better than anything on Everyday. DMB is well-known for their long jams during their live shows. An earlier reviewer said he thought the songs were altogether too long but I must disagree. The songs are the perfect length to get the effect of what a DMB concert is all about. At least they aren't overproduced \\"pop songs\\" like on Everyday. I think this DMB CD is a good one to have. Not great by any means, but any true fan of the band will know that this lives up to the DMB's lofty expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad news","review":"I just don't see why people think that a band playing a set chord structure repeatedly for 10 minutes, while members swith off soloing is a \\"jam.\\" A real jam is playing whatever comes to mind at any given time. DMB needs to stick to the songs, and not pretend to be the Dead, who actually did jam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good and Bad news","review":"Good news -- This TV is very reasonably priced for the size.

Cute idea, beyond terrible quality and I don't know what type of paint these use (they're made in China and this was a dirt cheap set, so it's sketchy at best) but I'm willing to bet if a child mouths these toys they're getting a mouthful of paint instantly.

There's lots of folkie stuff, both traditional and singer-songwriter-y, more flowery world music crossover material, and a bit of pop kitsch and jazz. Lots of what I would characterize as cabaret singing, often with interesting stylistic twists (such as the country touch on the second track, by the group Nol') There is precious little rock or electronica on here, however, which is a little odd, since I've heard that both styles are really big in Russia... But since Russian techno probably isn't the best music in the world, perhaps we should be thankful... At any rate, this is a good sampler of what them Russkies have to offer music-wise, and it's pretty easy on the ears.

Electronic music, however, is like horror movies - you have to weed through quite a few to find the winners. In my opinion Diroama is the real deal. Very catchy rhythms and melodies, electro hooks, and soulful brooding vocals. This is the first album of theirs which I have spent time with. I am about to purchase their latest. From the clips, it also sounds like a winner. They are German, but not to worry, most of the lyrics are in english. These imports are expensive so I purchased mine on ebay.

It made me realize all the things that were lacking in my relationship and only affirmed that moving on was the right decision for me. What was great about this book was that the author wasn't rooting for failed relationships but rather helping the reader understand whether the relationship was really worth the fight.

Ultra-cute fetish model Paige Richards does a respectable job as Bettie Page. Normally, I would relegate a disc like this to die-hard Bettie fans only, but in today's \\"retro-craze\\" atmosphere, others may find it appealing as well.

An invalid would have led a more exciting life. Strangely enough there is no mention of TV, cars, movies; her love life is apparently sexless, and one wonders why she does not just join a nunnery rather than waltz the streets like a phantom. At the very least there will be troupes of interesting celibates for company. Enough, Ms Brookner; either change your style or characters in your novels.

The scenic backgrounds are made of cheap paper that goes on the inside! of the small tank, so when they sit inside liquid for a few hours, they eventually peel off. There's no top for the plastic tank, so it's an open container very prone to spillage. You grow the rocks inside a chemical solution, which gets very cloudy and must be drained out and replaced with tapwater (and you need to do this a few times to get the tank clear). Trouble is, when you tip the tank to drain out the liquid, many of the little stalagmites you just grew BREAK. Those that don't break fade in color within a day or two.

By the time we were finished our set was just a messy glob of the magic rocks with only one or two nice rocks that happened to survive.I'm not sure, maybe we put too many rocks in the dish. ???

I was really hoping for more of that style with this album.Unfortunately for my taste, this album was surprisingly more sombre, however: minor keys, really sleeping selections. Perhaps the choices on the album are pieces written specifically for mandolin and meant to showcase their musical talent on a level that their peers and true afficiandos will appreciate?

The passionate and overwhelming love Jenny and Will had for each other will probably make many readers recall their first loves in painful, glorious detail. An interesting touch was that the narrative began in first person, and later, smoothly switched to third, without missing a beat. This would be a great book for anyone who was adopted or has adopted a child. It gives a realistic look at the other side of the story.

I liked the \\"evil\\" mother plotline, and wanted to know more about Jenny's life in New York. I found the character of Claudia to be boring and way too much time was spent on her wishy washy \\"Should I find my parents or not\\" part of the story.

I have my doubts that an ex-con with five ex-wives was the best choice for a husband and means a happy ending.I grew up in Kansas City about the same time the author did.

Perhaps it takes a certain amount and kind of understanding to do a good translating, or perhaps it takes knowledge and literary-language skill, or perhaps it takes all of these. There have always been vast problems choosing with translation to get in Middle Eastern and Far Eastern studies; my experience with Far Eastern studies/translations is that the translator really has to be humble and present with the original poet. In this case, the translator must let Rumi speak, and Arberry does that better than many other common translators."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible-don't go near this DVD!!","review":"I bought this DVD to add to my belly dance video collection.

If I just pinch the dogs coat and pull, I get a lot more undercoat.As far as the build quality goes, however, it is clearly a well made rake...a big surprise for the price. That is the only thing that keeps this review from being 1 star. Even if it didn't do the job for me, the build quality is quite good and worth a star in itself, even though it didn't work one bit for my dog.This might be a good rake for some breeds, but it's a waste of money on a Shiba Inu."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I am very impressed with this dog brush.

This one reads fast, is packed with wit, dry humor, delightful twists, some risque' developments and delivers a delightfully choreographed Agatha Christie kind of ending.There's a self confidence to Larry Karp's prose and his dialogue crackles with a brightness that's refreshing, funny and clear.If you like who-done-it mysteries you'll want to get a copy of this delightful book right away.Christopher J.

It was frustrating when my friends/family just didn't understand how it was that I simply \\"couldn't put my daughter down\\" until she was about 7 months old... how it was possible that she didn't like to be touched, but had to be held all the time... how she simply didn't nap... I was told that I was only making it worse by indulging her (\\"let her cry a bit!\\", \\"teach her to be patient!\\", etc.) Well, when I read this book, I felt an enormous sense of relief that my baby wasn't the only one like this. I was also thrilled to learn about concrete ways to care for my not-so-ordinary baby. We have ended up with a happier child and happier mom, too!

I kept wondering what I was doing wrong to make him so cranky all the time. After I bought the Searses book, I felt so much better. It describes all sorts of personality traits common to high need babies, but instead of making them seem like a curse, the authors show how these traits are beneficial for the child now and later in life. If you are at your wits end because you feel like you can never put your baby down without him/her crying or that your baby wants to nurse all the time-get this book. You will feel so much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for ALL parents, not just high needs","review":"This was the only book I found that had information about the hidden causes of fussiness (in our case it was a food sensitivity!).

I had a baby with colic, and I found that the ideology in this book that you, as the mother, have to do everything possible to stop your baby from crying increased my stress and made me feel worse. After my experience with a colicky baby, I believe that babies sometimes do cry for \\"no reason,\\" or at least not one that we as adults can always discern with our current knowledge.

So many people (our pediatrician included) told me to just feed on demand, wear him in the sling, and buy this book. I cried when I read this book. It condemned me to a life of misery when I hadn't given up on figuring out why my son was crying. It turns out he has a dairy allergy. If I had followed the advice of this book, I never would have figured it out and he would have gone on for weeks or months in pain. I knew his cries weren't right and did my own research to discover what was wrong. I eliminated dairy from my diet and he was a NEW baby. The crying stopped immediately. We went on to put him on a routine which allowed him to develop healthy sleeping habits which allowed me some freedom and saved sanity.

I don't think it is a good practice for someone to give advice in areas where he or she is not an expert.Much of the wisdom in this book comes from experience dealing with 1 child in 1 environment.

Save yourself a lot of money, go to your public library, browse through one of his books and decide for yourself. Don't even bother if you are not breastfeeding or are going back to work after having the baby (This book will make you feel guilty!).Instead read \\"Your fussy baby\\" by Dr Weissbluth.

In fact, they prove that difficult children can provide the most rewarding parenting experiences of all.When reading this book, you will need to recognize that not all children are alike, and that you cannot take \\"carte blanche,\\" the advice these folks give, because each child develops differently.

I can't believe how horrible this looks for EA.First, the RUSHING error. You gain what looks to be 6-8 yards on a rushing play. The game will then say that you only gained a yard (and sometimes say you lost yardage)! This is terrible. It completely makes running the ball obsolete.Next, when you finish your first season in dynasty mode, you have to complete some \\"Off Season\\" tasks.

I'm a big fan of college football and the NCAA Football franchise. However, there is a serious bug in the game that I cannot believe was overlooked by EA. In short, the computer subtracts about 5-6 yards from the end of every run.For instance, I was playing against the computer and faced a 3rd and 2. I ran the ball up the middle and picked up about 8 yards. Or so I thought. Instead of showing a first down, it showed 4th and inches! Huh! And this was not an isolated incident. About every other rush this happened.I sincerely hope EA fixes this error and replaces all the copies containing this bug (like they did with the Madden 06 bug). If this does not sound like a big issue to you or you never rush the ball anyway, then get the game. With the exception of this bug the game is great.

It chronicles a memorable political campaign by a candidate who runs for office because he needs the money, and whose hysterical campaign slogans include \\"Spread Fred\\" and \\"don't ask why Fred Tuttle, ask why not?\\" One of the best, and certainly most enjoyable, political spoofs I've seen, and which launched its one-of-a-kind star, Fred Tuttle, a homegrown Vermonter, into a real life campaign for political office."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical Politics in Vermont","review":"No film better conveys the \\"Silent Cal\\" humor of the passing rural scene in Vermont than this whimsical comedy.

The sheath may rate better than the knife, it is perfect, top quality and was made in England. The knife is a Solingen product, unlike several Bokers which are now made in China, and I don't buy junk from China.I gave it four stars and here's why it didn't get five: the hilt was slightly bent, the wood grip shows some sanding marks, not what I expected from a $250. knife.I'll never use this knife. It's a wall hanger to be admired and to remind me of my grandfather, the man who started my hobby of knife collecting.PS I did fix the bent hilt and sanded the wood handle smooth, so now it gets a 4.5 rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on Bergman","review":"After reading so much about Ingmar Bergman as a director, I was excited to view \\"Shame\\" for a film class. However, I was to be disappointed with Bergman's war movie. The characters are irritating at best, the plot slow and random. I could not find a coherent plot throughout the entire movie, and at times I wanted to slap Jan the husband for not being more assertive with his wife.

And the final scene is easily the bleakest close to a movie that I have ever experienced.Watch it with those you love- hold them close- do not dare to let them go."},{"rating":"2","title":"An unforgettable film","review":"This is one of the bleakest, the most harrowing of Bergman's films I've seen. I also think this is one of the most powerful films about the ugliness of war and what it does to the human souls.The couple of musicians, who left a big city for a remote island and make a living as farmers, find themselves capable of unspeakable and shameful acts that would have ordinarily been impossible for them even imagine, as they struggle to survive horrible reality of war. They betray their souls, their friends and even each other in a desperate attempt to simply survive another day. Liv Ullmann and Max Von Sydow are brilliant as usual as lost, confused, and terrified couple that got caught in the midst of a civil war.Shame is an excellent film but also the one which is almost impossible to sit through - that's how bleak, pessimistic, and hopeless it is.4.5/5"},{"rating":"1","title":"lyme disease book sexist","review":"I have had Lyme for over thirty years and I am considered uncurable,so I looked forward to reading this book.

On the other hand, the second lead, played by Rose Byrne, is pretty bad. Not really the actress's fault -- she's just really miscast: a hard-nosed young lawyer type she is NOT. The storyline and continuity are poor: the changing back and forth from present to past is poorly done, and left me unable to track the progression of the plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"stupid, packed with clich��s","review":"It's quite offputting to realise most amazon customers who reviewed this show think it is good. Says a lot about how much the average brain is not only getting faster, it's getting stupider. This series is boring, formulaic, implausible. You have to assume every character in it is a nimrod, otherwise it makes no sense. To call it \\"Sopranos for lawyers\\" is tantamount to equating salinger and danielle steele because they both wrote about death. The Sopranos is a masterpiece, it has substance all along. Damages is plain silly. A more apt comparison is Dinasty or Dallas (with good actors), though I'd suspect characters in Dallas and Dinasty were more consistent and reasonable. And probably less empty.[...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why spend time with such people?","review":"I gave up half-way into the second episode. Watching just made me feel dirty.

If you are expecting a legal, procedural drama (like Canterbury's Law, for example), this is not it. This is a soap opera. I stopped watching toward the end of season 1: the plot unfolds a little in each episode, but there is really nothing to stretch out for so many episodes, and the script is just a long series of short sentences. There are only a few scenes of human interactions and emotions, but mostly the characters simply \\"walk-through\\" this drama (like zombies), deadpanning their lines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Show","review":"This is one of the best shows i've watched in a long time, it's absolutely riveting, and i can't ever take my eyes off the screen. an excellent addition to any collection"},{"rating":"2","title":"the most riveting show on television","review":"I started watching Damages when it aired on tv, but I tuned out because I knew watching the episodes a week apart I was missing subtleties. I started again when it came out on dvd, and I'm so glad I watched it this way. The show is the smartest and most riveting show on television. Every frame, every line, and every scene matters. Every character will surprise you. It's visually stunning. A word of warning: you won't want to stop watching, so wait until you have a weekend to devote to this fantastic show."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST PILOT","review":"DAMAGES has the best pilot I've ever seen in a drama show. It is very subtle and violent at the same time and leaves us wondering what that would lead to. I watched it and couldn't stop. The series, in general, is very good. The acting is magnificent. It's always a pleasure to see the many real faces of Glenn Close, her speech, and try to guess her caracter. However, I hope - I only watch this movies on DVD - that DAMAGES doesn't turn Glenn Close into that very pure-evil one-dimension woman that we've seen in Fatal Attraction. If that happens, the show would become, for me, just another kind of Mexican soap opera, and I'll loose the interest in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome mystery series","review":"this is a great series that I wish could go on and on.

Now!","review":"I don't recall the last time I waited with such impatience for the next episode to air. The cinematography is dazzling -- who knew that Mario Van Pebbles (who makes a cameo appearance) was such an excellent director! Something interesting to note about the timeline sequences. When the show switches between past and present, the quality and color changes -- clear and high-quality for the past and somewhat grainy and green-tinted for the present (Think of the Matrix where real-life was shown with a bluish tint and time in the Matrix was green.) You'll notice when the two timelines finally merge - a very effective and interesting way to tell the story. I can't wait for Season Two!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait for Season 2","review":"The first time I saw this show, I could not wait for the next episode. I watched it when it first aired on F/X, and I really enjoy watching the DVD to catch little things that I never noticed before.Even if the plot was horrible (which it SO is not), the way this show is filmed will keep you hooked. It is so cleverly shot that you are always trying to figure out what the scene means. Some of the scenes are shot out of sequence but have significant meanings in other episodes. This is why the DVD is a great way to watch the show...you can cheat a little bit.When you watch this DVD, you will be craving for the second season. Glenn Close, Tate Donovan and Ted Danson are brilliant, and I love Rose Byrne, who plays one of the main and most important characters on the show.Highly recommended!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart show with characters that engage.","review":"This is a great show that loves to twist the story as much as the writers' minds will allow them. The first season sets up a landscape for the viewer to watch the characters' lives untangle piece-by-piece each in somewhat predictable but entertaining ways.All in all, good writing, production, stories, cast and (what it seemed like) crew to pull off a great show for five seasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and Intelligent","review":"I agree with the viewer who said watching the show is like reading a very good book. It's so much more complex than the average TV show, with the depth of character development you usually only find in books. I really can't understand the few negative reviews here, except that I guess there's no way to please everyone and some people are never pleased. But I have been watching the show on DVD, and from my viewpoint, the DVDs were money very well spent. This is the kind of show I will probably watch more than once--it's that good. Very well written and acted. Love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"forensic buff","review":"I give it 5 stars only for the acting. I watched a couple of the series but the is bruttle.

They are all supposed to be these brilliant minds, yet there is NO brilliance! The incredibly naive main character is supposed to have this fantasic legal mind, but she seems to have trouble figuring out whats for lunch; no way she could make it out of law school. The attorneys from Law and Order are more interesting.Most annoying the obvious manipulation is really over the top; its like watching with a bunch of 6th grade girls.

This is not your typical show that spoon feeds you everything and you need to see all the episodes to keep up, but oh is it a delicious ride. The acting is superb, the writing is outstanding, and even though they've been given two more seasons, there is a very satisfying conclusion to this first season. It is definitely full of twists and turns and red herrings, but that's sort of the point of the show. If it were cookie cutter and easy to follow, it'd be Law and Order.I highly recommend this show. Maybe it's not for everyone, but if you like a meaty show with substance, maybe it's for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really liked it","review":"attention holding drama that combines mystery and romantic story lines.

The one thought that kept returning as the episodes plodded along was that this series must have been written by edgy romance novelists.It's a shame that Glenn Close's impressive abilities are wasted.Perhaps the most annoying element was how the big mystery to the season was constantly referred to. By the sixth episode I really didn't care anymore. By then all interest in the show was gone for me. I assumed that the big secret would be as annoying as the rest of the show."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of top 5 suspense TV shows of all time","review":"I can't say enough about Damages.

Artists such as Charlie Hunter have great technical expertise, but lack the raw emotional power that greats like Coltrane, Davis, Mingus, and Luther Thomas had in the sixties and seventies (and that chicago underground, william parker, and david s. ware have today).

This is raw, hard music, and the live, one-step-back sound only adds to the stagey energy of these spontainious sheets of funk.

I'm giving it 4 stars because the bit gets into the iron-on edge strip a little bit, but nothing that the planned sanding won't clear up.The photo is misleading - it's not the same bit.

It is easy to use, very powerful, has nice onboard accessories and is so much better than a broom or dry mop. Goes under the bed and furniture easily. I've also used it on area rugs, which is nice. It has adjustable suction to enable this. I've used it on the carpeted stairs, and while it's only OK for them, it's better than bringing out a second carpet vacuum with the rotating brushes.

The new unit works very well and we look forward to having it as long as the previous unit.

The power cord is long enough so I don't have to be messing with the cord. It isn't good for the carpet but I didn't get it for that ( except maybe the stairs which is great because of it's light weight ).This is well worth it's price.

The unit and accessories appear as described, and it sounds strong and has good suction from the open pipe.Except, not. My house has bare floors and large (9x12) wool or cotton rugs, and 3 cats. After going over the kitchen, I turned around and saw the same onion skin and pet hair just mocking me. Then I spent 20 minutes on the living room rug, and afterwards it looked like only I'd crawled around picking lint by hand. Other gripes: the flexible hose kinks flat/closed (doesn't self correct), the floor tool clogs about every 90 seconds in both brush positions (and must be cleared WITH FINGERS, the debris doesn't suck off by the pipe alone).I don't have the heart to go in to more detail.

My love for the strong suction is completely overshadowed by the fact that it clogs every 5 seconds, which results in a loss of suction and a 10 minute disassembling nightmare to get it unclogged, also leaving anything I might have vacuumed up back on the floor.

The 3670G comes with tools which are inadequate for the job, perhaps in the hope that the purchaser will buy the optional parts for additional money.

I am a very fussy housekeeper -- we do not wear shoes in the house so the dirt on the vacuum was not from my floors. I periodically washed the vacuum off and always had the residue.

The body is cheap plastic. The unit is difficult to manuever, the cord is too short and the cord is a pain to wind and unwind.I have a big dog, 2 cats, a baby, hardwood floors and 2 area rugs in a 800 Sq foot house and this vacuum just doesn't function well for my needs.Just don't buy it.

The Mighty Mite does work wonderfully on wood floors and couches... this thing will NOT do carpets to save its life. Its a no frills connection, nothing to clip in place and nothing for the kids to break... I vacuumed under our couch and had to reconnect the floor brush three times.This is light weight going up and down the stairs but the plug is so short, you have to unplug/replug on a standard stair case.The attachments stay securely on the vacuum and the hose is adequately long enough to do ceilings and walls.Very basic vacuum but it does a good job.UPDATE-The vacuum DIED on Day three.

The wheels on the part that is the floor/carpet attachment are such poor quality they leave marks on my hardwood. I often have to run over a scrap of paper 2-3 times before it is suctioned in.I got this because hey, $60 is a bargain. But a vacuum is something you need to maintain a clean environment, and that is something I value more than my roommate at least.

I use it on both carpeted and bare floors (tile, hardwood, and laminate). I could do without my Oreck and WindTunnel, but would be lost without my Mighty Mite.It is very reasonably priced. Replacement bags can end up being a bit costly over time, but I contribute that to the fact that I use the vacuum extensively.

Not a fan of bagless vacs; so, for me the added cost of bags are well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome vacuum!","review":"I purchased this after reading the reviews and boy am I happy!!!I was using a shop vac before and it was so cumbersome.

The suction is very poor because of horribly-made hose and plastic tube. The power of the motor is about 1300 Watts, but I very seriously doubt that even half of that power works to clean dirt. Air leaks are really bad: hose to canister connection, hose to tube connection, tube interconnection, tube to brush connection. Tubes are made of cheap plastic and are wobbling all the time no matter how hard I'm trying to push one into another (and I'm a strong guy BTW).This vacuum cleaner is unable to pick crumbles and hairs from the crevices in a carpet.

Thus, for $67 --- this thing is a bargain compared to other vacuums out there.The light weight is an additional positive for this little guy.

It uses bags, but that is a good feature for us as we like bags when pulling up dust and dust mites (the bags are cheap as I just bought 24 for $12). I do not recommend this vacuum for carpets in general because the large attachment you see in the photo is not a brush attachment (it does come with a smaller brush attachment for drapes and hard to reach spots). But for sucking up loose junk on tile and in between tiles it is great. It is also great for cleaning drapes (floor to ceiling) and hard to reach spots because of the long wand extensions. Would buy again if needed. 4 stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor suction and flimsy plastic material","review":"I'm very disappointed by the Eureka 12 Amps Boss Mighty Mite Canister Vacuum Cleaner and don't understand why it gets these high ratings on here. When I bought this I knew it was not going to be the best vacuum cleaner because of the price, but the suction is so poor it is just worthless. It leaves most dirt behind because of its poor suction. The straight wand and floor nozzle are made of a very flimsy and light plastic material that make using it a real challenge. The floor nozzle has tiny plastic wheels that don't roll well on carpet. I've always had canister vacuum cleaners with metal wands and more substantial nozzles before this and I just don't understand why this company decided to make it plastic.

The chapter on Duchamp asks the question Duchamp himself asked,Can one make works which are not works of art?\\" and shows what that means in terms of avant-garde aesthetic. The last chapter is dismissive (but not excessively so) of some mainstream Americanand then makes a strong case for the terrific innovations of four exemplary poets: Susan Howe, CharlesBernstein, Steve McCaffery, and Lyn Hejinian. Even if you don't agree with Perloff's overall thesis,you'll love the details and extremely lucid readings. best of all, it's ENJOYABLE."},{"rating":"1","title":"21st, I mean 15th c.....","review":"wake me up is this 1975? more predictalbe veiled (new criticism) from the gran dame of poetic bootlicking-avant eliot? ha-typifies the problem with literary scholarship-stiff, predictable,revisionary. how many books can one write about privledged (safe) poetic experimentation-if you can even call it that. and dont get me started about Perloff's readings of recent works-(goldsmith's-the weather)Marjorie, I think it's time to retire, or have you already?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this one.","review":"Ridiculous plot with many holes.

The scenes in the beginning in the hospital are quite chilling and original. However, the ending was very predictable and felt quite rushed. With obvious inspiration from The Silence of the Lambs, there really isn't anything new here. It's a fun, quick read, but if you want a truly chilling and intelligent read, check out thriller writer Kevin O'Brien. His work has much more research behind it and more believable on all accounts.

She believes she shares past lives with Trey and sets out to fulfill their destiny and will destroy anyone who gets in her way.

Look no further. This soundtrack combines all the elements that made the late 60s so much fun: Fuzz Guitar, Hammond B3 organ, wordless vocals, jazzy brass, funky jazz grooves, and the famous Mah Na' song in two different versions. The movie is a documentary and, if it is like the soundtrack, must be one wild trip. The recording has a real breath to it...it doesn't sound dated at all. Fidelity is excellent with clear highs and a decent low end, especially the bass drum. If you love soundtracks or just love cool funky late 60s music, then pick this one up.

None of the sub-headlines are in bold so it's difficult to tell they're not part of the text. There are no pictures.

The Sunday Times comes as part of a bundle for the daily newspaper - which I mostly don't have time to read, but I look forward to every Sunday morning receiving the latest edition. It is always there when I logon in the mornings. The quality is great - the pictures are clear etc. I think it translates very well to the Kindle format.

But, I am at a loss to understand why it is so shabby. The Times has spent a fortune creating and trumpeting its new website so that it can charge for content (which is fair enough) but it sends a vastly inferior product to paying Kindle customers ... I could live with no pictures; I could live with no supplements (although I am not sure why I should) but, oh! those terrible formatting errors... it is virtually unreadable.

It remains the very antithesis of the London tabloid papers and has none of the shrillness of The Guardian. Unfortunately, the Kindle edition is very annoying to read as a consequence of the numerous errors in formatting. Paragraphs start mid-sentence, subtitles are handled as sentences, and some articles simply end in the middle. Inevitably, this goes from tiresome to unbearable. Canceled my sub while still in the trial period. It does not take too long to get too annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointingly poor quality","review":"I signed up for a Kindle trial edition of the Times, anticipating an entertaining, reasonably informative read (despite the Murdochian influence).What I found was an electronic publication that suffers from shockingly bad execution of basic news copy mechanics. On more than several occasions, I found a paragraph from an altogether different article landing incongruously in the article I was trying to read. So much for continuity. In addition, there were numerous copy editing errors. It's as if an early, pre-press edition of the paper were slapped together to make a deadline. I wouldn't tolerate this from an effete suburban newsweekly, and certainly will not from what is touted as a flagship international title.Unlike the web, the name of the game with the reading experience on the Kindle is prose, with nominal intrusion of graphics and photography. Unfortunately, the execution of the Times on the Kindle loses this game in disappointing fashion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced for old news","review":"Overpriced and no images. The quality of the journalism is far from what it used to be too.If you want a better standard read the Financial Times. Just the bare bones with no celebrity gossip and well written articles.The free trial is the only way the Kindle edition of the Times can be seen as value for money as it's worth exactly what you pay for it in this instance..Pricing a purely digital edition containing yesterday's news at almost 30 USD a month is insulting to their readers' intelligence."},{"rating":"1","title":"FAKES","review":"Once again the MADACY label is trying to present classic sixties songs and states that these are the origional artists, which they are.

John Woodmorappe painstakingly explores the scientific literature and sytematically demonstrates why these commonly accepted dating methods are inaccurate and scientifically unsound.

It highlights a number of problems with radiometric dating.Of particular note is the fact that 90% of all dates for the age of the Earth are less than 100 million years. Yet scientists have fixed the Earth's age at 4.5 billion years. As Mr. Woodmorappe points out, they are clearly guilty of picking and choosing.Another problem highlighted in this book is the closed system argument. In order for radiometric dates to be accurate, the rocks must not have exchanged matter with their surroundings during their entire lifetime. Quite obviously, this is not possible. All matter, living and inanimate, is an open system.This book also employs a little bit of irony. By quoting the writings of evolutionary scientists, Mr. Woodmorappe points out that they are well aware of the flaws in radiometric dating. The problem, of course, is that they choose to ignore them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely used it already fell apart","review":"Just got in my car this morning and I a noticed my charger was already falling apart even though I haven't really owned it that long and have only used it about 7 - 10 times.

How this extensive family was so instrumental in the politics, economy, real estate, Indian affairs, groundwork of western expansion, etc. is truly a saga of fascination.It is fortunate that the author included the Chouteau family tree as the names can become quite confusing (many Pierre's, Auguste's, Chouteau's, inter-marriages with the Gratiot's, Papin's and Labbadie's).Although not totally devoted to the era \\"before\\" Lewis and Clark, it is nevertheless an absorbing and accommodating read, extensively researched."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic insight on how to relate to a generation","review":"I read Preaching to a Postmodern World as part of the curriculum for a class I took for my M.Th.It definitely takes more of an ideological approach to \\"Postmodern Preaching\\" as opposed to systematic... so don't think it's going to give you a step by step explanation on how to \\"preach\\"...

However, the author takes more of a stance against postmodernism and the Church's way to push back. I recognize some questionable issues with postmodernism and some things the Church simply cannot stand for, but most people listening to sermons ate going to have some postmodern sensibilities and pastors should be prepared to connect with people in this way.

Hate spews from her mouth at every turn in this book. She is an embarrassment to all true, thoughtful, loving Christians. Please don't waste your money. There are plenty of other thoughtful books written by republicans that seek to expose democrats' errors in thinking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marilyn Manson","review":"Ann Coulter is the Marilyn Manson of the right. It's all shock theatre -- this book (which I finished in one cod-liver-oil-like gulp today), is so ludicrous it's funny. Except for the real fact that many people actually buy into her hate drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Galileo Revisited","review":"I am an Ann Coulter fan. I love the morality and acid wit that she uses to analyze issues of the day. Unfortunately, her religious faith has led her astray. Catholics painfully learned their lesson from their ludicrous, wrongheaded inquisition of Galileo in the eighteenth century --and thereafter abandoned the Bible as a source for scientific information. It is painful to watch Christians repeat the same dumb mistake about evolution.P.S. I recommend; Nicholas Wade's new book, \\"Before the Dawn, Recovering the Lost History of Our Ancestors.\\" It is a great read and summarizes what recent science reveals about human evolution. It tweaks liberals on some issues, conservatives on others."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Shame!","review":"This book has considerable, but unfulfilled, potential. Ann Coulter is obviously a bright, well-educated person, but her book is so crammed with self-righteous sarcasm (some of it directed against persons the thongs of whose sandals she is not worthy to untie)that her substantive arguments are largely obscured in her attempts to be obnoxious. On page 19, she attempts to describe persons who call Republicans evil. It is actually a description of herself - something like \\"filled with a towering, smug self-righteous rage.\\" In short, the book tells the reader a lot more about Ann Coulter than it does about those whom she attacks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not just myopic, but poorly written","review":"If you can get past her xenophobia, you will find a text that is neither concise nor engaging. While the vast majority of what she writes is sensationalism (I don't think she makes many attempts to hide that fact) the leftovers are boring and less than inspiring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Senseless: The Selling of Hatred","review":"The first time I encountered Ann Coulter, I thought her essay was a parody of the inflamatory right-wing blather that dominates talk radio. After a while, I realized that she was simply selling the same line of nonsense. She doesn't really say anything in this book; she just smears a mythical \\"liberal\\" ideology and whips up fear and bigotry. Coulter proves that you can sell any idea if you say it loud enough and often enough. Bully for her--she read Mien Kampf.By all means, read the book, but borrow a copy from a library or a friend--no sense helping her to line her pockets."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOL","review":"I had to shave off a few I.Q. point in order to force down this nonsensical crud.

What about the terror of a mother who sees what monstrosity she has birthed, or the terror of a mother watching her child grow disfiguring tumors. That is the Bush legacy, and the legacy of our war on terror.Destructuion, chaos, disease, and suffering. What greater hommage to Satan I could not imagine.Ann wants to make us beleive that the war is just and all those who oppose it are unamerican, She and the establishment politicians on both sides who abuse the trust given them are the anti-americans.

This woman is so inanely offensive and nonsensical, it makes my stomach turn.I think the title itself manages to aptly demonstrates Coulter's miscomprehension of all the many things she ceaselessly vilifies. Obviously, it would be very possible to view anything as a \\"church\\" when considered from the prospective of a church goer. These are just words. If I laid out certain perameters and then took step by step stock of Ann Coulter's life and opinions, I'm sure I could justifiable prove that this woman is a \\"bitch\\" and a \\"lunatic.\\" But again, just words.Honestly, sticks and stones lady. Calling liberals godless. Man. I'll bet liberals the world (or as you seem to see it, the United States) over are gnashing their teeth about such an offensive statement.

What kind of unhappiness did Ann experience in her life to write such a hateful book? Does she, or anyone actually think this is true? As a Christian with Liberal tendencies I found this book to just be annoying. While there are several well rounded and informative arguments on the benefits of being conservative, this is not one of them. Ann appears to have simply vomited on the page. Although the book is complete trash, I will give her credit for some creativity. All in all, this is probably one of the worst books I've ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required Reading","review":"Ann Coulter has written a landmark book which should be required reading for all Americans. With the constant barrage of propaganda from the left, it is refreshing to read a book that tells the truth.

Being a born-again conservative (liberal by birth, not choice) my eyes are further opened to Ann's explaination of current events and things that happened when I was a child and too young to question.I was never given all the information and assumed I was told the truth by parents, teachers, friends and the media. I now realize the lies that exist today were rampant back then too.I would like to say this book is for all polical philosophies, but it is not - a great read for conservative types and an annoyance to liberals.

But who wants that? Might be okay for impressionable 10-year-olds, but don't waste your money otherwise.

Definitely read.","review":"My first thought, working through this book, was that everything I read was the worst thing ever written. Under further consideration, the frantic, persecuted-feeling tone to the book really helps explain some of the actions and statements of the more extreme conservatives in recent years. This provides a lens into understanding much of the mindset of the extremist Christians - surely not the intention of the author, but by far the best way to get anything actually meaningful or insightful from the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book is Pure Drivil","review":"This book is horrible. I as a conservative cannot even see the point of writing such a mean spirited piece of garbage. No educational value whatsoever is in this.The coverage of her book is really trashy too.

First of all, you are not really good looking. Second, conservatives such as yourself look down upon revealing too much skin.

Hmmm.Is the state of Christianity so fragile and weak that is will crumble if not promoted by the government? I think not. In fact, that is an insult to Christianity to think that way.I do not know what god she worships but it is not my God. My God does not know hate, intolerance, ignorance.Her and people like her are no different from the Taliban that we all hate so much. I tried to read this book but could not make it to the end.

Truly vile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brainless: Deserves Zero Stars","review":"I forced myself to read this drivel. Aside from theshameful attacks upon the victims of 9/11, there is nothing new here. This is the same vile, hateful, lies you'd expect from Coulter, only this time, the majority of it is plagiarized. The lack of logic is startling: How exactly does wishing to protect the environment automatically make one a proponent of infanticide? How can you, Ms. Coulter, claim to be pro-life when you're pro-war, favor the death penalty, and have literally called for the poisoning of a Supreme Court Justice? It's a shame that this wolf has pulled the wool over so many sheep's eyes. On a positive note though, perpaps Ms (Mr.) coulter can take the proceeds of this book and finally have something done about that Adam's Apple."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mental Illness in it's many forms","review":"Ann Coulter is a terrifying woman. Not because she has access to some kind of universal truth but because she is truly mentally ill and clearly meets criteria for at least two disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV). For those of you who feel some kind of kindred spirit with this woman, please be wary. She is not stable and the kind of \\"truth\\" she likes to share is the kind that teaches other human beings to dehumanize one another. I assure you, the human race is not as black and white in their beliefs as she claims. Those of us who are functioning well, exist in many shades of grey comfortably, without having to disregard the humanity and potential of others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ann does it again.","review":"I find it funny that so many liberals here love to trash a book they never read, and yet when Fahrenheit 9/11 came out they trashed those who put it down..without seeing it first!

I'd marry the woman just to listen to her diatribe all day long. She has a dry sense of humor that many miss. She does research to add a validity to her writing, but also adds a bit of sarcasm that really upsets the Liberals. She stops short of calling Liberalism just what it really is, socialism. The more that the Liberals put her down, the more valid her works become. Liberals always accuse one of lying when they state facts that they don't want to admit or anyone else to hear. Evil is another word used to defend what truely is propaganda. The more the main line media attack someone, the more factual is the information being attacked. If you can't prove it's false, just claim it and the onus is placed back on the source.Her previous books seem to be aimed at people with the vocabulary of lawyers, this one seems to be for the intelligent reader.When is the next book, about Socialism coming out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ann is not afraid to say what most people think","review":"In a world of political correctness run amok, Ann Coulter's new book cuts to the quick.

Anyone who treats a group of people whose (liberal or conservative) political views differ from his own as \\"the other\\" runs the great risk of dehumanizing those people. The inherent dangers in the dehumanization of various groups was one of the most important lessons to emerge from the devastation of World War II and we would be loathe to forget it.

I am a conservative Reagan Republican. I feel that Ann's book \\"Godless\\" HURTS the conservative cause rather than helps it. When you read some of the text of this book it becomes obvious that Ann is full of anger, hatred, and venom. Her words are abusive and caustic. People lose the point that she is trying to make because they are swallowed up in the deep black pool of her own inner turmoil. I am a Bible believing, church attending member of the religious right, BUT, the anger and hatred in Godless does NOT represent me and the way I feel. My advice to Ann would be: Prozac"},{"rating":"1","title":"Know your enemy","review":"Those who would peg Coulter as the voice of the Republican right are as misguided as those who dismiss her critics as \\"liberals\\" and \\"militant feminists\\". Ann Coulter is the personification, the embodiment of the cynicism and hatred that has our country by the throat. I suggest that everyone read or listen to her with care, to hear the fear and manipulation that is her stock in trade.

Perhaps she should try a more appropriate forum, such as \\"The Jerry Springer Show\\" or Howard Stern. There she'll find viewers looking only for shock value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Attempt at Analysis","review":"I suppose if you are on a mission to castigate liberals then this book would rate 5 stars. For analysis it fails miserably. The science she cites is all accepted as bad science, so there is nothing new there. Basically this book is a collection of exaggerated propositions which are set up like straw men, and systematically knocked down by coulter, making her appear to be brilliant (when measured by a low standard) Reading this book reminded me of a guy I knew who used to write letters to the editor, and then respond to them under a different name.

The things Ann has said and attested about our loved ones (and us) are nauseauting and hateful. I hope you will join me in refusing to read such hate-provoking writing as this.

Coulter's connotations and tone are witty, yet biting. Unfortunately, unlike her previous books, she has little to say in this one. It's a quick read, kind of funny.

Proof? Liberal reviews have appeared to develop a case of amnesia with regard to what is apparently the no-longer-universal-statement, \\"keep an open mind\\".Conservatism is far from perfect but it is closer to American reality than many in the media would have one think. Fortunately from time to time a well-written book will stand up and speak out on what are the real \\"inconvenient truths\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative","review":"If you are a Liberal you will not want to read this.

I found my self deeply engrossed in a point she was making only to find myself laughing out loud as she concluded a paragraph with one of her familiar barbs full of delightful satire. The scope of the book is impressive, covering all the major issues that divide liberals and conservatives, from crime to abortion to the best analysis of Darwin's theory of evolution I have ever read.

She appeals to her readers' fears and prejudices and inspires them to engage in group-think (otherwise known as \\"mob-think\\"). As Stevenson pointed out, such tactics endanger not just the their targets, but everyone. Ann's books may be gratifying to the ignorant and hilarious to the cynical, but they do harm.

Her readers and admirers, in short. Evolution? Global warming? Social safety nets? Any law except one favoring the haves and penalizing the have-nots? Peace instead of war? Tolerance of other victimless lifestyles? Forget them!Given the educational opportunities freely available here, this profound lack of awareness is extraordinary. Well, you can lead a horse to water....I wish the reviewer who professed a desire to marry Ms. Coulter were granted his wish. He would find himself falling into a deep, dark, foul-smelling pit.

If you need to feel affirmed, at least try to find something a little more scholarly on which to rely.Just so all you angry conservatives know, liberals are much closer to living the teachings of Jesus than are conservatives who pay no regard to stewardship of the earth, to the alleviation of human suffering, and to turning the other cheek.Liberal or conservative, don't waste your time with this pseudo-intellectual wallowing in ignorance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad science","review":"I don't care much for liberals at all. However, I absolutely despise half-witted pundits who try to pretend that they have any grasp of evolutionary biology at all. Coulter's brazen arrogance gets her into trouble here. Her breezy confidence turns out to be a gooey meringue atop layers of stunning technical ignorance caused by indolence when it comes to investigating the issues, along with a giddy reliance on marginal secondary reading.There isn't time here (it would take a book) to dismantle each of her ridiculous arguments pertaining to evolution, but there is an excellent, excellent essay about it on talkreason.com: http://www.talkreason.org/articles/coulter2.cfm.Again, people are obviously free to have their own political opinions, and criticize others for theirs. However, they are NOT free to have their own \\"science\\" and impose it on the rest of the world.

Did you ever notice that every book she writes has herself on the cover? And now some are saying she plagarized; I don't believe it nobody else could be this ridiculous! Wow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to punditry, Ann","review":"Ann Coulter's treatment of evolutionary biology is very poorly done and uses arguments that have long been refuted by science that it makes her research for the entire book questionable. It is unfortunate that people lack even a basic knowledge of biology, let alone enough expertise to unravel all of the misrepresentations, technical errors, and unscientific misinformation. Thus, it is all too easy for her and her ilk to scare people into thinking that scientists are a sinister clique with nothing better to than to undermine people's moral value systems which couldn't be further from the case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Religion is not dead, just growing under a rock!","review":"Being old-fashioned, and middle-class, I find belief in Jehova & his son Jesus, a lot more comforting than the idea that \\"man\\" evolved over \\"billions & billions\\" of years from primorial muck! Ann uses more words than I knew existed, but she succintly nails the fact that the anti-Christian crowd do meet the definition of a \\"belief\\", they can't prove what they say is true, but you are an illiterate bastard if you disagree with their rantings!"},{"rating":"2","title":"warning! the truth may anger you","review":"Ann Coulter puts it just like it is.In today's media, if you are not politically correct, the truth be darned! Who cares if the facts do not support what you say, being politically correct is all that matters.While I may not agree with all of her points of view, its nice to FINALLY see someone back ideas up with facts instead of some emotional garbage. While she does add quite a bit of emotion and humor, it does not overrule common sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a sad woman!","review":"What the ice queen said about the 9/11 widowstells nothing about them; but about the authors owninner life and actions. How sad it is that peopleare actually buying this book. I am not a liberalbut thanks Ann; I will now vote for the most liberalperson on the ballot. How ironic she wears a cross;God must weep that a person he gaves so much to;has sold her soul for money; what a truly compassionaterepublican she is. I hope she realizes that she hascontributed to the dems taking over the house and senatein the next election. The independents have had itwith the way the 'right' character attacks the person;instead of debating the issues.Please Amazon- There should be a no star option for thisbook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Godless: The Church of Liberalism","review":"I read this while at Barnes & Noble. I would never pay for this book and support A. Coulter's base of hatred and lies, and her \\"conservative\\" lifestyle. This is trash!!! Don't buy it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, really?","review":"This was supposed to be a \\"funny\\" book? Try a sad and pathetic Courtney Love-like attempt to be the craziest B in the world. Hey, stay away from that cake she wants it all. Wow, she's a Christian? If so I'm converting. Not having any compassion for people who've lost their loved ones in the 9-11 attacks is just too much. She's crossed a line. What about the kids of those widows? She's victimizing them. I know what it's like to loose someone (my father when I was young) and if I had to suffer the kick in the teeth she's giving their mothers I don't know what I would have done. She comes off like a horrible, mean, nasty bully. It's disgusting. I'll never buy another book of hers or listen to another word she has to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"For god sake, get dressed","review":"I cannot get over Ann's photos on her books. The way she dresses is inappropriate, particularly for someone who puts herself out there as a Christian. If she were to walk into the church houses my parents, brothers and sisters, nephews and nieces, and aunts and uncles attend, she'd be escorted out. For god sake, Ann, get dressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite diatribe against liberalism","review":"Ann Coulter writes in a highly simplistic style and tone in this trite diatribe against her self-described view of American liberalism. Her examples and metaphors throughout the book to describe the dangers of liberalism fall short in convincing the reader of any real danger, and actually turn the light on the neoconservative movement in it's advocacy of one party rule in America. Her diatribes are often mean-spirited and over-the-top, especially the things she writes about the widows of the 9/11 terrorist attack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than usual","review":"I am a person that reads books on both political sides. I am interested on all views but Coulter has reached a point in her career where her statements are overshadowed by her crazy insensitive rantings on people with a different view than her own . This book is crazier than usual. A slow read... The way she slimes everyone is starting to get old. I have done some online research and discovered the plagerism reports appear to be true."},{"rating":"1","title":"low quality creationism regurgitated..","review":"Virtually everything I read in this book about evolution is false. Statements like \\"Darwinatics believe a bear fell in the ocean and turned into a whale\\" make this women look completely ignorant. I feel deeply sorry for anyone who reads this book thinking they've learned anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"As a Republican, I'm embarrassed","review":"I have voted Republican my whole life. Yet reading this book made me embarrassed. At the risk of being politically incorrect, let me just say that this lady is unbelievably vicious. During these times when people seem to gain popularity based on how divisive they can be, we really have to ask ourselves WWJD. That is why I find the contents of this book to be regrettable and repulsive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Godless and self indulgent","review":"I am mystified with Ann Coulter's views. It does seem that her fasination with the obvious and her insertion of wit is what I believe sells her books. Nothing more and nothing less will continue to be on her side. Ann is, of course, entitled to her written opinions, however the \\"Biblical precepts\\" as she mentions are within her own mind and possibly known only to her.I did find a lot of the book to be tumbled with self modifications such as her view on religion and I would like Ann to truthfully defend her plethora misconceptions of disturbing arguments.I cannot find it in myself to stay for another version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased Nothingness","review":"The title says it all, so partisan it sholud not even be taken seriously. Ms Coulter one phrase for you: seperation of church and state."},{"rating":"1","title":"I quite like being godless","review":"Having been raised Baptist, I enjoy not having to worry about what some anthropomorphic celestial father figure thinks of me, my life, or what I think of Ms. CoulterWhat is a god anyway? It's basically a social construct erected to give purpose and meaning to culture. It's also unique in that every one of these cultures believes they are of Divine sacredness. Muslim fundamentalists believe that the creator of the universe wants nothing more than to have a young man strap explosives to himself and blow himself up and kill innocents. Zionist Shohets and Rabbis believe that the architect of existence is something of an \\"omniscient real estate broker\\" who promised the land of Israel to them. And American Christian psychos like Ms. Coulter seem to believe that white Republicans with money are God's chosen people.Of course, Ann is a master at baiting fuel for her fires. She lives off of reactions to her work, mainly the negative ones. Best to ignore her and maybe she'll go away."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Definition of Godless","review":"Hackneyed, nonsensical, pablum. I am sure if her contituents were capable of intelligent thought they would find it ironic that if there were a god that fit the values and characteristics they ascribed to it, Coulter would, in fact, be Godless. I am also very appreciative of the fact that Coulter, in her ultimate but completely unsubstantiated wisdom, will finally put all this Darwinism nonsense to rest, once and for all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate for \\"God\\"?","review":"How could any person be a Christian and be that hateful.The true crazy people are the ones who buy her books.She will never havce kids or be married it's the only way to be that hatefull and judgemental. If she is a good Christian as she would like people to believe she must be a very old virgin correct.Maybe thats her problem with her fellow man."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a wonderful topic!","review":"Again, as my many fans know, I have NOT read this book, therefore I can bring an unbiased opinion to my review. Why get bogged down with \\"she said this\\" or \\"she meant this\\". It's too confusing.Let's just be rational here and start with this premise that we all know to be true: there is no God to be \\"godless\\" about. Doesn't that make everything much easier?If there was, would he abide by a harpy like Ann? I don't think, from what I've read in the New Testament and from what I've been told by Christians, that Jesus would like Ann very much at all.See? Wasn't that easy?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Coulter is a Douche...","review":"How can a person so ignorant and racist be given so much press? I thought our country had been trying to open up our eyes to racisim more and to try and stop hate. With this new book Coulter hits a new low. She aims her rage instead at Michael Moore to women who lost their husbands in 9/11 and at the liberal agenda. Aiming for below the belt at the liberal population is nothing new for this woman...but aiming her hate at people who have lost their families in 9/11 is disgusting. All Coulter does is call people names and make stupid offensive remarks...like her most recent speech calling John Edwards horribly offensive names. Her publisher and agent should drop her and stop this woman from being able to publicly sell her hate as political opinion. She just needs to get a job on the 700 club and spew her crap to Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson. It is a sad day when her books hit the shelves...because you know that someone out there is actually buying them."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm a liberal but I don't fit Coulter's stereotype","review":"I couldn't read past the blurb on the outside cover. Coulter had so many sterotypes just in the blurb that I wanted to throw the book at the wall. (Fortunately I just have to return it to the library. I didn't waste my money on this book.) Liberals are this. Liberals are that. Bull. I'm a liberal, but not an extreme liberal. I am pro-life, believe Jesus is our Savior, and find Darwinism silly. I'm also a feminist, believe all religions are equally valid, and our government system that was formed hundreds of years ago simply doesn't work in this modern era. Coulter's stereotypes make her come off as completely ridiculous. And for being such a Christian conservative, why is she showing so much cleavage on the cover? Let them buy the book for your wit, not your lumps."},{"rating":"1","title":"trash","review":"this is the worst book i have ever read. she spreads nothing but hate for people who do not think the way she doesm, and doesn't offers any ideas for compromising between the two parties. This is the last thing we need in our politics today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Transvestite with Adam's Apple","review":"Folks, I have never read a book so fraught with ignorance and blatant disregard for the truth. She clearly has placed her right wing agenda above all else, and gets paid well for her rants because she's made up to look like \\"every man's fantasy\\"... the truth is, Ms. Coulter is a transgender, and she chose to not have her Adam's Apple shaved, as there was a risk it would make her voice sound more masculine.(Hey, if you believe Ann, you'd believe anything!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Talentless","review":"The tone and content of this book reveal a very sad picture. Coulter somehow walled off and smothered that part of herself capable of loving others long ago, perhaps at age five.She is a vile, hateful human being so to her it logically follows everybody else is, too - either that or she's jealous. So Coulter stays hidden behind her wall, taking shots. Because she knows she's unlovable she replaced the hunger to be loved with a hunger to be paid attention to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's Start with the Cover","review":"I just wanted to comment about Ann on the cover of her book. What message is she trying to convey subconsciously here? She's dressed like Jane Fonda on one of her aerobics videos. She looks like an aerobics instructor, not an author discussing Godlessness.It should be clear to anyone Ann Coulter is nothing more than entertainment for GOP men, to distract them from their problems in blaming everything wrong in the country on liberals. It's pure entertainment and no one takes Ann Coulter seriously except the most extreme lunatics in the country.I'm also convinced Ann had a sex change operation due to her large adams apple. If you study human anatomy you'll find women do not possess such large adams apples. It's clearly a male trait. I'd say posing as a female with freakish political views that are really from a male based brain is pure acting. Ann Coulter is an actress of the highest degree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted Trees and Glue","review":"Authors sometimes run out of ideas, but continue to seek monetary reward by publishing, and this book is \\"Exhibit A\\" for that premise. Blond hair and a black cocktail dress can only get a girl soo far. Come on, Ann, get a wardrobe. Quit with the invective too."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE END","review":"The Republican \\"talking heads\\" have become some of the most repulsive creatures in American politics, no less than Michael Moore. Coulter and the Neocons have gutted and dismantled the party of Ronald Reagan- while claiming to be its legitimate heirs.Not true.If you want to read a REAL conservative book, check out WHERE THE RIGHT WENT WRONG by Pat Buchanan. It will help you understand why the Repubs are doomed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I do hope I won't be arrested ...","review":"... but I seem to have bought a book written by a four-year-old in a revealing leotard. Oh dear.Still, this book is actually packed with good things - like ink, paper, numbers on the edges and words seemingly chosen at random.But Ann, Ann, Ann, I shouldn't go on. It's late, we've had a notable supper, and you've entertained the gentlemen too generously with your lovely hair and amusing songs on the subject of liberalism's wicked and creeping historical advance.So get back in the kitchen and wash pots."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is not worth buying!","review":"Ann Coulter's not funny. She makes hateful statements like about the 9-11 widows. The scariest thing about her is how many people buy into her hate. I thought we were one nation indivisible."},{"rating":"1","title":"No merit","review":"Even if you agree with the politics, the book is written in poor taste and clearly out of frustration and anger. There are so many poinant books and articles written about the state of affairs in this country from a conservative view point that anyone looking for insight will be greatly dissapointed by this. It's not worth buying just for the controversy. You're better off saving your money for gas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Godless?","review":"I don't think anyone is godless wether they go to church and pay the preacher man or don't believe in God they are subject to the same laws. Denying gravity exhists does not make one float in the air. Denying God exhists does not make God dissapear. Of course \\"Religion and patriotism are the last refuges of the scoundrels\\" and Ann Coulter is certainly one of those."},{"rating":"1","title":"No evidence for evolution?","review":"Ann,FYI - If you're reading this please visit the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History in D.C. They have an exhibit that details the evolution of the horse over 50 million years from a small dog-like creature with paws that lived in the swamp that gradually evolved hoofs, size, and other grass-grazing features as the swamps dried up and were replaced by grasslands. All of the transitionary fossils have been found. To compare the \\"horse\\" of 50 million years ago to the horse of today one could quite easily classify it as a different species altogether.If this isn't irrefutable evidence for Darwin-style evolution, I don't know what is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who can resist?","review":"I just love Ann Coulter, and \\"Godless\\" is the best thing she's written - hilarious, well-researched, consistenly intriguing. I laughed out loud reading it, constantly interrupting those around me to say, \\"Listen to this!\\"The humor is perfect and the facts are invaluable. I never had a college professor teach me as much as Ann Coulter has about, simply, the 20th century of American politics and culture. For the most pleasurable learning experience you've ever had, read \\"Godless.\\"From, yes, the New Jersey Girls to the insanity of the public school system, from evolution to abortion, Coulter covers it all, and does it with great wit, courage, and accuracy.I've said it before, and I'll say it again: Sing it, Ann."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOOK AT ME, EVERYBODY!","review":"\\"Look at me, everybody!

Her over the top, sarcastic style will have some howling with laughter and nodding in agreement, while infuriating others. The final chapter went on just a little too long, or this book would be a definite five star rated book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ann speaks for herself and those he worships.

Any more than I hated Ralph Fiennes after \\"Schindler's List\\" - she's an actress, or closer to the facts, a pro wrestler. When she says liberals are evil, godless baby killers it's like Khruschev pounding his shoe shouting \\"We will bury you!\\" - full of sound and fury signifying nothing.Unfortuately a lot of pseudo-Cons think this is for real (ala Nascar). \\"Well I believe in Jesus and I support the troops - guess that makes me not-a-liberal...\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad, and hateful spewings from an untreated alcoholic","review":"I feel proud to call myself a \\"liberal\\", meaning \\"free from bigotry...open to new ideas for progress and tolerant of the ideas and behaviors of others\\" according to my dictionary. Sadly, this author seems filled with hateful venom toward a number of her fellow Americans.As I understand it, anyone's viewpoint of the world can technically be called a \\"religion\\" which means in a very broad sense, how they view life. My lifeview is liberal andtechnically, this author is correct in calling \\"liberalism\\" (or conservatism, or any other \\"ism\\" a religion, in a very loose sense). She is not very creative, or intelligent or even inflammatory in saying so.Her writing beyond her premise loses all credibility with me. There is nothing there but hate and loathing, sadly.

It read as such. Packed full of hate, and rants that had nothing to support itself. If one could read this as satire then perhaps it would actually be funny. However what this kind of writing does to our country is slowly erode the boundaries between what is real and what is not real. But. What make such a book truly despicable is that it was written pandering to a specific audience to make money. This isn't a good ha ha like some Sunday newpaper cartoon ... this is ugly, hateful, and misleading completely on purpose. It is misinformation for an already disturbingly misinformed public. Coulter will continue to write such garbage as long as people buy it ... hey, such as capitalism. She has a right to ... well write this, but it is shameful never-the-less. A conservative friend lent me this book ... I would never have paid for it knowing I paid blood money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read.","review":"I am a Logcabin Republican, (if you don't know what that is, Google it).

If we dont listen she might go away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ann Coulter is Godless","review":"Ann Coulter's moral character is even lower than Fred Phelps. Granted, they both take great joy in taunting and sucker punching the psyches of innocent people who have suffered profound personal tragedies, but Ann Coulter takes it even a step further by cashing in royally on these evil deeds.Ann Coulter is the antithesis of Jesus Christ."},{"rating":"2","title":"hitler was a darwinist!!!","review":"AS usual Ann is stinging! The hypocrisy on the left is stunning and she tells it like it is. Godless & the high priests are the teachers! Yes! And teachers seem to care about the teachers not about teaching kids to read. More teachers molest per capita than priests but the movies, TV shows and news reports hate the Catholics and revere the teachers so that is what we hear about. Horrible Catholic priests. Both are horrible but lets root out the perverts in the schools too!Interesting about the set up for the Scopes trial too and about Hitler and Stalin basing their systems on Darwinism. But don't mention God in the schools. BAD BAD. AS usual a great and thought prpovoking read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"I read her copy and then we ceremoniously flung it into the garbage can.

Their mentality tears people apart not unites. Her views turn most normal Americans off of religion when they cross the line and try to dictate their ideology on this society.The facts are; Bush is an idiot and is screwing up this and our kid's generation with one fiasco after another. There's a reason why religion and politics are to remain separate; it's fanatics like Coulter that prove that point!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"We are all one","review":"Lacking any concept or insight into a real sense of spiritual developement....without genuine inspiration or understanding....meaningless soundbites of dogmatic irrelevance...self pleasuring for the emotionally retarded. Without any redeeming social value...without pretense of any intellectual development....yet Ann is a part of the shadow within us all, an inner questioning of what is real and what is illusion; a tenuous grip on reality that is so hard to define in a culture of irrelevance. This is pure entertainment masquerading as high cultural, even spiritual dominance! Ann seems to forget her humility and connection to the oneness that inspires Truth. But i forgive her insanity and invite her to redeem herself by including everyone, without judgement, as equally important aspects of the creator when she writes her new book: I am born again into the Human Race."},{"rating":"1","title":"baby registry anyone?","review":"The fact that you could, in theory, add this item to a baby or wedding registry, is ironic. This book belongs in the same aisle as Mein Kampf or the Autobiography of Malcolm X, you know, the hate aisle. Seriously, there's no way any idea fueled with as much hate as this woman puts on paper should be taken seriously. She's a parody of herself claiming that this group she hates called liberals run away from science(claiming that AIDS discriminates based on anything other than risky sexual activity is a dangerous idea, as is the idea that we should populate until Earth is standing room only and then move on to Mars). Seriously, get over the idea that the words Conservative and Liberal are names to call each other people. Start thinking about whether your ideas help or hurt people. I think saying that the 9/11 widows enjoyed their husbands' deaths hurts people. How about you?"},{"rating":"1","title":"PLAGARISM STAR DELIVERS BOMBASTIC DRIVEL AGAIN","review":"Ann Coulter has had her work analyzed by Editor and Publisher and as has been reported in the New York Post and other mainstream media proven herself to once again be a quilty of plagarism in her latest work of fiction.Buying this book is a waste of money. However, it is far preferable for the uneducated right wing masses to waste their money on books than in supporting extremists candidates. So buy the book and allow the shrill Ann Coulter to get even richer. This may be the way to ensure that her fifteen minutes of fame is finally accomplished and she will exit from the scene. It is time for Ann Coulter to take the millions she has earned in bilking the clueless and move to Russia where propagandists are more valued."},{"rating":"1","title":"Improve the cover to sell more books","review":"In today's world it seems that to sell a bottle of wine you simply need a good label. The wine in the bottle is no longer important. Similarly, Ann Coulter doesn't rely on factual or interesting content, she just needs to appear scantily clad on a book cover. Seeing that this book was a flop, I suggest she appear fully unclothed on the cover of her next book. That should spur sales and attract her targer market: uneducated morons.Nothing in this book would stimulate an interesting debate; it just insults the intelligence of anyone who can find Europe on a map. There are plenty of conservative authors who are interesting and intellectually honest. Pat Buchanan, while he may be out of the mainstream on some issues, is quite interesting to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and true","review":"Ann Coulter rocks, and so does this book. This book is so true that it makes one alternate between laughing and wanting to weep (but we men don't weep.) Coulter's wit, as always, is razor sharp and Coulter is a hoot. This is the kind of book Al Franken (a/k/a the Lying Liar) would write if he had the intelligence to do so, which he does not.Coulter neatly dissects many of the presumptions of modern Leftism and shows us their inherent lack of logic and contradictions. Why do we assume pedophilia can be cured? Why do we admire Western Europe, with its low economic growth rate and sky-high unemployment, but hate nuclear power, which most Western European countries embrace? Ann attacks all manner of such contradictions in this highly witty and incisive piece.It doesn't hurt that Ann is easy on the eyes. But her mind is as sharp as a tack, and that is what this book is about. Highly recommended. RJB."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coulter has never been better!","review":"If you are seeking true enlightenment and education, then this witty and refreshing text is a must! Ms. Coulter engages the reader in a fun read while also revealing the truth about such hot topics as abortion, evolution, and public education in America.

How could a publishing company allow such awful things to be published -- then again HOW could i spend hard earned cash to read it. With such hateful language -- how can we expect to progress as a nation. While Ms Coulter is entitled to her opinions, she is not entitled to spewing hate for hate's sake and lying.I have learned my lesson --- and I regret contributing to the Ann Coulter is a liar fund. Do yourselves all a favor -- and do NOT waste your money or your time with this book. I wish i had all those hours to live over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep Your Money","review":"I refuse to believe that any human being can actually believe the hateful, uninformed, and often bewildering things that Ann Coulter says in this book. So if you're thinking about buying \\"Godless\\" or any other of Ann's hate speech because you're a conservative and want to read more about conservative beliefs, keep looking. Turning to this drivel to learn more about true conservatism is like trying to become an attorney by watching a Judge Judy marathon. It's entertainment for the lowest common denominator. Ann Coulter sells books by being outrageous and spewing craziness so you'll be interested. She doesn't care about conservatives, and she doesn't share your beliefs - I don't care who you are. All she cares about is taking your money. Do us all a favor and stop padding this woman's pockets."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is the point?","review":"My question, after reading, is who is stopping you from criticising C.

Why don't you criticize the survivors of the Holocaust for just seeking publicity? Again, no point. Just hateful words."},{"rating":"1","title":"God Awful!","review":"Ann Coulter makes shock jocks look like bastions of fair journalism.

So what do they do?They start talking about God!But the history of the Repubs shows us that this is just empty rhetoric. Ms. Coulter is buying into this rhetoric.There are plenty of things that are ailing the Republican party, and Ms. Coulter could have written a book about how to fix it. Instead, she bashes liberals on the only issue Repubs have left: religion.But wer're not fooled!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment from a Conservative reader","review":"Ann Coulter has made her name by making radical statements that few would make. Sometimes she comes out the hero, sometimes she sounds like a moron. Unfortunately, this book is is about 80% foolish. She rarely has facts but uses many opinions. She makes outlandish comments that even I, a moral republican and a economic libertarian, believe are unintelligent and creates more harm then good. Unfortunately, no good thought or inspiration comes from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ann Coulter is an idiot... or is she?","review":"When I first read the summary of the book I thought: surely this woman is crazy. But then it dawned on me: maybe she is an atheist liberal at heart but has figured out there are far more simple-minded Christians out there willing to spend their hard earned money on the kind of mindless crap she writes then there are intelligent people who would buy books about what she really believes. If this is the case, then she is truly a genius. In that case congratulations Ann!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Godlessness of Factlessness","review":"I borrowed this book from a friend and read it and was quite disappointed by the lack of fact checking. I know it's supposed to be a book of opinionated jabs at the left, but at the least she could have made her statements backed up by statistics and factual analysis. I'm glad I didn't buy it, I only like to buy analysis from authors who actually do research on their subjects."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's about the WRITING, people!!!!!!","review":"I really, really tried to read this book. It's a meandering long winded run-on sentence filled essay that leaves the reader exhausted.

She continues her toxic lies with truly evil intent. This book is propaganda of the most fascist kind. It is utter horsecrap that perpetuates the theory that conservative fascism will save the reader from certain doom. Ann Coulter is obviously a proponent of hateful divisive political rhetoric who castigates others for their belief as she spreads virulent hypocrisy of her own design. We do not need this sort of divisive hate when America is so desperately in need of cooperation between its citizens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Her own worst enemy","review":"Only someone incapable of defining terms such as theory, fact, religion, belief, evidence, causation, and selective perception could take this garbage seriously. I provide as evidence her barb on evolutionary theory. With her tacit approval of \\"intelligent design,\\" the sales of her own book prove her wrong. That so many humans would purchase this 'book' provides ample evidence that if there IS a God, he is creating creatures that are getting dumber and dumber, or he has a very weird sense of humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anyone ever heard of separation of church and state?","review":"This is hate literature at its absolute basest much like everything Ann Coulter spews.It's a sad, sad state when right wingers think they are correct and anyone who has a mind of their own is somehow lower or evil. A dialogue is no longer tolerated but smashed down brutally with childish insults and name calling.Liberals have never insisted on the abolition of religion - we just don't want it shoved down our throats. Republicans, on the other hand, do not believe in the separation of church and state - they want to to force EVERYONE to accept their version of religion and politics and it you don't you are considered unpatriotic.There used to be a room for opposing views in this country but Republicans are facist and are right around the corner from breaking out the train cars and carting Liberals to concentration camps.Buy this book on the shelves right beside Mein Kampf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage, Pure garbage, not even worth using as a doorstop","review":"I picked this book up because I thought that it was only fair that I actually read a book by a woman who is indicative of all that is wrong with America - ie. that the general population until now at least spends its time and forms its opinions based on the commentary of people like this woman and Rush Limbaugh. I must admit the prose is lively but I doubt much of it is true. I certainly saw absolutely nothing backed by facts or even logical reasaonable thinking. But let me turn my review to those who reviewed this piece of trash who actually gave it a high rating. What the hell were you thinking? This is garbage pure and simple and any moron that actually believes it should do us all a favor and stay home on election day. Let me make myself clear - if you gave this piece of trash a high rating you are a moron - Got it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ramblings of a mad woman","review":"Ann Coulter ia a loud fowl mouthed hypocrite with too much nerve. I was shocked at her audacity in pointing fingers at the 911 widows. For someone who has an obvious cocaine problem and apparent issues of address and voter fraud, Ann Coulter is an ultra-conservative nut job. America should be ashamed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Mein Kampf?","review":"Ann Coulter gives much evidence in this book that she is a true hack. The idealogies expressed in this tome are just this side of the National Socialism of 1930's Germany, and if she has her way, we'll all be goose-stepping in the near future. If you are a fan of this ideology, check out Mein Kampf from your local library. It was written by a guy named Hitler, who was a much better writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aberrant Right-wing Tart","review":"This woman is an aberrant, mutated, arrogant over intellectual right-wing charlatan tart!

It is a piece of propaganda trash aimed at fueling anger and as a result making money. She sh9ould be ashamed of herself for writing such garbage to sell some books. We should have a moral code for authors that get to pollute our children's minds. Don't waste your hard earned dollar on this trash so the author could buy another trashy mini skirt. Worst read of the decade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet another troll. Pay no attention and she'll disappear.","review":"This book is transparent trolling at its finest. Ya gotcher eye candy on the cover, ya gotcher catchy title making it clear who to hate, and ya gotcher \\"rallying cry\\" for The Righteous (TM). If it weren't such common drivel---you can find the essential arguments on nearly any Internet discussion board---it might be worth reading just for the novelty.I give the book 2 stars instead of 1 because her histrionic rants are grammatically correct and have proper punctuation. At this point, I think it's really all that one could hope for out of \\"Hot Legs\\" Coulter."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad time","review":"What a sad time for our country when character assassinations and pure hate can be printed in a book and scooped up by its citizens. It only serves to divide us a nation even more than we already are. What will become of us if we continue to give people like this author the opportunity to use such hideous marketing ploys to make her fortune at the expense of all of us."},{"rating":"1","title":"United We Stand?","review":"Ann Coulter is the Madonna of the book world. She doesn't even believe half the tripe that she writes; she very coldly and calculatedly does it for the MONEY! The real sad ones are the people who lap this stuff up like pigs in poop and make her rich. A sucker born every minute? More like every second nowadays. As the son of a Methodist minister I am offended, but I've seen this kind of hipocrisy all my life. I guess I missed the verse in the bible that says HATE your enemies. One thing I know for sure; this country is and will continue to crumble from the inside as long as half of it's citizenry hates and condemns the other half for differing beliefs instead of simply disagreeing with them. This kind of vitriol approaches facism. DIVIDED WE FALL!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Act","review":"Ann gets one star above minimum for persistance in maintaining a clever persona that is making her quite wealthy. I came away from this and earlier books by Ann wondering how an intelligent person can hold such views and present them in such a mean-spirited fashion. Of cource it is obvious, it sells books. Ann is a very distinct part of the political circus. She very much pisses people off and entertains others. You will not be enlightened but you may be entertained. Now if you read this book and say \\"hey, this makes sense\\", you may just be retarded."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poorly conceived book.","review":"I borrowed this book from the library, regretting miserably that the city had to support Ann Coulter's finances. She hits it on the head all right... the head of the person holding the nail. For some reason, she feels compelled to attack those who do not have the air-time (and publicity) given to her by the right-wing networks. So with her compulsive 9-11 widow bashing and ill-attempts at humor, and her poorly conceived thesis obscured by her ruthless rhetoric, this book fails to show anything except how crazy and blind a person can be?!Really, the best way to handle people like Ann Coulter is to just ignore her. It works for her. Denial of reality seems to work best when it does not conform with her beliefs. Actually, denial AND dreaming. Her book should be re-titled \\"Brainless.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Shock Author","review":"Reading this book(as hard as it was) was just so I COULD give an accurate review of it. Thankfully I found an un-used one in the library that looks like it had never been touched so I wouldn't have to blow my money on this crap, and boy am I lucky. She really offers nothing than opinions she TRIES to claim as facts. She has been caught LYING MANY TIMES in her books and yet Republicans still go after her as if she's their savior...no big suprise though. Basically to sum it up, if you're a fanatical Republican just to the right of Hitler, you should love this book. Everyone else should be as disgusted as ever at this cruel, heartless woman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coulter's God","review":"This book is full of factual inaccuracies and misstatements, whether deliberate or just through lack of understanding of the subject only Ann Coulter knows. Considered as a work of science it's a joke; as a means of making money for Ann Coulter, it's obviously been quite successful. It is therefore easy to deduce that Coulter's God has nothing to do with divinity and everything to do with her bank balance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ann does it again","review":"[...] Her criticism of the secular religion of liberalism is right-on.

I can't get enough or Ann!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ann the 29% 'ers Spokesperson","review":".A bit predictably tedious at the start but it quickly settles into a delicate symmetry of dense and excursive passages of overindulgent impenetrable drivel. The ending, however, strikes a disappointing note and should have been omitted in its entirety. It leaves the reader wondering what happened to the author that, after reaching a sublime steady stride of incoherent conjecture, she trips into delusional obscurity. Overall a creative if somewhat excessive use of the exclamation punctuation.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cruella Deville Strikes Again -- A Woman Possessed by the Devil","review":"No sane human being should buy or read this diatribe. Anne Coulter is possessed by the devil. Her book is filled with filthy, vile invective against the 9/11 widows and widows and families of America's dead servicemen and women. Coulter is a disgrace to herself, her family, her publisher, the Republican left, and her nation. She should be barred from ever being published as a writer or given any air time on radio, TV, or the Internet. She must be insane to write trash such as this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazingly Bad","review":"This has to be the worst misread of American politics and history ever published. I wonder what happened to the author earlier in her life to make her so vicious? Note that the same pose is used on the covers of both her books: using sex to try to make a sale, Ann? This book would make an excellent, although expensive, doorstop. The person it was borrowed from got it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly surprised","review":"Ann is much more clever than people realize. The first half of the book is a funny page-turner that draws you in. It's too outlandish to be construed as serious hatemongering. It reads like a stand-up routine.Then -- WHAM -- you get hit with the intelligent design (ID) thesis in the second half. I always thought that the fundies were nuts for believing in ID, but after this book my confidence in Darwinism is shaken. I'm an atheist vegetarian and I liked it. It's a well laid trap, but read it anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ann Coulter at her best","review":"Ann Coulter lays it out how Liberals have systematically tried to do away with morals, faith and America as the founding fathers intended.

Finally, all the truth about the evolution lie comes out. That it is merely a faith, that the evidence doesn't show it to be true, that it is really a state-backed religion. Buy this book, let the fireworks begin, and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Caustic, sarcastic, funny, and right on","review":"The controversy around Coulter's book would lessen if you see the fast paced read in light of her type of humor. She makes serious points i.e. if the death penalty isn't a deterrant, why is Michael Moore still alive and I'm not on death row. You take a statement out of the humor context and what you have is that Anne Coulter want to murder Moore. It's suppose to be funny. Bizarre humor? Maybe but the controversy around her is way overblown. Great read. Fast paced. And actual laugh out loud humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liberalism as a religion?","review":"To claim that \\"liberalism\\" is a religion proves to the educated reader just how obtuse and stilted this book is. Sadly, its people like Coulter who continue to point out the differences between our two major political parties and are responsible for the ever-present split of our nation. The content of this book is stereotypical, offensive, and deceptive. It may as well be a book that examines the differences between African-Americans and Euro-Americans while proclaiming the superiority of the latter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"My wife and I were REALLY dissappointed in this book. We finally gave up after the first chapter.She rambles on and on. She uses a lot of words and terms that the average reader won't know. If you have ever heard her speak on TV, then you know what the book is like. She talks fast and that is conveyed into the book.What is really sad is that she curses in it. For being a \\"Christian\\" she uses a lot of BAD words.We DO NOT recommend this book at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book is dull and selfish","review":"weak-minded people seem to be so easily titilated by the right-wing bigot who talks with aggresive assurance, and patronises nicer people.

Gimps buy books like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank God for Ann Coulter","review":"I often marvel at liberals' anger and conservatives' joy at the writings and punditry of the great Ann Coulter. This book, like her previous works, is not only shamelessly plagiarized but also quite comical. There are very intelligent people on the right out there, but Coulter is certainly not one of them. Rather than voicing the conservative viewpoint, she parodies it.In this sense, this book is not unlike Comedy Central's Colbert Report. The only difference is that, unlike Colbert, Coulter doesn't realize she is playing a right-wing buffoon. I should think that thoughtful, committed conservatives would want to distance themselves from such work in order to have their important views taken seriously. As for liberals, sit back and enjoy the show. Sure, she sells a lot of books, but so does Larry Flint."},{"rating":"1","title":"An insult to thoughtful conservatives everywhere","review":"Culturally illiterate bigots shouldn't publish books like this; it's a waste of otherwise useful paper. Being hateful and mean may be a good way to sell books to the idiot-fringe but it's a sad commentary on Amercian society that her books sell as many copies as they do. If I was a \\"conservative\\" (which, I'm not), I'd be profoundly embarassed to have Ann Coulter claming to speak for me. She's an insult to thoughful conservatives everywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just love that adam's apple.","review":"Well Coulter has set the bar to a new low for other rabid conservatives to aim for. Malkin are you listening. Maybe in the her next book in six weeks she will attack the children who had parents die in War with Iraq.I could borrow some of the nasty comments by other reviewers but that would make me as sleazy as Ann.

Ann Coulter proves that there is such a thing as a cold hearted \\"christian.\\" Too bad none of her points can be read as truth b/c of lack of credability. Most of the quotes she cites are from New York Times articles and taken out of contects...she is good at that.

I admit that I only read parts of the book while at the bookstore, but no one who is educated, and I presume she is, can really think that evolution is unproven. You might as well say that the Earth is flat, or square, or whatever.She writes this drivel because it targets the far-right and gives them what they want. Apparently this works because she churns out this trash about once a year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plagiarist Pundit Pumps Political Platitudes","review":"The freak show continues, minus wit, wisdom, or any originality. The plagiarism within \\"Godless\\" has been documented, but few seem surprised enough to care. The resurgence of this pathetic mental case at a high-profile conservative political dinner last night was no surprise, either--nor was her latest dull attack on a significant Democrat. This time it was Senator John Edwards targeted by Ms. Coulter's increasingly bizarre homophoboia.Perhaps someone in her inner circle of sycophants should point out to her royal highness of the massive Adam's Apple and larger ego that Senator Edwards and President Clinton (whom she previously called \\"gay\\") are both married with children. It makes me believe that there might be a Supreme Being when I realize that--like Rush Limbaugh--Ann Coulter is CHILDLESS.

Coulter has made a career out of sensationalized distortions which often stop just short of encouraging violence, except when they dont. Educated and erudite, she has wasted a genuine ability and intellect on spreading irrational distortions of \\"the other side\\". There is absolutely no redeeming value in her writings whatsoever, unless you value hatred, fascism, irrational, inflamatory diatribe over actual satire, or insight into the political process. She is a national shame and disgrace, and we should all take a deep look into why she and we love to hate \\"the other\\" so much. But the answer is the same as its always been, fear, misunderstanding, arrogance, and a need to prove something to others. Ann, get a therapist, and spare us your daddy killing."},{"rating":"1","title":"You're being duped","review":"Terrible.

Then I throw in the simple thought that AC would be great in the ring and that her whole political spin is her own version of the WWE.Hey, it's obvious that the Right is finally distancing themselves from her.

Ann Coulter does not represent my views as a Christian or an American. Ms Coulter, you and your ilk (Limbaugh, Savage, O'Reilly) need to realize that being a Christian does not automatically equate to being a Republican.What Coulter and the others mentioned above seem to advocate scares me: a one-party (Republican) theocratic state. There's something similar to that in Iran.Get this, Coulter's other diatribes, Rush Limbaugh's two self-congratulatory puffed-up BS, and you'll have a \\"Mein Kampf\\" for the 21st century.I only give this one star because the computer won't allow me to give a negative rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ann Coulter for Prez...!!!!!!","review":"What else can you say about an author who writes about a truth most Americans have know for so long, but have never really been vocal about, except at the voting box?I recommend this book to everybody (conservatives, liberals, and those inbetween)!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bitter, too mean.","review":"I've enjoyed some of Coulter's books and talks, but reading this book this time just pushed me over the edge.

Don't be too influenced by the \\"one-star\\" crowd. Nor should you be fooled by the \\"I'm a conservative and am ashamed\\" comments. Nothing in this book is new but it does give an interesting perspective on liberalism as a religion. The \\"Jersey Girls\\" comments are all that you hear about in the mainstream media. There are plenty of other things in this book that should have the liberals hopping mad. It's an easy one-time read that I will sell online and get about half my money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Godless, the Movie","review":"This weekend I read Ann Coulter's \\"Godless\\". I was expecting a tiresome extension of her weekly column. What I got was the makings of a great movie! It was relentless in demonstrating that liberals are emotional and incapable of predicting the consequences of their actions. But better than that, it was hilarious. The asides and editorial comments cast a blinding light on liberal myopia far better than just a presentation of the facts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"Anyone who was in any way impressed with this book should seriously consider seeking professional help. Ann Coulter has shown how she epitomizes what is wrong with America. She is not so much politically astute as she is mean-spirited with virtually every word from her mouth. Rather than provide sound rationale for her opinions, she belittles anyone who does not agree with her and she attacks with malice groups of people who have no political agenda. Perhaps some will be amused by her venom and hatred, but personally, I'm sick of it and yet it continues to sell. I bought the book out of curiosity, just to see if her rhetoric was really as bad as the sound bites. It was worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"On target","review":"This is typical Coulter. She is merciless in her revelation of the numerous liberal hypocracies. Yet, as usual, her humor is so sharp you may forget that this is a serious tome. No wonder liberals hate her, she has them pegged and they are defenseless. Once again ideas triumph over emotion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truth be told...Ann is fabulous!","review":"This book is raw, witty and Ann Coulter's finest. It will generate talk for years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Looking Through A Not So Fun House Mirror","review":"I don't think that I am even at the point of disagreeing with the tightly clad author: Ms. Coulter's extremist perspective is so evident in her writings that I cannot say with any certainty that she clearly and plausibily sets out a view that any reader---left, right, or in the middle---could get to the point of evaluating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coulter Does Not Believe It","review":"Politics has always been my hobby, and I consider myself a liberal. I decided to read part of Coulter's book at Borders last week. The first paragraph of the chapter on science was proof enough for me that Coulter uses this shock and awe method only to get money. I realized that there was no way she could possibly believe what she writes. The last sentence (I believe) of the first paragraph stated that liberals only get excited by science when the research involves Nazi-like embryonic experimentation. My family was fortunate enough to flee Europe prior to Hitler's ascension to power, so my family was spared from joining the status of the 6 million other Jews. But her comparison of stem-cell research which will save lives to Nazi experimentation was so outragreous and disgusting that the only rational explanation I could arrive at is Coulter doesn't really believe what she writes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read with good points made","review":"Overall this is a very good book and it makes some very good and valid points; I am not a fan of Coulters heavy handed language and the overt religious conotations, though. Facts always trump emotions and I think Coulter hits that nail squarely on the head. If more conservatives were as blunt and unapologetic as Coulter the conservative voice would be heard more often and the conservative viewpoint would be more obvious. I am neither conservative nor liberal but I like and understand the arguments made here. Coulter says what she means, she means what she says, and she stands up for her principles. Good for her. Pick up this book and read it (actually read it) with an open mind before writing a review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dittohead scholarship, conservative religion shown up as jingoism","review":"A rating of 1 is too much, but that was the lowest available. The author makes no pretense at scholarship or responsible writing. This is a book for the already closed minds of conservative dittoheads. If you like Rush Limbaugh and Pat Robertson, you will like this book. It exposes the religion of conservatism as mean-spirited, knee-jerking jingoism. I see nothing pious, humble, or charitable in the views of such people. This author is not a religious person; she is merely a book-writing entrepreneur who knows what to write that sells to the conservative unwashed. She has made a lot of money and you can expect her to write more of the same, having done so well with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"This would be great if she labeled it fiction","review":"Thumbs up for expressing her views. It would be nice if you verified her facts and did not alter reality so much. Sure liberals can be fanatical. Funny thing is, liberals don't go around committing acts of terrorism in the name God (e.g. abortion dr. assassinatons) and don't preach a philosophy of \\"hate those who are different.\\"I must say that she held my attention through the whole book. Very comical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neocon babble","review":"Ann Coulter is unbelievable in her unrelenting hatred of anyone not in aggreement with her warped sense of reality. To her there is no middle ground. I am an educated, well travelled adult who while born in the United States, spent a good portion of my childhood living overseas and consider myself to be fairly open minded. To be called a communist, a traitor, and an enemy of America just because I don't buy into the ultra conservative mind think is an insult to the freedom that this country was founded on.I have never in my life considered buring or destroying a book because of it's evil, until I read this one.Be afraid, be very afraid of these people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Republican Jesus wins out","review":"I've always been a huge fan of Mr. Coulter's. How can you not love someone who calls for the bombing of newspapers, demands the conversion of non-Christians by the sword, and mocks the grieving of Cindy Sheehan for her son and the 911 widows for their husbands. Coulter's popularity is the ultimate proof that America has rejected the old, compassionate, French-minded Jesus of the Beatitudes and adopted the Jesus of Our Leader, a savior who isn't afraid to [...] and slay nations, a redeemer who despises the weak and belittles the grieving.The logic Coulter employs in \\"Godless\\" is impeccable. Liberals, she proclaims, detest science. They ignore the empirically observable truth that God fashioned Eve from Adam's rib while they promote superstitious Darwinism. They deny the science supporting the use of adult stem cells to cure disease because \\"Liberals just want to kill humans.\\" How can you argue with that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money!!","review":"A timely book for an election year. It would help create more divisions among the masses and would divert their short attention span from the actual issues. The content of the book is dishonest and silly. You are better off watching reality television for free.The book can be offensive for many people, because it tends to desecrate the memory of the 9/11 victims and their families, but makes Coulter a star. Coulter's new brand of belligerent and loud conservatism is popular because it is entertaining, and would also help the masses act out their anger about their miserable lives vicariously through these so-called neo-conservative characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Myopic Book with Specious Logic","review":"Casting some of her aspersions on 911 Widows aside, I would like to view the book on its merits or lack thereof.Anne Coulter throws fiery darts at the pseudo religion of the extreme left, yet completely ignores the very same false religion of the extreme right. She does a very inept job of supporting her claim that liberalism is a false religion.Instead of intelligently and cogently supporting her claims with facts, she drifts off into an incoherent and somewhat mad diatribe on why she hates liberals.\\"Ms Right\\" also should be challenged as to why she claims to be a Christian and morally upright, yet uses sex as a great deal of her \\"schtick\\". Dressing in revealing clothes, she's obviously trying to get men to buy her books. This further addresses the weakness of her message because she must use such low measures to sell her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now to become a relic of what could have been an interesting career.","review":"Recent events, which include what might be called Insults, such as ones I cannot myself use in an Amazon review, now make this author's career, I believe, through logic, to be over.

Fact is, this is written to be controversial, not accurate. Why? Controversy sells, accuracy doesn't. Liberals aren't any more \\"all Godless\\" than conservatives are all Nazis. Like all extremist pundits, Coulter pushes hot buttons as she turns vagueries into conclusions that simply aren't true or accurate. If you read it, approach it as you would Jerry Springer...there for entertainment, not enlightenment. And if you actually do buy into this pop-culture tripe that she spews as fact...well, frankly, I'm not sure if I'm more disappointed or simply surprised that you even know how to read. :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"cacophony","review":"The only reason this book has a lofty 3.5 stars is that all of the one-star reviewers would have given it a ZERO, if the choice was available.

This is the first Ann Coulter book I've read and while I absolutely enjoy her directness, her ascerbic wit, and her researched facts, I do feel it comes off as a bit of a rant---something I never picked up on when I've seen her on the boob tube. I'm not Christian, so all of the Bible stuff was not particularly interesting to me. Yes, I do believe in one God, so I'm not Godless :o) Or is it because I'm Republican that I'm not Godless??? I don't know if I would call Liberals Godless; I don't really subscribe to that label for them. I think that they are more likely the people that would have ended up in the insane asylums of the olden days. Nuttier than fruitcakes, absolute lack of a common sense gene in there bodies, dumber than dirt (have you ever tried arguing with a stupid person?), yes, but Godless??? I don't know about that.

I feel like it's a personal attack against me... and specifically since I am a christian. God loves everyone, he isn't a liberal, and he isn't a conservative. He is not involved with politics, and he loves us all. Not ALL liberals are atheist... (in fact, I can name plenty of atheist conservatives) True christians accept everyone for their beliefs, and seek peace.

Unmatched style and flair!","review":"Cugel's Saga - Those who know and love the unmatched style and wit of Maestro Vance will not fail to find what they have come to expect in the good Maestro's works, namely, engrossing tales fraught with all manner of exotic villiany, superb pomp, pendantic quibble, and unlikely circumstance! In Cugel, Maestro Vance has fashioned for his readers a protagonist we both love and censure with complete equality and yet always admire despite ourselves. He is completely selfish in every sense of the term and yet not without conscience; pompouse beyond all imagination and yet fiercely practical. The story is told with flawless command and with the Maestro's signatory flair. I recommend Cugel's Saga with great enthusiasm. I also urge you to \\"Eyes of the Overworld\\" also by Jack Vance"},{"rating":"2","title":"some of the best for fans","review":"If you are a jack vance fan, this is some of the best. If you don't know vance, and the odd way he writes, check around first as he might not be for you. Not everyone loves him. He uses huge, odd words all the time. Peasants might talk like british professors. But it is all meant to be funny. Not funny in a quip and one-liner way, but in the way watching nerds slap-fight over a quarter might be funny...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eyes of the Overworld redux","review":"'Cugel's Saga' is the third book in the 'Dying Earth' series by Jack Vance. Like the previous book ,'The Eyes of the Overworld', the story tells of the journey of the thief and grifter, Cugel, to escape exile and return to his home to gain revenge on Iucounu the magician who sent him to exile twice.In broad outline the two books are the same, but this time Cugel is a much more sympathetic character than in 'The Eyes of the Overworld'. Here Cugel is almost a lovable loser as in several adventures he seems on the verge of success and riches only to barely escape with his life. Through every misfortune Cugel slowly makes his way home to his final confrontation with Iucounu. The adventures are full Vance's trademark wonderful dialogue and strange imaginative situations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Gold","review":"Many years ago, in the depths of a crushing depression, I picked up Cugel's Saga and began reading. Vance's sentences tolled like bells; his humor made me laugh in ways I never had before; his characterizations made real people seem shallow and indistinct. I got over the depression, but not Vance. Since then I've collected almost all his books - twice. Once I thought I was through with Vance and tossed the ragged paperbacks in the trash. Before long, however, I began sifting through dusty used bookstores literally coast to coast to replenish my shelves. It was worth every step, every penny and every sneeze. I will never let go of my Vances again. He is the best writer this writer and book reviewer has ever read. Cugel's Saga is his best book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely fantastic!","review":"Cugel's Saga is the sequel to Eyes of the Overworld. Jack Vance's questionable hero, Cugel, struggles southward to avenge himself upon the Laughing Magician, encountering some of the most inventive situations ever put to paper. Always self-centered and vain to a flaw, Cugel nevertheless is possessed of a cruel and delightful sense of justice. As he wreaks havoc, either intentionally or by blind dumb luck, on the deserving of the world, one cannot help but cheer the miscreant on. Jack Vance is the greatest fantasy writer of our time. This book is part of the Dying Earth series, including The Dying Earth, Eyes of the Overworld, and Rhialto the Marvelous."},{"rating":"2","title":"poetry in prose","review":"This is the latest book (both in terms of publishing and in order that I've read) that I've added to my \\"book club\\", that is to say, my favorite books--books that I think everyone should own, or at least read at least once. This is a very poetical book. Canty's prose is a lyrical prose. It's a melancholy book that has a certain hopeful hopelessness to it. It's the story of an over-the-hill, overweight poet who is past his artistic prime who gets a teaching position in an out of the way school. His marriage is over as is his career. He has lost his talent and his life to alcoholism. While at this school he meets a troubled young student. These two people are drawn to each other and in each other find each other's salvation, of a sorts. It's a haunting story, one that ranks with any of the finest pieces of literature written.

Because it involves two things which are usually diametrically opposed, such as wit and the actual comprehension of complex issues, there aren't that many people able to pull it off. However, this man, does it, and does it well enough to have made Oscar Wilde jealous. The thing about these things is they are relevent, even more so today in the midst of an Orwellian drama. To be well read is to be well armed, and Chesterton is Charlemange.This is a book which should implicitly read in order to become explicit in an exceedingly idealistic rhetoric spewed world where no one understands where anyone stands because the people in charge stand for nothing but themselves.The cautionary tale is how far do we allow government to interject into our lives before we can't call our lives our own anymore?"},{"rating":"1","title":"PR piece?","review":"Hesh Kestin's book was given to all Computer Associates employees when it was published.

I love how it is cool, interesting, fun, challenging, informative, and really awesome. It is very different from Pharaoh in that in Pharaoh, the people are mindless drones, you have a solid mission, and it is not as detailed as CotN. In CotN, you can do what ever you want, your people are intelligent, you can make a more realistic city, and you die.

I would reccomend that this game be played by ages 12 and up [even though the \\"E\\" rating is appropriate for ages 6 and up] because the game is fairly hard.

Yes, it's a tad pricey, but it's cheaper to buy this than to buy all the singles and other CDs that these songs were first released on. The artwork on the box is beautiful and if you can read Japanese, you've hit the jackpot with the huge booklet which contains information on the singers, anime summaries, and lyrics to every single song.

The primary concern I have is that the village that Shaddai builds is populated solely with white children.

Thinking he will be safe, he exits the village Shaddai has built through a hole in the wall.I find this to be an excellent resource when I am discussing the issue of sin with children. God creates the boundaries of safety for all of us.

My first impression, just glancing at it after she unwrapped it, was that it was too wordy for a younger audience but it had some pretty nice illustrations. Then I read some of it. I have to say, I don't want my daughter thinking its okay for a commune of young children to live and be trapped by an older man who is always with them. Nor do I want her to think it's wrong to be curious, or that it's bad. Children learn best through exploring their curiosity, and this book almost detriments that. It's dressed up bible nonsense.

I thought that would be enough to make the diaper fit but I didn't realize that once a child grows bigger (as opposed to just having a big tummy) then the rise won't fit either. If the diaper isn't long enough around the legs or not coming up high enough around the back then this tab won't fix your problem. You can try to get creative and cut the tabs around the legs or add some extra snaps so you can move the tabs up higher on the diaper but if you can do that you may as well forgo buying the tabs and just make what you need. If your only problem is a cute big baby tummy and not a taller child then this can help. They go on easily and extend the length of the tab as advertised. The color didn't quite match the diaper but that isn't a big deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled","review":"I purchased this album because I like Lucky Thompson's sound and AllMusic lists the date for this recording as 1957, a great time for small group jazz. No way. I have lots of jazz recordings from this period and none of them even hint at tinker bell piano and rubberband bass.

The batteries don't hold a charge at all, so after less than 5 minutes you find yourself pushing around a vacuum that makes a low moaning sound & picks up nothing. There's $60 down the drain.

It also works well to get pet hair off both carpeted and fabric surfaces; I've used the beater brush setting on my couch and has the couch looking new again every time. On carpets it does a good job grabbing surface dirt except when *really* close to the baseboards. I find it lightweight and easy to handle for quick tasks.I love that it came with two batteries so it's always ready to go. I don't use the extended handle portions so for me this stores in a really compact space. The beater brush setting can be on on or off. The dust cup is relatively easy to empty.This model provides just enough power for the tasks I need it to do and I leave the bigger tasks to my full size vacuum. Pleased with this purchase and recommended for light cleaning tasks on all flooring types and low to medium height carpet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value vac","review":"Light, powerful, utilitarian (use as a hand or stand-up vac) and the extra battery really helps!

I wanted to have one device that can be used for car and narrow places as well as regular household cleaning purpose.I do understand, it is not supposed to have a powerful pump, but performance has fallen short of reasonable expectation.And the thing that disappoints me the most is, it's not at all good for car cleaning as well. In hand held mode the front end of the device (with rotating part) does not come off, making it impossible to operate in narrow spaces. So how is it any good?I am very disappointed with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value","review":"I had purchased one of these about 8 or 9 years ago and it had worked quite well until recently.

It runs for a bout ten minutes on a fully charged battery.I am not too crazy about the charger annd charging base. The charging base is made to be mounted on the wall with screws.

Targets so I just ordered it online. I am so happy with it. I use it mainly to vacuum dog hair throughout our hardwood floor house and on the couches. I use the suction portion for the hardwood floors and then switch to \\"carpet\\" mode for the courches where the brushes roll and pick up the hair off our microsuede couch.I'm surprised at how well the vacuum works, especially given that it's cordless. I mounted it on the side wall in our kitchen and it's a great daily/mid-week cleaner for our floors.

I use this little vacuum everyday in my kitchen, family room, sun room, and dining room. And it works great! Crushed cheerios, glitter, and pet hair are no problem. We have very uneven Mexican tile, hardwood floors, and oriental rugs- and it works wonderfully on all three. The proof is there every time I empty it. I have never had the battery life fail in mid-vacuum, but I have never tried (nor would I) to vacuum the entire house with it. My only complaint is that I didn't buy it sooner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Carpet Quick-up!","review":"I'm surprised at the power this little cordless has! It picks up the dirt, dog hair and even little pebbles. A single battery lasts a long time, and with the spare battery ready, I can actually keep my place easily quick-swept. (I'm more a gardener, not a cleaner, so if it's not easy it probably won't happen.) Some cons: the filter case is a little difficult to remove, it would be nice if the \\"on\\" button was up on the handle instead of down on the base, and although the stick comes off for stair cleaning, it doesn't have a \\"Dust Buster-like\\" snout like, say the Electrolux Pronto (which doesn't have the same power).

I haven't seen this band live in about 3 years because it is obvious they are more concerned with being \\"rock stars\\" than writing and performing the music that made 'Maize', the EP, and half of 'Pushmonkey' great. If you loved their self-titled album go buy 'Maize' which is thankfully getting re-released. The thing that upsets me the most about this band is that they used to play a bunch of awesome songs live that never made it on 'Pushmonkey'. I figured that maybe they were holding those tunes back for this release but it seems that they've decided to join the ranks of every nu-metal act out there instead. Oh well, at least we get a live recording of \\"Rednose\\" on the re-release of 'Maize'.Please don't buy El Bitche. You'd only be encouraging them to make more garbage like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pushmonkey? Pushgarbage!","review":"Easily the biggest dissapointment of the year musically. Who would have guessed as their first release is one of my all-time favorites. Gone is the addictive guitar hooks, the incredible vocal harmonizing, the in-your-face onslaught of the unique Pushmonkey sound. What happened here? The songs on this CD wouldnt get any band signed and its a complete embarassment. If I could I wouldnt even give this one star - its that bad. Dont be fooled by the 5 star reviews (all from Texas coincidentally! - borrow before you buy youll be glad you did. Again it really pains me to say this as I had really enjoyed the last CDbut this one is awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pushmonkey Falls from the Tree","review":"Pushmonkey's first CD was AWESOME; honestly one of the best ones out there, period. ... This new CD, however, is just such a disappointment that I can hardly believe it, unfortunately. I believe the band was listening to too much of \\"today's rock\\" before writing these songs, and the music has definitely regressed. Please note that most of the \\"5 star\\" reviews here on Amazon were written by people from Texas; perhaps it is no mere coincidence that the band is from TX as well? DEFINITELY listen to the songs before buying this CD; if you are hoping for a music experience similar to that of their first CD (or are hoping they may have even gotten BETTER, somehow) you will almost certainly be disappointed with this effort. I hope these guys can turn their backs to the current trends and get back to their incredibly original and melodic rock music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hybrid Bitche","review":"We're Creed, no wait we're Linkin Park, no..In either case definite a sub-par version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old fan: it had to grow on me","review":"I am an older fan. No recording can capture this bands' stage presence and the earlier albums rock! That aside: The first time I listened to El Biche I reacted like some of my fellow reviewers. It is definitley not like earlier ventures. Seems like the result of experimentation; its not too polished and bland though. A little ballad heavy. Although some lyrics or short riffs walk the line of cheesy or typical rock rap hybrid stuff (\\"thing\\" \\"master breaker\\"), they still work in Tony's melodic trumpet (\\"tag\\"), vulenerable lyrics (\\"mine to waste\\") and some good old fashion blunt aggression to balance it (\\"chemical skin\\" & \\"carbomb\\"). They have kept their identity. They do seem to be going in a few different directions but I think El Biche is definitley worth it. I'm proud of this central Tx band.

This is a French import (based on a radio recording??) of 'Trane at Birdland. The truth is though that Eric Dolphy is the real star on this record. His two minute solo at the beginning of 'My Favorite Things' is incredible and the next eighteen minutes of the track aren't bad either. That basically sums up the album. Some standard Trane tunes with some amazing new expansions and interpretations by Dolphy and himself. I usually am not very forgiving of low sound quality but in this case, the listener is so drawn in to the music that he can ignore how poor the sound quality is. Highly recommended.

Cunningham did not exhibit the \\"Invincible Hero(oine) Syndrome\\" displayed often with Arilyn Moonblade. There are many interesting characters and an interesting plot (not on the level of Elfsong or Elfshadow, though). What made me unhappy was the treatment of the paladin and of Khelben Arunsun. The apparent dislike of authority mentioned by an above reviewer was ugly. This book was the end to a franchise and what it disastrously left out was a sense that the ideals fought for by the Harpers will live on in the Realms, even though the book series has ended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak. Very weak.","review":"This book was full of cliches, sloppy storytelling, and, worst of all, characters who are nothing more than cardboard, and flimsy cardboard at that. The forces of \\"good\\" are especially portrayed as total morons, making you wonder why evil didn't overrun the realms a long time ago. Though, to be fair, Cunningham's Paladins in gaming terms would clearly be Lawful Neutral, not Lawful Good. Which just goes to show that she really doesn't understand how to portray such characters in the first place. And I definitely agree with the reviewers who found a strong bias against religion and authority from the author. A cliched story is bad enough. A cliched story with the author's personal biases shoe-horned into the tale makes for an even less enjoyable reading experience. Leave this one on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Characters with no honour at all bring this down","review":"I bought this book with some enthusiasm. I expected that it would be pretty intresting with a \\"Thief\\" type character. At first I did like Bronwyn, but midway through and especially in the latter half, she just struck me as totally selfish and having no sense of honour. I'm not sure if the treatment of the Paladin, Algorind, was meant to be funny or not, but I thought the way the protagonists regarded him to be atrocious. The only characters who I felt any sympathy for were Algorind and Dag Zoreth, who I found intriguing. This book could have been good overall if Bronwyn had not grated me the wrong way so much, and if in fact she is represenative of current Harpers then the fact then this being the last book is indeed a good thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grim and unentertaining.","review":"Elaine Cunningham does not live up to previous works with Thornhold. The lead character is unsympathetic, I found myself hoping for the bad guys to prevail on several occassions.

Definately not her best work."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing end to the Harpers series","review":"I found this book to be uneven and ultimately unsatisfying -- not up to Cunnigham's usual standards. I liked the two leads, Bronwyn, an Indiana Jones type of character, and Ebenezer, the typical grumpy dwarf with the heart of gold. The young knight Algorind, dealing with real life situations while trying to keep true to his convictions, was also well done. The whole magical artifact plotline was very cliched though. ...There was a clumsy attempt to set up for a sequel that seems unlikely to be written. The ending has a rift erupt in the Harpers organization that doesn't make much sense. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets a few stares","review":"I love this book!!!!

All these hilarious metaphors and similes, just make me absolutely marvel at his creativity, like how can anybody be this funny on paper?!?! In fact, I'm here on Amazon today to actually buy the book (something I've never done before!) That's how funny it is. Do yourself a favor - spend a measely $10 on this, you'll be glad you did!

Not that I expect every average listener to pick up on that, but surely if you're writing about it you should put more than an average effort into understanding the lyrics, shouldn't you?

The video is a loose historical exploration of Dylan's career which includes roughly the period of the late 1970s through 1989. It mostly consists of snippets of interviews by journalists and a few musicians. Some of the musicians offer a bit of insight into the recording of some of Dylan's material. There are a few clips of Dylan performing. However, the video is corrupted by the bloated opinions of journalists who (despite their self-proclaimed status as \\"Dylan experts\\") seem to have only listened to his records once before dismissing them. Their opinions are seemingly based on little more than their own personal \\"taste.\\" Little effort is expended by these \\"experts\\" to understand Dylan's work.

It was only after listening to the album about 4 times that i actually started to like. And once you start to like it you get a little obssessive about it.

Like Slipknot, they have 'screamy' vocals along with some mediocre clean vocals. The musicianship is very basic, most of the songs being comprimised of power chords, drop D playing and simple, linear drumming. As with the rest of the genre, there are no guitar solos at all in this album which to fans like myself is a huge let-down.If you're not too picky about what you listen to and can stand more of the same old, watered-down metal, go for it. But it's not an album I frequently listen to. Nice try AHC - just try a little harder next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"If Korn and the Backstreet Boys mated...","review":"these are the kids they would have. I saw them open for SLAYER(a real band, for those nu-metal geeks that have never heard of them).I admit, the CD sounds OK. But after seeing them live, I just can't see them as anything but a joke.They had seven band members! Who the hell has Seven band members?The guitar is just a bunch of basic, recycled, two finger power chords. There is no reason for them to have two guitar players. And whats with the dual keyboards? These guys hardly played anything. All they did was dance around the stage like N'STINK.Anyway, I'm the first to post a negative review about these posers. I have probably offended some of you.

I bought The House hoping maybe she had found her \\"style\\" again, but alas it was not to be. I do not understand how a bestselling author can get away with combining points-of-view within one paragraph, \\"telling\\" not \\"showing\\" the story, and repeating the same things over and over and over until I just want to scream! It seems that perhaps because she is such a big name, her work is not copyread anymore. I think it might be time for her to put away her pen, or get back to the basics of good writing. I will not be buying another of her books anytime soon. I chose to rate this book with one star, because no stars wasn't a choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time!","review":"Don't waste your time or money on this book.

And rarely have I read a book that I really, really didn't like, but this is one of them. There is such a lack of dialogue, and the author repeats her same thoughts over and over. I swear, if I would have had to read the words \\"four years\\" one more time (referring to the main character's failed relationship) I would have hurt somebody. There was so much that could have been done with this book. But, by the time she actually gets the house, you've been bored stiff for four years and don't much care. It seems to be that it was poorly edited, and there is a lot of awkward grammar. I was really disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I wasted time reading this book that I will never get back. It was repetitive, predictable, and drawn out. I only finished the book hoping for a twist in the ending, but it turned out the way I thought it would.

But, I would not waste the time if I were you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still Waiting","review":"I, like other readers, used to be a Danielle Steel junkie. I couldn't wait for the next book. Like the others, I have been disappointed repeatedly in the last 10 or so years. The writing style, credibility, and repetition, especially of the \\"absolutes,\\" (all, never, every, very...) is mediocre and at times annoying. Character development is predictable from book to book and generally unrealistic. I too hoped that this book would be better, but found myself searching for more depth as I read. Maybe the next one will be better.........."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I always liked Danielle Steel but this book was terrible. It was very repetitive, had at least 2 sentences that were not complete and did not make sense. Someone else found misspelled words. And, the ending, what a let down.

ELEGANT STYLE!","review":"True, this story starts out slow, but it was still entertaining because I trust in Danielle Steel and know that she's going to deliver some wonderful characters, an interesting plot, and a few hours of great entertainment ... for a gloomy afternoon in suburbia.I can relate to Sarah ... and to Jeff (both out of other relationships) and to their restoring THE HOUSE she inherited together.Perhaps it might not be Danielle Steel in top form, but it's still Danielle Steel, the most popular romance/suspense writer of our day. Love her! Love her books. In her private life, she's a glamorous, beautiful, strong woman ... one we should all emulate. (She could be a movie star herself; she's THAT attractive ... THAT elegant!AND IT SHOWS IN HER WRITING!Go, Danielle!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad At All!","review":"I just finished this book, and thought, \\"I could see where someone would say it was boring.\\" But I just loved the story, loved the history of Sarah tracking down her great-grandmother, loved the details of the house (and was very jealous of such a nice house!), and all in all, this was one of the better of Danielle Steel's recent works. Yes, there was some repetition, but not as bad as \\"Impossible.\\" I would say if you've been hesitating to pick up a Danielle Steel book lately, as I have, this one might actually be enjoyable!! Is she on her way back? I know we all hope so as we know she is capable of great work, that's why we stay her fans!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another repetitive Novel by Danielle","review":"Daniel should take her time and write ONE good book rather than turning out typiccal novels like this one.

You know, like there is more story, more life, expanded areas where you would have liked to have gone, if given the chance.Of course, a lot of people probably wouldn't have stuck around for that long of a story, so maybe she was right in cutting some of fat.Maybe she will write another one, that starts somewhere in the middle of this one, or even better, tell the story of Lilli, and her passionate love life and why she had to leave her children.Now that would be awesome!katwww.rendgraphics.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"Danielle Steele Needs to Retire","review":"There was a time in my life that Danielle Steele was my favorite author. I even named my daughter after her 20 years ago. However, she is living on her laurels now and really should retire. Her novels are not much better than what a high school student could write. She overuses words such as \\"she loved that about him.\\" \\"she loved how he did this..\\" and so forth. With \\"The House\\", by the third chapter, it was as if she thought her reading audience did not have enough sense to realize that Phil was not good for the heroine. She had to keep beating our heads with it, just filling up paper in order to make it long enough for a book. I doubt I will ever read another one of her novels. So sad...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok for DS","review":"While this certainly wasn't her worst novel, it isn't much more than ok. I got the impression she had written an outline then filled with book with annoying, repetitive details - about the people, the house, etc. And oh, just once can't someone in her novel be happy being single??"},{"rating":"1","title":"what ever happened to DS's writing","review":"I just finished reading the first 60 pages and its so annoying. She must repeat at least 10 times that she has been seeing Phil for 4 years. I feel like there are lots of fillers here, she repeats everything we know so many times she could have written 60 pages in 20. I do agree that she was once a fantastic writer, but not anymore. I doubt I'll ever read another of her books, don't know if I'll even finish this one. So far its a really boring read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, boring","review":"After chapter after chapter of the gal lamenting over her dead-end romance, she finally buys the house. Aha, I thought, the story begins. But alas, not much happens. Then she finds a picture of her grandmother in the house, and I think, OK here's the story, but not to be. Then there is the architect that enters - a good love story - no.Danielle Steel had the makings of three great story lines but failed to develop any of them. The story of the grandmother's life in the house would have been tremendous.I think maybe she had a Visa bill to pay and had to get a book out quickly, because she did not put any thought into this one. Where was the editor on this one? It was a bummer.

What a bunch of words and thoughts-over and over again.My first Danielle Steele book, probably my last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite and Predictable","review":"This is my first and last Danielle Steel book. Curious about the enthusiasm for this author, I decided to give her a try. Never before have I experienced such a constant and highly repetitious barrage of being told what characters were thinking and feeling, with so little attempt to make them come alive through their actions and words. Her attempts at character development were transparent, and the story line was trite and highly predictable and could have been told in a quarter of the time. There were many, many missed opportunities to enrich the story with details that would have made the House a more meaningful character. Steel's attempts to apply psychology to the main character's motivations were inappropriate and failed to add anything to the story. Overall it read like an outline of a story still waiting to be fleshed out and made alive. A waste of time and money, but never again."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's boring. Period.","review":"The book's just boring. I read this book after I read Cecilia Ahern's PS I Love You (PS I Love You is even worst), and I thought after a few pages that the book was going to be a much better read than Cecilia Ahern's, but it was NOT.What I hated the most about the book was the repetition of Sara's relationship with Phil, which rather than understanding Sara's feelings better, I felt that Sara was just pathetic. AND, the repetition of how beautiful Sara was. BORING."},{"rating":"1","title":"yawn, yawn...get to the point, please","review":"I purchased this book after reading a review and I'm so sorry I did. While the idea was good, the writing was terrible. I'm no author, but even I know that repeating the same narrative (the boyfriend relationship) over and over and over again is not good writing. I felt as if Ms Steel got stuck in one place and was writing the same thing over and over again until she came up with another thought. Perhaps her editor/publisher was dogging her to write another book and she just threw this together to satisfy Delacorte Press; at any rate, it was pretty boring for the most part. I hope she takes a sabatical from writing until she can give her readers something with some life to it. I doubt that I purchase any more of her books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to stories like she used to write.","review":"I had about given up on DS but decided to try The House and I must say I found it thoroughly enjoying.

Other than that, very great job with this one and i look forward to the next book due out in June."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. I love books about old houses or redoing houses so this one was right up my alley. It was fast moving and entertaining.

I would rather she publish fewer books that have more substantial, less predictable story lines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehhhh...","review":"After reading a very lackluster DS book (Miracle) I decided to give her one more shot. After all, some of my favorite authors had books that were 'meh' so I figured that this book would be better. It had a different premise/storyline that sounded good, so I picked it up. It's gotta be better than Miracle, right???... It wasn't. Ms. Steel makes the same mistake of finding ways to repeat the same thing over and over. Just when I thought DS had finally made something clear and would move on, she just repeated herself with slightly different wording. It was extremely frustrating to see what seemed like a great story idea get this treatment from Ms. Steel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Factory ordered predictable story","review":"I think Danielle Steele may have a contract with her book company to write a certain amount of books per her contract, so she fulfills this obligation with this kind of factory cookie-cutter book to basically tell a story without putting much thought into the story or the characters. It's a formula story with no interesting or multi-dimensional characters. The kind of book that I totally forget soon after I've finished reading it, because there is nothing that interests or intrigues me enough to remember in this story. Not recommended - basically just a way to fill up paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a literary masterpiece...","review":"I persevered and finished this book. What a waste of time.

It will also be my last. I am absolutely baffled by the hundreds of positive reviews here on Amazon. This book was one of the worst I have ever read.First, it was so long and drawn out. By the time you get to the end, you're on the edge of your seat waiting for that knock 'em dead moment when the killer is revealed and all of the clues are explained. Instead, you get a boring, predictable, disappointing ending that goes nowhere. It was like Cornwell just gave up on the story. There were so many characters who could have been the killer - their erratic behavior explained and an interesting ending provided. No such luck.Also, Kay's lack of closure with Mark irritated me. There is no ending to their story. Just disappointing overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"The lustre begins to wear off...","review":"\\"Postmortem\\" and \\"Body of Evidence\\" were good books. \\"All That Remains\\" is not. It sets the pattern for the remainder of her work to date (Jan 2001): flimsy plots, poor/non-existent characterisation, awful dialogue and plain bad writing. The first two Scarpetta books showed signs of planning, thought, research and effort. None has since. This is dashed-off tosh, written too quickly with an eye on the bank balance and not on the story. Holes abound and description is poor. The pacing is usually glacial but then, just when it matters, too quick. It is not plausible as a thriller or mystery as the culprit is obvious from the get-go. Skip this and pick up Michael Connelly or John Connolly."},{"rating":"2","title":"enjoyable","review":"Patricia Cornwell always makes reading an enjoyment and keeps the reader always interested in the story wondering what is in store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks!","review":"This is a waste of my time, battery, and eyesight. The plot was typical, there wasn't many things that were new, the story was very slow, and it wasn't very compelling or suspenseful. Honestly, I don't even want to give it one star. There were several grammar mistakes too. I don't recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Scarpetta book yet","review":"I have read 4 of the Scarpetta books and find this the bestyet.

Young couples are being murdered and found dead months later, in a secluded area with no clues as to how they died. All of their vehicles found are found at rest areas, and all that remains with them is a jack of hearts.

And it should have stayed that way; I should not have bought it because it was a huge disappointment. The story seems to start with an interesting case but very soon after that it dies and turns into pages and pages of nothing. Descriptions of places that don't really matter, clothes people wear that have NO impact whatsoever on the story and the ending..... don't even get me going on that. I should have stopped around page 25 or so and started an other book.I believe this was an early 'Scarpetta' story. Almost all PC's other books kept me on the edge of my seat but this one, don't bother, it's a waste of your time. It was for my time, that's for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Searing Thriller","review":"An unknown killer is targeting and murdering couples in remote wooded areas, leaving their bodies to be found months later. Chief Medical Examiner Kay Scarpetta finds her investigation of the latest murders hindered by Pat Harvey, mother of one of the victims and also Washington's National Drug Policy Director, who suspects that the FBI is more keen to protect its own interests than stopping the killer. Cornwell's sensitive treatment of the victims--letting us get to know them through Scarpetta's investigation--makes it all the better. A searing thriller impossible to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspenseful and Quick-Paced","review":"As all of the Kay Scarpetta books go, I really liked this one.

I was so glad when I finished this and hate I wasted so much time."},{"rating":"2","title":"More good Scarpetta","review":"No doubt here that Kay Scarpetta fans will enjoy this book. Patricia Cornwell constructs an enjoyable story here that will keep you turning the pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"great read","review":"Very compelling, Scarpetta knows her job and still has a life outside of it. Barely, but she's hanging on to the ideal of work plus a life, and even trying to help out a friend while doing it. She is compassionate about her victims' families, and this adds to the complexity of the character. Of course, it also leads her down some false paths and to make a few mistakes, but that's realistic. The author has done a good job of keeping this a stand alone piece while it is obviously written about a central cast of characters, and I would highly recommend this one or any of them from this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Fun Reading... Educational Too!","review":"I really have enjoyed the Kay Scarpetta series&#65533; (Postmortem, Body of Evidence, All That Remains, Cruel & Unusual, The Body Farm, From Potter&#65533;s Field, Cause of Death, Unnatural Exposure, Point of Origin, Black Notice, The Last Precinct). I have read them all except The Last Precinct which I expect to begin very soon. I recommend you read them all for pure pleasure. They are an absolute delight to read.

It is vintage Scarpetta when Lucy was innocent, Marino was strong, and Kay had few self doubts. I read (reread actually) it back to back with one of Cornwell's latest Scarpetta novels and was amazed at how much more I enjoyed the earlier work. For anyone who started reading Cornwell in later years and didn't enjoy her, I would recommend this earlier work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read","review":"This is one of the best of Cornwells series on Kay Scarpetta. It moves fast and has twists and turns in the personality conflicts as well as in the mystery of the whodunit. She has achieved in fleshing out the romance between Kay and her lover and still making it clear that this is a difficult relationship to maintain due both to their jobs and due to their personality. She allows Kay to be a strong individual who has some difficulty in letting people into her life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forensic Mystery","review":"This is the third installment of Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta series. While not mandatory to read them in order, I do think the books are more enjoyable that way. For example, reporter Abby Turnbull is prominent in this book, can she be trusted, is she a true friend? It would be hard to understand her character and her relationship with Dr. Scarpetta without reading the other two books first, especially Postmortem.All in all, I thought this book moved a little slower than the previous one, Body of Evidence. That said, I still enjoyed it and plan to read more in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Series","review":"I love all the Scarpetta books by Patricia Cornwell. I have the series in hardback in my bookcase to share with interested family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read, abrupt ending","review":"It had been awhile since I had read one of Patricia Cornwell's books.

It seemed a bit rushed and abrupt."},{"rating":"2","title":"I forgot I had read it earlier","review":"All that remains was the 3rd book in Patricia Cornwells Scarpetta series. I had read it when it first came out and enjoyed it then and again on Kindle when I last read it. I kept thinking I know this story, but I was about 3 chapters into it when I figured it out.It is a good Scarpetta episode and it was great to read and earlier story after all these years.Patricia Cornwell is an author that I buy on publication date and after finishing a story I am eagerly waiting for the next one. I think every once in a while we should go back and re-read and earlier episode to remember the characters and see how they have grown and also more importantly how the author has matured as well.Thanks for the opportunity to share."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of Cormwells worst","review":"This book just dragged on and on. Endless pages that seemed to add nothing to the story. Too much of only Scarpetta. Needed more of the regular charactors Cromwell usually has in this series. I couldn't wait to be done with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and Lifeless","review":"This is the first Patricia Cornwell I've read and, assuming it is a typical Patricia Cornwell book, I don't plan to read any of the others. People who like a writer always say, \\"Oh, but you read the wrong book. You should try...\\" I don't believe writers vary that much. This book had an uninteresting plot, flat characters, and no suspense whatsoever. The conversations were flat on the page, the men had no personalities except Marino whose character was delineated by his poor grammar. Scarpetta is barely interesting, but even so, I never believed for a moment that she would love someone as impersonal as Mark. I kept reading because I am a sucker."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"This book was DREADFUL. The writing is third rate (I'd quote a passage but I've already given the book away), the characters are completely unappealing (with the exception of Marino), and the conclusion is beyond anticlimactic. Truthfully, I don't understand this genre to begin with. When so many disturbing murders are taking place in the real world (e.g., Chandra Levy, Samantha Runnion) why do people want to read about people being hacked up by serial killers? Also, I don't belong to the temperance league, but these characters are constantly drinking -- hard liquor and a lot of it -- and smoking. I guess this proves that they're \\"tough guys with tough jobs,\\" but I don't think the local coroner should be allowed to perform autopsies while she has a hangover. This book was about as intriguing as the manual to my DVD player. Do yourself a favor -- read something else -- like the manual to your DVD player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Great book once you get into it. it's the first of a long line of books about the character you meet in this book, each one keeps getting better and better.

Poor ending.","review":"If you want a good page turner, select \\"All that Remains.\\" It's the third of the Kay Scarpetta series and is the best to date. Does it have a weak ending? Yes. But the characters and storyline are more in depth than in her previous stories. I'm sure I'll read the entire series. but I'm still skeptical about a medical examiner who uses the FBI to help solve her mysteries. But hey...it's fiction. Suspension of disbelief is the key.

Plus, the book makes it easy to do, because she tells you actual examples.If it can help a shy person like me, imagine the benefits for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for shy AND outgoing people","review":"Most people find it very difficult to network. Yet, networking is what gets many of us jobs, apartments, and even new friends. Networking can be as simple as your mom mentioning that a co-worker is looking for a new secretary and then putting in a good word for you. So many of us are networking and don't even realize it.As a very shy person with very little ability to be social or outgoing, I have found Andrea Nierenberg's book to be invaluable. She even has included a chapter geared especially toward introverted people in her book. After reading Andrea's book, I have used her advice to get a nicer (but cheaper) apartment by networking through co-workers and am currently being considered for a better job by using Andrea's principles at a recent pool party. Less than 2 weeks after reading Andrea's book, my life is already getting better!I highly recommend this book to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Only Networking Book You'll Ever Need","review":"Andrea's book demystifies the notion about networking that an exchanged business card and a handshake lead to immediate results. Instead, she reminds her reader that the best business is done between people that know, trust and like eachother - feelings that can only genuinely develop over time.She shares \\"how to\\" network based on personality types, interests and more, and also how to keep your network alive in practical ways.I've taken Andrea's book to heart and am having more fun than ever, building deeper and more meaningful connections, personally and professionally. This book will truly improve your life, luck and career, just as Andrea says it will!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it, solid advice","review":"Andrea Nierenberg is the author of \\"Nonstop Networking: How to Improve Your Life, Luck, and Career\\". This is good pick for those just starting out and want an easy read about how to network with people.Personal networking is an important skill for anyone who owns a business, and there's even a chapter for introverts who are uncomfortable in social situations. Based on the principle that most people are more comfortable doing business with those they are familiar with and trust, it's a nice guide on how to build and strengthen your personal and business relationships.Whether you're looking for a job, or have a business and want to gain more clients this type of skill is an important one to develop. Reviews for Nonstop Networking on amazon were favorable, with the only real complaint that the 170 page book is printed in double space type and a large font, so you'll notice it's considerably smaller if it were printed normal size."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job.","review":"Didn't notice the ridges on the side before purchasing but not a big deal.

However Tuck by himself is missing some of the soulfulness that he has when he plays with her. Technically he is very good but he seems to try to do too much on some songs. Sometimes less is more. Some of the material on this CD is very good (Somewhere Over The Rainbow, Body and Soul) but sometimes it sounds like lots of notes for the sake of more notes. The lack of continuity makes it difficult for me to put it on and play it without skipping a few tracks. I guess the title is appropriate. So if that is what you are looking for...."},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredible guitar virtuoso!","review":"It doesn't matter if you play guitar or just appreciate good guitar music, this CD is essential. Tuck, the one-man-band-Andress plays jazz standards, funk and popular music without missing a beat. His ability to play rhythm, bass lines and the melody AT THE SAME TIME is simply unreal; and although each song is technically amazing, he never loses touch with what is most important to the song - it's individuality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding. One of my favorite cd's in my collection.","review":"Tuck is to the solo jazz guitar what Michael Hedges was to the acoustic. He always sounds like he's about to crash and burn, but never does.

The essays in the book offer a communist perspective of American history, emphasizing the social and structural processes underpinning historical change. But there are moments that the writers come off, to me, as sort of the stereotypical 'crotchety' communist whose resentment tinges their critique with an embittered, vengeful air, namely against the bourgeoisie who are seen as the diabolical cabalists responsible for the suppression of liberatory social movements throughout history. But it just rubbed me that way a few times, otherwise this book has good examinations of American society and its emergence as a capitalist superpower."},{"rating":"2","title":"does not nest","review":"The cups measure just fine; however, they do not nest for storage.

They have been sturdy and have endured a year's worth of drops without cracking. I wash them in the dishwasher and have had a couple of them get white stains (I'm assuming it's from etching in the dw). No matter though. What I do think could be better is that if you have the handles lined up so they can all hang from something, they don't nest properly. The little red holder that they came with got chunked as it was completely useless to me. I got a red plastic circular thing and attached them to it then hung it from a peg. They don't nest right but that's how it all works best for me. Be nice if they all nested properly when the handles were hung in a row.

The large dial makes it easy to read when placed at the back of the oven, and it seems to be very accurate. I haven't verified accuracy, but I've noticed that cookies and other baked goods are consistently better since I've started using the thermometer (not overdone, underdone).Also, ovens will naturally vary in temperature from top to bottom and front to back by as much as 50 degrees. If you put three sheets of cookies in the oven, one on each rack, the top sheet could easily be done before the bottom sheet. Without knowing exactly what the temperature variations are in your oven, checking doneness is guesswork. By placing the thermometer at different places in my oven, I've been able to figure out the oven's \\"temperature profile\\" and I can adjust recipes accordingly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not accurate","review":"My kitchen-Aid oven and this thermometer differ by 50 degrees at 400.

She questioned the accuracy of the temperature settings, using as a reference, an old, inexpensive oven thermometer. I, in turn, questioned the accuracy of the oven thermometer. We purchased the KitchenAid stainless steel oven thermometer as a third reference.The result? The automatic setting of the range's oven temperature and the \\"old\\" oven thermometer matched during a test. The KitchenAid thermometer registered some thirty degrees less!E-mailing the customer service department of KitchenAid for assistance was a total failure, without any response to my inquiry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good and mostly accurate","review":"If your oven is older it may not be maintaining a constant temp. Mine was this way and I looked at a variety of gadgets to measure the temp. I finally settled on this kitchen aid thermometer.

I've purchased others that, although they worked, either varied the temperature by more than 50 degrees or collected the food film/grease from the oven like a magnet, thereby impeding readability. This thermometer seems to deflect film - makes for easy reading. My only \\"complaint\\" is that it doesn't stay put - it often falls over if I close the oven door too quickly/forcefully. The hook it comes with is a nice feature, but I suspect the design of my oven racks may simply be a bit too close together to allow for proper use of the hook.

But I'll bet that after listening some time your grandmother's going say, \\"Well, it's very pretty and all, but aincha got Blind Joe Death by John Fahey? When I hear the American acoustical guitar, I like it to go someplace, not just lie in a corner and curl up!\\" Ackerman's tunes drift pleasantly down, like snow, and melt as soon as they touch the ground, leaving not a trace behind, except the faint impression of wasted time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked Perfect in my 2010 Imac","review":"This cable was perfect, it allowed me to add a fast Solid State Drive (SSD) to my 2010 IMac all in one.It worked perfectly and I have no complaints at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Type 1","review":"I purchased this book for my wife who is Type 1 and wants to count carbs.

They weren't mentioned at all in the series until the last 6 episodes, but suddenly they appear, have uber weaponry and then try to take over. And I hate that.. it's a plot device for someone to say \\"War is Bad!!\\"... like we don't know that. There was no other reason for that to happen, save for the 'message' that the creators were trying to convey.If these guys were mentioned earlier in the series, then fine I would agree with the inclusion at the end, but it seemed to me they were created just to bang us over the head with the 'message'.A typically bad japanese ending to a great show (would it kill them to have some semblence of a happy ending, I guess I should be grateful that the main cast survived)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Desperation option","review":"It's hard to find a good quality A/B/C switch to use with your TV - and this isn't it.

As a minor irritation, the plastic housing is cheap, the buttons are numbered C-B-A rather than A-B-C, and the switch \\"feel\\" differs between the buttons - that is, when A or C is selected, its button stays pushed in; but when B is selected, all buttons are out. If you are desperate for a three-way switch - maybe OK. At least, this one is cheap. But if you can find a good quality switch, you would be happier with it.

Sail ships ranging in sizes from small sloops to large Ship of the Line are covered. Details regarding the design considerations/proposals, dimensions, number/types of guns, tonnage, performance, etc. are included. Detail illustrations are also included.This book mentions some brief history of some of the sailing vessels but not in detail.

With a fun Dare-Meter at the start of each dare, the reader knows if they are looking at a \\"Daring\\", \\"Ultra-Daring\\", or \\"Ultra-Gutsy Daring\\" topic. Dare to have a life wish list ranked at an ultra dare and really spoke to me. Thinking of a few things to wish for in life is normal, but writing them down and crossing one off each year is gusty.

This one is a 9 only compared to the body of his other work. It's not experimental and is just more of classic Jack Bruce. Very solid studio effort. The production is a little (by todays standards) sterile. The song writing style of Jack Bruce on this album seems to be completely unaware or uncaring perhaps of current trends. This doesn't matter much to the listener if the music is taken in an (as is) attitude. In the Album notes Jack comments that he always wanted to get together with these musicians (friends) and do a project. Thus the title.

'Heimat' is an enormously-long film that is usually shown on television in digestible hour-long chunks. It's best to think of it as a superior soap opera, although it has nothing at all to do with 'Dallas'. There isn't really a plot, as such - the film follows the lives of a group of people living in a twentieth-century (mainly pre-WW2) village in Germany. It's massive in several sense of the word, and has a scope as epic as '2001', but on a human scale. Although it goes on for over half a day, it's generally quite mesmeric. Lots of things happen, but it's all about a slow accumulation of details. I'm sorry if this review seems vague - reviewing this film is like reviewing forty years of history, in three hundred words. There was a sequel of similar quality, released as 'Die Zweit Heimat'. The title means 'homeland'."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT THE BEST OF KEANU","review":"SPOTTY DETAILS, SOME INFORMATION ON FAMILY HISTORY INCORRECT, ROBERT MILLER KATINA MILLERS'S FATHER NOT SAM REEVES, NOT THE BEST READING I'VE BEEN EXPOSED TO ABOUT KEANU AND I'VE READ A LOT."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD IDEA!","review":"This is the worst purchase I made all year.

That is my favorite too. There is a secret ska influence. There are song titles like \\"You Look Like Hell Tonight.\\" Elizabeth is not nice. She doesn't want you to like her.

I like the fact that, unlike some older design, you don't have to worry about ice, salt, stirring... It work best if you have an extra freezer in the garage at home so you can leave the main compartment in there, forget about it, and its ready to use whenever.2 minor draw back:-It will make enough for 4 people and you cannot make another batch until the 'thing' freeze up again.- Make sure whatever mix you are using is very cold. If you max out the capacity, sometime it does not bring the finished icecream to as cold as I like. OR it will take too long to make it cold enough, that too much air has been mixed into the ice-cream and it will have too much of a cream(foamy) texture.Overall I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yummy!","review":"We love our Deni ice cream maker! We have had our ice cream maker for almost 1 year now. We are a family of 6 and this is the perfect size for us. Each of us gets a sizable amount of ice cream but you can't go back for seconds because it's gone! Therefore, we don't overeat. Occasionally the ice cream doesn't want to freeze up and I think it's just because I don't refrigerate the ingredients long enough. It does make a nice soft serve ice cream when everything is really chilled. One of our favorites is frozen fruit. We blend a bunch of fruit and yogurt in the blender and then chill in the fridge. We just pour the \\"smoothy\\" into the ice cream maker and let it go. It tastes great and is much healthier than ice cream. It's pretty quick too and quiet. We can easily carry on a conversation while the ice cream maker is running. It also cleans up easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deni ice cream maker","review":"Returned it because it smelled as though it was burning up even though I followed instructions and never made anything but soft serve things.

They were, without a doubt, the best thing on stage that night; some great musicianship, inventive song-writing and interesting, worthwhile lyrics. This is a group definitely worth some attention. With a number of bands, one feels that you could replace any member and never know the difference. This group had a collective feel that made you appreciate every of its four members for their unique and seemingly irreplaceable contribution to the collective product.

This pole has been up for a few months, but was destroyed during the first significant winter storm, a blizzard with about 20 to 30 mph winds. The wind bent it so far over that the pole buckled about 8 inches above ground level. (I had taken the flag down before the storm struck to reduce wind resistance.) I have neighbors who've had flag poles up for over 20 years without any problems.

While the arrangements are interesting in spots, there are too many diffused attempts to hit pop charts with vocal pieces and insufficient solo space for either Brecker (although Mike had a couple of nice solos on the last 2 cuts). I agree that Columbia might have been trying to nudge them toward a BS&T; thing, since BS&T; was selling lots of records at the time.The talent clearly compares to the fusion bands that were around then and soon thereafter, but saddling the talent with boring vocal pieces with boring vocalists and lyrics squanders it.This album might be interesting to collectors to hear what these players sounded like before they became well-known, but I can't recommend it to anyone else."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album just kicks #@*&.","review":"I was very happy to find this classic on disc.

Picasso's own words, appearing as blocked quotes in the margins are not dated, nor sources given. The reader is not able to chronologically trace the change in philosophy reflected in his words. The text also suffers from an inordinate number of typographical errors. Walther's poorly disguised gut reaction of disgust in describing some of Picasso's work may reflect the reaction his early critics felt in viewing some of his paintings.

He manages to tell a compelling story while constantly shifting focus from raids against inhabitants of the Mohawk Valley to individuals in England and Fort Niagara plotting larger strategies. The details he offers his readers of individual attacks upon settlements large and small are constant reminders of the brutality of the ongoing campaign in the Mohawk Valley, and the suffering that occurred for all involved. Besides being a significant contribution to the military literature of the American Revolution, Watt's work is a fine addition to local history in New York. This is a book students of the American Revolution in general and the Mohawk Valley in particular will want on their bookshelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darcy's Diary is a great companion for Pride and Predjudice","review":"After seeing so many P&P sequels, prequels, and retellings, I chose Darcy's Diary because the bit I read here let me know that the original Jane Austin character would be respected. I was right! This book describes P&P from Darcy's point of view in a way that just illuminates Austin's description without adding too much. Very well done!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated and unconvincing","review":"This work by Michael Deaver was unimpressive to say the least. After considering the arguments presented I was left with very little understanding of the issues. Only a very basic theoretical framework is provided that offers the reader little to no insight into how to deal with the issue of Iraqi WMDs [that we have since found didnt exist].Furthermore, the author \\"Michael V.

Zotti's research is pretty good, but it would actually benefit by being treated as a discussion thread because sometimes he misses some interesting links.\\"Why are yawns contagious?\\" dodges answering the question -- even though there are good indicators from other human behavior (when people get seasick in unison).This book is a 10 for my curious 10-year-old, but only about a 5 for me"},{"rating":"1","title":"At least he got the punctuation right.","review":"Supposedly this book is for folks who don't have a strong science background. Yet it contains quite a few factual erors. Also there are spots where Zotti becomes facetious rather than informative without expressly telling you he is joking and not relating facts. If you are not already familiar with the topics covered you will end up misinformed. The book gives the impression that Zotti is tired of standing in Cecil's shadow. Sadly, he shows neither the wit nor the knowledge required to step into the light."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most interesting book I've ever read.","review":"This is my favorite book. Once you start reading it, you can't put it down. Some of the things it tells you about you could have a masters degree and not know. A very fun book to read. He even adds humor to it.

Even then they probably wouldn't lose their interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Basic","review":"I purchased this book in the hope it might be a good resource. I was wrong.

This book gives me the creeps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stereotypes and bad writing are all over the place.","review":"I read this book for a class and I can tell you that is seems to be written by somebody in high school. For example, about half of the paragraphs in the book start with the name \\"Clarke.\\" This sort of uninventive writing is seen in many other ways throughout the book. The bad editing, as had been mentioned in other reviews for example. In addition, it seems to be based soley on stereotypes. I did not care to read about how important it was to have the White House redecorated. The characters are flat and the story is somewhat bogus at times. The sad part is, I think the idea for the novel is really great. I just do not know where this went wrong. So, if you want to be bored and/or offended, read this book. Otherwise save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"El Matador = El Sucko","review":"Listen to me. Don't buy this game. If someone wants to give it you, refuse it. Seriously, I paid $49 for this pathetic excuse for a third person shooter. I was bored after the first 30 minutes. No real storyline, just the repetitive action of shooting bad guys who somehow can shoot YOU while you are standing behind walls. Also, grenades can damage you even if you're nowhere near the explosion. The graphics weren't bad, expecially the jungle scenes. That's why I rated this game with 2 stars instead of one. I like third person shooters, and was hoping this would be one of those games like Rogue Trooper, which was very good.Save your money, but if you feel the need to blow 50 bucks, then take the money and flush it down the toilet.

Thermaltake works like a champ! CPU temp dropped from 150-165 and 4500 RPM fan speeds, to a relaxed 120 and 2500 RPM. CPU would overheat and reset my PC while playing labor intensive games. No longer! Nice and QUIET. Sturdy unit - heavy. Install takes some patience, and NOTE: if your MOBO has the P4 CPU slot rotated 90-degrees-out (like my MSI) the fan mounts are forced to a top-bottom config, instead of front-rear - which did not work with my case - the attached fan would be stuck flat against the powersupply... I had to remove the \\"shroud\\" from the tower (easy) and fab a new bracket for the fan (not pretty) but you could run the tower without the shroud and no optional fan, and probably get excellent cooling just the same. Very nice unit - highly recommend. 4 rather than 5 for fitment issue only."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Fireplace DVD","review":"When playing it you really do feel warmer lol Funny how that works. the fire and fishes are the best, the lava was a waste.

This product didn't do it for me. All of the videos suffered from poor resolution... you could see the dithering. The fish tank audio was loud, the fish seemed to sense a shark in the waters... they were in hyper-drive. The fireplace scenes all seem to have been recorded in a wind-tunnel. The campfire audio was the best part of the DVD. There was no audio on the lava lamp which was OK. Would have been nice to have less aggressive colors for the lava, however."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's What I Wanted, But...","review":"I really wanted a DVD screensaver for my TV so I can play music and what not and have something interesting on the TV screen. I like this DVD for what it offers (3 fireplaces, 1 fish tank and 1 lava lamp). All of the screen savers (except lava lamp) have audio with them (crackling fire / bubbling aquarium), but I'm not all that impressed with the quality of the video. I don't have the best flat screen TV, but video generally looks pretty good on there. The video on this DVD appears faded, so my only complaint with it is that the colors aren't as vibrant and the picture isn't as \\"HD\\" as I would like it to be, but I think it definitely does what I wanted something like this to do.Overall I would recommend it, but I may still keep my eyes peeled for a more \\"HD\\" DVD screen saver..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fireplace DVD was almost exactly what I had hoped!","review":"This DVD was a great find!

One of the fireplaces was exactly what I had hoped for. The other two are really good too.

When you live in a place that does not have a fireplace and you want that warm comforting feeling around the Holidays especially, then this is not to bad. It looks nice on a flat screen TV and the crackling sounds are a nice touch to make it feel more realistic. The fish tank is not bad, but you can tell when it restarts.

Always wanted one but, unless I can buy myself a house, doubt I will ever have one. But I want to see the flickering glow, hear the cracks, listen to it burn while I read a good book. Now I can. The DVD holds three fires, one lava lamp and a fish tank. I find myself playing the campfire a lot. The only problem with it is the idea behind it is that the campfire is in the woods at night. Of course, that makes sense, but there is a very loud cricket in the soundtrack which kind of drives me nuts.Also every once and a while the picture, as it loops, seems to pixel. You only notice it if you are looking right at it when it loops, in that one tiny second of time, which is rare, but I feel that I did need to take a point away.It isn't perfect but for the price, when compared to the other DVDs, I think it is the best pick.

I found it very difficult to follow as it was filled with way too many characters introduced in previous novels in the series. There was no character development, and the events and reactions relied heavily on unexplained relationships from previous stories. Consequently the story was muddled, confusing, and meaningless. The teaser on the back of the book didn't even enter into the novel until page 80; for awhile I thought they had put the wrong cover on the book! This book is like reading chapters out of the middle of a huge novel--you don't know what happened in previous chapters and you can see that many conflicts will be resolved in future chapters.

Are we going after those who are cruel to animals, are we uniting Nikki with Jack ? If so why do we knock off another mother and child? Why does Julia have to die.

First, why was there even a plot about extracting revenge for the horse farm owners, then abruptly that plot went away, conveniently resolving the issue on its own? There wasn't any good reason to even have that plot in the book. And how did the fired attorney just go away on her own? And (caution-spoiler to follow), why in the world was the daughter of the judge killed off (unless there's another story line here)? It added nothing to the book! And the ending-why oh why would the wife of the National Security Advisor come out of hiding to be with her husband after the guy was almost beaten to death in retaliation by the Sisterhood? Why would she even want to be near him? I haven't a clue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, Escapist Read","review":"Totally entertaining installment of the Sisterhood series. Is it real? No. Is it believable? No. Could it happen? No. Is it a fun idea to ponder and revel in? You bet! The Sisterhood is a group of women who have been failed by the judicial system as we know it, so they create their own. Myra, Charles, and the gang never fail to entertain. In addition to the entertainment value, this one includes more than one emotional moment with more loss for the Sisterhood. I look forward to the next installment, in fact I've already started it.

I recommend it for impatient folks like myself who may need a \\"Quick How-To\\" reference guide, or need the occasional Ah-Ha that's why it does that sort of answer.

This book is also very in-depth and will provide a total knowledge to someone just learning.The hardest thing with Crystal is that buidling reports is more an art form then science considering the vast amount of options the developer has to solve any given business problem.

I had assumed that \\"action\\" meant the brush actually moved (silly me). Please note that I did not buy mine from Amazon, and that dubious \\"Dual Brush Action\\" claim is conspicuously absent in the description here.This model SteamVac works well enough (how wrong can you go with hot detergent water?) but not nearly as well as the fancier Hoovers that have rotating brushes, which I have also used.

I'll be trading mine for a better model with a moving brush."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steam Vac?","review":"Very Misleading carpet cleaner name \\"Steam Vac\\". Where is the steam? There is no steam, just hot water that gets cold very fast. I used mine around the house and it made the carpets wet...did not do much to the stains. I rented a steam Cleaner and it did a lot better.

It left them as wet as if I spilled a glass of water--there's no extraction power whatsoever there. The carpets are quite damp, but should dry.

The point of the story is that trolls are incredibly stupid. Anybody looking for a deeper meaning will be disappointed. Some of the reviewers asked if it's a retelling of a real Norwegian folktale.

This book was among my students' favorites. There was enough action and drama to capture the attention of the most street-wise boys.

It will present a good opportunity to discuss kind treatment of pets and good manners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not our favorite","review":"Although we own several Jan Brett books, this one was disappointing to both me and my 7 year old son. We read it several days ago as I was scheduled to be the parent reader in his class the next day. Needless to say, we chose another book for me to read to the kids. Although the illustrations are beautiful, the story is odd and a little creepy... Trolls invading a home on Christmas Eve and eating the holiday meal??

My daughter just brought this home from her library at school and I read it to her tonight. The story was so odd, and weird for a children's story.

This is my 3rd one and up until this vacuum, I loved these small simple vacuums. On this Quick-Broom Hoover, however, the bagless feature is completely inoperable. After vacumming a few times a week for a month, there will be a couple of grains of sand in the visable easy-to-empty dirt container. All of the dirt, dust, dog hair, spilled food, etc. is converted to a greyish-brownish mat and is housed above the dirt container clinging to an internal non-disposable filter. In order to \\"empty\\" this vacuum you have to turn the filter (which is like a non-removable bag) inside out and hand pick out the greyish brown mat of gunk. In other words, its perpetually clogged -- the dirt container has never had more than a few grains of sand in it. In all fairness, I do have a sheltie who has long hair and its possible that this vacuum might work in a household without animals.

Sure there's background detail but Darlington obviously finds the conspiracy phenomenon and the way it alters lives more interesting than trying to find 'the truth'.Very funny but also quite depressing, one gets the sense that Darlington is trying to show how these individual obsessions with Area 51 are ultimately futile, like flies swatted by a mad horse."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book about the Area 51 subculture","review":"Everyone has heard the stories about UFO's and top secret spy planes being tested at Area 51, but what makes this book so great is it looks beyond that and focuses on the unusual band of characters that have come to be associated with the not-so-secret base in nevada. This book covers everything from the creation of the base to the dedication of the E.T. Highway, and everything inbetween, right down to the politics and petty bickering in the tiny town of Rachel just outside of area 51.

It did not have a lanyard and a carrying pouch with rear belt clip. It was not made in the United States. IT WAS MADE IN CHINA!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The compass I received is both rugged and accurate. The model 3H is much better than other, cheaper lenstatic compasses I've used in the past. The difference is stark. From the aluminum constrution to the clarity of the readings...this compass is worth the extra money. It is a little more difficult to operate than some of the more popular baseplate compasses, lacking a \\"set and forget\\" declination adjustment and numerous map scales, but the Cammenga is unquestionably more durable than the comparably priced baseplate model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Chinese knock off","review":"The rating should be zero.

Originally, I thought it might be too heavy for my Mom, who has arthritis, but the design actually requires less effort on the user's part.It's listed as dishwasher-safe, but I prefer to wash it by hand.

This pizza cutter will be in my drawer for a long time, it is sure to last. A word of warning, though, this utensil is *huge* and will take up room in your untensil drawer. It is easy to clean and comfortable to use, I don't know that I've come across a better one out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"High-end tool","review":"This cutter is about as good as it gets in the consumer market. I've used professional pizza cutters before, and the KitchenAid version is every bit as sturdy and twice as refined. It has two blade supports (most only have one) and a soft gasket on each side of the blade to minimize wobbling under pressure. The ability to tighten the wheel support is nice, because other cutters I have used loosened over time. The plastic blade guard is a nice touch because it keeps your other utensils from being scratched during storage. The handle design goes beyond the call of duty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Pizza Wheel Available","review":"I bought one of these for myself and liked it so much I had to buy one for my parent's kitchen so I could cut Mom's veggie pizza. This is the biggest cutting wheel you can find and SHARP! No more dragging toppings across your pizza as you cut it! This wheel will practically clear Mt. Everest leaving all of your toppings where they're supposed to be. Pepperoni is sliced, not smushed and drug along. Pile on the toppings if you have this one - it can handle it.Make sure it has the metal tip on the end of the handle with the hole - Kitchenaid is unfornately getting cheap and is skimping on product quality as many of the Kitchenaid feedbacks indicate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful album","review":"This is an album composed of classical music that just about everyone is familiar with and it's done beautifully.

It is expensive when you compare it to the off-the-shelf stuff, but - Wow! - what a result! First, I viewed the product video on You-Tube, then proceeded to go to work on the vehicle, following the instructions on the product bottles. The finish on the car (1993 Porsche) was not bad enough to warrant the sanding step, so I started with the rubbing compound using my Chcago electronic polisher at apx 1200 rpm, then moved on to the polishing steps. Be sure to mask off any areas of the car (or your garage) that you are not working on, as it gets pretty messy! The final result was great, fantastic shine and no swirl marks.

I find it poorly organized; for example if you want to learn to simply count from 1-10 in a language, you will have to jump around to find each number which are between 40% and so forth. It isn't very helpful to learn how to say \\"fifth\\" and then 50% and then five for instance when you are just beginning a language. I found \\"hello\\" in Spanish, but then \\"goodbye\\" was nowhere to be found. If you are starting from scratch and want to learn a new language, I don't recommend this CD. However, it does contain several different languages in one program. I have also found that it crashes often when you use the sound on it and since I have 64MB ram and this program suggests only 16MB, I was upset that it is such a memory hog.

Thank you John Parker for a world-class work of art! Far and away, one of the best books I have ever read. I have bought several copies to hand out to fellow runners and non-runners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I have ever read......need I say more","review":"It will change the way you think about track, running, or challenging yourself and meeting your goals, no matter how high your goals are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to get into","review":"Had high expectations for this book after reading other reviews but found it difficult to get into. Only made it about half way through before I put it down; couldn't keep focused on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful and Inspiring, it makes you want to RUN!","review":"I ordered this book on a hunch, thinking that it might be interesting. I had no idea how good it would be, or how much it would inspire me to get up and go jogging! The story is wonderfully engaging, with strong characters and conflict that draws you into the world of a serious runner.Highly recommended for anyone trying to get in shape and needing a little inspiration, or anyone who enjoys a good jog or run, or anyone who just enjoys a good story! If you've never run a day in your life, never watched a track meet or even paid much attention to the summer olympics, this book will give you a new appreciation for the life of a runner. And don't be surprised if you find yourself signing up for your local C25K program after just a few chapters!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Novel","review":"Wow. Stunning. John Parker's words are like the smell that brings back a rush of long-misplaced memories. John captured the essence and feelings of competitive running flawlessly. Thank you.This isn't just about running. It's about the difficulties and ramifications of intense, uncompromising commitment to physically and mentally challenging goals. Be it sports, career or relationships; lots of lessons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back in Print!","review":"Finally a re-issue of this out of print classic. I wondered if it could possibly be as good as I had heard about given that this book is legendary amongst groups of runners, and being a casual runner I wondered if I would get much out of a book about a seriously competitive runner but as soon as I opened it I got sucked right in to the story. This book is every bit as good as you've heard and anyone who has ever strapped on a pair of shoes and known the joy and pain of a stretch of road or track ahead of you will love it - even if you haven't I think the story is as much about life as it is about running that you can't help but be inspired by this book. Beautifully written, and a joy to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"trashy","review":"There are great descriptions of running, yes. But there are many chapters presenting really trashy values - e.g. the athletic director meeting in the whirlpool with his secretary, with whom he is having an affair. She does not care for him, but considers this part of her job... This is not a book for kids or teens!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother unless you're a glutton for punishment","review":"This book is not only poorly written, but annoying as well. Weak plot, poor character development, and a portrayal of runners as self-obsessed egomaniacs results in a book of marginal quality. \\"Runners World\\" is more inspiring, uplifting, interesting, and better written than this book. The author should stick to running or writing non-fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated","review":"What does one want from a running book? A good story? Good descriptions of running? This book is short on both. The characters are very flat, the story is trite and the running scenes are mediocre. Among runners it is very popular; I suppose this is because they are desirous of anything connected with their normally marginalized sport. I am a runner, so I can sympathize, but I can not concur in calling this book \\"good\\" or \\"great\\". It is written for runners by a runner; a runner who, can not write, I might add: a good high school writer could have come up with such slop. Poorly conceived, poorly written. It will make no waves outside of running circles. Only a novel which aspires to be great literature as well as great literature about running will be successful or worth reading. Borrow this from a friend or find it at the library, but dont expect \\"a cult classic\\". The classic novel on running is yet to be written."},{"rating":"1","title":"community college creative writing evening class","review":"After reading Running with the Buffaloes I searched for more running-related books and came across this one. The title alone should have been warning enough as to just how awful this book is. Anyone who has sat through a creative writing class will recognize this: it's written by the guy in the class who just read Catcher in the Rye and decided that he could write something like it.The characters in this book, all of them, and their relationships are unbelievable. The smart people are too smart; the dumb people too dumb. The dialogue and description made me wince.One shouldn't love a running novel merely because one loves running - the only explanation I can think of for all the exceptional reviews I see here on Amazon for this book. (Geez, one person exclaimed it was the best book he'd ever read!)I noticed that the author has another book out titled, Runners and Other Dreamers. Now that sounds good."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T TRY TO ORDER THIS ITEM","review":"This book is always advertised, yet NEVER in stock after you pay for it.

Go out and buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent if skimmed...","review":"I bought this book with high hopes and, disappointed, happily left it on the plane I finished it on. Not a keeper. Not a mythical text handed down from one sage inspired runner to another - as promised. There's a reason this was sold out of the back of the author's car and not published out right to begin with - it's a juvenile, go nowhere story that surrounds a few gems of elite running lore, repeating what you knew but may have forgotten from your own running career at some point in your life. Sift through the book to find these gems and suspend what little temptation you may suffer to follow the story. Practice this kind of efficiency and you'll be pleased but not overwhelmed. Save your money and borrow it from a friend, the library, or look in the seat pocket of the person in front of you...you never know."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-So","review":"I personally did not like this book and found the plot development to be slow.

Runner's World rated it as the #1 running book. As I started reading the book, it has very little to do with running and more to do with being a collegiate athlete during the 70s. Book was very bland and dated, and made me fall asleep on numerous occasions. No real concrete plot. Author use too much descriptive fluff, and the running sequences are over before you even realize.If you want a great book about running readBorn to Run: A Hidden Tribe, Superathletes, and the Greatest Race the World Has Never Seen. A much better read for an avid runner. Everyone that gave such great review to \\"Once a Runner\\" obviously haven't read \\"Born to Run.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Once a Runner is a great book","review":"I am a high school runner who just finished Once a runner.

Great running adventure story along with very creative ways to improve my level of fitness. I looked forward to reading every night and felt sad when I finished. I was left wanting more!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"Anyone who has ever committed himself or herself to running will understand the genius of this book. It contains not only the joys of running, but also the doubts and hardships, which makes it a genuine assessment of the mind of a runner. It just makes you want to go run intervals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read for all runners","review":"Want to know what makes a runner tick?Read this book...you'll be foreverchanged. It describes a fictitious collegiatetrack program with some very colorfulcharacters. Their tales and traumasboil down the essence of running."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great look into mind of a runner - so-so plot outside this","review":"The book has an interesting history as something of a cult classic among runners beginning in the 1970s, a time when running was much more a fringe activity than now. The stength of the book is the insight it gives you into the mind of a competive athlete in terms of focus, desire to win, and sheer determination. Even a weekend runner like myself who gets out for a few races can enjoy this. The weakness of the book is just about everything else -- the rest of the plot and characterizations are pretty weak and can be skimmed over.Read this to learn about the spirit and focus of competition (5 stars) and then skim the rest (about 3 stars at best minus 1 for the typos in the text). I would recommend this book if you have any interest in running- it is short and a quick read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Run, Baby, Run.","review":"Being a U of O alum, circa 1972, seeing Steve Prefontaine on campus and having a couple of friends who ran for Bill Bowerman, I was prepared to dislike this book; but I found myself rushing through it, reading the entire novel on a flight from Portland to Houston. The author, John Parker, does a great job of creating his lead character, Quenton Cassidy. I found myself invested in his struggles as a runner and a person. That's not to say the book is perfect, the romance meanders and ends up dangling and the metaphysical aspects of running life at the end feel like filler, but all in all, I loved this book.If you're a track fan or a runner, you'll love this book. If not, the whole thing may leave you somewhat mystified."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Book - from a running/racing point of view","review":"Captured the \\"in race\\" feel better than any author I have read to date. The remaining story is OK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning to new runners","review":"To those people who have just completed Couch-to-5k and are looking for a little inspiration as they continue their running journey--this book is NOT for you. Within the first 10 pages of this painfully smug book, people like you are dismissed as \\"fatties\\" who will never understand the plight of the naturally gifted. My fear is that the only thing you will learn from this novel is that elite runners are massive jerks with over-inflated egos (which, by the way, is not true). So save your time for something truly inspirational, not this dated, latently sexist drivel, and remember that running is for everyone--including those of us with love handles."},{"rating":"2","title":"running novel","review":"this book is in excellent condition and it arrived in a timely manner.

He read it in record time and said it was great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much vulgarity for me, thank you","review":"The book appears to get rave reviews for its technical merit, even though it's a fictional work. I will never know. I bought the Kindle version of the book, and midway through chapter 2, I knew I couldn't, in good conscience as a Christian, finish reading it. Having spent 3 years in the Army, and 23 in the Navy, I've had my share of exposure to foul language, and even practiced it a bit, but it seems this book goes to extreme measures to use the name of God in vain, and to speak in terms that would make a sailor blush. I did a search of a few of the 'off-color' words I could think of, and the hits astonished me - enough to cause me to cease and desist. I had to check to be sure this wasn't written by Al Pacino. I've belonged to a running club for a number of years, and we don't talk like that. It's a shame, because I really enjoyed \\"Heart Rate Training for the Compleat Idiot\\". Hard to believe this book is by the same author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Without a doubt, the truest book I've ever read.","review":"This book delves into the life of a runner and offers as true a glimpse as I've ever seen into what it's like to put oneself in great discomfort on a daily basis, all for the sake of trying to prove something to yourself. Quenton Cassidy embodies the mind, spirit, and soul of a runner, no matter the skill level or speed. His troubles become yours as you read the book, as do his triumphs. Parker captured what it is to be a runner and was able to answer in perfect sense the question that every distance runner is asked at one time or another: why do you do it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Runners BIble Brought Back","review":"After reading this book brought to me by my son, an All American college distance runner, I ordered a copy for myself. My son told me he has been through everything in this book, and to understand a true runner this book is the one to read. If you have a runner in the family this book is a must."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memoirs of the 1970's Running Scene","review":"I read this book while at Oregon (1978-1981) and yes, I could relate to the Trials of Miles/Miles of Trials because big milage was the thing in those days. I did skip the portions involving Cassidy getting kicked off the team because it was so unrealistic. The mentor for Cassidy reminded me of Dellinger, so I liked those portions of the book. I can't believe it has become a collector's item and selling for 50 bucks a pop. But, whatever the market will bear right? I would recommend reading it if you want to know what racing was like in those days. For me, reading it again would make me feel old, much like when I see Waffle Racers being marketed as \\"leisure\\" shoes when all I can think of was that they were the state of the art cross country shoes that I loved so much. I'm still racing and still looking ahead, not at the runners behind me. That said, it is a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!!","review":"I loved this book and found it very inspiring. It is great to get into a sports book that is about more than the sport itself. Even as fiction, this book was a great lesson in dedication and achievement. I highly reccomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST book I've ever read!","review":"I'm a sophomore in highschool and I'm also a extremely dedicated cross-country and track runner. This book has changed my life! The inspirational story of Quenton Cassidy's runner career left me breathless! The first chapter gave me goose-bumps because it decribed the start of a race perfectly. I read chapters from the book every night before a big race. Reading about Cassidy's determination gives any runner a boost.

Just as a capital letter commences any new sentence, so a capital letter is the first to appear after a colon - but not in this work. Furthermore, I found too many instances of digression when try to make a simple point.All of which is off-putting for the serious reader.In short, this book is hard to review because it is most difficult to read and if it can't be read - then there really is no point in it being reviewed in the first place.Poor showing - especially after all that research.NM"},{"rating":"2","title":"something strange is going on here","review":"This is supposed to be a comment on Watson's Wisdom and Strength, the Veronnese Renaissance masterpiece, not English naval heroes.

And the peelings don't fall off the peeler, they build up into a clump and I have to manually pull them out of the peeler. So it ends up taking a lot longer, and just doesn't work as cleanly as it should.The other thing I didn't like about this peeler was the price.

I listened to it twice, trying to find something about any of the selections that would make the album worth inflicting on someone else. Alas, to no avail. I'll donate it to the Salvation Army thrift shop. For $0.25 they may be able to unload it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good, though maybe not 'ultimate'","review":"If you love Christmas as much as I do, you will probably enjoy this album. It features plenty of standard favorites - especially sung by the MoTab, who seem to be a holiday staple. I probably wouldn't pay $17.95 just to hear songs like 'The Little Drummer Boy' of 'We Wish You a Merry Christmas.'What makes this compillation interesting is the liberal sprinkling of less traditional - or, anyway, less well-known - classical pieces. Vivaldi's 'Gloria', Corelli's 'Christmas Concerto', and the opera 'Hansel and Gretel' all make an appearance. The standout, in my mind, is the ethereally beautiful 'Watt's Cradle Hymn,' which I have never seen or heard anywhere else - that one song alone makes this album worth a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellant service!","review":"I ordered this late & they still got it for me b4 Christmas.

My biggest complaint is that the left shift key isn't very sensitive, so quite often I'll be typing along, look down, and see all lower case! Another complaint is how the function keys are split into groups of 3, 4, 3, and 2 keys. This seems strange to me. I always have to look down before hitting function keys. Another complaint is how the Home, End, Ins, etc. key cluster is layed out. I can't seem to get used to that for some reason. Is it just me? Other than those minor problems, the keyboard is GREAT!

Who was the brainiac who thought that one up?If you are a slow typer who needs to look at each key before you press it, then this keyboard is for you. But if you have been typing a long time, and can type without looking at the keyboard, then you will find yourself always hitting the wrong buttons.Please Logitech, use the STANDARD KEYBOARD FORMAT for your next keyboard.

I've followed the instructions on the logitech support site to reinstall the systems (take out batteries, press button on receiver for 15 secs., install one system, wait at least 20 mins., install the second system), but the problem doesn't go away.

Not trusting my own reaction, I passed the book around our core group of peace educators. The bullet is adorable, and therein lies the rub. If I were a young child, I would want to find a gun RIGHT NOW so I could play with the cute little bullet and look down the barrel to take a peek into her wonderful gun house. Towards the end of the book, the stray bullet is pregnant with a baby bullet. The illustrations are beautiful and the author's sincerity was never doubted, but the intended age level is in no way sophisticated enough to understand that Ms. Bullet is an attractive nuisance and not a potential playmate. For those looking for a good gun education book for young children, I would recommend Guns Are Not For Fun, which we also bought through Amazon, not nearly as pretty but delivering an unambiguous gun safety message."},{"rating":"1","title":"??","review":"This book came up in a related items search as I was looking for a book for my young nephew.

The Portait Studio Satin papers made by Jet Print also produce excellent photos--just not as glossy.One thing I discovered, the Jet Print Premium Photo papers don't produce as good of a picture as the Professional paper.

I think now that it is because the diameter was too small, it was lightweight & the blade was not sharp enough.NOW THIS ONE IS PERFECT! It fits the large hand of a man very well . We both thought it was great that it really is not possible to cut yourself if you use it properly & pay attention. (If you look away with a sharp knife you'll be minus a finger, too).

I have misunderstood them many times, and after reading parts of this book, I have realized what went wrong.Deborah Tannen has effectively shown the differences between the communication styles of men and women. Although it doesn't tell either sex how to better their communication styles to close the gap, the book uses many examples of situations that people have encountered and can relate to which will help them better understand things that have happened in their life. It answers a lot of questions for a lot of people. This book is fairly easy reading, but you have to be mature to understand what is being said.

It's just too much time spent on sexes relations instead of real communications problems. Of course, difference of male and female styles of communication is a problem, you have to keep in mind, but this is not the ONLY problem. Reading the review on a boook I expected advice on improving my communication skills, not to hear a bunch of regular feministic stream of accusations of the business world.

I would give it zero stars if I could."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and piratical book","review":"Working as a technology consultant for various rural hospitals and clinics, I have been able to put into practical application many of the principles expressed in this book. Not only with my own team, but also in order to guide and assist the ground-level managers at these medical facilities. This book is packed full of excellent ideas and concepts which are backed up with wonderful illustrations to help us visualize and understand the concepts presented."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money. (ZERO Stars)","review":"Complete waste of $22. A sometimes amusing read, but ultimately of little practical value. The book is an overly simplistic re-hashing of basic customer service tenets that doesn't say anything new.Beyond basic cutomer service focus (a critical success factor for ANY business), the idea that Disney has anything to teach us about how to run hosptials is a stretch, at best (and a more likely a counterproductive fantasy). A hospital is not a luxury resort, an operating room is not a ride, a surgeon is not a cute tour guide in a uniform. Nobody dies if they can't afford to go to Disney World.There is a lot that can be improved in our hospitals and our healthcare system, but I hope we can find better role models than the Disney Corporation.There are much better and more appropriate models for quality service delivery in healthcare. The simplistic thinking behind the premise of this book is not going to tell you anything you shouldn't already know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good but perhaps a little oversimplified","review":"Our group recently had a workshop on how to improve patient satisfaction. We were tasked with reading this book. I found the book very helpful and it motivated me to try even harder to improve the experience of my patients. It even made me want to take my family to Disney. Many of the concepts make sense and can be implemented on an individual level. The majority of the concepts would seem to require buy in and implementation from an entire institution. At times I think the author might slightly over simplify how easy some of the concepts might be to implement. I still found the book very helpful and it motivated me in a positive way. Most of my colleagues also enjoyed the book and found it helpful. Many of us are perhaps a little jaded so it's impressive what a good reception we all gave this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical","review":"Lee's book is practical and an easy read.

When I got it, one lead was pulled out of the socket. I found a pin extractor and re-affixed the lead.

I was very disappointed, however, because many of the photos appear to be touched up or otherwise stylized somehow. There are many very blurry images and various double or multiple exposure shots. If all the photos were like the one on the cover - simple, real, excellent photos of horses - the book would be worth the money. However, only about 1/4 of the photos are that way. This seemed to me to be more like a rich person's coffee table book than a true horse lover's book - for those who like \\"artistic\\" renderings rather than the real thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEAUTIFUL","review":"Eastman has done a fabulous job!

But if this was his goal I feel Eastman failed terribly. In my opinion it is a collection of blurry out of focus shots most of which should have been left on the darkroom floor. If you want \\"art\\" I guess this book is for you, but if you want photos of one of the most beautiful animals in the world look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I've been looking for a equine coffee table book with amazing photography.

Probably a fine book for a non-horsey person who is just fascinated by any horse photos but if you are a horse person - this is not it and I returned the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice . . . if you're into digitally manipulated photography","review":"I have to say, this book was interesting to look at, but not what I was expecting for equine photography. In this case, the author took very basic and quite bland photos and digitally enhanced them, creating more of a work of art then an actual photograph. It is common to see pictures of white horses with darkened backgrounds, or severly blurred images that either direct you to a small focal point or have no focal point at all. All of the pictures have been changed to either black & white or sienna brown. As far as spectacular equine photography goes, I would stick to the masters, such as Gabrielle Boiselle, Robert Vavra, etc. that do it without Photoshop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good information but lacking visuals","review":"This book is a good compilation of Richter's work.

The album without the bonus tracks is, for lack of a better word; rad. Too bad Grandaddy sends so much material overseas, it makes it hard for americans to get there hands on these jewels. Why wouldn't they just put the bonus tracks on the american copy? Maybe because they don't fit the overall theme of the rest of the album lyricly.

Now he returns in a story about rabid cats. A politician is attacked by a cat and although tests on the animal are negative, the governor still dies of rabies. Was it an unfortunate accident or was the governor murdered? City politics and budget problems continue to plague MacDonell. To complicate matters further, the FBI suspects foul play by MacDonell or someone on his staff. INDEX OF SUSPICION is a well-written, intriguing mystery. The characters are believable and dialogue sizzles. But you get more than just an entertaining read. As in CANIS, Bob Armstrong's expertise shines through. He continues to educate his readers, this time on rabies and how it can be contracted (you don't have to be bitten by a rabid animal), as well as life in the trenches at an Animal Control Center. This was an excellent follow-up in a great series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work all the time","review":"This product works well when it works.

This is a great view into the world of UK crime and the accompanying dialogue is well constructed in the language of those involved. From loan sharks to secret hideouts, this book leaves no stone unturned. The reader clearly understands this is a book about breaking the law but the effort which was put into producing a Pound note that was passable in any location was stunning. Mr. Jory successfully tells his story without making the book an ego trip and he infuses aspects of his personal life that make him seem like a very average person who just happened to stumble on to a way to make more money (literally) than he had ever imagined. I definitely recommend this book for fans of the true crime genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Beat Generation from most of the way inside","review":"Victor Bockris has a knack for being around interesting people and his essays and interviews of the Beat Generation celebrities are legendary.

Beat turns to Punk, and this book comes to market.

It does not clean very well, but does the everyday job of picking up dirt. My ex-wife got it and still using it. I need to get one. Wasted hundreds on Hoover and Dirt Devil's upright too. Purchase 3 Hoover in my life time and are not happy. 3 strikes, your out Hoover. I'll get a Eureka canister vac for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"A dog and light colored carpeting don't mix well","review":"After much research I purchased this cleaner. I had planned on getting the Little Green Machine but due to the negative reviews I changed my mind. Since I received this little Hoover gem I've used it on the worst kind of doggie messes and was amazed!!! I'm a senior citizen with mobility issues and was delighted to find that, even when filled to capacity, this machine is lightweight and sooooo simple to use. Easy fill, easy dump out, easy storage and gets those spots out quickly and efficiently. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the hose doesn't come off so it's just a tad cumbersome to fill or clean out. However, it is very easy to clean the inlets and outlets even when they're full of dog hair. I seriously don't think you can beat the price or quality of this Hoover product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Cleaner for the Money","review":"I just got this today to clean up a mess my cat made on my couch. Like other reviewers said, this does NOT create steam, but instead uses hot tap water (I'm not sure why they named it \\"Steamvac\\").It worked well and cleaned up the spots on my couch. There was plenty of dirty water in the recovery tank, which proves that it does suction. Many small cleaners like this spray solution on, but don't suction it back out.I didn't think it was overly loud, considering it is a vacuum. It is very light and easy to carry. The only reason I didn't give it 4 stars is because it doesn't have a rotating brush to help scrub out stains. Of course, I knew this when I bought it, but it would've been a nice feature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little machine!!","review":"I absolutely love this machine! With a dog, 4 kids and a grandchild, we are always having our little \\"accidents\\". I don't think it is extremely loud as others have said, but agree the cord could be a bit longer. I can't believe how well it cleans spots. So well, in fact, it sometimes leaves a nice clean spot and shows how really dirty the surrounding area is. Sometimes I hate to stop! I just wish I could find a full size cleaner this good and for such a reasonable price! If you're looking for a spot cleaner, this is the one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use and Really works!","review":"After we built our house and filled it with white carpeting, I realized how much I was going to spend keeping it clean. With a 3 year old and a small dog, this machine has kept my sanity. It works best when you use it as soon as you can after a spill or puppy \\"accident\\". Also, it works better when the water you add is REALLY hot. It even got out some stains the movers left that the professional company could not get out. I love how easy the machine cleans up afterwards too. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was I think the cord is too short. If you have an extension cord this wouldn't even be an issue. One review said it was really loud, it's no louder than a regular vacuum and I think to get the suction you need to lift out a stain you have to expect a little noise. GREAT PRODUCT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I bought this item based on the mostly glowing reviews posted & was totally excited to use this for existing stains/future stains.

This record is a little more artsy than \\"Streethawk\\" but the great hooks are still there. It seems like they wanted to shake away all of the Bowie comparisons, and they did a great job of it while maintaining their style and distinct sound. Fans of Destroyer will not be disappointed, nor will people who've never heard them. If you are new to Destroyer, I would recommend buying \\"Streethawk\\" first, but if you're into more experimental rock/pop buy this one immediately. \\"Streethawk\\" is a lot more accesable and lives up to the \\"Hunky Dory\\" references.So to make a long story short, Destroyer is a wonderful band and definitely worth checking out. This is a record that definitely gets better with time (even though it's great on the first listen) and if I had written this review 2 weeks from now I would probably give it 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"born to sing","review":"this is not a 1942 movie born to sing with leo gorcey the other guy is wrong... this is a new singing lesson dvd..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abdominal cramps","review":"The taste is good and I like the amount of protein.

The sound of the recording is just too heavy. If the production had been better, this CD would have been more listenable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complex and Beautiful","review":"It is hard to overstate how much impact this album had on me. Amon Tobin captured everything I love about electronic music here, composing a dynamic, dark and often surreal sound-scape. \\"Slowly,\\" my favorite track, is a beautiful, somber experience that effortlessly blends jazzy notes with a down tempo beat. \\"Four Ton Mantis\\" is a fantastic and eerie piece with alternately slow and driving beats that you can't help but be enraptured with. \\"Rhino Jockey\\" seems to swell with breathless excitement with its hard hitting, relentless energy. \\"Get Your Snack On,\\" \\"Golfer vs Boxer,\\" and \\"Chocolate Lovely\\" are also not to be missed. Of all of Tobin's excellent work, I believe Supermodified is truly his best. You are doing yourself a disservice if you skip this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"His best yet...","review":"I've got both Bricolage and Permutation by Amon Tobin, and can say that Supermodified is the best of the lot. Nobody has mentioned the first track yet, but it is KILLER. Tight loops with amazing live drum samples and wikked smooth bass.While I enjoyed Permutation, I found it to be a little rough around the edges... the breakbeats and jazz samples just didn't melt together perfectly as they do on this album. Supermodified sounds like more thought went into the tracks, and when he cuts loose some of the freshest beats, the mix is unstoppable. Get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Some comparisons","review":"I haven't even finished the album yet, but I dig it. It's got a dark ambient feel, almost industrial like a Meat Beat Manifesto, but it's fairly playful and flowy like the Orb. Also, after only four songs its seems pretty consistent in quality. Oh, it's also got a hint of Aphex Twin from a experimental angle, but it insn't as harsh. First time I've heard bought this artist by the way. (hope this was helpful...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"a new soundtrack for F.L.'s Metropolis","review":"This album ,a surprise release-I did not realize it would come so unexpectedly- has a more volumetric sound to it than his other albums. It may not be better, but as an individual in the architectural profession i find it has a quality beyond groups like Panacea who search for a structural and architectural quality in music (it usually, unfortunatly sounds like a buzzing Air window unit with an occasional digital sound effect! Pretty bad interpretation if you ask me). If anyone ever does a remake of the classic Metropolis this should be the sound track to the remake!Oh!-pick up Bebel Gilberto's \\"Tanto Tempo\\"-1st track is with Amon Tobin, 9th track with Theivery Corps.-great Bossa Nova stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Supermodified - CRAZY GOOD","review":"This has to be one of the best electronic albums I've ever listened to. Amon Tobin's first 2 albums were pretty good, although a bit inconsistent. But Supermodified is his crowning achievement. The sounds are deep and rich, and the way he layers them together makes for a fantastic eargasm. This album has soul. Unlike other electronic stuff, Amon Tobin is jazzy. You can definately tell he's from Brazil.The first 3 tracks are so good they'll make your head spin. \\"Slowly\\" is a masterpiece - in the same vein as \\"Nova\\" from Permutation. I get so excited listening to this album I'm afraid I'll hurt myself. Exercise caution when driving cus you're liable to get a speeding ticket.But seriously this album is excellent. It restores my faith in humanity that there are people like Amon Tobin out there making music like this.Oh yeah, look for the import version, or the Slowly single with \\"Bad Sex\\" on it. that's a good track too. It has a guy going \\"Ay, chihuahua\\". ha."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Artist","review":"I believe there are very few true artist in this day and age and Amon Tobin is one of them. Original, chic, innovative, unique, beautiful... absolutely beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Down-tempo at its absolute finest.","review":"This would have to be one of the best albums I've ever bought. Amon Tobin is a genius with a techno-jazz hybrid sound. I adore the first 4 tracks on this album, as with the first 4 tracks on Bricolage, which has a slightly darker sound than Supermodified. Similarly to Bricolage, Supermodified becomes more abstract the further in you listen, which can be considered either good or bad, depending on your own musical tastes. However, I'm not a huge fan of abstract down-tempo, but I am still able to consider this one of my favourite albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enough to chew your fingers off","review":"Amon Tobin is an electronic wizard and if you haven't heard or understood this by now \\"Supermodified\\" in another powered example.As if Fila Brazillia moved too a neo appocalyptic interface with some violent Richard James and made thier own set of \\"A-pexed\\" Twins. Amon Tobin makes music so unique to downtempo, dub, electronic music that even the eclectic soul or maybe even rivethead and D&B raver culture would celebrate Amons terribly haunting and unique style.For even further effect try his untouchable \\"Out From Out Where\\". While you may truley enjoy \\"Supermodified\\", you may want to eat \\"Out From Out Where\\" like its your last electronic meal."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New and Impressive Style","review":"Although the predominant choice is for traditional (i.e. non-synthesized) instruments, the album still maintains an overall techno feel. Most songs contain a number of unexpected interruptions, syncopated drum patterns and lumbering gypsy beats that somehow manage to keep it all together. Think of Aphex Twin's \\"I Care Because You Do\\" played in a chamber music setting. Tobin manages to combine a very diverse set of influences such as rock, jazz, techo and even classical into a new category unto itself, which means this is very original stuff. Upon first listening it's good and then it grows on you from there. The excellent production and mix deserve recognition here as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Focused, Easily Understood Physics Review","review":"This text was the only book that I used to study for my physicsexam and I passed the first time!

You will listen to this, if you're a guitar player, and be inspired; but you'll find that inspiration fully realized in Kaki King and Don Ross, not on this CD. To be fair to Hedges, he died too early to do that for himself, but I still doubt he would have achieved the perfection of Everybody Loves You or Passion Session.

When he is playing solo guitar it is excellent. But on too many of the tracks, and most of the long ones, Hedges adds other instruments and the result is very spacey, mellow sounds that are indeed too much like elevator music. Very boring. This is a shame because Hedges obviously has more to offer. The After The Gold Rush cover is so slow and dull it begins to annoy after about 2 minutes. On other tracks, the popping percussive hits on the guitar can be sometimes a bit jarring, but after hearing them several times you get used to it. If you get this cd, plan to program your player to play only 3 or 4 tracks which are very good. Nothing bad here, but too much is boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"good tune but tracks","review":"The tunes were great but several tracks skipped.

He will be greatly missed, especially in October when he would come to my neck of the woods in New Jersey.

This early solo effort is notable by its minimalistic approach. So many composers throw lots of notes on the pallette - Mark uses notes & colors sparingly, and still produces a strong statement. Of particular interest on this album is his use of trumpet. Even though it's his major instrument, he chooses to use it primarily as a background instrument in many of the tracks.

I saw the live Met production and last year a Live in HD rebroadcast - now I have the DVD to savor. Dessay absolutely shines in this opera - her timing and expressions are unbelievable! Watching the live production, I saw Florez get a standing ovation that wouldn't stop until an encore (!) was sung - he's that amazing.

The Orchestra was spectacular with not a weak spot in the entire opera, crisp, clean execution, and magnificent musicality. The support singers were also better than you can imagine. I was unfamiliar with this opera until I saw this production, and can't for the life of me imagine anything more thrilling!

This one is the best we have ever seen. Juan Diego Florez hits all his high Cs effortlessly and he is a beautiful young man. We understand giving him a standing ovation in the biggest opera houses of the world. But Ms. Dessay is fabulous! Her voice is perfect, her bel canto presentation flawless and her comedic actions show us what Donizetti had in mind when he wrote the piece. The pair are both slim, young and lovely to look at and one could believe them as teen aged lovers...this was the part that always bothered us with Sutherland and Pavarotti. We sent gift copies to a friend and a relative and hope for more from this pair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best version","review":"I regard this version as superior to the one with Ciofi because Dessay is in fact a better singer than Ciofi. Florez needs no introduction since he is the reigning light lyric tenor today. Some complain that his voice has a \\"nasal\\" quality but in fact that is simply one of its unique identifying features. Most very great singers had uncommon voices, perhaps even ones with a few \\"defects\\", that served to make them unique. Callas for example, and Melchior. There are lots of voices with nothing distinctive about them, but Florez is not in that group, fortunately. No praise is too high for his art or his unique vocal instrument."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frenetic to the point of ugliness","review":"After reading all these reviews I too am in the minority. I have seen about 130 operas but must admit this is not in my top 100. To be fair to the opera I should probably watch it again. First the sets were horrible and Eurotrash like. I found Natalie's frenetic behavior annoying...cuteness to the point of ugliness. And I found the entire score unmemorable. I wish I had the Sill's performance to compare it to. I just did not enjoy the opera comedy. I always pictured Jeanette MacDonald in this role, someone with a little more elegance who could win the adoration of an entire regiment. Lucille Ball on uppers is just not fun in an opera. But I will give it another try.

Often, however, the most readable first-person narratives leave something to be desired in breadth, since a single real person cannot be everywhere and have opinions on everything. Unless, it seems, that person is Eleanor Roosevelt. Her voice in her 'My Day' columns is authoritative, compassionate, wise, and insightful. Her opinions and philosophy on politics and diplomacy, both national and international, seem to me very pertinent to some of issues we face in our world today. Since I read this book, I have found myself hypothesizing about what she would have thought about some current happenings as I try to make sense of them. The editorial introductions to each year and each article excerpt in the book are well-written and provide the right amount of context to frame the excerpts without distracting from them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real pleasure and an insight into troubled times","review":"I recently picked this volume up when I visited Val-Kill her house a few miles away from the Hyde Park mansion. For many years the first lady shared her thoughts on current events and encouraged Americans to look upon racism and other social evils with shame. This is a good selection of her My Day columns which revolutionized opinions in America and remain an important testement to the power of free speech in this country."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Way to Learn Some History","review":"I found this an interesting way to learn more about Eleanor Roosevelt, FDR and the politics of that time. Given the tumultuous times we live in, to read about overcoming the obstacles of the United States' past in Eleanor's words were both comforting and revealing. I began this book knowing somethings about her achievements and finished the book knowing much more about the details of her philosophies and how the world looked through her eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprised people like this book","review":"I am so surprised people like this book. I was expecting whole entries from her newspaper columns with maybe some editorial here and there. This book is nothing but a bunch of editorial with snippets of her columns (and I'm not sure that I would ever consider them the \\"best of\\"). I found a gem here or there but am SO disappointed in this book. I love to read about Eleanor Roosevelt and was looking forward to reading HER words, HER thoughts, and this was far from a book of that. SO disappointed. I have rarely rated a book so low. The only reason I keep reading is to see if I can find those \\"gems\\". If you're looking for Mrs. Roosevelt, in her own words, don't waste your time or money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Compare realistically with other speakers before buying.","review":"Well I did just want to buy a Soundman X2 for my new PC. I did base my choice on this Amazon product reviews which was overwhelmingly with an average of 5 stars, but I was dissmayed by the actual product regarding performance. I finally did compare it with Yamaha Power Cube ACS 45 and the performance is much further better: specifically it's bass and volume is better. I'm not promoting any brand here, I just want the consumers to try and compare it first with other products before buying this Soundman X2."},{"rating":"2","title":"It looks great! But sounds better!","review":"I've been searching for the ideal speakers for my computer and after look for along time I've decided to go with logitech. Though it is not as well know (in the speaker market) as Cambridge (creative) it does produce a great sound. When I saw the two satellites I thought \\"how small\\" and I started to regret the choice, but then as I plugged them in.... \\"WOH\\". The sound quality is amazing! Everyone loves my speakers, cause they look cool, but better than that it sounds great.The sub-woofer gives a great bass (very good, as good as they come, for the size and price), satellites give a bigger sound than the actual size of the speaker.Last of all the speaker don't have an on/off switch. It turns off when no sound is coming through (a timer, fuse, or something)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sound With Style","review":"These speakers will provide you with rich vibrant sound that you could not even dream of getting from even stereo system speakers. They are nicely compact and fit in almost any nook or cranny, despite looking rather large on the pictures, but do not think that size matters, because the satellites crank out some great mid-range sound while the subwoofer gives you liquid bass. Great sound for games, MP3, or any application that takes advantage of audio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sound for the Money!","review":"Before buying these speakers I researched amazon's customer reviews (I've found them very helpful in the past). Once again, the reviews I read were accurate. These speakers deliver quality sound with very good, deep, bass for less than many of the speaker options on the market. So far so good - I've only had them a couple of weeks, but I highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"history of magic","review":"What an interesting video about the origins of magic.

Had a gift certificate and was tiredof dragging around a cord. The perfect set up. What I recieved wassimply this: one of those car vacs with a long handle. Just deserts I suppose, for the price what could I expect. If you are thinking of cleaning anything heavier than dust and maybe some hair off of an area rug than caveat emptor, baby. Moreover, it's built with the same flimsy construction of a car vac. Hoover should be ashamed. I still think the idea of a cordless vacumn makes sense but wait until a real one comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK . . .for about a month","review":"Considering the excellent reviews, I purchased this vacuum for our tile and area rugs. I have never had good luck with cordless vacs, but it had been a few years, so I figured technology had improved. It was so-so for about a month, and then simply lost its \\"oomph.\\" It no longer is able to pick up cheerios, let alone cat hair. Most of the time, it just moves the dirt from one spot to another. A real disappointment that has since been replace with a hand-held Oreck vacuum (it won't pick up a bowling ball, but at least it picks up cheerios!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Convenient for Quick Jobs","review":"Although it can by no means compared to my Wind Tunnel for thoroughly cleaning the house, it helps to maintain my floor in between those big cleaning sessions. I have 2 cats and a toddler, and this is very convenient to get out because it's lightweight and cordless. It works on my wood, tile and area rugs, but not too effective on the plush carpet. It does an ok job of picking up cat hair, kitty litter, and lints. I do wish that it's stronger because sometimes it won't pick up immdiately and just push things around, but emptying out the dirt cup usually improves things. I am always amazed at the amount it sucked up in the dirt cup. However, it is a real pain to empty out the dirt cup. Usually the dust go flying all over the place, and it's somewhat messy and difficult not to spill some. Overall it's a nice little gadget well worth the money, but there's definitely room for improvement."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK for what it is.","review":"Has the power and life I expected from a rechargeable (enough to do quick cleanup on small kitchen floor). There are a couple of design flaws that will make me look elsewhere when it's time to replace this one. It's very difficult to get the broom on the charger so that it makes a connection. Also, when you don't line it up just right you can force the adapter plug out of the base which means you have to unscrew the entire mount and reposition the plug in the base. My mother in law has the Eureka which is just as good and has a much better charging setup. I get that on next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I had this cordless stick-vac only a few months before it completely broke down. A flimsy, unreliable product. Even when it worked, it's weak power and sieve-like filtration were a bad joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"I was so disappointed when it arrived. We have a black and decker hand vac that is so much more powerful than this one. It picks up better than this Hoover! I am in the process of sending it back. I will probably purchase a Dirt Devil. We had one for 6 years before it broke. It worked great! I wanted to try the Hoover because it's cordless, but I'd much rather deal with a cord than not be able to pick things up. The vacuum is also built too close to the ground. If you run over things like beads or popcorn, it will just push them out of the way. You have to lift the vacuum over it to pick them up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for quick clean ups, of light dirt.","review":"I've only used this product once, but I can tell I'll be using it in place of a swifter sweeper. My dogs shed alot, and a single swifter isn't enough to pick up all the hair. This electric broom works well at picking large amounts of hair from both hardwood floors and carpet. It's bag isn't big enough, nor does it have enough power to be a replacment for a regular vacuum, but that isn't what it was built for. It's very light, and strong enough to use for quick pickups of dog hair and other light dirt in between more involved cleaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"This is the first bleach filler arch in the series and besides the negative reviews from other customers i absolutly loved this box set and if you are planning on collecting the whole bleach series it would not be right to skip this season or you will have an incomplete collection.

What about Snoop Dogs laughable attemp at saying the most curse words in a one minute interval? I will admit that the movie may have gotten a few chuckles out of me, but I'm clueless to why it did. The security ladies carried the movie and they werent ever major characters! And theres the kid we all dislike who turns out to be a music director. Sighs, again.Really people, why was this movie made? I would be glad if anyone could answer me that, seriously.

This filmed minstrel show, aimed directly at white teenagers who want to act \\"cool\\", is astoundingly offensive to any black person with a brain and pride.Snoop Dogg takes a break from making his porno films long enough to \\"star\\" in this tribute to ignorance. He does drugs, objectifies women and acts like all the other black rapper/losers you've seen on MTV a million times. Tom Arnold is also in this mess, doing his \\"Stupid White Guy\\" routine while the godawful rap soundtrack pumps away in the background. There are also other shameful, tasteless performances by black actors/actresses who should know better. Why anyone should waste their $$ watching this drivel is beyond me.If you are a white kid between the ages of 14 to 21, wear your baseball cap on backwards, dress like a homeless clown and end every sentence with \\"yo\\", then this film is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"There was nothing lower than one star...so...","review":"Soul plane was elected worst movie of the year.

It is racist even to the black people that made it. And is a waste of time, and waste of money. Check any review online this movie just SUCKS!!!

I am black man who found this movie highly offensive but I think anyone in their right mind with even a ounce of intelligence would find this movie a bit hard to watch. It's taken us a long time just to prove that we can be every bit as capable and intelligent as anybody else especially in the movie industry and now we have garbage like Bringin'Down Da House and this movie.

Yonge.\\" There are two tables of contents for some reason, one with page numbers and one without. The first paragraph of each section is left justified, while all other paragraphs are fully justified. All in all, a fairly sloppy production job, perhaps done mostly by a machine.

Control is also good, and while you can only shoot one shot at a time, one can learn quickly how to time those shots to increase the attack rate. I also found the cycling color effect during the title screen to be a lovely little touch. If you can find this game mint in box, then there is even an amusing Atari Force comic book that comes with it.

The writings and theories covered include those of N.H. Wiesel, Samson Raphael Hirsch, Rabbi Israel Salanter, A.D.

Also, the blood is really lame - more of a slime than a liquid.

This means that if you are backing up a 15gb drive, nessecitating 12 CDs and CD # 10 is rejected, instead of asking you to insert a fresh disc and going on, the whole thing stops and you must start with 12 new, blank discs, and you are the proud owner of 10 shiny new coasters!

In reading this book I found as much help for my own heart as I did for my other children. They have all read this book and have found it very helpful. I read and reread many passages and highlighted some that I needed to refer to quickly when I am in need of a helping hand.

I tried to grate mozzerella for pizza and the top flew off, spraying cheese everywhere. I called Kitchaid and they suggested I had a faulty item, and offered to exchanged it. The same thing happened with the next one.. and the next one... To Kitchaid's credit, they handled the exchanges very well. Finally, Kitchaid replaced my food processor with another model - a 12 cup smaller version, which has been fabulous, and grates mozzeralla just fine. I called recently to find out if they have addressed this design flaw as I really liked the idea of such a large powerful machine, but was told the design was not changed. I feel it is irresponsible of Kitchenaid to keep selling a product with an obvious problem.

The tech aspect of the novel was not too deep and futuristic but played along nicely with the real world background needed for a story of this kind.

It would not have taken a lot of research to find out that it is NOT dark at night in late November at McMurdo Station, Antarctica (there's 24-hour daylight at that time of year); and people can't fall into cavernous crevasses on the annual sea ice (there is a few feet of ice then the ocean). But as frustrating as the errors can be, they are soon forgotten as the action and drama of Icefire keep the pace sizzling. You can't enjoy a thriller if you get caught up in plausibility and facts. This story gets you caught up in the plot and characters--which is the mark of good story-telling. A very entertaining read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Great book.

Go on, make a ridiculous movie out of it, but don't pretend that it has any credibility as a novel. While the plotting is somewhat compelling, the characters are shallow and the dialogue is trite. I cannot judge the feasibility of the tidal wave creation by nukes and the ensuing carnage, etc, but their clumsiness with other details such as military rank and yields of nuclear weapons destroys one's confidence in the rest of their material. (They twice refer to a weapon as 5.5 megatons, but then call it 550 kilotons and they get the relative strength of a 20 megaton bomb and the Hirshima bomb wrong, also by a factor of ten.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"super wide super Kodak","review":"the lens is sharp to the edges without distortion. sharp, sharp, sharp! excellent all glass quality, and it looks neat. people stop to ask me about it (i do scenery shooting) and it looks impressive.as with any large lens, it partly covers the cameras built in flash. the flashes on any camera would not brighten the wide view anyway. the camera's normal built in wide angle is wide enough for indoor shots.in sum, love the lens and it is a great price! great Kodak quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good lens","review":"I was looking for a wide angle lens for my Panasonic FZ-50 camera.

I just have a couple tips for a better manicure1. Always put a color under the shatter.2. Always let the color under the shatter dry COMPLETELY before applying shatter.3. You might consider putting your shatter in the fridge for about five minutes before using to reduce clumpiness.4. Shake well before using.5. Thinner coats make smaller shatter effects and more \\"broken\\" looking pieces. Thicker gives less broken pieces.I'd also like to mention that I did not try Mia, Sally Hansen, China Glaze etc. crackle products, only opi white shatter. If you want to get it just be careful how you put it on and follow the tips I mentioned above."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my money back!!","review":"What are prople raving about??? this product sucks!

I chose a hot pink color for the base and waited for it to dry completely, I then applied the white crackle and waited for it to dry. It completely picked up on the pink and turned itself into a light pink color of its own. My finger nails looked like Valentine's Day colors! Needless to say, it wasn't what I was expecting.

This polish is so see thru that I can see all the edges of the patterns underneath and it barely even shattered, mostly it looks like long streaky lines down my nail. So disappointed.

The condition it came in was excellent...it looks like it is brand new, and I have gotten so many compliments! The color is also perfect for light base colors, so you have a good contrast when putting black over it. I did white underneath, and it looks awesome!

The only problem is it goes on slightly clumpy, so you have to be really careful how much of it you apply. And it doesn't dry that great either, so if you do put a little too much on it just takes that much longer to set.

It's a bit too eye-catching on my entire nail unless it's a holiday or a party (even under fluorescent lighting, it catches and reflects light like nobody's business), but for everyday, I do like using this to paint on a bling-bling pink French tip on my toe nails. That's just the right amount of sparkle for me. The really nice thing about this polish is that it's PACKED with glitter... with this, I don't need to build up thick layers of polish to get the dense coverage of glitter I want. Just one coat is all I use - there's still visible nail line with 1 coat which doesn't bother me, but if VNL bothers you 2 coats will do the trick (or use a coat of white nail polish as your base, then put Teenage Dream over that)."},{"rating":"2","title":"overrated","review":"When I got it it seemed used/ a bit dried out.

As for the \\"shatter\\" it just look like someone painted black gook onto my fingernails and then dragged a toothpick through the substance to give it \\"crackles\\". It makes my nails look horrible and really cheap and honestly kind of like white trash. It is absolutely nothing like you see on videos.

Wheelock is a fine alternative to \\"Latin: An Intensive Course,\\" and is somewhat easier to follow, but either book will suit a mature individual. I highly recommend using in addition a good mid-level dictionary (Chambers-Murray being the best for size, scope, and price) as well as a good beginning reference grammar (Bennett being the most readily available, and probably the easiest to use--but you'll want to upgrade later)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needs the right context.","review":"As it is stated in the beginning of the book, it was designed for intensive seminars, and is on a four week schedule(pg. xi).

Wheelock is the best in its field, but in rapid review, Moreland and Fleischer is No. 1.

I like his writing style ... however the plot leaves a lot to be desired, many holes and unresolved threads ... i don't want to list them here because it could spoil the ending, but I think there were no fewer than 10 gaping holes in the story, plus the author pulls a cheap trick at the end disclosing evidence which would have been known from the beginning and allowed the case to be closed immediately. Apparently the lead lawyer/police did know so one has to question why it took 480 pages for them to put two and two together.However, i would definitely read another book by Lescroart ... he writes well. Just need to find one where the plot holds up better and the story is complete."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I have read just about all of John Lescroart's books and I have to say this is the worst. The plot was too thin and way too predictable for a well known author. The suspect (the husband) did all the typical dumb things which made him look guilty and the attorney chosen to represent him had never handled a murder case before. I was totally bored and after 100 pages I just skipped to the last two chapters, so I felt like I didn't totally waste my money on this book. I hope he is not losing his touch as I use to really enjoy his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Legal Thriller from the Master of This Genre!","review":"Author John Lescroart does it again with his latest legal thriller/mystery \\"The Suspect\\". The multi-talented Lescroart has given readers another literary treasure to feast on; certainly fans of his (And he has legions of them) will find this latest offering simply brilliant!The plot is strong but it is the characters that once again give his stories that something special. The courtroom scenes are what you would expect from the author but this story takes you to places that are unexpected. The suspense will hook you and you will not be able to put this book down until you finally read that last page.The American Authors Association (AAA) has made this book their top award winning choice for their 2007 book awards.

I suppose Lynch was trying to create the dumbest possible thing he could, and he succeeded. It's even worse than Dune. While I don't begrudge his compulsion to create this tripe, I'm not sure why he has it for sale.

But as for me, I adore it. I found myself bellowing in insane laughter, not just at the genius dialogue and inept storyline. But also at how relevant this film is to many morons you see in society. Is it so hard to just enjoy ridiculous and offensive humor from the man who practically invented surreal filmmaking and storytelling?Lighten up; Lynch wasn't attempting to break any new ground with this cartoon, and judging by many reviews, it seems people had that consensus.I couldn't get enough of this little treasure and would reccomend it to anyone with a vast and open-minded sense of humor.Keep going Lynch, your cult has not died yet"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I had read reviews first....","review":"I am a fan of David Lynch for his terrifically strange and usually very interesting work, in spite of the content of his films being occasionally too sexually perverse for my taste, but it seems to be one of Lynch's trademarks.

You can no longer do quick calcs, you'll press the same number twice. The key force is at least twice what it was on the 48's and clumsy at best. This machine sits in my desk drawer as a backup.

What a disappointment. I have been using a 48SX for over 10 years. When I first started using the new G I thought I could get used to the keypad (very difficult to press the keys) and the new layout (the enter key is in a different spot). The answer to both is a resounding NO. The keys cause mistakes, the enter key is the same size as the keys around it, so if your used to keying in without looking at the keyboard, look out.

The software is powerful (imaginary matrix algebra, anyone?), but the machine is a POS. The documentation is useless, and is divided into two books for even more torture! If dreams came true, the next HP calculator would have:- Body & keys like the 48G- A USB port- The functions of the 49G, but with a faster processor- ONE thick, well-written manual like the 48G- RPN ONLY!!!But dream on, because these are the days where high quality products are replaced with flimsy crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardware too slow for software","review":"I wasted my hard earned money on this calculator. I was so thoroughly disappointed in the calculator that I gave up using it. It was a total and thorough frustration. For example, if you try to graph anything with this calculator, it takes a hundred years (a little exaggeration but expresses the idea) to finish. Even adding simple integers, the calculator would chug along very slowly (e.g. 3+13). Putting the calculator into non-teaching mode (I forgot the actual name for the feature) helped a little though.What attracted me to it was the reviews here and elsewhere. There are some nice features to the calculator. The buttons are nice, the feel of the calculator is nice and the functions are fine as well.However, it is in my opinion a mistake to put this kind of functionality in a calculator without also putting in the hardware to perform the requested operations in a reasonably timely manner. This calculator is not worth more than $20."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing","review":"This entry from HP is no match for the 48 Series. The enclosed manuals are vaguely written. Case in point is converting units, or transposing one unit to another. Instead of small indicators at the bottom of the screen, like the 48 series,the HP 49 has pop-up displays which require much more time. It does look nice. but so do paperweights.

How could we know how to use it if there is no handy user's guide? Actualy there is an Advanced User's Guide which you can see only at hp.com. There is no way to have it as a book.

The HP48 is the real deal, the Rolls Royce AND the Farrari of all the calculators!!!!!!!!!!!The hp 49g has lost those qualities trying to be a poor TI wannabe. The screen is awfull you can't see properly, the keys are soft and VERY umprecise plus if you want to use the RPN entry mode you have to press too many keys at once!!!

I've been using that one ever since. However, when I got a new job doing some statistical analysis about two years ago, I decided to treat myself by buying the latest version, the HP 49G.I was sadly disappointed. Even though the processor was much faster than my previous calculator, the GUI made using it much slower. Also, this was the first calculator I ever had which would actually CRASH. That's right, it CRASHES. There's a tiny reset button on the back you can press with a pushpin when this happens. This is completely unacceptable for a calculator.After about a week of using it, I sold it on an on-line auction site and bought the HP 48G in its place. I have both it and my 10-year old 48SX now, keeping one at work and the other at home. HP makes great calculators, EXCEPT for this model. Do yourself a favor and buy the 48G instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"What is all the whining about?","review":"I recently added a 49g to my collection and after reading the complaints about the keys, my question is; why all the whining? Yes, the keys are rubber, not hard plastic like the HP calculators that I've used since the early 80s, like the 41c, 15c, 28c/s and the 48 series (I still have them all). They are still so much better in feel than the top of the line TIs that it's hard to even compare (I own an 84+ and an 89).As far as power and ease of use, this HP is head and shoulders above the competition. As an educator, I consider it very unfortunate that TIs have claimed the market in secondary education. HPs are much better examples of professional tools and I believe that they are much more prominent in engineering and scientific settings than the competition.If you don't like the rubber keys, drop the extra money and get a 50g. Don't even bother with a TI.If you want a real working tool and not a school supply, get an HP."},{"rating":"1","title":"I dont like it...MY opinion only...you may!","review":"Replacement for my old Sharp 1350...which I wish I hadn't drowned in coffee!The HP is slow at times with the simplest of calcs.

Many times I have re-input data only to find that the numbers suddenly appear.....twice!!Bottom line....Not at all confident with using this calculator and getting the right result.Rubber buttons....why????. Already rubber is getting furry on top and printed numbers wearing off. We are talking months here..not years!I really wish I'd taken this thing back the day after I'd bought it.ps I used to love my old HP67 from back in 1978, a dream to use, nice quality buttons, positive clicks."},{"rating":"2","title":"HP 49G Flexibility","review":"In using the HP 49G I have found that I have even more flexibility and options available than I did with a 'loaded up' 48GX. What makes the 49G potentially widely appealing is that it can be run on the algebraic or RPN mode. For current or former 48 users, the 49G doesn't have some of the limitations that we are used to: 128 kb port size (try 1 meg and 256 kb!), all the erable CAS functions are built in and don't corrupt the memory, you don't have to unlock alpha to move the cursor around when editing, you can select menu lists or softkeys, the overall speed is better, and with the 'out of the box' available memory the price difference between the 49G vs 48GX is more than compensated for.The downside....You have to learn new things, including key placements (you had to learn them for the 48 too), the feel of the keys is (in my opinion) the one thing that HP actually screwed up on this calculator."},{"rating":"1","title":"HP49G","review":"Screen is difficult to read--it's recessed too much.

The HP-49 is my least favorite of them, mainly because of the disappointing User's Guide. I've always been impressed with the documentation that comes with their calculators, but this one was far below their usual standards. I could hardly believe my eyes when I read, \\"In line with Hewlett-Packard's environment policy--which, in part, aims to minimise the use of paper products--instructions on how to use the advanced functions of the HP49G are not included in this manual, but are published, instead, on the World Wide Web.\\" That's a pretty lame excuse for not printing a better manual.

It can do the job, but it is not fun to use.If you must have the advanced features you can probably overlook the clumsy feel, but if like me you use a desktop PC for most of the advanced jobs anyway then buy an HP32SII or other RPN calculator and it will do a better job for 1/3 the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing HP product","review":"I've been using HP calculators for over 14 years.

The keys are horrible, they have a slippery feel and are hard to press--unlike the quality tactile feel of HP calculators past. The manual is an insult; it was slapped together at the last moment, it seemed. In my opinion, there's no way you could learn how to use this calculator effectively from such an anemic manual if this were your first introduction to an HP. This is not the HP calculator that I know. Although it retains much of the processing engine of the 48 series, the interface is klunky and the fonts are ugly.

The Introduction by Mr. Rogich is very good, as are the notes/footnotes throughout the book. Thankfully the publisher and/or Mr. Rogich did not feel it necessary to shorten the notes, but allowed for lengthy ones, and thankfully right at the bottom of the page. The Treatise itself touches most of the spiritual concepts that one might be concerned about: meekness, sexuality, gluttony, mourning, vainglory, asceticism, etc. As usual, St. Gregory is very insightful and profound. This book, however, is not really a good beginners introduction to Orthodox thought on these matters, but is more for those who already have built a solid spiritual foundation by living an Orthodox life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chevenga's going to be back -- online","review":"Look for a highly-revised and expanded version of Lion's Soul (and Lion's Heart) to appear serialized online, along with the third Chevenga book, 'asa kraiya.'

The soft piano music calms the nerves, while the tracks are not exactly lullabies that puts you to sleep. It helps plow along the quick reviewing/cramming the night before the exam. The variation of the music tempo between tracks also eliminates the monotony that can be boring and makes the collection forgettable--this is usual to other piano albums, but not this one. Jim Chappell might have composed the tracks between wide spans of time.

And I do not mean this sarcastically, but, honestly, it's better than a...um...'controlled substance' (of your choice) to (please excuse the sixties verbiage here) 'mellow you out.'

The songs on this C.D. are so soothing and have a very peaceful feel to them. I see how they relax my son into a peaceful slumber. As the C.D. player plays all night, my son also wakes up to this music. We have snuggle time in the morning before we begin our day, and this music provides a wonderful backdrop to our morning routine.

Pierre Brossard is the type of character who inspiresmixed emotions. Early in the book you feel he has repentedfor his sins by embracing the Catholic Church. As the bookcontinues you realize that Brossard has not really changedat all, and has convinced himself that his killing of the 14Jews in WWII was justified. You really feel the suspense atthe end of the book wondering if he will get away! Wonderfulbook! I would highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was hoping for a well-written page-turner, but...","review":"After hearing a very favorable review on NPR, I put The Statement on the top of my reading list. So, I was very disappointed to figure out the end before I had finished the first 25 pages. The plot held promise but Moore delivered it with leaden prose. Brossard's thoughts, repeated throughout the book, offered little insight (he didn't want to get caught, etc.) and the characters were drawn with minimal strokes.I laughed at the lone scene of brief nudity in the book. It seems as if it were inserted solely for the purpose of eliciting a blurb like \\"...a sexy, taut thriller, blah blah blah\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where was the thrill?","review":"Being a fan of WW II thrillers I was excited to read a goodreview of \\"The Statement\\" and bought it immediately.

Where was the thrill?Books like \\"Enigma\\" and \\"Fatherland\\" are what I call thrillers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and that's just the problem","review":"When you read a book that seems predictable,you expect to be proved wrong by a credible surprise ending. Moore truly disappoints because there is no surprise. What you suspect will happen is exactly what happens. To worsen matters,the reader never sees the other guilty parties brought to justice. You learn about them early on, but they never appear in the context of the plot. Ugh!One reviewer said that this would have been a better non-fiction work.I agree. He tells us much about collusion by the Church with the Vichy government during WWII. Moore didn't need to write a predictable novel to educate readers about this history"},{"rating":"1","title":"just another preacher story lacking suspense or any interest","review":"A guy is sheltered by the catholic church after killing 14 Jews during the WWII, moving from monastery to monastery for 40 years. Painted as a cold blooded killer, he is so devoid of stamina and life, his character reads like an empty bubble. After him are just as unsympathetic Jewish assassins bent on bringing justice... eye for an eye, by killing the monster. Only, I can't quite figure out whom to sympathize with. A killer is a killer. Boring, poorly written, another preacher story. Perhaps am skewed after reading a nonfiction story several weeks ago about Nazis rounding up whole blocks of poles and russians and shooting people on the spot. This one would have been more interesting as a non fiction account provided it was written based on solid research."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crime apologists","review":"'The Statement' is not a simple suspense novel. The reality of French war crime apologists is the backdrop of this sad tale. The book details the incredible post Second World War popular French policies of supporting and excusing French war criminals. The book follows one such murderer as he moves, in the 1980s, from one monastery to the next, avoiding capture with the help of church officials and right wing people, in and out of the government. This dark tale is more of an historical and moral tale than a cloak and dagger mystery. If you are interested in the subject, Susan Zuccotti's The Holocaust, the French, and the Jews, and Michael Marrus, and Robert O. Paxton's Vichy France and the Jews are great sources of what happened to the Jews when France became a vassal state of Nazi Germany."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garlic Press Black","review":"I have always wanted a garlic press so when I got the $25 G.C.

Such a tool to work best must apply a considerable pressure. This unit will not take it. My wife with arthritis in her hands broke this thing and in so doing I discovered how it is really made. The colored plastic on the handle is not a covering over a solid metal handle but is very breakable plastic. The metal head which takes all the force is attached to this plastic handle with a metal tip which appears to be an extension to the head is just decoration. You would think by looking at it that the handle was solid steel and no one could break or bend it. NOT TRUE. the plastic handle broke exactly where you would expect. It broke where the plastic attaches ( glued ) to the head. Not worth the price. I don't like to be fooled but I was.

This does fit fit that requirement. Further, it was the cheapest of the carry-on size strollers that we found. And it maneuvers quite ok even over uneven ground. Best is backwards due to its nice big rear wheels. One handed pushing is possible just not for very long. So, overall, we're happy.Things we'd like to improve: the fold is a rather tricky to get used to. But you do eventually figure out how to stay relatively clean during folding. We'd like the ability to raise the handle. We'd also like the ability to easily store the rain cover somewhere on the stroller even when folded. And the carry bag is cheap, cheap, cheap quality.

Many of the tracks seem to feature a single muscial phrase played over and over. Yawn!

When I brought it back to my mechanic we noticed that the ball joint's base was thicker than the original and was coming in contact with my CV joint (and has worn it down significantly) whenever I had my wheel turned fully to the left. He kindly replaced the metal clamp on my CV joint but the noise still persists. I will probably consider original parts in the future.

My son listens intently and asks me to repeat specific sections: when uncle trumpets the morning: \\"varoomaroom\\" (in your best elephant voice), and when he composes a cheerful song for his nephew (sing it to any tune you like and change a word or name here and there), it picks up everyone's spirits and the happy ending makes it fine for bed time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother with This One","review":"I purchased this CD in the hopes I would discover some well-produced Christmas stories. What I got instead are five stories with a very unimaginative narrative. All five stories are read by the same person who makes several stuttering mistakes throughout the CD.The audio is muddy as if the microphone was covered with a sock and the musical interludes are boring and sound as if they were recorded using a tin can. There are no liner notes whatsoever and no production credits.\\"Christmas Stories\\" is nothing more than a cheap production of old, venerable stories that could have been produced much better. The entire program sounds as if it were transferred directly from a cassette tape to CD. I strongly recommend AGAINST purchasing this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"An essential new-age addition to your collection.","review":"This album brought new age music into my vocabulary and it has stayed a sentimental favorite through the years. Every song on it has something new to offer and it is perfect to sit and listen to, to move to, to meditate to, or simply to relax to. George Winston's chilling and timeless \\"Thanksgiving\\" is the gem of the album (sorry, now CD....I do have it on album). The simple piano chord progression plays on memories of winter or home or truly giving thanks. \\"On The Threshold Of Liberty\\" is a very unique piece building and building to a patriotic and hypnotic climax. The simple snare and building solo horn make this piece unforgettable. \\"Shadowdance\\" is another jewel on this collection. The entire CD is like a symphony and most of the time I only put it on when I know I can listen to the whole thing. You won't be disappointed. Don't be scared off by the date...these artists were hungry then and they did things the right way. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems!!!","review":"Please be aware you are going to have to buy additional parts and use some ingenuity to keep hardware at both ends of the hose from leaking and coming off.

If you should happen to forget to release the water pressure in the hose when you are finished watering, you will later come back to a flooded house.

My dog loved his bath on the deck and actually stood still for it.One word of caution which might be the problem with some of you. Turn the water on very low it does make a very hard stream which is probably why some are experiencing leaking.

Basically it is nice looking worthless piece of junk. Now we have two brand new openers that can not open any cans.In frustration we bought cheap Chinese opener for 3 dollars at the supermarket and it works like a charm - there is no can that it can not open works every time with a nice clean cut at the edges with one single cut.KitchenAid was big waste of almost $20 for each opener - what a rip off.

A screw driver and a hammer would be as effective. It is hard to grip and cuts in random segments. How can Kitchen Aid put there name to this product is beyond me.

Very frustrating.I thought maybe we had done something wrong so I bought another just like it. About a year later the new one started doing the same things. So I tossed it in the trash and replaced it with the Swing-A-Way $8.00 opener.

I could not have been more wrong. It looks solid enough to get the job done (and in fact, the handle was pretty solid), but there is something quirky with the blade. Either it's misaligned or just not sharp enough...All I know is we hate it and threw it out after realizing we were letting something as stupid as a can opener drive us crazy! We grabbed a cheap one from the grocery store to tide us over until we got a \\"real\\" one, and I have to say it it a hundered times better than the Kitchen Aid.

I've found that my kids actually grow a lot through the experience of being in a mix-age group, with the older ones helping the younger ones and the younger ones learning from the older ones.

And as another reviewer already mentioned, it has a tendency to collect water in the handle when it is washed. When I'm scooping the ice cream, the water drips out and down the handle, thus making it even harder to grip the handle. It makes the handle slippery and my hand just slides right down to the scoop and I get ice cream all over my hand.

I've caulked four different surfaces with it so far, about twenty linear feet, all with perfect results. I'm at a loss to explain the negative experiences described by other users. Maybe some kinds of solvents harm the rubber.

Don't expect to use the tool more than one time as the grout wore down the edges almost immediately. The smoother worked well in some patches but not in others.

Sky High is one of my all time favorite albums and personally, it transports me to a time when my worries were only that of a little girl's. If something could be both energizing and relaxing, Govi's Sky High album is it. I don't know if it was merely my experience growing up in Florida, but it harkens thoughts of wind, surf, and sun.

It has a really simple, sweet feel to it, too.It is such a joy to see and hear my daughter's reactions and sounds as she watches her favorite dvd and tries to imitate. As a nurse and mother, it makes me feel so good to know that it's actually teaching and language development each time she watches it. What a joy!!

In the Dvorak triptych, Harnoncourt masterfully outlines the big tunes with plain tone colour, adopting fairly conventional tempi and resulting in extremely coherent performances. Not so here. His languid tempi (you will not be able to find any other recording which needs to spill onto a second disc) so often make each tone poem lose its structural shape, and his harping on individual melodies make things sound rather fragmentary. It is worth hearing for its entertainment and intellectual value, and it challenges your perception and conception of the piece, but not very convincingly to my ears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice, but unfinished","review":"As many other reviewers pointed out, this album feels \\"unfinished,\\" and for good reason. It's mostly demo-quality.However, the re-workings of classic Fields of the Nephilim tracks \\"Darkcell\\" and \\"Trees Come Down\\" may justify the purchase for hardcore Fields of the Nephilim fans. They've been given the proper attention. Frankly, though, I'd consider picking up the single (available via Amazon) for those tracks instead.If you're looking for an introduction to Carl McCoy's work, I'd instead recommend the Fields of the Nephilim \\"singles collection\\" <i>Revelations</i> as a starting point if you're interested in the epic guitar-driven gothic rock sound; or the fabulous <i>Zoon</i> album (under the Nefilim moniker) if you prefer a harder, metal-influenced album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fields are dead...","review":"I am so dissapointed about this new so called \\"Fields of the Nephilim\\" album. It's just another Nefilim, strange with bombastic metal guitars and double bass in every parts and songs. Not very melodic.... no no, Fields of the Nephilim are dead :-("},{"rating":"2","title":"Sour grapes?","review":"As very long standing Fan/Follower of the Nephilim I was really suprised to see on the official web site that they didn't support this album. I understand the politics of it (believe me, I've worked as promoter to the occasional big \\"Goth Rock\\" band so I know about politics!) but to me whatever the circumstances behind this albums birth you cannot take away the fact that it is actually a pretty stunning album! I saw the Nephilim for the first time at the Manchester International II in 1988, a long time ago - this album brought it all back. Only my opinion but this album I feel is well worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAIT FOR THAT WHICH IS COMING","review":"LEAVE THIS ALBUM ON THE SHELF. IT IS STATED BY CARL MCCOY THAT HE DOES NOT ENDORSE THIS RELEASE AND ONE CAN HEAR WHY.

You definitely can feel your back and ab muscles working."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks for responding Michael","review":"I have all of your workouts and love them all. I have to be honest. I think this one is your best. I think it was mainly due to the standing ab work and the music. Good music is really important to me. It keeps me pumped to continue a particularly tough workout. I'd love to see you come out with a circuit routine that has intervals of boxing, jumprope, and standing ab exercises. I can't wait to see what you come up with next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a \\"Killer back\\" workout","review":"I purchased this DVD assuming there would be exercises for both the back and abs areas. The focus is on the abs, where the back comes into play. But there are no exercises designed just to targot the back. In fact, Michael barely mentions much about the back except when talking about good form. A good cardio workout, alot of jumping in the first segment- you will feel your calves burn. A good abs and waist workout as well. There are alot of twisting moves. The exercises are very similar to tae-bo, and I would recommend a tae-bo video over this one. Michael only performs half of the exercises himself. He also seems to favor one girl over the other through his attention. I wouldn't go through this workout though, and think that it was designed by somebody who had years of boxing experience.He also uses handweights, a jump-rope, and a body bar during the workout. But its easy to manage without them."},{"rating":"1","title":"really bad if you like organized instructors","review":"This workout dvd is quite bad. Almost immediately, I realized how this man CANNOT keep count, and just rambles on and on while his 'assistants' are doing the exercises (as in, he's 'training' them, hence the title). The problem with not counting but rambling on is that the workout becomes uneven--more reps on the one side over the other. I mean, counting is pretty pedestrian when it comes to workouts, isn't it? How else do you measure your improvements? Furthermore, the workout lacks the minutest level of creativity--it's just boring, repetitive, basic movements (as is the workout with Dolores) and you're not even sure what bart of your abs some of these movements are working exactly. I'm not sure Michael knows the exact details either. No doubt he's ripped and whatever he's doing for his own body is working (I read somewhere he's a boxer), but as an instructor, I think my pizza delivery guy could pull off something more interesting and worth my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"lacking alot of video direction","review":"seems like this video could be useful, but the trainer is terrible at working the camera and makes you feel uncomfortable watching it, yet alone trying to work out to it....some of the moves were cool, but all in all i will trade this in for something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soulmate","review":"This book was terrible did not help in this day and time maybe if would have bought 10 years ago but the things told to do to find a soulmate was not how it is done."},{"rating":"2","title":"awsome!","review":"This mp3 player is the best high quality mp3 player that i ever had.the microphone is sensitive but very cool.The music is loud and clear like a cd.Everyone should buy this mp3 player.Trust me you will love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work!","review":"I am in the process of returning the Pine D'Music MP3 player to amazon.

If this is the case, then i am very upset that the manual does not discuss this inportant step to have the ability to put music on the player!

The MP3 player's digital sound is top quality, the recording feature is handy and the player itself is EXTREMELY SMALL! It fits in the palm of your hand and can be hidden in a small pocket or up a sleeve. With the recording feature, you can record conversations up to 2 hours and 15 minutes long! Music is downloaded to the player using a cable hooked up to your computers Parallel Port. There are two disadvantages to this player, though: 1.) The memory is only 32 MBs, thats about 12 songs, so you'll probably have to buy a FlashMemory card, such as the kind used in Digital Cameras, to store more music. 2.) The earbud headphones are very annoying because they tend to fall out of your ears when you are on the go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinks!","review":"First of all, the mp3 software was not compatible with my September of 1999 computer.

Then I put it in my pocket and took it to school and it lasted only 2 hours. I put lots of napkins to protect it. i was EXTREMELY careful.

And it looked exactly the same! So I went to the Trust website, and I found out that Trust's Cyberman was developed earlier than the one from Pine Technologies. So I think it's a rip-off. But what I hate most of all, is that the Pine Technologies Cyberman is even more expensive than the one from Trust. And I've seen both, and I can tell that there's no difference; not in weight, not in size, not in quality. So my suggestion: Buy Trust's Cyberman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best MP3 I've heard yet !","review":"I have listed to 4 MP3 players, and the Pine D'Music is the BEST sound quality I have heard yet on such a player.

There was nothing going on and I was tired of seeing another garage rock band. I was only slightly familiar with them. I was asked to review their first album. I didn't really know if they were from England or Ohio. They seemed like something like The Beatles and The Byrds. The guitarist had a distinct style of playing that was unique. Songs like \\"My Own Face Inside The Trees\\" are wonderful. There is a bookish and a sonic ability that is quite charming. I was into Louis Philippe a few years ago too. He arranged some of this album. That guy was really into lush productions of the 1960s. Stuff like Joe Meek and the Mamas and the Papas. Cornelius also explored this music. The Clientele seems to have created another brilliant record, that is its own world, and doesn't really care was is in fashion. They are a cool band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dreamy, floating, beautiful.","review":"I feel lucky to have discovered The Clientele, purely by chance, earlier this year.

So I hunted down a sample of the album (on another website) to see what the rest of their material sounded like. At first, I found the music enchanting and ethereal. But, by the time I finished listening to the rest of the relatively short samples, I felt a strong desire to hear something else. All of the songs bear the same tempo and textures. Furthermore, the guitarist appears to never turn the tremolo effect on his amp off. This is the type of audio effect where a little goes a long way, so I'm going to skip this one, thanks!

Could never get enough of my home-town favorite, John Larroquette.For most, though, the show started when Markie Post joined the cast; most seeing this release (Season One) would pass, saying \\"I'll wait and get a few seasons down the road\\". Shoot, many will bypass individual season packs altogether these days, awaiting the \\"much cheaper/all-at-once\\" full series run set.I just wish Warner would at least put out S2 and S3, and then decide whether or not to move forward with the whole series.

It's dark and grainy, and a little blurry, so it looks like the reults of taking an older VHS tape and transferring cotent to a DVD. I would have paid a bit more if they could have cleaned it up.Other than that, I enjoyed the series and look forward to the next few seasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"At Last!","review":"I am so excited about this release, Night Court is one of my all time favorite Comedies, and have been searching for two years for any signs of its release.

It is a \\"hot potato\\" type game, with vibration, voices, and finally an explosion at the end...that part is cute. In my opinion though, the plastic is too hard to use as it is supposed to be since play gets faster and faster towards the end of \\"hot potato\\". Our kids (ages 7, 5, and 3) were playing it and as it was going off, our 5-year-old threw it towards the 3-year-old and hit her in the head. It could also break something in the house as they whip it away from themselves, trying not to get caught with the bomb at the end of the game. We have since used it as a bomb to hide or set at someone's feet and they laugh about it \\"going off\\" as a \\"gottcha\\" type game.

Don't expect the glow to last longer than those three minutes. I kept the watch as I figured I could live without the lit decals. My previous watch lasted for about 5-7 years. The leather band on this one is already cracking and and breaking (after only 6 months of wear)- an indication that it is really old leather. It looks great out of the box, but it won't last.

And, we won't talk about all the drop cookies, meatballs, etc., that it's so wonderful for. Be sure to get this one - you won't be sorry.

First of all the box came pretty beat-up. Aside from a few scuffs to the machine, there was a broken (albeit non essential) piece of plastic not important enough to send the whole thing back. Assembly was a jiff. But when we (my wife and I) got on to use it... well that is where we departed on our opinions. The wife like the bike and did OK on the rower. I found the pedals too small on the bike and the rower was just useless... maybe I am spoiled with top-end rower ergs. But it was a bit \\"jerky\\" on the catch with a thud and the reach is just too short for a person 5+ feet. I like to have a greater range for reach and pull than what this machine can provide. I have to gove the bike a 6 out of 10 and the rower a 2 our to 10.

I actually listened to the podiobook version and really liked Brian's story. The characters were diverse and interesting and the horror very chilling. Brian could have easily veered toward the similar stories like The Prophecy movie series, but he kept it very original and therefore interesting. Overall, I really enjoyed the story and will definitely look into more of Brian's stories. If you like the Prophecy movies and stories involving angelic/demonic history and their relationship with humankind, then I recommend this.And I'm not sure what's so wrong with Brian giving a plot synopsis of his own book. He's not praising himself for a job well-done, he's just giving a plot synopsis. It'd be strange if he didn't give himself a 5-star rating... Sort of like someone running for office and then voting for the other guy. \\"Orangeburst Mistertruth\\" needs to get a clue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story, tough topic","review":"I also listened to the [...] version of Nephilim Push and greatly enjoyed it. An author who writes a story concerning religious viewpoints that does not strictly adhere to established dogma is bound to distress some of those whose dogma is being adjusted through the story.I let myself be told a story by this author - plain and simple - and I enjoyed the story for what it is. It's well written with believeable characters who react to a threat as you would expect a reasonable person to react. The story is scary, tense, and some of the characters are twisted. But, as in any good story, they all play their part - good or bad.I will look toward more of this authors work in the future and hope that others will as well.Donnie Light, author"},{"rating":"1","title":"A first","review":"This is a first.

It's a wonderful, interesting read. Delia Sherman makes the Middle Ages come alive. Through telling details and habits of speech, she shows you just exactly who these characters are, and why. And though it's sent in an oppressive era of history, she puts a woman-friendly twinge on events, filling in extant fragments of a ballad to tell of William Flower's arrival at the king's palace, his work as a cook, his ascent through the ranks, and the unexpected circumstances that led to his retirement.

Yet for every blast of cauterising noise, there were passages of eerie quiet, and increased dexterity with samples yielded organic rather than incidental effects and were employed for maximum impact. It was their finest, most consumed moment-one that has yet to be matched, even by themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"High quality worth every cent","review":"This is a great knife.

Ed Harris plays an American spy, Gus Lang. He works for both the British and Germans during the period immediately before DDAY. He is sent to Paris where a young but brilliant American officer, one of a handful of allied soldiers who knows the actual DDay plans, has been captured and is being interrogated by the Germans. The Allies direct Lang to prevent the young American from talking. The Germans use Lang to try coercing the American to reveal the Allies DDay plans. The fun of this movie revolves around not knowing Gus Lang's real intentions. Add the fact that one of the German officers involved in the interogation is working for the Allies, but which one?

We do not live in a safe country. The only thing holding us together is the grace of God. My faith soared in reading this because my trust is in Jesus Christ and not man.

Many of the details about the Korean war are interesting, as is the continual struggle between Nationalists and Communists, and the protagonist's disinterest in politics - and tunnel vision on returning home. However, I found the novel lacking in a compelling personal story, and that really did it in for me. The protagonist is quick on his feet, but not likeable, insightful, or particularly interesting. Ha's prose is stilted and cliche-filled, and left me with the impression that it had been translated (poorly). It slowed me down significantly, and detracted from the story enough that I considered putting down the book early on several occasions. Even worse, I now regret that I didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Star","review":"A disgusting book.These Chinese prisoners were well cared for and created thcir own problems. American GIs and international civilian POWs in North Korea were freezing, starving, beaten and shot on a daily basis.

This book demonstrates his skill in dealing with difficult and highly politicized situations by focusing on their effects on individuals. The situation explored here is that of Chinese prisoners in U.S. run prisoner of war camps in South Korea during the Korean War. Our hero is a loyal member of the People' Liberation Army who is subjected to pressures not just from his American captors but also from the Nationalist Chinese who are delegated some of the chores of dealing with prisoners and the Chinese Communists who continue to lead the captives while they are imprisoned. The writing is spare and mostly descriptive, but at times the emotional level goes way up and the author reveals them losing their heads over sometimes not very important matters."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Documentary Novel","review":"War Trash, a novel which is outwardly about the Korean War, is really a way for Ha Jin to explore the shortcomings of the two systems of government available for Chinese people: the Nationalist system in Taiwan, and the Communist on mainland China. As in Ha Jin's novel Waiting, political systems and their answers to human dilemmas are always lacking. When people seek to solve life's deep problems with political solutions, the results are always violent and inadequate. This novel has a documentary feel to it; the research into the era appears to be meticulous. All in all, War Trash is another major accomplishment for this writer, both clear and concise without lacking in depth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid but falls short of waiting and free life","review":"You can read many other reviews that will note the plot and progress of the book. All I would like to say is that if you are a fan of melodic writing (as most Asian American authors excel at) or just a fan of Ha Jin, then this is a must read. I would probably read Waiting, the Bridegroom (short stories), or a Free Life first. This book is a little more intense than the aforementioned trio. If you are interested in a raw look into the POW camps during the Korean war, then check it out. I mean, National Book Award and Pen/Faulkner award winner. You can't go wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"simple prose, objective, convincing characters","review":"Ha Jin has a simple, but effective prose style. He objectively utilizes historical material, while portraying convincing individuals.In \\"War Trash\\" he takes what could have been a dreary re-creation of prison life for Chinese prisoners of the U.S. during the Korean War, and makes it quite interesting without the use of melodrama. It helps that his protagonist, a young man with some education, is a very engaging personality who matures and grows in self confidence as the novel progresses. He is ethical without being heroic, much as the protagonist of \\"The Crazed\\".Ha Jin paints a chilling portrait of the Communist party during and immediately after the Korean War, while making the committed Communists in the novel nuanced individuals. This is my third Ha Jin novel, and actually the fastest paced of the three (others were \\"Waiting\\" and \\"The Crazed\\")."},{"rating":"1","title":"It takes talent to make a war horror's story this boring","review":"I rarely give only one star, but I couldn't get even half way through the book.

This most sophisticated presentation of Objectivism is Sciabarra's treatment of it in his \\"Ayn Rand: Russian Radical.\\" If you can handle Mr. Sciabarra's curious thesis that Rand is a dialetical thinker, his book is the best place to go for a detailed summary of Rand's creed."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book, messed up ending","review":"I really liked this book, however, the ending did not fit. It seems Ms Hobbs rushed the ending to the point she and the editor missed some of the facts. I agree with another reviewer when she said Buttercup had just gotten out of jail but told the police she had been locked up for days in Reed's house. The other thing that was messed up was the book never revealed how Buttercup found out about Reed stealing the money from her grandmother. She was truly a bold crack head to go breaking into somebody's house by herself in a neighborhood she knew nothing about. And why wasn't Buttercup living with her grandmother in the first place? Who was living with her before Buttercup moved with her, since she seemed to be in bad shape already?

We will never forget the combination of the sun's warmth, the green forest with blue and orange wildflowers everywhere, and the magic of \\"Dusk\\". This man knows how to make the piano speak many different ways. \\"Dusk\\" is my favorite because it is pure Chappell."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Pure such an expression!","review":"This CD single, above the other So Pure singles out there is worth it because it is 4 songs. If you are going to get a So Pure, get this. The other single only has Would Not Come live and that's the same version as on That I Would Be Good. For the content of this CD...it's great. It has the album cut of So Pure and the Butch Vig remix of So Pure. This remix is about 6 minutes long I think and quite a departure. But it is good dance music. The live tracks speak volumes about Alanis' skill. The all acoustic I Was Hoping and So Pure Live are brilliantly done. Alanis is at her best, when it's her, a box, and a man strumming a guitar."},{"rating":"2","title":"The original Transplants from the 1970's","review":"This CD is by the band The Transplants who were from Boston,MASS.It is not by the band who stole their name and are made up of big label musicians.I still remember seeing this band play in Boston back in 1978 or 1979.I used to hear them on the radio back when I was in college in Boston.For at least 5 years now I have been finding more references to this band who were one of boston's first punk rock bands.All of the songs were recorded DIY with a 4 Track in a loft and at a live show.there is 75 minutes worth of music which is a great deal.I am really glad to be able to have the chance to hear this great jem from the past.Too bad that they have to share their name with a bunch of corporate rockers who bear no resemblance to this bands unique and cool approach to being original and punk rock.The founder of the band is Jordan Kratz and he is still involved in Punk Rock music.you can check out his band Big Meat Hammer who are the oldest going punk band in Maine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Maneater-Moneyeater","review":"Its time for Gary Busey to retire or chose the role after some Careful study of the script.I loved all his action movies when he was young.ANIMATED MOVIE would have been better than this.POOR TIGER - what a waste of talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Not a JAWS rip off","review":"Without a doubt this is Gary Busey's best work since Slapshot 2: Breaking the ice. I love how you couldn't tell this was filmed on location in Canada, all the actors had great midwest accents. Also the tiger shots were thrilling. The animal totally didn't look like it was just walking across the shot towards some raw meat just outside of the shot. I know i had chills. Also I love how the apple/corn festival was built up for about 1 1/2 hours and then they delivered with about 15 seconds of the actual festival. Great screenwriting!! Watching this movie over and over again helped me recover from 1st degree burns i received on over 5% of my right hand while i was making cookies last week.

It would be nice if more colors than just yellow were offered.This tassel is long enough and well enough made. It's far from the worst I've seen, but not as good as the best (Kung Fu Instruments). On the other hand, it's very convenient to get without having to do wire transfers to China.The only complaint I have, a minor one, is that the tassel is slightly on the heavy side. That means that it is less likely to wrap around your wrist if your hand gets too busy. That may be good for form competitions, but form competition isn't the reason I study.One piece of advice, the shipping cost for single pieces is outrageous. It just about doubles the price. The solution is to get together with your Jian class or practice partners and do a group buy. My study group just bought 15."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album changed my life","review":"I remember listening to this over and over again as a kid starting at 5 years old. Woe to me if my big brother caught me playing his records (he was afraid I'd scratch them). But at least my brother was generous and played this album a lot. As a little kid, some of these songs really frightened me (The Bat, He Never Came Back, Exploration in Terror), but I grew to love the whole thing. This record was a big reason why I got into being a musician in later years and took up the drums (and writing original stuff on keys) and having a moderately successful carreer doing soundtracks. I don't think there is any other album from the 60's as wacky and as experimental as this. This is the Ventures really pushing their boundaries and coming up with amazing sounds (done all on guitars - as they stress in the liner notes). This is a great example of incredible 60's guitar albums. I think it's downright historic. It was also Keith Moon's favorite record."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Your Budget A Favor, Get A Different Book","review":"This book isn't expensive and it isn't without merit, but I recommend you look elsewhere. With all due respect to the authors, this book is rather gimmicky. The flow of the book is choppy and at several points the authors drop the ball by treating various subject with a degree of shallowness that is disappointing even for such a small pocket book. One example is the treatment of credit cards. They repeat the common mantras about credit cards, but the coverage of situations not to use credits cards is repetitive and there is no discussion whatsoever of point-systems that many credit cards offer--an amazing way for a person on a budget to expand their purchasing power.I close the cover of this book feeling that I've just hung up the phone with a chatty telemarketer, somewhat impressed with their jovial presentation but feeling hardly educated by the interchange."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Opens Your Eyes","review":"The book is great!

I really like the idea of having separate monthly monetary limits on personal pocket money, family allowance and personal allowance. I definitely had the Starbucks syndrome, where I spend so much money on lunches, coffee and snacks that I was frittering away thousands a year. Having only a certain amount in cash each week in my pocket for all of these little expenses has been really helpful, and I don't have write down everytime I buy a coffee. I also really like the separate savings accounts - for the must fund, rainy day fund, want fund, and other contingencies like insurance and taxes.

I can finish most interesting books without a problem. This book is much too long, wordy and goes nowhere. It could be summarized in one page.

Other than this, it is not much help to anyone with ADD."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD REALISTIC ACCOUNT...","review":"I have ADD. I am 36 yrs old, female. I LIKED this book because it was written from a \\"Regular-Joes\\" perspective. Don't pay any mind to the guy who gave it \\"one star\\". He missed the point of this kind of book. He may not know it, but not everyone wants to read a hoity-toity physician's perspecitve on a complex condition. My experience has been, I think the people who actually HAVE it tend to have the most accurate information. It was very nice to just RELATE to what these 2 women journaled and observed through their own experiences - on the job and personally. I know ALOT about ADD ADHD and I appreciate ALL types of materials on this subject. Even when I don't agree with them sometimes, the only way you learn is by learning others perspectives. And this book is really - just that. I felt it was pretty much on target - quite honestly. I purchased the book about 5 years ago, and still use it as part of my ADD library. I find it very helpful and useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"It sends the wrong message about ADD.","review":"While this book does have moments, for the most part, it seems that it is sending the wrong message about ADD. It makes ADD seem to be something bad, something which needs to be cured by the use of drugs like Ritalin. ADD research has come a long way since this book was written, and ADD is now seen more as a blessing in disguise. It is different way of thinking and interpreting the world. It isn't something that needs to be cured. There are far better books on the subject, such as ADD: A Different Perspective by Thom Hartmann. This book, on the other hand, could actually have dangerous results for people who read it. It may have an answer, but it may not be the right one."},{"rating":"1","title":"self-help for dummies","review":"The authors write: \\"Since one of the hallmarks of ADD is impulsivity, you may buy first and think later. Simply being aware of your tendencies may help. Train yourself to stop and think before buying anything...\\" [DUH!] \\"If impulse buying is a problem, you may have to stay out of stores, cut up your credit cards or plan your shopping trips with an empty wallet!\\" If advice like this is helpful to you, then this book is full of it. I found the information here to be too dumbed-down to be useful. The \\"simulated subtypes\\" offered as examples of adult ADDers were not as helpful as the real people testimonials you will find in \\"Driven to Distraction\\". If you dont find 12-step programs with their underlying quasi-religious overtones helpful, then this book is not for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Condescending","review":"Don't buy this one. Really. I'm baffled by the good reviews. I am newly diagnosed as ADD, and of the handful of books I've read so far, this was easily the most condescending and least useful. It is written on an 8th grade level, with loads of examples of fake character studies accompanied by \\"lessons\\" that are beyond obvious. For example, we meet \\"Bob,\\" who has trouble with interpersonal relationships because he is always interrupting people. The advice the authors give is, if you resemble \\"Bob,\\" you should remind yourself to let the other person finish speaking before you speak.The authors concede several times that they are not therapists or psychologists, just people with ADD. What they fail to add is that they aren't very good writers.A better choice is to read \\"Driven to Distraction\\" -- it's way better written, has much more information, and won't condescend to you in such an exasperating and tedious way.

That there are many people out there who do and think the crazy things that all of us with ADD do. I was amazed at how many of the example profiles matched me almost word for word. My first realization was almost exactly the title of the book. The approaches for dealing with the symptoms of ADD are generally good. The only thing I didn't like is that there are many points in the book where the authors advocate lying. Not major stuff, mind you, but untruths nonetheless. Mostly excuses for behavior that are anything but honest. It would have been nice to get recommendations for actions that one could use without trading stress of ADD for stress of dishonesty."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm not!","review":"This book changed my life!I found it on the shelf of a psychiatrist friend and immediately read the whole thing.

It really did open cans easily--comparing it with the OXO brand manual can opener--but the cutter wheel is no easier to clean than any other opener. (Best bet for cleaning the cutter wheel is an old tooth brush sprayed with a non-toxic cleaner such as Simple Green. Rinse the brush, run over the wheel again, and the wheel is reasonably clean.)Now, almost a year later, this Made-in-China can opener no longer works reliably. On many cans, it unpredictably cuts for just an inch or two and then circles round the top, refusing to cut at all. For that reason, I downgrade my rating to one star.

However, the first one wouldn't open the cans very well. It felt heavy duty, but was not. I wanted this damn can opener so bad, I took it back and bought another one from a different retailer. It was horrible too. I was very disappointed. I ended up buying a Swing-A-Way can opener for 5.99 (used by NASA, but not nearly as pretty as the Kitchenaid). The cheapie works great!

It did a good job of cutting-at first. After a few uses, it is now useless. It no longer grips the cans. It slips constantly and no longer cuts. I replaced it with a Kuhn-Rikon safety opener. An award-winning opener that works every time. It's a bit pricey, but well worth it. I wish I had known about it before I bought this piece of garbage. I think kitchenaid should stick to countertop appliances."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dud From KitchenAid","review":"Initially, this can opener worked o.k. However, after about a month of use the cutting blade seemed to be sort of dull. It became impossible to get a clean cut and became more difficult to manipulate.

I bought this can opener three years ago. It was awful...difficult to use, shredded the paper at the top of the can's label, and was very difficult to get started. Because I love Kitchenaid products so much, I assumed that this was just a defective can opener, threw it away, and bought another. The second one was even worse! It worked okay the first couple of times, but now it barely cuts at all. It grinds the top of the can, making dents, but won't actually make a cut. Once I can get it started, I cannot finish it because it \\"messes up\\" the can pretty badly. This one is going in the garbage as well. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk.

The blade & gear that are supposed to hold the edge of the can, don't meet well.

While I LOVE the silicone spatulas and spoons and the rest that came in the set, this can opener was relegated to the garbage can. I tried many different times on numerous types of cans and it just never did what it was supposed to do (open the darn can). I liked the feel of it, the weight and balance are terrific, but I think maybe the blade is just too short or something. I really wanted to like this, but when the can opener I got at the grocery store works better, it is time to say \\"enough\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"It broke!","review":"It worked fine for the two or three years we had it and then...it broke. We used the can opener at least once a week, sometimes more since we don't use an electric can opener. Defective or just worn out? It's not like we opened 10 cans a day, but I don't think it was defective from the start. Eventually one of the parts became loose and the opener no longer gripped the lid enough to open it. Frustrated, I threw it out. I now see that KitchenAid offers a lifetime warranty on defective products but even if it were defective, I don't know that it's worth my time to investigate how to send it back and ship it. Besides, it's too late. It's gone and I bought a different brand can opener.I also thought the KitchenAid opener was a bit too hefty. It was also large and thus didn't fit very well in the utensil drawer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't let the brand name fool 'ya","review":"This thing is an over-priced pieced of junk. In search of a can opener that actually works for any reasonable length of time, we bought this, thinking if it says \\"KitchenAid\\", it must be OK. Wrong. This one didn't even last as long as the \\"cheap\\" can openers. TO BE AVOIDED. Only positives: as my wife says, \\"it's a pretty color and it looks nice\\". It could be used as a paper weight, or as a poor \\"punch only\\" replacement for the more functional can opener on my Swiss army knife.KithenAid should be ashamed (and owes everyone that bought this thing a refund!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to Kitchen Aid standards","review":"I love Kitchen Aid products. I have spent extra in the past just to get the item with their name on it, because I knew it would be dependable. Sadly, this is not the case with their manual can openers. I went through 3 in about a six month period. I was so convinced that I was just getting bad ones (because they were Kitchen Aid), that I kept giving them another chance.

I keep thinking that somehow a good book was lost in the translation from Spanish to English.The stories main focus is on the day to day life in captivity of the various hostages. Very dull stuff. What would have been far more interesting is the story of Escabar - and how/why he was able to rise to be such a force in Colombian society."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very confused narrative.","review":"When reading this book I kept imagining the editor who received an incoherent manuscript from a famous author about a fascinating subject matter. Possibly, a little like the Emperor's New Clothes dilemma. The narrative is confused, the segues often incomprenshible, and despite the inherently dramatic subject matter, a difficult read. Finally, I was left with no understanding of why Columbia? What social, polictical history led to and made possible this siege of kidnapping?

I know, when it comes to the 2 female stars of this movie, it is a double-dose of disaster. To have to \\"put-up with\\" over an hour with them invading the screen is intorable. Watching the movie is painful and I could have kicked myself for not walking out of the theater after the first 15 min. Then to top it of, the title song \\"Johnny Guitar\\" is worse than a dirge.

Watching this blu-ray is like watching Johnny Guitar for the first time. The soundtrack is crystal clear....all in all Olive Films did a great job.In addition to the excellent introduction by Martin Scorsese, I would have liked a commentary track or in depth documentary..............the stories about the making of this movie are the stuff of epic myth..believe me, the negative chemistry off screen between Joan and Mercedes comes through on screen in spades.

There are many classic lines in this film. The first meeting between Johhny & Vienna at her gambling saloon is filled w/ them.And whether it's a comedy, a melodrama, or a camp showdown between two very mannish women, doesn't matter.

Dr. Goldensohn's hand-written and typed interview notes were kept in boxes in his family's home for over 40 years. The interviews read like narratives - details of the prisoners themselves, their surroundings, their motives, are described in ways that read like a good story, although very chilling at times. Not surprisingly, each man conveys an unwillingness to assume responsibility for his part in the Holocaust. This is a must read for those interested in Jewish history but also for anyone who is intrigued in the story behind the story - how a young Jewish doctor from Newark, New Jersey was able to sit in a prison cell with leaders of the Nazi party and get them to talk so openly about themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neuemburg interviews","review":"I am a personal friend of Eli, and first read some of this material at his home in NY.

In an attempt to put a nice bow on a cheap package, the author tried, but failed to tie up the loose ends of each chapter. One vingette after another and still nothing note worthy. Unlike other books from this genre, \\"In Dark Places\\" and \\"A Haunting: One Family's Nightmare,\\" this particular book was at best miserable.

I would highly recommend this book; especially for anyone, like myself, who has had similar experiences in a haunted house."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's just okay.","review":"I don't like writing reviews where I thrash a book or a movie because I don't want to ruin it for other people.

I highly recommend this book for \\"amateur ghost hunters\\" like me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly surprised","review":"This is an excellent example of how a haunting should be explained, directly from the person having the experience. It gives the narration a lot more sincerity and depth. The supernatural is a fascinating topic, but difficult to really comprehend. This book gave me a better understanding as to what it must be like to live in a house inhabited by spirits, because it was told by someone who actually did."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad press","review":"I read this book. The story wasn't bad. The typing was. I don't think anyone proofread the manuscript before it went to copy! It read like a juvenile had been in a rush to type it and didn't read through it after! It took away from the thrill of the storyline! It did not look professional! I know Amazon is much better then this!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A little stretched","review":"OK, maybe it's all true, but everything seemed a little exagerated or maybe a little bit out of perspective. If some of the things the author said happened,I believe she'd have been out of there, family in tow. Being drawn to a house??? Aren't we all? Haunted or not.

I was really annoyed because who wants to look at a computer screen while performing this martial art? The introduction was odd. You see the instructor going through his version of tai chi and you have his talking head in the bottom right corner of your monitor's screen explaining his movements. It's long-winded, and inconvenient. An awful example to follow for beginners. I'm checking out Scott Coles' DVD tai chi series next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"If you want to read Margaret Sanger's book, read Margaret Sanger's Pivot of Civilization, as published by Humanity Press or as available on-line, not this chopped up attack on her book by someone with a major agenda."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This book is awful. I am writing a thesis on Margaret Sanger and wasted my time today. I cannot believe that a university library would actually purchase this book as it's the most unacademic piece on Sanger I've read. On the first page Perry implies that Planned Parenthood promotes teen promiscuity to make profit when teens need to go back for birth control and abortions. I don't have time to write a longer review, but just look at the other reviews! Half of them are by the author himself (which is pathetic, by the way). If you take out those reviews, there is no way this book would have 3.5 star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti Birth Control Slant Makes this Book a Piece of Trash","review":"I not only want my money back, I want the author to pay me for the time I spent reading this piece of trash.

I will never order from this again. Completely horrible. Think twice before you order anything again"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pygmalion by George Bernard Shaw","review":"I thought that this book was a thoroughly enjoyable read. The book depicts the common belief of the people in early 20th century London that appearance and stature is far more important than education or beliefs. This belief, although not as extreme today, is still held by many. Shaw uses the two extremes of society at that time to tell a truly fascinating story of a young, poor woman, Eliza Doolittle, who is transformed into a lady of high class and style by a professor of phonetics, Henry Higgins. Although it is a play and it is difficult to know the characters' thoughts, Shaw details their actions to the point that allows the reader to feel they know the characters and feel like they were actually a part of the story. Shaw's combination of humor and expression of feeling perfectly offset each other so that the book never bores the reader. This book is a fairly easy read and gives the reader an accurate account of life in early 20th century London."},{"rating":"2","title":"book order","review":"Ordered book on 8/22 and it was received 8/26.

They have very mild acne, the 13 year old having some more sever fare ups. They both loved this product. It was a little drying on my red head's more sensitive skin, but generally the product worked well and smelled good, as well. I would not recommend using it more than once a day--too drying."},{"rating":"2","title":"a pleasant facial system","review":"I let my room mate who has major acne problems try this and this is what she said:\\"I have found that this product meets and exceeds my expectations. After using a wide range of acne treatment systems, both over the counter and prescription, this held its ground.First and foremost, I want to remind all that this is a slow mover. It will not offer you the best results immediately. I have horrible acne, and since having a baby, I could not use any of my prescription acne medication, due to harming the baby through nursing. My once manageable acne turned really bad... then enter scene, Natures Gate, and after two weeks, my itchy and sore acne turned calm. I would recommend this product for mild to moderate acne, not extreme cases.\\"God Bless ~Amy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Sensitive Skin","review":"For being such a burly lumberjack of a man, I have very delicate skin. I figured some organic face wash would be cool for my skin. This wasn't it. I used it once, just as the directions stated, and my entire face was an enormous red blotch. I had to take benadryl to get rid of it. If you've got sensitive skin, skip this stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still waiting....","review":"Granted, not every product will work for every person, but 10 days into this and I notice no difference at all in my teen's skin. She was really looking forward to seeing the difference. I can see by the other reviews that they have had success with the product, but we have not. I will give it a bit longer and update this review if needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Far So Good","review":"Ah yes, another 3-step acne treatment system. It seems that ever since ProActiv hit the market years ago we've had the copycats. So what makes this one different? Nothing really, other than it being an organic treatment. I've been using Nature's Gate for a few weeks now and have noticed some improvement on my face, not that it was really bad to begin with. Perhaps it's too early to tell.Regardless, after following the 3-step process I can say that my face feels incredibly clean and rejuvenated. It feels awesome! I suppose that's the whole purpose of this system, right? -- to make the face feel renewed. It's worth noting too that the substances in each of the bottles smell very good! I was pleasantly surprised at the scent of each of these substances -- they each have a pleasant almost citrus-like scent.I stopped using ProActiv a while back because I just wasn't getting the results anymore. So far this one has nicely taken it's place. Give it a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not drying but didn't clear up acne","review":"I bought this after reading the review by the woman in her 30's saying it didn't dry out her skin ect. For me, this product was useless in clearing up acne. I broke out the entire time I used it. The cleanser & astringent aren't enough. I used them up over a month ago & have maybe a 1/4 of the cream left. The only good thing it seemed to do was help to exfoliate my skin keeping away the dry winter flakes that are included with my acne. Crazy, but that's me. Salicylic Acid isn't rated as being too safe if you are pregnate or want to have kids... hardly Organic!! I didn't know this until after I was using it. I will finish it up so it doesn't go to waste but will not purchase in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Face turned red like a chemical burn after using Acne lotion","review":"I used this product for a few weeks until one night when my skin had a very strong reaction. My face turned red as if I had been out in the sun all day and got burned like a lobster. The experience scared me out of ever using this product again. I guess Salacylic Acid can be harsh on some skin types, but this was worse than anything I've ever experienced. Even my Mom was scared when she saw my face and how red it was. She just kept saying over and over again \\"that's scary,\\" as if on replay. I hope this review my save other people my same fate. Be careful when using this product, especially the Acne Lotion."},{"rating":"1","title":"No change","review":"I'm prone to breakouts in the summer months so I gave this a try. My skin had the same reaction initially to it as when I used Retin-A in the past. It got a bit dry and itchy. But unlike with Retin-A, I didn't notice any clearing of the area from breakouts in the following days so I stopped using it. Can't say it was effective enough to want to try again at this point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Results in 2 Weeks","review":"I have been using this product once a day for the past 2 weeks and I'm starting to see some results. I do still have a couple blemishes but they are very mild. The areas where I normally don't have blemishes are much smoother than before. So far I haven't had any issues with dry skin, which is rare for this type of product. I have used a few other brands and this is by far the best. Just be consistent."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disaster for my middle-age super oily skin","review":"Well, I used the product with high hopes, following the steps as directed, and the first couple of times, my face felt pretty good. Steps one and two made my face feel ultra-clean--dry really--and the moisturizer made it feel good. Soon, however, my skin started to burn, itch and hurt and it had the texture of sandpaper. Ouch! Too bad it didn't work for me. I'll hand it down to my son, maybe he can get some use out of it. But I am skeptical, because I don't think he would have the patience and diligence to follow the steps and do the whole program, as it is meant to be used. If you are reading these reviews and considering buying this product, I am sure that you are motivated to give it a fair try. That's the only way you can know."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had something done that was worth every cent!","review":"Anyone fighting acne like I have for the past 2 years, theres a procedure called Levulan. It's worth it. It's like a peel, but not as harsh or drastic. My skin has cleared 98% after 1 treatment. I only purchase organic/animal cruelty free products and while natures gate is a great product, I didn't really care for all the steps to cleaning my skin."},{"rating":"1","title":"After four days, a rash developed...","review":"My thirteen-year-old daughter tried this product for her run-of-the-mill acne. After four days, she developed a rash and had to stop using it. I don't know what triggered her sensitivity."},{"rating":"1","title":"This didn't work for me.","review":"I always expect great (or at least somewhat noticeable) results with skin care regimens...so that's what I was expecting with Nature's Gate. Unfortunately, I didn't get the results I was hoping for.Honestly, I didn't see much change at all (except for a dried out face). Granted, I didn't use the product for the entire month--but I figure if I didn't see any noticeable results after two weeks, I probably wasn't going to see any after a month."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally an Organic Acne Treatment!","review":"Natural Results Acne Treatment System is a 3 step treatment system. The Corrective Cleanser had a fresh scent, produced a good lather that felt fine on the skin, and was moisturizing instead of drying (drying tends to be a problem with a lot of other acne treatments.) The Calming Toner also had a fresh scent and made my skin feel refreshed and cleansed but not oily. Lastly, I really liked the Controlling Lotion. This lotion had a different scent--almost like cinnamon--that I like. My only regret is that the Controlling Lotion does not contain an SPF.My skin appears to be reacting favorably toward these products so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: Rash!!!","review":"I've tried a lot of products over the years. Even though I don't have sensitive skin I bought this product because of it's all natural/organic image. I have a few blemishes on my face but I've never been happy with the appearance of my skin. I was hoping this product would clear my acne, smooth out my skin and give it a more even tone/feel. I used this product for about 4 days following the directions religiously. After the fourth day my skin became irritated and my face and neck broke out into a red, bumpy, itchy rash that looks and feels like sandpaper. I immediately discontinued use and it has been almost a week and the rash has not cleared up! I've read some reviews where the rash can last up to two/three weeks! not fun! I was highly disappointed in this product and I've tried a lot of different products but none of them have caused me break out in a rash like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basically the same as Oxy Ten","review":"It's a good kit, but it seems that you can get just as much from Oxy Ten at the local grocery store for a fraction of the price. The only advantage may be, as others have mentioned, that it doesn't bleach your towels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harsh on the skin","review":"For people with sensitive skin, this might not be the best product. It is similar to Proactive in price and in application but after using this product for two weeks what looked and felt like a chemical burn appeared all over teenager's face. In addition, it didn't appear to clear up any blemishes.I don't recommend this product there are more gentle products for controlling acne on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave it the ol' college try, but no go.","review":"Well, I tried to give this product the full 6 weeks, but decided to abort the operation a bit early. I'm in my 40s, have had acne to some degree since I was 9 and have tried everything, including prescription meds. My acne isn't severe, just persistent. This product feels nice, although the toner burns a bit, and doesn't leave my face dry and flaky. The smell is odd, but not unpleasant. The drawback is that now I'm getting blemishes in places where I really never got them before! I've been using this for several weeks, long enough for whatever might be \\"lurking\\" under my skin to have arrived and disappeared, but am still getting at least as many blemishes as before starting this program. Back to the benzoyl peroxide!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Made my skin SO much worse","review":"I have adult acne, and broke out worse than a teen after a month of using this. I really wanted it to work, but benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid works better than this with my positive attitude."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the greatest...","review":"I got this product for my daughter who is one of those Proactive gotta have types. I figured this product being organic would be good for her. WRONG. according to her, her skin felt greasy when she got to the last step. She claimed the smell was good, but she didn't get a clean tingly feeling once she finished, so according to her, the system was a zilch. that is it. not recommended by me at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"This works, but is very harsh on sensitive skin.","review":"I have two grandnieces with problem skin. The oldest used it for one day and stopped because it irritated her skin so badly, almost like she was sunburned. The other grandniece used it for four days, saw an improvement of a breakout on her forehead, but her skin became so irritated she had to stop. She too looked like she had a sunburn. This product works, but it is also very harsh. From what I have read of other reviews it seems fair, easily sunburned skin can't tolerate this treatment. And both my girls are very fair and have to slather on the sunscreen when they spend any time in the sun. Too bad, the girls and I had high hopes for this as a less expensive alternative to Proactive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Renew your face!","review":"My daughter has problems with little tiny acne spots on her hairline and forehead. She used this one time, and the little tiny zits went away by the next day, and her skin is left soft and moist. With this new three step method, she can't go wrong. Thanks for letting her try this new product. She was sceptical at first, but now she loves it, and only does it once a day before going to school. She is only thirteen, and this has done wonders for her self esteem! Thanks for this wonderful product, she loves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am delighted.. the best yet!!!!","review":"Someone bought this for me and I tried it straight away. My blemishes cleared up over night, literally. My tone and complexion improved, the skin irritations subsided and even past scars started to fade (in two days); I haven't had any skin problems since... I especially appreciate that there are no chemicals, no alcohol and no peroxide (which never worked on my skin) in this product. I am a big advocate of all natural/ organic skin care products and I will never use anything else again; I have stopped my search.I will try the pore minimizing, anti- aging product since the acne treatment does nothing for that problem. But, it doesn't promise to minimize pores, but to clear skin- which it does beautifully. The best thing about this product is that you don't have to use a lot of lotion. A dime size amount covers my whole face. I use this at least twice a day with no problems and complications; it only takes about 2 minutes... BIG THUMBS UP!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Made my face breakout","review":"I have been using Proactive for years but decided to try something new.

I barely have any acne, but I thought I'd try this and see if it improved things. I used it for a few weeks and I think it made it worse. I think it was starting to make me get a rash so I quit using it.But- Nature's Gate makes great products, I use a lot of their other stuff. It didn't work for me, but maybe I have some kind of an allergy or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch! My skin hurts!","review":"I'm very into natural products so I did not want to try straight-out Benzoyl peroxide or say 3% straight Salicylic Acid for my adult acne. I was pleased to see Nature's Gate offered a natural alternative. I used the wash, toner & lotion just ONCE/day for a week. I do have sensitive skin, but think most people w/ acne do. Anyway, all 6-7 evenings I tried it, my skin immediately flared up into a slight burning feel & a red appearance just minutes after application. I think a combo of the salicylic acid, the oligopeptide-10 and the tea tree oil (combined w/ many other listed products, some totally natural, some totally not), was far too much for my skin to handle. My fave brand for natural skin care is Aubrey Organics. I just learned they now make a Sensitive Skin wash, toner & lotion, so I'm off to try that next. I quit the Nature's Gate and won't try it again. Good luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It worked on my sensitive skin","review":"I have very sensitive skin, and when I use a product my skin doesn't like, it gets a pimply-like rash. Until I tried Nature's Gate Organics, even the acne treatments for sensitive skin caused allergic reactions. Nature's Gate is the one product that actually makes my skin look better after using it. It doesn't dry out my skin, doesn't make it itchy or red, and it doesn't give me a rash. I found a winner with this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EDITH STEIN: ST.

That [stinks] and the rest of the cd does too, except the \\"Carol of the Bells\\" and \\"Out of the Races and On To the Tracks\\".

All in all, thoroughly horrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK, what is this song?","review":"Good soundtrack. I'm asking, like others have, for the artist and title of the 2ND song during the Edge of the World Party (with the burning man outside). It starts exactly 30 minutes into the film when Paul is ending his talk to Mitch and his girl. It really kicks in when Sean Bateman (James Van Der Beek) first shows up at the party and walks by Eric Stoltz. Pretty serious jam and no one seems to know who it is.

The catalog # for this CD is EK 26439."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fitting of the movie...","review":"This movie is bizarre. I went to see this movie thinking it was just some raunchy colleg-kid movie that my girlfriends and I could laugh at but I left the theater saying, \\"That was _____ up!\\" It was an artsy movie to be honest. It required thought, and that is why the soundtrack is so fitting. Number ten, Without You is an old song that everyone knows, but after seeing the movie it has this new eeriness to it. the TomandAndy songs are just great. They kind of jump around and get your brain working. They have a sort of melodic craziness to them and I like it. The Gentleman who fell is another great song, kind of graceful and pretty. European Vacation is crazy! If you see the movie, you are more likely to understand the soundtrack. It's great for in the car when you're just driving alone. Pick it up if you like interesting collections of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfectly fit","review":"every song on this CD fit perfectly. i especially like the harry nilsson song for when love letter girl (in the book, it says her name is Mary) kills herself. that just fit so perfect. im kind of sad they didnt put the george michaels song (faith) on the soundtrack because it goes with the best part of the movie. or when paul is dancing in the mirror and i believe they have some french song playing. overall this soundtrack had some GREAT songs on it and you wont be dissappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Books like this are why I love history","review":"I waited awhile to write this review. I needed some time to think over the impact this was having on me. It's a powerful and well written story. And I admit one of the things I enjoyed most was that Robert Carter was complex. He was not one dimensional. I'm not sure I would have enjoyed spending time with him, but I'm sure I would have found him interesting. Tomorrow I'll be watching '1776'. I first saw the play when I was a child and it became a family tradition that we always watched it together on the 4th of July. The scenes where including the topic of slavery in the Declaration are going to appear different for me this time. Tom Jefferson's \\"intent\\" to free his slaves will sound more shallow than usual. Robert Carter is a hero for me. He did what was right. And I'll be thinking of him on the 4th."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read","review":"To avoid repeating what all of the accurate and appropriate other reviews have mentioned, I will add just one thing. The most outstanding aspect of Carter's life, from my perspective, is just how completely radical he was for his time. It doesn't even seem that he meant to be, either. From before the war until his death he made decisions based on what was needed or important to him at that time. Even before he freed his slaves, his business matters, political and religious views, and family life all grew from somewhere profoundly different from everyone else around him. His life could have as easliy gone one of may different ways. He was conisdered eccentric and fell out of favor with his peers, but never did anything that by modern standards seems that odd. Without the excellent context the author provides, this would be completely lost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boettke is Non-Inspiring","review":"This treatise lacks a great deal in the way of practicality.

And this book can be challenging both personally and publicly on what it asks you to put in. It's about shaking yourself up a bit and finding what really makes you tick, and about tending to the untended parts of your personality and soul.

The different radio bands provide all the sources of information you might need, and I've been impressed with the quality of the speaker used for the radio function. The inverter and 12volt power point plug work well, keeping our cell phones charged during outages. The areas where Black and Decker could improve this product is to provide LED lighting for both the recharging flashlight and the small attached room light (they currently use incandescent bulbs). This would make the product use even less electricity while providing an even more reliable light source. I've had to replace the bulb on the rechargeable flashlight several times and the light it produces is quite dim, although serviceable when needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"PEACE OF MIND","review":"This product will give you the peace of mind needed when the power goes out.

While most of our friends and family here in St. Pete have just started using them for the hurricane season, we have had ours plugged in since day 1. Although we have had no hurricanes yet, our electricity has gone out twice in the early morning hours, and the Storm Station light came on and awoke me once, and I noticed it one time on an middle-of-the-night trip to the bathroom. This unit warned us of the outage, and saved us from sleeping past our wake up time, being late for work, etc. I disagree with the post w/ only one star. When the electricity goes out, one needs light, and communication (cell phone AND radio/TV band). Who cares if you have to go w/o coffee for one morning? During a hurricane, I want a cocktail anyway, not coffee. I have a very high regard for this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as useful as purported","review":"We bought several of these for gifts for the holidays, but when using the one we got for ourselves a couple of issues became obvious. Primarily, it's not as \\"set it and forget it\\" as it should be. Once the battery is fully charged, you are then supposed to uplug it and turn it off -- which makes its automatic \\"find me\\" light pointless. If you know in advance that the power is going to go out, it might be OK, but then how is that different from having to get some flashlights and candles ready?Secondly, it's construction reminds me of a child's fireman toy.It has its uses, but these design oversights prevent me from actually recomending the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk, don't buy","review":"It looked like it was charged up.

I bought the DVD for a long plane trip (16 hours) and am so happy I did. The shows are enjoyable for him to watch and they teach good values, so I feel comfortable with him watching these shows. I also REALLY love the play all function on the video so that I am not having to constantly pick another show on the menu. Play all will play a Paz show, then a Wilbur, then a Save Ums, then do the second set, so there is some variety. You also get a few extra shows in the bonus features, which is great, because my son also loves Meteor. Since my son will actually sit still and watch this DVD, it is worth the repetitiveness of the shows when he watches it over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very In-depth look at the Issue","review":"The documentaryA Global Warning?

Every natural occurrence of global warming and cooling throughout the history of Earth is explained and all the possible changes to come man-made and natural are illuminated. Even possible solutions to the problem are explained in-depth (and almost makes you sick that we still drive gas-guzzlers and use fossil fuel power plants).The only downside to having this much information is having this much information.

I loved it, and decided to explore other Windham Hill artists and bought this double album. And I was not disappointed. Each and every piece on here is sheer heaven.

It will sound relaxing in the office without distracting you from your work.Yet it also rewards closer listening. The lovely, lilting harp lines will stay in your system for a long time.Another thing I like about this cd is that the melodies are not repetitive. Each song has its own sound.

That's right, the same guy who fronted the hair-band Extreeme in the 80's (remember \\"More Than Words\\") and later Van Halen. Gary with Extreeme was nothing special, Gary with Van Halen bombed horribly, so why even give this a try? Because it's completely different than anything he's done, it's well composed, well written and finally Gary has put a piece of his soul into something on tape. What we have here is a dark album, backed by incredible production and industrial very heavy sound that works in non-cliche form. Gary's vocals are very powerful here, it sounds as if he's borrowing from everything he knows (including his Opera experience) to really go over the top. Unfortunately it wasn't a success and the band is no more, but this is still worth checking out, because it's just that good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Electronic, less feeling","review":"I have to say that I've got very disappointed with this debut of the new Cherone's tribe. Even though, Cherone is a good singer, songwritter and performer, and the band have two great guitar players on the crew, it's sounds too much electronic, industrial, sometimes it doesn't sound rock, but seems like one of that new metal bands from eMpTyV, like Linkin Park, for example. It doesn't have the feeling and the beat of a real rock band, like Van Halen (witch I love!), Led Zeppelin, etc. It also have good moments, like the outstanding open track \\"Left for Dead\\", the almost progressive tunes \\"No One\\" and \\"Thanks for Nothing\\" and the Queen-based final track title \\"Exit Elvis\\".

Lyrically, he dares you to think beyond the constant barrage of sound bites and pop culture opinions. After exploring the dangers of relativism, confronting atheistic philosophy, and challenging the senseless morality of 'Big Bang' supporters, the cover art begs the question, 'Why not?' Don't be too intimidated... He also presents these challenges on a great rock record that will, no doubt, plant itself firmly in your cd player for months before you realize that you haven't had the desire to listen to anything else. Gary Cherone has embarked into new territory, here...

There's something in there for everyone! Gary's voice comes across as strong as ever, at least when it's not treated with synthesizers. There are two tunes that simply needed to be scrapped \\"2+2\\"(which isn't even a tune) and \\"Exit Elvis\\" which reminded me of some bad French film noir soundtrack at times.-Don't ask me why...

Lacking depth.","review":"Being a special effects junkie drew me to this movie. So I'd recommend it primarily to my fellow special effects junkies. Given, it isn't a super high budgeted film, so it's on par with any B-movie with decent special effects. I can't say the attractive cast dissuaded my choice at all, either. Eye candy is apparent. The plot was good, but I prefer the deeper storyline I could only hope to find in a book series outlining the history of \\"The Covenant\\" and whatnot.

I'm sorry but the boys CANNOT act. I was really looking forward to a movie like this. Male witches, FINALLY. However, the storyline needed a lot of help, over use of one line (\\"The power is so seductive\\"), the absence of any real magic(special effects that would make you go \\"ohh ahhh\\"), and no real good fight scene(the wire works just sucked). They could of at least given the blond chick some dancing lessons. Did I mention, the un-need moaning of the dude during the very long kissing scene. Yeah, do not waste your money.

That sure doesn't apply to this one. This movie is simply a bad movie. I gave it two stars instead of one because this one is just barely watchable, mainly because of the cute girls in it. Other than this, this movie is basically a bunch of good-looking girls being chased by good-looking guys. Oh, somewhere in there there is some stupid plot about families who are really witches or something like that. But mostly this is just a bunch of teenagers mouthing corny lines that you have heard before in other horror flicks.I would call this one a guilty pleasure except it is not that much of a pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not scary, but interesting enough","review":"This movie kept my interest. I wish it would've been scarier, but it did unfold the story in an interesting way. I like movies where young people discover they have some power or gift and the story tells of how each character responds to that power.Steven Strait was very good in the movie. His character was an important part of the film and he needed to be strong and likeable in the role - and he was. I do wish the trailers and ads had not given away info on the villian in the movie. It would've been nice to have that character unfold without knowing upfront what his purpose was.But all in all, I enjoyed this film. Hopefully, there will be a sequal."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Covenant","review":"I have to say this movie wasn't as bad as others were saying it to be.

You might as well sit at home and watch 2 hours worth of Charmed. The only good thing about this movie is the soundtrack. Tomandandy were the same masterminds behind the awesome music in the remake of The Hills Have Eyes. The songs by Rob Zombie and other metal bands were good too. This movie kind of makes me think of Darkness Falls. Not sure why, it just does. Maybe because they were supposed to be so good and just flopped around like a fish out of water until they died.

Really craptacular garbage, and I'm sure an embarassment to all involved."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Movie","review":"It was a pretty good movie. The actors were decent and the storyline was decent as well. The plot moved a little fast and it was to easy to spot the bad guy (the first 5 mins and you can figure out who it will be). Some cool uses of the 'power'. The water bubble fight was.... better than having a fireball fight I guess.As the other poster's questions about why Caleb was getting beat by Chase once he ascended. Its because Chase had already ascended, and plus Chase had his father's power. Then once Caleb got his power he was able to fight but was at a distinct disadvantage because Chase was 2x his power. But when Chase got more willed to them that made them at least equally matched.. and from the way Caleb beat up the other of the four (don't remember name.. the blonde kid after the bar fight) it seems like he is naturally more powerful than the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"bore city!","review":"WHOA!THIS MOVIE WAS REALLY CORNY!

Directed by Renny Harlin, who once showed a promising career with Die Hard 2, Cliffhanger, Deep Blue Sea, and the Long Kiss Goodnight; but has faltered as of late with recent fiascos like Exorcist: The Beginning and Mindhunters; the Covenant revolves around a group of descended male witches who look as if they just walked out of an Abercrombie & Fitch catalog. Their posh lifestyle is threatened to come to an end when an adversary rears his head, or something like that. The Covenant is one of those films that you just wonder how it got made. Harlin's action set pieces are just plain sloppy and uninspired, making one wonder if this really is the same guy who brought us the aforementioned films. As for the rest of the film, including the atrocious acting, lame CGI effects, and overuse of thunder and lightning effects; well, you get the idea. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non-magical","review":"Touted as the new millenium's The Lost Boys, this movie is undeserving of such comparison. The soundtrack is smashing and the actors are all good-looking, but there is no witty dialogue or humorous subplots.

The storyline of Warlocks and Witches with magical powers living around one of the old colonizing areas is not new. There take on it wasn't bad, just not original.

Nestorius believed that Jesus was actually two distinct persons, Jesus the Man, and Jesus the Divine. This way they (Nestorius and his latter-day disciple) could avoid admitting that Mary is the \\"mother of God\\".Protestants who embrace McCarthy's book, yet claim to adhere to some form of \\"catholic\\" Christianity, are showing that they cherish their grudge against Rome more than they cherish the truth about Christ's Divine Personhood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Always read two books on any subject","review":"A wise man once told me to always read at least two books on any subject to avoid any intentional or unintentional biases of the author. the other book I would recommend that you all read with McCarthy's book is \\"The Gospel according to James McCarthy\\" by Gary Michuta.

And yes I have issues about some Catholic teachings before anyone accuses me of jumping on the defense. Regardless of religious denomination we must remember that our one access to the kingdom of heaven is Jesus Christ. We also need to understand that there are many Catholics who don't necessarily believe every single Catholic doctrine to the letter. For example, many Catholics at least question the existence of purgatory, the real presence of Jesus in the Eucharist, the issue of works in relation to faith, and certainly the authority of the pope. My point is we can't judge someone's relationship to Jesus based on the name of their denomination. And we certainly can't judge all Catholics based on what the Vatican teahces.

One gets the sense of people who have truly grown in charity. In contrast, books by ex-Catholics who have hived off into some shrunken little sectarianism (such as this book) are always filled to the brim with an endless litany of bitterness like the diary of a petulant teenager. One gets just the opposite sense that the person writing this has dried up into a hard little kernel of nastiness that can only do one thing: play the tape of his grievances against the Catholic Church again and again. Not very attractive. Such writers have nothing to say or offer the world. This is the gospel of love? Spare me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Gospel According to Jim?","review":"Unfortunately, Catholic bashers will love this book and will probably flock to the book's and the writer's defense as they read this review.

McCarthy sets up straw men that are ably demolished by Catholic apologists on the web; check out these writers before you spend your hard earned cash on this unfair tract."},{"rating":"1","title":"more anti-catholic claptrap","review":"I can't believe that I spent two nights reading this book. He fails to mention the apostolic tradition, fails to cite historical precidence, fails to mention the various councils, fails to mention the tenants of faith and did not accurately identify the eastern rites of the Catholic Church. All the author did was elaborate on the popular sound bites that are directed against the Catholic Church.

Is it because he states \\"Well, the Bible says....\\"? There are plenty of Protestant authors (such as RC Sproul Jr.) who would disagree with his views on the two issues that I mentioned above.

I give the book only 4-stars because McCarthy was TOO \\"charitable\\" towards a cult and persecuter of God's people, a system of abominable idolatry, homosexuality, violence, bloodshed, war and the like. Cathlolics would be far more honest if they'd just admit they follow MAN and not God's Word, and that they follow a bunch of Italian men, a spiritual mafia out of Rome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Common Anti-Catholic Propoganda","review":"McCarthy trots out the same old protestant straw man arguments against the Catholic Church.

The men he quotes, the fathers of the Church and others, were faithful Catholics. Just as he takes the very Scriptures, the New Testament of which was made by the Catholic Church, and tries to use it against that Church.I found this book, like those of most other protestant apologists, utterly unconvincing. To try to prove that the Church actually did succumb early on to heresy is tantamount to saying that Jesus was sadly deceived when He said that \\"The gates of hell shall not prevail against it.\\" (The Church)If you believe that Jesus abandoned His Church by the third century only to revive it with Martin Luther and thousands of conflicting denominations, this book is for you. Otherwise, come on home to Rome!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of Scholarship","review":"Failed to give a full answer - just what was convenient.

It provides information regarding many controversial subjects with accurate information from accepted Catholic sources, as well as the Biblical (Protestant) response of Catholic dogma. I found the discussion of Scripture and Tradition very enlightening. I especially found the comparison of the Roman Catholic Church to the Sanhedrin and the Pharisees to be persuasive.I do not see this as a book bashing Catholics.

These musicians mix strong jazz themes over a solid rock & roll foundation. It is an absolute pleasure to hear saxophones in such a setting. Both sax players exude a strong \\"Coltrane\\" influence as soloists. At the same time they demonstrate the tight, intricate ensemble playing of Blood, Sweat & Tears or Chicago. The drums are presented with a very fat, funky techno rhythm. The bass and guitar complement the technical dexterity demonstrated by the rest of the ensemble. Overall, this is an exciting mix of material that will challenge serious listeners."},{"rating":"2","title":"refreshing new sound","review":"I really enjoy the Spinning CD. I am not a musician.

Don't even get me started, but even books have chapters! None the less, i still believe in this artist, and after his recent divorce his best may be yet to come..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alt. Country Genre Transcendence","review":"\\"Alt. Country deity Richard Buckner has put his best cowboy boot forward minus the Calexico core of Burns and Convertino (who provided masterful support on 'The Hill'). As great as that release was, nobody would be missing them on \\"Impasse\\". (Bucknerplayed all instruments and his wife played percussion). As usual, he stretches the genre envelope into ethereal realms, and even the (sparsely used) 'cheesy' synthesizer sounds just right. Cannot this man produce anything less than exultant music? What gifts the music God hath bestowed! Let it vibrate the chakra of your heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"A soundtrack for the escape you dream about at your desk","review":"I won't try and duplicate the eloquent words used by others in these reviews to describe this amazing album. I will say this: I often gauge music by its ability to serve as a decent soundtrack for those brief periods, known as \\"vacations,\\" in which I am reminded of the existence of the wonderful world that lies outside my airconditioned cube. Background music for those long trips down backroads in the deserts outside LA. This album is so much more than that: it bypasses my daydreams and taps directly into the neural path that is activated on those all-too-brief journeys into the World. Reminds me of what is like to be free of everything except the things that matter, without having to pay for gas or airplane fare. Take a trip now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buckner on Rawk","review":"This is the Buckner album that rocks without rocking. It's hard to explain. Drums are involed, organ, bass, electric guitar and the likes too. But nothing really ever gets loud but it somehow just rocks. The lyrics are pretty amazing if you like to actually read them. If you're looking for trite cliches, don't go here. Granted, Richard's voice is take it or leave it, but on this record, it's really hard for anyone to say no. Loaded is probably my favorite song on the record. But the song \\"Dusted From The Top\\" has this point at the climax where Richard's voice cracks almost as if he started crying while he was recording it. It's one of those few moments in recording when the singer suddenly becomes totally human...not just a figure. Personally, I like Eliot Smith, but Buckner is superior to me. This record explains why."},{"rating":"2","title":"The very Best of them all-Still after all these years...","review":"After all the years and all the Winter Solstice/Carols of Christmas?Windham Hill Christmas compilations, this is the one I always come back to. It has the most original material, and because of that, it is one of the few Winter Solstice albums you can honestly listen to in July or January or December. Brilliant improvisations by Philip Aaberg begin, and end this disc. One of Ackerman's awesome harp-guitar pieces, a piece by Barbara Higbee which is one of the only I've heard of her flute performances. And the most poignant moments of all - Fred Simon's Simple Psalm. Very moving piano work, complete with chime effects. Simply awesome. There is literally not a single boring or predictable track on this CD; it is a true masterpiece of astonishingly consistent talent all throughout. Yes the first \\"Winter Solstice\\" was very good, but this was actually far beyond perfect. THIS is the CD to start with!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating","review":"I was shopping in a store in Berkeley several years ago and they happened to be playing this album. I had never heard anything like it so I asked what the album was. The saleswoman had to go upstairs to find out and I'm so glad she did. It was my introduction to Windham Hill which led me to several of their artists who have become my favorites (particularly Nightnoise and Metamora) and many more of their albums that I now have. As other reviewers here have noted, the music is perfect background music for dinner parties, holidays or anytime you want to feel mellow. I particularly like the pieces with minor key fiddle music that remind me of pioneer folk music. I didn't hesitate to buy it after hearing a few of the songs. The samples here should convince you too."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the Winter's Solstice series","review":"Better than the first Winter's Solstice and much better than the succeeding sequels.

Almost like mini-sermons. Then at the end of the chapter there are some questions for self reflection.Repeated encounters with different kinds of lies, different reasons, and different outcomes you start to strongly rethink your own attitude towards lying. I can definately see why this book has been so well received.While there exists Christian references and overtones, the non-Christian will get a few mind-bending surprises about their own views of situational ethics.

Your not buying this video for porn, and the actors really aren't all that good looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Severely Disappointed","review":"What a let down.

I listen to it when I am studying for my Med Tech certificate and even when I am catching up on my Zzz's in the library. Phantom Ranch is the \\"number one single.\\" Very catchy indeed.

I've had it for years, but everytime we move, it gets packed, and I temporarily lose it. Rather than waiting for it to be found, because it's such wonderful music that I can't wait that long, I usually end up purchasing another. So, now, I have three copies. This is a beautiful, peaceful, comtemplative music compilation. Nicholas Gunn is one of the best contemporary, \\"New Age,\\" flutists, and he is literally able to paint an image of surreal and natural beauty, as he is performing. This is a fabulous relaxation CD, as well as a great CD to play in the background at home or at work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music of the Grand Canyon:","review":"I ordered this cd because I heard a preview on Pandora.

Although this genre doesn't shine on every single track, the bulk of the music contained here is excellent and worth buying. If anything, this album could justifiably be bought simply to hear \\"Rootwitch,\\" perhaps the most astounding guitar piece Hedges ever composed. \\"Ritual Dance\\" is also very exciting, with its very intense and fast rhythms. The \\"Point A/Point B\\" series is an interesting presence, performed on an experimental guitar called a Trans-Trem. As far as the ensemble music goes, \\"The First Cutting\\" is the most appealing. Finally, Hedges sole vocal performance on \\"i carry your heart\\" demonstrates that the artist is also a gifted tenor. Definitely worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning guitar and song","review":"This CD is worth buying just for the song which ends it -- a setting of a poem by e.e. cummings.

Two weeks later a rainstorm came along in the middle of the night, and the wind tore it right in half. I'm not talking about a tornado here, just a typical (though strong) wind/ rain storm.So on the 4th of July I bought a new one. On the 9th of July another storm (not even that bad, and only 10 minutes long) tore that one right in half.The weakness of this awful bracket is the thin layer of aluminum in between the adjustable bracket and the arm. When a flag gets wet it gets heavy, and when the wind blows it's going to put some pressure on the bracket. Cast aluminum is weak and snaps easily.I now have to shop for a whole new bracket, and I have screw holes through the new vinyl siding of my house due to removing the old one. DO NOT get cast aluminum flag brackets for use outdoors, and avoid adjustable. Look for STAINLESS STEEL brackets with at least four screw holes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Bracket","review":"I have owned two of the brackets as well. Both of them broke in the same spot at the base. One was just in the wind the other in a moderate rain storm, but neither of the storms should have been enough to break the bracket. The only reason I gave it a second chance was I didn't want to have to redrill holes in the brick wall it was mounted to, but looks like I will have to unless I can find the same bolt pattern on a stronger bracket. If you live in a mild climate with no wind or rain this bracket will work, for the rest of the world keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy","review":"This cast aluminum bracket broke in half at the base, at the point where it adjusts to different angles. It is not well engineered. This failure is apparently the same as several others have had before me.I called Valley Forge Flag to see if they would replace the bracket and they would not. But the funniest part was that two different reps (including one supervisor) told me tha the flag & pole had to be removed from the base if ANY wind & rain was expected.I go out of my way to buy American made products but ...Do yourself a favor and buy elsewhere ... Made in America (PA in this case)does not automatically guarantee good quality.I wish I had taken the time to read the reviews before buying this bracket."},{"rating":"1","title":"Claptrap","review":"Self-styled Nostradamus experts are forever telling us what various quatrains mean, but it is always AFTER the events predicted. For example, one quatrain predicts the attack on 9/11, if you squint your eyes just so and hold your mouth just right. It's all based on astrology, which erroneously describes the stars going around the earth.What I have never seen is one clear, specific Nostradamus prediction BEFORE the event. Riddles just are not helpful. Supposedly various seers, including Nostradamus, have predicted the world will end on or about December 20-1, 2012. Now, that's specific. So should everyone hold off on their Christmas shopping to see what happens? I think not.This DVD is one big joke with weirdos pretending to great wisdom, speaking pseudo-scientific claptrap.

One may imagine my disappointment when I discovered Prayer was missing from the book! And \\"Madame Guillotine\\" is practically the equivalent to Jekyll and Hyde's thunderous \\"Facade\\" and should have definitely been included.

As another pointed out, it won't wake you up, but the beep and flash every 5-6 seconds makes falling asleep impossible.

Everyone knows about the first, but he made three more, the final one resulting in utter failure.Columbus encountered numerous problems, ranging from a hurricane to hostile natives to shipwrecks to hostile Spaniards(!) to mutiny. The program decribes this last voyage as a disaster and I would have to agree. Columbus's aim was to find that elusive passage to the Orient, yet it escaped him, replaced instead by the many hardships he suffered mentioned above. In the end he lost all four of his deterating ships to the elements and had to pay for his passage back to Spain with his own money! Within two years of returning Columbus died, a broken man; an inglorious end for the person who started a new age in history.Four stars. Interesting story. Columbus serves as a vivid reminder that all glory is fleeting..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Columbus - Post 1492","review":"A little slow at some points about 45 minutes into the episode, but overall an interesting and in depth presentation about Christopher Columbus that gives the general public (and students if you're a teacher) a better idea of the fate of Christopher Columbus.

A soft flute, an even softer fiddle, clear guitar...keyboards and piano, and very suddle synthesizers comprise the CD. It is new age with a slightly Celtic twist. But I cringe at using the term new age, because this is most definently not your typical new age. It's much better than that. And even adding \\"the Celtic twist\\" seems a bit unfair. It is not something I would group under a Celtic music profile, but if I close my eyes and listen I see a Celtic forest at dusk.This is one of the few Nightnoise CD's that has a very Windham Hill feel to it. While \\"White Horse Sessions\\" is in my opinion a better CD, the two are so different that its almost unfair to compare them.\\"At the end of the Evening\\" is the most aptly titled CD I think I've ever heard... it is something that you will play at the end of the evening, to sooth and comfort you, but not to put you to sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Musical Paramount for human accomplishment","review":"I am writing this as a sum review of all of Nightnoise's work. Their music was the first thing my parents ever played to me, so I know every song on every album. But every time that I sit down and listen, something new happens to pop up. This is the first band to ever really actually move me emotionally, and it has ultimately heightened my musical experience through my entire life.

OK for dorm living, but not something you'd be happy for company to eat with you. This book, on the other hand, is a marvel. These recipes taste like you studied in France for two years and then spent all day in the kitchen, yet most are quick enough for weeknight dinners. My family loves the Pasta with Pancetta and Peas as well as the Olive Stuffed Chicken with Almonds. I also bought the Gourmet's Weeknight Meals, and I like this book much better. I give this 4 rather than 5 stars because there are several sections that I just don't use--Cool Drinks, Snacks, Starters, Sweets (Campari and Grapefruit Ice Pops? probably not), and an anemic chapter titled Menus.

In this novel, that beegins to show off often too much, as the plot is contrived (specially the \\"mystery\\") and the characters increasingly stilted. Nonethless, Saylor, as always, did his homework, and has much to say about Roman siegeworks and siege warfare, government in a subject Greek city and its relations towards Rome, that he manages to keep the novel actually intersting and compelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gordianus the Finder at his very finest!","review":"If you have read any of the other volumes of Steven Saylor's \\"Roma Sub Rosa\\" series, then this book is a *must read.* Story lines that showed themselves in \\"Rubicon\\" and \\"Catalina's Riddle\\" appear once again, making this one of the most fascinating historical mysteries that I have read in quite some time. Saylor leads you along, and just when you think you know where all the pieces of the puzzle lie, he reveals 'the truth' in a way that truly is both surprising and logical.The history of the conflict at Massilia, brings to life the struggle of Julius Caesar to attain rule over the Roman world. The attention paid to detail in setting this story in the Greek colony-city-state on the edge of the Gaul & Roman worlds, shows a broad spectrum of cultures at one of the most fascinating times in western classical history.As with all of Steven Saylor's works, this novel is highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saylor doesn't disappoint!","review":"Saylor doesn't disappoint! Just when you think you know what's going to happen this great author rips the rug right out from underneath you!If you like great characters and wonderful plots, you'll love this series.

He's my favourite author EVER."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steven Saylor does it again!","review":"Steven Saylor does it again! Gordianus finds himself in Massallia (present-day Marseilles) unraveling multiple mysteries at once. This novel takes place a few years after its predecessor, and Gordianus has aged accordingly.The other reviewers delved into quite a bit of detail about how wonderful the plot is, and how much Saylor delves into the history behind his story; all of which I have to agree with.There is one major shortcoming with the novel that truly irked me. The inclusion of Davus, Gordianus' son-in-law, as a major character was marred slightly by the fact that in all the previous novels he appeared in, he wasn't particularly all that intelligent. In this novel, his intellect, and knack for putting pieces together rivals that of Gordianus himself.Having said that, the novel was quite an enjoyable (albeit a bit too short) read, and is a definite should-by for all saylor fans, and those readers who enjoy historical fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saylor does it again","review":"As the Gordanius series continues, mr. Saylor doesn't seem to lose grip on his characters. They are still as plausible as ever. The only small comment I have is that the historical context in this volume is less interesting than in earlier volumes. Consequently the mystery itself is more important. And in that respect mr. Saylor doens't disappoint his readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mess in Massilia","review":"This is neither a good historical novel nor a good mystery. The set pieces are mildly interesting, but the author has to stretch the contrived plot far beyond believability to get his protagonists moving around between the set pieces and the historical characters. All the characters are unconvincing to the extreme; they talk in cliches and behave implausibly. Avoid! For a good historical mystery, try Iain Pears' An Instance of the Fingerpost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Growing Old Gracefully","review":"Nowadays it's said that 60 is the new 40 (or is that 45?). Barbara Wilder's terrific, empowering book makes that statement true. Each step in this marvelous work takes us closer to youth -- not Seventeen mag and not Merlin going backward -- but back to the future, to the youths we might have had were it not for cultural repressions, and back to the kind of strength we had as children, transformed into TRUE adulthood, maturity and fulfillment. Wilder gives meaning to aging, and nothing could be more important in a society that loathes old folk (and makes them loath themselves and therefore often live in utter selfishness) and that discards women after we have reached a \\"certain age.\\" Someone once said middle-aged women could be cat burglars and get away with it because no one remembers what we look like, we are invisible. Take these 11 steps and your crime career is over -- you will be learn to be seen and never forgotten. Let us hope WIlder does a sequel: for men."},{"rating":"2","title":"Power Women--We Rock!","review":"I was prepared to resist this book as \\"been there, done that,\\" but I was soon drawn in by the creative way Wilder not only charts an emotional and psychological map of coming into one's own as a Power Woman, but illuminates where we are on the spectrum, both personally and in a mythic and social context. I found it validating to see what had gone right as well as awry in my own evolution as a woman in our culture. The deeper I got into the book, the more avidly I took notes, particularly in regard to Wilder's new paradigms of authentic leadership and profound definition of success.

It goes so far as to say that if your child's bedwetting stops by itself or with the use of a bed alarm, you should still have a doctor investigate the cause of the bedwetting.

Instead, Brinkley has composed a collection of essays recounting, as mentioned in the subtitle, the people, places and events that have captured his interest during his career as a television journalist. These compositions provide glimpses into the past sixty years, and are both observant and humorous. Brinkley helps shed some light on the second half of the twentieth century, and in doing so, also provides us a glimpse into his own personality. Through his insights and reactions, we can just begin to get a glimmer of the man behind the familiar face."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perverse and Lame","review":"Wow!! This is BAD!! The acting is horrible...Not to mention the costume/make up is nonexistant. The fake mustache on Stella's father is so obsurd looking it almost comes off when he hugs her. I don't quite understand why Stella's father checks out her bust size and gives her prono magazines. There was not a perverse father in Twilight that I am aware of...I've only seen Twilight one time but I don't remember all the sexual jokes. However, it is not only the father who is a perv but Stella's buddy who fingerbanged her...apparently this is a big thing and the whole school knows of it....Again, I don't remember the overtly perverse humor being in Twilight. Also, why the close up camera shots of Stella's nose and Edgar's lips snarling??? I was unable to make it thru the whole movie...which is pretty bad considering some of the movies I have endured thru. I at least made it thru one viewing of Twilight."},{"rating":"1","title":"lly a review, just a note to the people who make this kind of film.","review":"If you want your film to be a financial success, there are only two ways:1) Really good story, photography, effects and acting and lots of luck.2) Blood/gore, lots of fun or scary violence and lots of mostly attractive female full nudity.Trust me or not, those are your options."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow! Think you've seen bad movies before? Think again...","review":"Holy Toledo.Before you even think of a question you might have about this movie - I'll give you my answer now...\\"It's terrible.\\"Forget the dollar value of the movie you'll lose out on, think about the time value you will never be able to get back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Taintlight","review":"A pretty horrible movie I must say. I watched the whole thing and I don't know why. I had hopes that it would get better but nope, it was god awful, not funny at all. If you are going to see a parody of Twilight, just go see Vampires Suck. Vampires Suck is pure genius compared to this movie. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE, I BEG YOU!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh.","review":"While I realize this movie is a spoof, it's still not worth $18. If you really want to see it, get it on Netflix Instant.It has the quality of something high schoolers would make with daddy's camcorder. The writers are obsessed with poop jokes, feces was a running theme throughout the movie.The best part of the whole thing was their take on Jasper Cullen. It had me laughing hysterically."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eww.","review":"This movie is horrible. I watched about 15 minutes of it before turning it off. Jokes aren't funny. Actors are bad. Quality is bad. Lighting is horrible. It's mostly just gross all around. Literally, figuratively, whatever. It's gross."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a joke.....","review":"Be warned!!! These other two reviews are 100% wrong, and must be involved somehow with the marketing of this dud. This movie is lacking terribly in all area. Like being hilarious??? NOT!!! Being well acted??? NOT!!! Being lame and, oh so boring??? YES!!! If you wish to see this movie, and can make it all the way through, you should deserve some kind of reward. If you're a fan of the twilight series, stick to the real thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed at shooting fish in a barrel","review":"If you think Twilight was bad, this makes it look like an Academy Award winner... The level of bathroom humor is similar to what you would hear in a kindergarten classroom... at the same time the sex jokes (that definitely make this inappropriate for most of the preteen audience that drools over Twilight) are very grown up but are entirely vulgar. The makers went too far off in left field with this one. There is so much to poke fun at in the Twilight series that they ignored to just go off and throw random, vulgar, and immature jokes in. They literally failed at shooting fish in a barrel."},{"rating":"1","title":"not even stupid funny","review":"Some movies are so dumb that they are funny, But this is a movie that I would have made at age 12 maybe and thought was funny, it's not good at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"The stupidest waste of time and money ever","review":"When people say this was recorded with a shitty camera, they are not lying. It looks like a cheap cellphone camera, the acting is TERRIBLE and the entire mood of the movie will leave you uncomfortable. I can't believe I wasted $2 on this movie, it isn't even worth a free download. I did not even watch 5 minutes into the movie it was so bad. I don't even want to think about the stupidity I just watched."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tainted My Time","review":"Poor quality, poor acting, and poor storyline. I realize this is a low budget film, but I've seen less sloppy work on sting budgets before. Raunchy humor, obscenities, disgusting sexual innuendos, camera shaking, poor wardrobe....pretty much everything that screams cheap. I'm sure the kiddos had fun making this, but not the best film to watch on a Friday night. You're better off watching Plan 9 from Outer Space. I think the only thing I liked about the film was some of the music, but it distracted me from the film altogether, which defeated the purpose of watching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good by any means of the word","review":"This was just too painful for me to watch so I stopped very early into the movie, spoof movies CAN be funny but most of the time they're just awful. If you really want to see a Twilight spoof movie go see Vampires Suck, despite the fact it was made by the guys who made meet the spartans, epic movie and other horrible movies it was really funny, easily the best spoof movie since the original scary movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the 'real' movie!","review":"I have to start by saying that I consider the LBP crew good friends and I'm totally biased but as Seaver himself knows I'm not one to say I like something if I don't. That said I REALLY enjoyed Taintlight.Meredith Host and Kurt Indovina both parodied their Twilight counterparts perfectly with just enough LBP outlandishness to make me giggle.The rest of the cast were also spot on with their characters and backed up the leads wonderfully.Serious fans of Twilight will NOT like this movie. But if you have a sense of humor, especially if you love bodily function humour, and an are looking for a fun, well-acted and enjoyable movie you will love Taintlight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time or Money","review":"We watched the first ten minutes of this before we shut it off. It's essentially the quality of something a bunch of high schoolers would make: badly written, horribly shot (on an old camcorder, it looks like), with cheesy costumes, props, and fake mustaches. How this ended up on Amazon, let alone priced at $18, is beyond me. This is something that should be up on Youtube, not for sale on Amazon.Avoid this like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"possibly the worst movie ever","review":"Just watched it on netflix(on the wii). It was a total waste of my hour, it wasn't even a good spoof. HORRIBLE writing, camera work and acting(worse acting then twilight!) Don't waste your time or money on this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"omg it is so bad","review":"it's essentially a bunch of kids, either high school or college age trying their hardest to parody twilight. Parts of it that actually mock the ridiculousness of the series kind of succeed but everything they changed (different characters based on their lack of crew) is really awful and sophomoric at best (which, realistically you could say about twilight too)the epic fight scene at the end makes it kind of worth the hour you'll spend watching it. maybe. if you're really drunk"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a soft core porno without the sex or nudity.","review":"I swear this thing is just as bad as those porno movies that have no story to it and it's all about the sex and nudity. This movie doesn't even have the sex or nudity, but kept the bad acting, graphics, and story. However, there are a lot of sex jokes, bad jokes, and stupid jokes. There also plenty of sexual and masturbation jokes with the dad and daughter. Then again, there just a lot of sexual jokes with the daughter, period."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Movie is about as Fun as Swallowing Thumbtacks","review":"I've seen some awful movies inexplicably wind up on DVD, and Taintlight is easily one of the worst. There are dozens of things wrong with this movie, but I can sum it up with:1. It's not remotely funny.2. It was shot entirely with a camcorder.3. There's no use of lighting or color correction.That was 65 minutes of my life that I'll never get back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, please.","review":"What in the world is Amazon thinking, let this piece of tripe be sold to unsuspecting customers? This looks a high school film project, not a seventeen dollar movie. If you want to see a Twilight parody that is actually worth something, check out the Hillywood Show parody on YouTube.Twilight is not that hard to make fun of, but somehow you guys epically failed."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},O={class:"card-container"},B=["disabled"],M={key:0},W={key:1};function N(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",O,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",W,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",M,"See more"))],8,B)):b("",!0)])}const H=d(x,[["render",N],["__scopeId","data-v-966b7f5c"]]),P=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/4.md","filePath":"glossary/4.md"}'),j={name:"glossary/4.md"},L=Object.assign(j,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{P as __pageData,L as default};
