I mainly liked Clannad for their later, 'new age' music. But I was given this album and, let me tell you, it rocks. The songs feature great musical arrangements, especially \\"Eirigh Is Cuir...Coiriu,\\" my favorite fast song on the album. It's a really catchy song (I especially love the instrumental-only part of the song) that will get your feet tapping. The album also includes some beautiful, moving ballads, such as \\"Eirigh Suas a Stoirin,\\" which feels like a soft mist descending and then rising. Those 2 songs alone make the album worth buying, but the other songs are great also. In fact, if I were more of a traditional-music fan to begin with, I would probably give the album 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful hand crafted homes that reflect owner's dreams.","review":"This is a true collection of extraordinary homes that bring to life the uniqueness of their creators.

It isn't much different from his writing in comics but still is a good story. I thought that the book was good in having a more realistic view towards the large issues that are brought up.

Byrne basically shredded everything that Perez had done.I won't even get into how he later screwed up the whole Donna Troy history. Maybe he can do Hawkman next.

I am an experienced knitter and while the photos and illustrations were well done, the instructions left a lot to be desired. I found errors and places where one had to assume the progression. Because this is a technique that is fairly new it is even more important that instructions be written for novice knitters as well as those who can on the fly create their own designs from a few moments instruction. I have sucessfully knit many Aran sweaters with complicated Celtic cables as well as other patterns.

Given that the Joker cycle moves quickly and stays on the track, there is no point in racing the two vehicles.

Aside from the excellent performances from Kathy Burke and Ray Winstone (not forgetting the underrated Charlie Creed Miles), the movie is beautifully shot in a very painterly, European style (the influence of producer Luc Besson perhaps) and features a poignant soundtrack including pieces by Eric Clapton.Yes, one can argue that Miles' Billy is given too much screen time and Winstone is given too little to develop the narrative thread involving Ray's alcoholism, but these are minor quibbles given the overall strength of the performances. Also worth mentioning is Jamie Foreman's Mark, Ray's anecdote spouting best friend.Overall, an important British movie by any standard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Depressing Viewing","review":"Nil by MouthThis is definitely one of the most depressing films I've ever seen.

Only the women in this film have any sense of morality and right and wrong. The language is strictly from the gutter and adds perfectly to the portrayed pond lives that are using it.Of course, this is how some people really do live their lives but entertainment it is not.

The camera shots were done very close-up to give you the feeling that you were right there in the mist of things!! I can't wait for the next project by Oldman to begin!

And her version of \\"Hasta Que Vuelvas\\" can send chills down your spine.Great to have these on CD finally -- \\"Hoy\\" has never been available before -- but why are the liner notes only presented in English? And it's rather insulting to the Spanish-language audience that misspellings pop up in the liner notes on some of the song titles. Even the great Alan Bergman's name is spelled wrong. Did anyone proofread this? The presentation should have been as classy as the music. Still, I've been playing this CD ever since it was released."},{"rating":"2","title":"Musical Album","review":"Woderful rerelease, on a CD, of two musical albums performed by Vikki Carr.

Good music has an strong effect on the listener, but this album is not good, and the music does not \\"send\\" the listener anywhere. I own, and am a fan of, music by Lucha Villa, Vincente Fernandez, Luis Miguel, Roberto Carlos, Jose Jose, Nelson Ned, Los Iracundos, Los Bukis, and Eydie Gorme. So for an american, I think I am familiar with, know and appreciate spanish and mexican music as well as most. And I'm telling you, this album is not \\"it\\". The long and short of it, is that the music does not \\"send\\" you. That may be a subjective judgment, that is, unique to the listener. But I think that my feelings areshared by lots of listeners, who for some reason are not represented in this reviews section. If I were to analyze the music, I would say that it sounds to me americanized, in an overdone Doris Day sort of way. Its mexican or spanish soul is absent. In its place, I would recommend Eydie Gorme."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly as advertised.","review":"Received my dvd in the condition promised in a very timely manner.

I found the game to have good graphics. And since I was constantly running in to different monsters and challenges, it kept me interested. Also, having the opportunity to have different and better armor and weapons along with magical powers made me want to keep playing. The plot was a little strange though. Other than that, I found it to be a good game."},{"rating":"1","title":"The REAL deal","review":"This is perhaps the worst rpg ever written. The combiniation of unoriginal game play, and an absolutely detestable story line your money would be more well spent on .5 pencil lead. Fear not however, if you bought this game rest assure that this WAS a playstation 1 game that was rushed into PS2 service if only to fill the vaccum created by the lack of RPG's in Song's repitore. The only thing sader than is PS1 polygons, is the lack of a clear involving story line. However bad the story is on most RPG's it doesn't seem to matter by the time you find a place to save you are completly encompassed by the plot, the developers of this game must have DELIBERATELY attempted to make sure by the time you got to level 2 you would be using the the cd as a steady, reliable, non-slip drink coaster!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Game is Horrible","review":"This game is one of the worst I've ever played with the execption of Catfight.

I love action RPGs but this game doesnt cut it. The game play is rough and status effects last for hours. The bosses are insanely hard, which is a wonder because i played for hours before i got to it. Also the monsters lack detail and are weird.

Well, I happen to like it. It's fun, and if you have a sense of humor, the parts with speech are funny as heck. Seriously, if you watch the bad guy, Morpheous, while he is speaking, and don't laugh, you have issues.However, I also agree that if you have issues with psycho cameras, stay away. I'm not done yet, but so far my biggest challenge has been the camera, not the monsters. On the upside, you don't really have to worry too much about sneak attacks from behind while running, since that's usually where the camera points... ^^()So yeah, if you can live with some weirdness, and camera issues, get the game. If you don't believe me on this, rent it. If it drives you nuts, stay away.

I bought the game in 2001 shortly after scrambling around for the first wave ps2. I popped the game into my system. The graphics are sub-par for a console as graphically capable as ps2. Walking near an edge [is difficult] since you fall of like Jovian gravity (gravity of jupiter which is many times that of Earth) is pulling you into hell. The puzzles are extremely stupid. I never got past this one later in the game. And palmera pieces an incredibly stupid idea. It makes PERFECT sense that you lose durability for just walking around. I expected an epic RPG. Never again will i make assumptions based on the cover. Definitly one of Agetec's worst."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid","review":"I am a big fan of Groove Armada, but my one previous complaint is that they can't keep it going for an entire album. In \\"Pursuit of Happiness\\", Andy Cato, one half of the Armada, puts up his most reliable and long playing listen yet. It doesn't ever get too boring, and Rachel Foster's vocals mix and blend perfectly with the relaxed, smooth, free sounding music Cato slides expertly underneath. Reminiscent of Sade and Everything but the Girl, \\"Pursuit of Happiness\\" is perhaps a couple years late, but once one can get away from popular culture, they realize that music is generally timeless anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this CD","review":"This is now one of my favorite cds that I play often.

The \\"people who bought this also bought this\\" feature is a great way to branch out and find something new. I've never been happier with a chance taken than with this cd -- very soothing, sexy music.

It's a work of art from start to finish and Jericho, Higher Ground, and Pursuit of Happiness are some of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard. Overall it's pretty chill, downtempo electronica, but where WP stands apart is melodic quality of their music. It's emotionally engaging and you could definitely use this as a *cough* soundtrack for some Very Fun Adult Moments.My only complaint is that the Subway song irks me for romanticizing being homeless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cool music....","review":"I just listened to this fantastic and amazing and can't wait to play it again in my car. The songs are hypnotic and really do seem to carry you away. Every song on this cd is great and that is rare for an artist. I'll be there, Best Days of our lives, 21st century and other are some of the best. Mostly trance like and danceable beats with a couple slower and mellower songs like Higher Ground and Subway. It's a little different sound than the typical dance that is currently out there but a great investment if you like this kind of music. I recommend it highly!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really that special","review":"Talk about an overrated album. Uninspired drums and synthesizers coupled with an insipid vocal track. Sorry, just doesn't get my adrenalin pumping. Of course, maybe you have to listen to the album five or six times to \\"get it.\\" I took a few new CDs along on a drive through the Poconos last weekend in a pursuit of happiness but I could endure listening to this disc only once before replacing it permanently with Deep Forest's Comparsa, an exquisitely soulful collection of tribal melodies that really connected me to the scenery, enticing me to explore my strange new surroundings. All the songs on the Weekend Players disc just sort of blend together, and are bland together.

Clever way of folding up compactly so that it's about the same size as my Visor Edge. I have found two minor problems with using it.Until you get used to it, attaching my PDA to the keyboard is tricky. This is probably due the way Handspring designed the connector and not the fault of Targus.The other problem I have is most of the time when I connect the keyboard to my PDA the keyboard won't work unless I detach it, disable the keyboard in the Keyboard program, reattach the keyboard, reattach the keyboard, and then reenable the keyboard software.With some experimentation I found that if I just disable the keyboard software before detaching the keyboard, I didn't have this problem. The drawback is remembering to disable before detachment, and enabling after attachment.Aside from these two minor problems, I still regard this as an excellent product."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic album","review":"A fantastic album, as Planxty jostles for the position of best traditional Irish band ever.

The questions at the end of each chapter in this book made me feel very comfortable. There is also very useful software on the CD-ROM that could have helped me even much more. I tried running it (the day of my certification exam) and I had no problems running the software--I simply executed the \\".jar\\" file as explained in the book.

The book not only enabled me to pass, but I regularly go to it as a reference. I learned a lot about how Java really works from it, and I feel much more confident with the platform due to the excellent content and organization of this book. I found it useful, however, to not just rely on it's practice exam. Although comprehensive, I found the questions repeat too often and were sometimes taken right from the book. I supplemented it with Bill Brogden's Exam Cram book and was glad I did, as it gave a different perspective on the test questions which was a help when I sat for the exam. Roberts presents the right amount of subject detail. There was very little on the exam that wasn't covered somewhere in the book. This book will not only prepare you for the exam, but helps to educate on some of the finer points of the Java platform."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great exam oriented book!","review":"This book is totally exam oriented which is exactly what one islooking for.

And as such, I find this book dissappointing. Unfortunatly now I'm in the situation of having to 'revise' on a few weakness and sit the exam again.

I haven't read through any other of the certification books but feel that this book does a decent job at preparing you for the test. I have not done the developers exam so I can't comment on that section of the book.There are numerous typos and some erroronous statements, see the errata section on the publishers website, including the IO section seeminly like it is included in the programmers exam whereas it is not and the cd-rom and practice exams still containing AWT questions.

The material is presented in a clear way and it is a pretty good starting place for studing for the exam. It's a fair book but does not live up to the high marks it is getting here. The test engine is very misleading with simple questions recycled from the chapter questions. Taking the exam in the test engine will give you a false sense of security that you will pass the real test. Don't be fooled! The test is much harder than this book will lead you to believe. As already noted by other comments here there are items on the test which the book specifically says are not on the test. I would almost consider that to be malpractice.

The TFT liquid display cant be beat and produces vibrant colors and pictures for easy viewing in any environment. The only hang up I can say about this product is that its software is a bit difficult for this first time Pocket PC user.

Today is the 16th working day. I called to check on the status and they told me it would be another 2 weeks before they would even begin to work on it. I'm very upset about this (obviously) and would recommend that future buyers purchase insurance against screen breakage, and check out the customer service ratings on other Pocket PC's. As for it's performance, I loved the E-125! I'm only dissatisfied with the CS. By the way, my check cleared my bank 2 weeks ago.

These people look like they could have lived a hundred years ago instead of the 1980's! Gardening, quilting, plowing and haymaking are still going on today but it seems much easier in the modern world then these pictures show.The people remind me of my grandparents.

Included extras are a remix of the standard So Nice (Summer Samba), and two, count 'em, two remixes of Sem Concencao. The import-only Summer Samba is more acoustic, lovely, laid back, guitar and voice. The first of the two extra import-only Sem Concencaos is an electric, almost dance mix - spectacular. The final Sem Cencencao is a similar rhythmic electronic remix, stepped down a bit. These are among the strongest cuts on the album. Worth it for me. Samba that rocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's pretty good","review":"I was really jonesing for this CD after listening to her music on the \\"Next Stop Wonderland\\" soundtrack. She has a rich, distinictive voice. If you're looking for bossa nova, you won't find it on \\"Tanto Tempo.\\" The music is very contemporary, but a lot of it is also quite mellow. Songs that stand out are \\"Sem Contencao\\" (Track 4) and \\"So Nice\\" (Track 7). I'm only giving \\"Tanto Tempo\\" 4 stars because it didn't knock me off of my feet and some of my expectations were not met after listening to it. It's a good CD overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"The cure for what ails you","review":"Ever have one of those days? Or weeks? It's you alone against the world... Life isn't fair... etc. etc. Well, take a listen to Tanto Tempo and you'll find yourself in a better place.My favorites are \\"Close your Eyes\\" and \\"Bananeira.\\" Gilberto's voice soothes and uplifts. She makes it all better. Even her sadder tunes (like \\"Lonely\\") can help. When her voice turns sorrowful, you remember that everybody hurts.Speaking of Gilberto's voice... It's like standing beneath a gentle, cool waterfall on a hot and insufferably sticky day. Pure refreshment."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Hard to find Music This Good!!!!!","review":"Read the other reviews here... especially the one right below mine!!!This album is bossa nova updated and it's really really really really reallyproduced well... ..

Una bella voz con bellas canciones, algunas viejas pero cantadas con un enfoque diferente,aunque sin traicionar el espiritu musical de brasil.

As is her CD. I give it 4 stars instead of five because I can't quite swallow the synthesized sound effects. I honed my love for bossa nova on old school albums, such as Getz/Gilberto, the standard for all bossa nova. Perhaps I'm just being old fashioned, but the wind sound effects, etc. just don't do it for me. That being said, it's an immensely listenable album. Bebel's voice is wonderfully mellow, and the music sways your hips gently. I would recommend this album for both long-time fans of bossa nova and novices, who are sure to find the CD relaxing and soothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"a new gilberto","review":"This album takes one back to the beautiful bossa days of old, with just a touch of electronic updating to give it a modern feel.

Perfect for a late night cocktail under muted lamps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Short","review":"I was really looking forward to this CD but was very disappointed when I realized how short it was.

I really wonder how...I listened to her album and saw her live at the Beacon Theater in New York: what's the hipe all about? She has no voice, no musical ear, and no presence on stage (half of the audience also left before the end of the show!). The idea that she is mixing the good old bossa nova (sacred) with electronic music is nothing revolutionary, and she doesn't even carry it well. Anyway, she is not the one playing the music, and being able to sing a weak tune in a microphone when she has heard bossa nova all her life is no talent to me! Disappointing, that's all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat and full of junk","review":"Don't buy this CD because you like her father or mother. It's not the same. She does not have the talent, just the name, and has filled her music with noise and gimmicks to hide the fact that she should look for another line of work. Simplicity and movement should flow from these selections, but it leaves one wanting to change the disk. She also starts her live shows with an hour of ear-busting rap DJ music of her choosing, so avoid these as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good voice lost in a misleading conception","review":"So they invented drum'n'bass. They define it as being Bossa Nova with a new beat. I tell you it's nothing at all. I think they could add new material to it if they really wanted to create something new.What's wrong here is to find that this is a new way of playing and feeling Bossa Nova. No, not absolutely, this is not Bossa Nova.Repertoire is good Brazilian music. Voice is fine crystal.Unfortunately this 'drum'n'bass' ensemble is just a passing wave.Ms. Gilberto owes us something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"overproduced electronic besmirchal of bossa nova","review":"This is truly only of the most horrible CDs to come out of Brasil. Unfortunately, it is representative of a growing movement within Brasil (and the world) to merge electronic gobbly gook with basically good music to produce a bastardized form of music which only besmirches the original style of music (here, bossa nova). It also reflects an unfortunate movement to forget one's own language and sing in English as well. Brazilian Portuguese is probably the most beautiful musical language on the planet. English on the other hand is not musical at all and only grates on one's ears when sung. The only song worthy of a positive comment is Banareira. Record this song and forget the rest of this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too literal","review":"Ursula K. Le Guin usually imagines faraway worlds with societies and problems that resemble our own, but are usually unique enough to fascinate the reader. In \\"The Telling\\", her producer-consumer society seems too much like China in the cultural revolution, while the outlying mountainous region seems like a carbon-copy of Tibet, complete with old wooden monasteries being buldozed by the new regime. The religious Telling is slightly interesting but seems contrived, unlike the detailed portrait of Odo's anarchic society in the Dispossessed.And as with all her books, the ending is too convienient."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying to Be Fair","review":"A fan of Ursula K. LeGuin who loved THE DISPOSESSED might have the wrong expectations about THE TELLING. Gone are the intrigues of plot, the psychological complexities, the paradoxical choices. Instead we are presented with LeGuin's lucid poetic style and richness of image in the form of an allegory.There is nothing inherently wrong with political treatise, and certainly the criticisms LeGuin offers of our \\"producer-consumer\\" culture are valid. The solution she produces to the \\"something-for-nothing\\" dilemma of shared technology is well-supported as her plot unfolds. The problem is, this isn't truly a novel. How readers will respond to it will depend entirely on their expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Content is there for the taking, or the ignoring.","review":"This book, as with many of her others, has a variety of subjects that she explores, but particular emphasis is reserved for loss and tolerance.It takes place in a location in which an external culture has overridden the original one. The main character, an introspective sort of person, starts out on the edge. Isolated, devastated, she eventually finds that all is not lost. From a position of inability, she finds her way to a position of action in which she saves what she can. What more can a person do?I love books which encourage thinking, and this is one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thin, thin, thin","review":"I am a great fan of Le Guin's. She writes beautifully and intelligently, and she always explores some interesting sociological or anthropological concept in her writings. But she normally has a good solid story that the concept lives within, as well as excellent character development. Not here! This isn't a concept living within a story, it's a philosophical tract thinly disguised as a story. And I didn't connect with the characters at all. All right, I speedread. I do that when I get bored. Maybe I missed something. But I'm not going back to look for it. Life's too short. I move a lot; I limit my collection of books, but \\"Tehanu\\", \\"The Beginning Place\\", and \\"The Dispossessed\\" have travelled thousands of miles with me.

An apparent try at ' spare ' narative. Half-interested authors shouldn't be putting out books.

I'll keep the review simple; The Telling was pretentious, plotless and without character development. I also got the impression that LeGuin was feeling pretty clever when she wrote it. It comes across as a mere outline for a novel; unfinished and exceptionally boring to the point that I could not bring myself to finish it. Please don't start here as I'm sure her other works MUST be better than this based on her reputation."},{"rating":"1","title":"A different Le Guin, and not for the better....","review":"I am a huge fan of several of Le Guin's earlier works, especially the Earthsea Trilogy, and many of her other \\"early\\" sci-fi/fanstasy works. However, I have found that much of her new writing has dwindled away from the class of good literature, into the realm of garbled preachiness, such as this book. In truth, I have read bad fanfiction that is better. I was terribly disappointed, as were others. I recently saw an entire stock of this book from a bookstore at a dollar store, because nobody was interested in buying it. I would say - read Le Guin's earlier works that include such masterpieces as The Tombs of Atuan, and leave her newer works alone, as they are no longer up to par."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"As a long-time fan of Le Guin who counts \\"The Dispossessed\\" and \\"The Left Hand of Darkness\\" among my favorite novels, I was delighted to discover recently that there was a \\"Hainish Cycle\\" novel I hadn't read.

All parts came in the large box and were easily assembled. Yukon Fitness is great to deal with.

This bench is junk. First off, the back rest has a 1 inch pad. Honestly, it feels like you're laying on a piece of plywood. The leg curl/ leg extension attachment has a j-pin that you put in to raise the seat pad up to perform both exercises. That pin bent, so I contacted them and they sent me a new one. The 2nd time using it, it bent. Without the seat raised, it is impossible to perform either leg exercise. I weight 185 lbs, so its not like i'm a huge man. This product is very poorly designed. Basically, this bench is worthless. Now i have to spend another $300 to buy a bench that actually works. I find is hilarious that 2 people gave this bench positive reviews. They must not lift much.

The book has no legitimacy because the author uses no critical judgment whatsoever in analyzing the evidence. He just gets on the prosecutor's bandwagon and leads the cheers.The author also turns a blind eye to prosecutorial misconduct and outright criminal activity by the district attorney, preferring instead to ladle in more and more embarrassing information about the defendant. Instead of an analysis of a murder case, what we wind up with is a modified version of the Kenneth Starr report: 300 pages of smut and no evidence.If you want to read hero worshipping of the cops and the DA, this is the book for you.

The other flaw is that it doesn't get much smaller toward the bottom so you can't mix small amounts as well. The mixer can't handle heavy bread doughs at high speeds. The whole thing shakes and doesn't \\"knead\\" well. The other aspect of the mixer that drives me crazy is the blending aparatus in the center of the bowl. You can't lift it up and out and you have to work around it and scrape around it.

I was expecting this game to be like King's Field since it was made by the same company. Other than the first person view/feel, attacking, and picking up items, it is nothing like it. The music is cheap, alot of the rooms look the same, there is no map, and the gameplay is too fast and rushed. I'm in a poison area where you have to keep activating your Protect Ring to keep yourself safe. I'm trying to fight monsters and whatnot. Having to constantly use this item and waste magic doing it instead of being able to use your other rings is a pain.

While the basic points made in the book are valid and pertinent, creating a 'book' out of what amounts to two pages worth of saliency stretches the notion of value to the extreme. The anecdotes / examples fill space and add nothing to the narrative, in fact the anecdotes devalue the validity of the kernel. I would not have bought this book if I had seen it first. That said, the authors understanding and interpretation of female motivations is excellent.A little more proper analysis would have been helpful - and advice on moving forward with relationships."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so to poor","review":"the author is kind of a weird dude.

I was suspicious after having read the reviews on the last page: Women being positive to \\"anti-feminist\\" books is almost never a good sign, and just a copy of what has been said and done the last 40 years.If you liked Thomas Ellis \\"The Rantings of a Single Male: Losing Patience with Feminism, Political Correctness... and Basically Everything\\" or the web site \\"men are better than women\\", \\"The Man's no-nonsense etc\\" is not the book for you. It was a waste of money for me and I do not wish for people in the anti-feminist movement to waste their time and money on this book. The author's intentions are no doubt good, but his parents were right :-) If you have read the introduction you will understand my last comment.I do see that I may have misunderstood somewhere along the line during my order of several anti-feminist books, but I am certain that Amazon tagged this book as anti-feminist literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book sucks","review":"I have never purchased such a bunch of crap in my life.

It is fairly intuitive and I was able to load both an image to the LCD screen and a ring tone from my computer using the provided USB cable. For me the other accessories were a bonus. The belt clip case is hard plastic, but rotates 180 degrees so you can have the phone parallel to your belt. This is a great feature when your sitting or driving and keeps the phone from poking your leg or ribs. The value for me was well worth the $10 price. Before buying this I downloaded some software for $7 that I never did get to work. And I also joined the Motorola programmers site to try and accomplish the same thing that this software did.

Why make a saw with no blades available."},{"rating":"2","title":"MADE IN ITALY","review":"I have owned Makita, Delta, and Hitachi compound miter saws. Most larger saws have too much \\"head flex\\" if you are into precision cuts, you will know that term well. The reason I bought this saw, is because it has that precision cutting and well engineered from ITALY. Read the small print on the motor. I almost bought the Hitachi, but the Hitachi does not have good fences on both sides and the Hitachi is a little awkward. It's like buying an italian sports car, this is the Lamborghini of compound miter saws."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible design","review":"I thought I would love this saw just like my 12\\" slide Dewalt, but the design is terrible. The shroud around the dust port hits the workpiece as does the cast aluminum around the slide. It is impossible to cut anything higher than 3.5 inches at a 45 degree angle. I cant believe this saw made it to production. If this wasn't paid for by insurance to replace a stolen sawbuck that is out of production, I would return it.

I have been eying a new slider and new bench for some time and finally got it. The saw mounted easily on the the Rousseau bench.Most of our materials are 1\\" to 2\\" thick so this is an ideal saw for us. I have not used a slider before, but had used radial arms - very similar cutting feel; silky compared to the old chopper. Perfect and smooth cuts. Also bought one of those laser guides (Laser Cutting Guide - northern tool) - what a combo.Don't miss the 10\\" blade at all.One issue, unlike the chopper, the saw dust is quite fine and tricky to control. Time for a small shop vac.I bought a better blade, but there is nothing wrong with the one that it came with - excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great start to the series","review":"An unlikely Heroine who in another world could have been the villain.

That definitely worked in Winter's Orphans favor. Rarely have I been so pleasantly surprised by a book. I ended up finishing it in a parking lot after starting it at lunch, which isn't as unusual for me as it sounds. The only reason that I wouldn't give Winter's Orphans a 5 is that I thought a couple of areas were underdeveloped.

Well-written and thought provoking, Barnett has done a good job of helping the reader come into the historical situation of first-century Jews and Jesus. He gives insightful commentary and well documented evidence of the atrocious behavior of King Herod, known in the Gospels as the killer of the Bethlehem infants. After reading Barnett's analysis one realizes Herod was totally capable of such a travesty. He also gives a good background to the parables of Christ, showing how Jesus' choice of topics blended well with the his small-town rural background.Well done and I think, a quick read.

To begin with, they need a new proofreader. I've never seen so many typographical and grammatical errors in such a small book. Secondly, the content was so shallow, my 10 year old could have contributed as much information as they did.

Basically our son colored some wings and planes and then watched them drop to the ground like rocks when he tried to fly them. Your child will be extremely disappointed, as mine was. The only redeeming quality to this product is the little bit educational info they provide (what is lift, etc.) But it's not like you can't find that info someplace else.

The pictures on the box are misleading.. this kit comes with a balsa wood plane, a styrofoam one and paper. It says you can make 6 different airplanes, but only provides the balsa airplane body to make one at a time. You are supposed to use the paper in conjunction with the balsa wood, but the paper tailwing just falls out. The 'paint markers' have a cheap plastic brush which just scratches the paint on.

You follow the stories of two different people who have dedicated their lives to helping animals. The 3D images were clear and sharp.

It seems to rinse out well under luke warm water. It did make my scalp itch. It must be one of the herbs that I have a reaction too. After about two weeks of use my hair got a bit dry. I think it may not have been moisturizing enough for my hair. It did leave it shiny and the curls set nicely. It has a companion spray that sets curls. I wouldn't recommend using it unless you like really stiff hair. It did leave my hair very stiff and when it got on my skin it made my neck itch really bad.

Yet, it was the same as always. I enjoyed the game, but I think if you want a fun game that shows you the power of the machine spend your money on Twisted Metal: Black or wait for Metal Gear.

If I should place the book, it could something not far away from James Heriott, however it describes the wild life, as well as his work in the fields with his dogs. Alas, the place where he once lived was, as we read, later replaced by a dam, so the book represents a sad farewell to his way of living, and a time never to come back again.This is a book worth to be read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Significant error in VA section","review":"page 10/7: \\"E.

While the writing gets bogged down in verbiage from time to time, the characters are exquisitely drawn, and the tale is gripping and powerfully told, without sentimentality, and completely unpredictable.

This had about 98% the exact same material performed in front of a different audience and in full screen. So I found it to be a waste of money. It's one thing for comedians to repeat a joke or two as a filler an to repeat the same material for new audience, but to release it twice? What a way to screw us out our money! So if you ownThe Pimp Chronicles Part 1, then this would be a waste of money, if you ask me. Either release, the comedy is hilarious and worthy of 5 stars but this specific DVD only gets 2 because it's the same. It's a waste of money if you haveThe Pimp Chronicles Part 1. But if don't have either, go with this one, as there are a couple extra and extended jokes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the HBO Special Instead!","review":"This DVD is almost the exact same routine that Katt did on his HBO special Pimp Chronicles, Part I. The biggest difference is the overall production quality of this show. The film is dark and is filmed at awkward distances that often make it difficult to even see him or get close-ups of his facial expressions, which are a big part of his comedy. The jokes are almost identical to the ones he did on his HBO special. I would recommend buying the HBO special for your collection and filing this one on your \\"don't buy\\" list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pimp down, Pimp 32!!!lol","review":"Katt Williams is one of the funniest cats in comedy right now.

His HBO special was worse than Mike Epps (who I happen to think is hilarious) and now all we need is for Chris Tucker (also hilarious) to lay an egg on HBO so the Friday Sidekick Circle can be complete. Not only is he corny, but Williams has been bleeding this \\"pimp\\" routine ever since his role on Friday After Next and it's getting -- no, scratch that -- it got old about 3 years ago. While his role in Friday After Next was somewhat funny, this DVD is totally unfunny. He may tell a joke here or there that might make you chuckle, but nothing here will make you laugh.I have to ask though, was he doing these jokes BEFORE he did Friday After Next? Seriously, whether he was or wasn't, it's time for him to move on already, or at the very least, update his material.

The dialogue was better than realistic, retaining the immediacy and energy from it's stage roots. The photography and colors were poetic. Rarely does such a human story get so well made.

First of all, I do not think it gives comprehensive explanation involving many concepts. Secondly, the problems at the end of each chapter incorporate formulas, equations of concepts that haven't been covered previously. Therefore, it's difficult to complete homework without much invesetigation and frustration! Lastly, I do not care for how the book refers back to previous examples on several occcasions. This cause you to have to jump back and forth in the book. Besides that, many of the illustrations have similar titles (e.g. example, figure, exercise..) and can lead to some confusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read The other 1 star reviews","review":"This book is a disorganized, sloppy and ridiculous attempt to explain statistics in layman's terms.I bought the study guide (much better) and have come to this conclusion. Most textbook writers should write a textbook then take out the exercises put them in the study guide and throw away the manuscript forever as not to add to the loathing that people have of mathematics.Luckily, my instructor does not require that we turn in homework I simply do the exercises from the study guide skip reading the book and save my self a lot of time.This means I practice the same problems over and over (a lot more effective than it sounds) and pass the tests easily since there is not really too much to this book other than a few formulas and definitions."},{"rating":"2","title":"I mean, its stats","review":"I find this textbook to be a little expensive, but im guessing thats normal for these kinds of textbooks. Its a pretty good textbook with ALOT of sample problems and practice problems that helps (as long as you do them) I find that there are more practice problems/examples than explanations, so i sometimes refer to wikipedia/google for definitions, since i find that some terms/ideas/concepts arent explained that well.They have some nice pictures, and good sample problems.

I had to buy another text on statistics so I could understand what this book was trying to get across. Be aware that the text is not enough.

It also comes with another set of CD's that you will also need to use in order to navigate through the mess that this author created.

So I turned to the CDs which came with the book, only to find that the website links are all messed up and needed an instructor's registered email to access any important stuff. --simply useless.I am usually not very active about giving advice but in this case I had to speak out--Don't buy.

Bought a larger blade at WM to do the job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the weekend warrior","review":"This is a rugged saw with enough power for most jobs. There are a couple of plain steel starter blades included although you'll need better for serious work. I bent the wood blade on my second cut. Now, I *was* cutting pressure-treated wood, which is metal insinuated into the cellulose fibers. But even the \\"manual\\" (just a single large sheet, with many folds) recommends using bimetal blades because of their superior durability. I picked up a couple for about 5 bucks total and got to work.The included case is nice. Note that you'll have to remove the blade when stowing the saw; it won't fit otherwise. But you can transport the saw without worrying about snagging the cord or damaging something.Nice for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad for the money","review":"I bought this one based on price alone. There have been many times when having a reciprocating saw around the house would have been just the ticket. After looking around and not wanting to spend the money on a cordless I decided to give this one a shot and am glad I did. There is plenty of power for everything I've needed it for, the blade locking system is fine and provided you choose the proper blade for the task it will do what is needed. One thing to keep in mind is that blade selection is 75% of the equation with these things. Wood blade for wood, metal blade for metal, etc. DO NOT go with cheap blades and you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this saw...","review":"First, I am a casual, around-the-house handyman, not a professional.

However, it proved itself this past weekend as we gutted our kitchen down to the studs. We used this saw to cut out an arch that was built into a breakfast nook area. It consisted of several layers of 2x4 boards, metal drywall corner pieces, metal mesh, etc. This saw zipped through all of that and we pulled the arch out in no time. I also used it to clean up the mess from our project and was impressed with how quickly it cut through the debris to make for more manageable pieces. I started my cleanup with a buddy's saw and its blade became stuck in a chunk of 2x4/plaster and I couldn't get it unstuck. I used my saw to get the other blade cut out and the rest of the structure cut up. This saw and a pack of good blades is all you will need for most demo projects!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lightweight, durable professional tool","review":"Well, I am a professional handyman, and I do plenty of small scale demolition and construction.I bought the lighter 7.5 AMP version of this saw after a full day of research.I need tools that are durable of course, lightweight because I have to pick them up and carry them up, down hills, stairs and ladders, crawl under houses and hold the saw above my head. And inexpensive, because all tools wear out and need to be replaced.This Saw lasted about 5 years, until it jammed inside from plaster dust, but it may be repairable and I'll have a try.I looked for another one like it, but had to go with a heavier SKILL saw because I had no time to look in other stores.Go ahead, buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed with the IMAC","review":"We purchased an IMAC for it's supposed amazing digital photo and DVD capabilities.

I felt part of the expedition to freedom, and it made my heart soar. Plesae read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful life lessons","review":"Anyone who buys this book will be interested in the main theme - the unbelievable trek made by the group of escaped prisonors, but there is plenty more on which to reflect.The book opens with the author's arrest and brutal interrogation. During this phase he survives by sheer will power and in the knowledge of his innocense. But later when he and fellow prisoners escape, a subtle change begins. More and more as hardships and tragedies take their toll, it is the bond of the group that keeps them going. I won't reveal the closing lines of the book but they highlight that value as well.As we journey through life, most of us are surprised when we experience suffering or injustice. The bitterness of such experiences can harden some into cynicism and drive others to despair. But the underlying message I found in this book is that we are not supposed to, and indeed cannot, make the journey alone. In caring for the survival and welfare of others, we ourselves survive and are cared for."},{"rating":"1","title":"AN UNLIKELY STORY","review":"I don't doubt that the walk or something like it took place but the confessed lack of notes, maps or diary combined with the passing of time since the event and the significant guesswork employed takes the edge and the enjoyment off what turns into a rather monotonous story of escape, but such places did and do exist and people have escaped. In this case as a survival story it is an physically unlikely account of extended endurance in a hostile climate by men in a weakened state, and when you add in lengthy encounters with Yetis at close quarters and the temptation to close the book grew strong. I would imagine that the naming of names of the people in the prison camp would not have brought their gratutude. But for 99p it passed the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embellished but True?","review":"I agree with the objections of Mr. Dunn, who points out several flagrantly impossible feats presented as fact. I, too, have spent a lifetime backpacking all over the world, and for a true outdoorsman it is impossible to suspsend disbelief sufficiently to take the author at his word.Nevertheless, many of the anecdotes seem too vivid to have been completely fabricated. Perhaps the author needlessly embellished an already amazing story to ensure a book deal? Perhaps, for example, they received quite a bit more help & guidance than the author lets on?It rather reminds me of \\"A Million Tiny Pieces.\\" The author could have saved everyone a lot of trouble had he merely published it as autobiographical fiction rather than an autobiography."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fiction not fact","review":"The book is fiction not fact. In 2006, BBC released a report based on former Soviet records, including statements allegedly written by Rawicz himself, showing that Rawicz had been released as part of the 1942 general amnesty of Poles in the USSR and subsequently transported across the Caspian Sea to a refugee camp in Iran and that his escape to India never occurred."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am in AWE...","review":"Unbelievably real.

He selects six other companions to attept this act of deparation with him. In planning his escape, another reviewer indicates that he receives help from an unexpected source. You will not believe who assists him in his quest for freedom!The balance of the work deals in the trek across Siberia, Mogolia, the Gobi desert, and finally the Himalayas.In the annuals of human history you would be hard pressed to indentify a person whose sigle mindedness approaches Slavomir Rawicz.This is a terrific book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Facinating story but has this story ever been verified?","review":"I found this account fascinating, however, I question the validity. Some of the details don't seem to make sense. For instance, would the wife of the prison camp commander really help a prisoner. Even if the escape took place while the camp commander was away he would still be severly punished (maybe even end up a prisoner himself). Also, the author does not talk about the inhuman/unspeakable brutality of these prison camps. The British soldiers who found the men and the doctors who cared for them - where are their accounts or even medical records? So while I found the book a engrossing adventure I am sceptical of its truthfulness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fake","review":"My impession is that it is fake. It just doesn't feel true. I've read quite a few books on various prison camps in various wars and this book just doesn't ring true. The polish prisioners speak using british slang. There was no name gathering. No documentation. I don't believe they'd be in any shape to make a 4,000 mile trek from freezing Siberia, over the Himalayas, thru deserts etc.Slavomir Rawicz also claims to have seen Bigfoot. He describes an encounter with two 8 foot tall creatures somewhere between Bhutan and Sikkim. According to Slavomir, he and his companions watched the outsized beasts for over 2 hours, from a distance of 100 yards.I just resently finished Ghost Soldiers: Hamptton Sides. Now there's a true story about a forced march to two prison camps and a rescue/escape. I've always known about Bataan's POW death march and 3.5 years imprisonment but this was mt first book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping from page one","review":"The story is unforgettable. Made me appreciate even more how much we take for granted. An unexpected benefit, cold weather doesn't bother me anymore. I hope my children will read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is too good to be true....","review":"If Rawicz's account of his escaping from the Soviet prison were true, it would be one of the most extraordinary testament to the human endurance. The author claimed that during the crossing of the Gobi desert in the middle of the summer, the escaping party didn't have a single sip of water for as long as fourteen days, ( whereas a normal human being needs as much as a gallon of water per day just to survival). Rawicz's account of crossing the Himalayan mountain range during the winter without food supply makes his story even less believable. He even claimed the party throwing rocks to a couple of Yeti to make them move out of the way! Little wonder in the fifty years since the book was first published, nobody else has confirmed Rawicz's story. One should read Heinrich Harrer's \\"Seven years in Tibet\\" for a little appreciation of just how much effort is needed to walk across the Himalayan range."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great story but Unture!","review":"Although I really enjoyed reading this book, I was extremely disappointed to find out later that it was an unture story. The BBC investigated this story several years ago and found it was false. I remember reading another book of fiction that was passed off as a true story entitled,\\"As Far As My Feet Will Carry Me, by Josef M. Bauer which was almost identical to this work or fiction. The title of this book should be changed so future readers will know it is fiction before they pay their money to purchase it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so true story","review":"Odd that Rawicz's Mongolians walk everywhere rather than ride horses, and dress in conical hats (something no one else has observed). Odd that he claims to have gone for 12 days in the Gobi without water - he must have been ready for a beer or two after that. And perhaps he had consumed more than a couple of beers when he met the yetis in the high Himalayas.It's also odd that Rawicz has refused to authenticate any of his claims and declined to produce records, photographs, witnesses, or the full identity or whereabouts of the other survivors.I think the bit on the cover, which claims that this is a \\"true story\\", may need revising."},{"rating":"2","title":"when you have to do it.....","review":"It would seem those who review this story as \\"unbelievable\\" have never found themselves in a situation they MUST endure...for example, the situation in which labouring women find themselves.....where one must reach deep inside for the strenth and courage to continue....when one's desire to live outstrips the tempation to give up. For other\\"unbelievable\\" examples, I would refer them to the myriad of Holocaust survivors, those of the ill-fated ship Endurance, or of southeast asian boat refugees. Perhaps if these reviewers found themselves in a similar situation, they would discover their own \\"unbelievable\\" resources."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"A true story about the author's flight to freedom. It is a reading experience I wouldn't want to miss. The author's account of his time in prison and the following trek to Camp 303 are frankly terrifying. I still find it quite impossible that people survive this trek. The flight doesn't seem any less a hardship, but is for obvious reasons more cheerful.Still two month after reading this book, I am moved beyond words."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN EXTRAORDINARY PAGE-TURNER!","review":"I literally could not put this book down once I picked it up.

There is no record of anyone named Slavomir Rawicz existing before the post WWII era. Though he claimed to be a free polish veteran who was personally recommended by General Anders to be a pilot, his name cannot be found in a single record from that time. There are not even records of how or when he arrived in the UK let alone any trace of him in India. His \\"companions\\" on his journey have no records anywhere at all. Nobody has ever met any of them aside from Rawicz. Its not details like what happened in the Gobi thats questionable. Its everything about the person who called himself Salvomir Rawicz.Second, this book was not written by Slavomir Rawicz as he was barely literate in english when it was written. It was ghost written by a British Reporter named Ronald Dowling whose primary interest was Yeti sightings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fiction/Non-Fiction","review":"At several points in the reading of this \\"tale of surrvival\\", I began to question it's having been purported to be a \\"non-ficrional\\" account of escape from a Siberian prison camp. It seemed a way to \\"perfect\\" narration, with all the bases covered:prison toruture, good guards/bad guards, a young female who joins the group along the way (no mention of any lustful interest in this person from any of these men who had not even seen a female for years etc.) When in the tale, they chose to go directly through the Gobi desert, instead of skirting it, I became suspicious. When little mention was made of the parched thirst they would most surely have experienced, I became even more suspicious. I decided to go to Amazon and see what other readers had to say. I was most pleased to read that I am not alone in my view. This is a complete fictional tale of woe. Shame on the publisher for putting this out as a \\"non-fictional piece. Do not waste your time on this outright attempt at deception."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably, partially, fake","review":"Based on a few internet searches, it seems that this book is at least partially fake. It seems likely that someone did a walk like this, but not certain that this was it. Won't waste my time reading something that might be fiction. I want facts."},{"rating":"2","title":"True or not, an excellent read","review":"I am an avid reader of non-fiction adventure/survival stories and found this book to be well written and hard to put down. There is much controversy about whether it is fact or fiction yet I found the story to be plausible and fascinating.Slavomir Rawicz is taken prison in World War II, subjected to horrendous conditions, and escapes with some other prisoners. Then the story takes off as it describes their 4000 mile trek over mountains and across desert.True or not, it is an excellent read.For other books that I found gripping and well worth reading, see my other reviews or my listmania list."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good book and great story","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. I have read some people don't believe the story is true based on evidence from the former USSR. I don't care. You may also enjoy Unbroken by Laura Hillenbrand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great story, though sadly a fabrication","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, but was surprised I had never heard of the story. After doing a bit of research, I learned that though the historical context is correct, the events did not occur as described. There was much controversy when the book came out in the 50s, and the story was debunked when Soviet records of the era were made available in the 90s. References to substantiate this farce are too numerous to mention."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tribute to inner strength","review":"The Long Walk is an awe inspiring story of seven men who risked everything in escaping from a Soviet labor camp in Siberia and ultimately ended up some 4000 miles south in British India after having endured the snow of Siberia, the heat and sand of the Gobi desert and the frozen mountains of the Himilayas.This story is so frightening in the disregard for human life demonstrated by the Soviets while at the same time amazingly inspirational in the kindness of strangers. For over a year these men traveled on foot and if not for the overwhelming generosity of all of those they encountered on their journey somehow managed to survive a brutal journey. As one of the men himself so eloquently put it, \\"They do a lot to wipe out bitter memories of other people who have lost their respect for humanity.\\"I could hardly put this book down and have no doubt this occured as Slavomir recollects and am astonished that some would be naive enough to claim it was fabricated."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you don't mind true stories being fictional, you may like this book","review":"I like my non fiction to be true...or even mostly true since I am inclined to allow a certain flexibility due to lack of memory or need to fill in holes. As I read this story I found myself questioning more and more the veracity of it. Up to 12 days trekking in the DESERT without water? Seriously? Not getting the first name of one of his survival mates even though the whole escape took over year? Really? Worrying about setting a fire, find a flat stone in the desert for grilling and cooking a snake after weeks without food? (hell, if it was me I would already be considering cannibalism, an uncooked snake would be a treat!)And of course let's not forget about the yeti? After I read the book I searched the internet and saw that I was not the only one questioning whether this story was true or not. As I said I like my true stories to be TRUTHFUL to the events, hence the one star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alas!","review":"I purchased this book in a National Park bookstore. Given its glowing reviews I plunged in and read it in just a few days. It's a stunningread - - well written and understated. Several times during the process I was puzzled; eight days in the Gobi without water, thirty miles per day in rough going, etc. However, so absorbing is the book that I suspendedmy better judgment in the rush to advance the story. Only upon completion did the doubts surface. Upon rereading certain sections, it now seems clear that the story is a hoax. Furthermore, it is written bysomeone without much experience in hiking/walking in wilderness. I alsowondered why the USSR would \\"waste\\" one year in trying to get one individual to confess before shipping him to Siberia. I leave this to experts on the Soviet Union, but as one who has done just a bit of hiking in warm climates, I can say the \\"long walk\\" portion of this book is moreof a comic book story than a real one. A pity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is this really true???","review":"Absolutely amazing story and a bit hard to fathom and to believe but a great story nonetheless. Who cares even if it is a \\"hoax\\" - which I don't believe, - it's a great book. I highly recommend it. They all would have died had it not been for the welcoming Tibetans they kept meeting.

The book skips pages, has pages missing and looks like it was taken apart and put back together again in the binding.Its unfortunate that I paid expediting shipping to get it here in a hurry for my teenage son who needed to do a book report on it of school and he couldn't even use it.I will never purchase from this seller again."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Long Walk","review":"Not a bad read, although the plot becomes bogged down with the sheer boredom of this journey.Page after page of searching for food and walking. It is hard to belive that these men managed their way throught this almost inconceiveable journey on the goodness of the Mongolinan and Tibetan people.This novel does not impart upon the reader adequately thru written prose, the actual hardships that would have been commensurate of this type of journey. Nor does it impart any survial techniques required to keep people alive on a several thousand mile journey.In closing, I find it basically uninspiring and hard to belive. Wouldn't even make a good fiction novel. SAVE YOUR MONEY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very humbling read!","review":"After reading many of the reviews I am inclined to go with my original feelings of empathy for the trekkers. In hindsight, it is a tad unbelievable that a prison commandant's wife would help these men escape, but as one reviewer noted, truth is indeed stranger than fiction. The desire for freedom is a force that cannot be underestimated unless you are faced with having it being taken away. I believe that if you are faced with this choice most people would rather die than have it taken away because by not attempting escape you are in essence dead already. I too, read this book more than 30 years ago and mentioned it to my son who not only sought it out but bought me a copy which I still read from time to time to keep things in perspective. It is a good read for anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning! An epic adventure beyond compare.","review":"The Long Walk is one of the most fascinating stories I have ever read and was almost lost to the annuls of history, but for the chance encounter of a yeti.

The story, after a while, seems almost unbelievable and I just kept reading wanting them to all make it. But, as goes life things worth fighting or dying for have a cost to all human endeavors of great achievement. One flaw, which isn't the fault of the author, was how these brave souls ended their story without a conclusion. If you read this book DO NOT see the movie! The movie was a HUGE let down. Quite sad as this story had the makings of Oscar award winning acclaim."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gripping, but not true at all....","review":"I was intrigued by this story of a Polish officer taken prisoner by the Russians in 1939 and his amazing journey to freedom by sheer determination and willpower.The book is well written and gripping. It makes the reader appreciate what a human being is actually capable of under extreme conditions.The only problem of this \\"true story\\" is that it is not true at all. Documents surfaced after the fall of the Soviet Union demonstrate that the author was actually liberated by the Soviets a few years after being captured, and transported to a camp in Iran. The escape, as described, simply never happened.This information was published by the BBC after his death, but it is a shame that he falsely claimed having lived through this ordeal, most likely for profit.It is a good read nonetheless, but to me, it was a major letdown, mainly because the title claims \\"The TRUE story.....\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Tell me the old, old story","review":"This book enjoyed a great vogue when it was first published in the U.K. However, it wasn't long before it was exposed as a work of fiction, notably by Peter Fleming, Ian's explorer brother, in an article in \\"The Spectator\\". Fleming knew much of the area well, and the only detail from his critique I can recall after 40 years was the striking omission by Rawicz of his having crossed a road in the Gobi desert, lined with telegraph poles, and carring regular traffic.Gripping yarn, pity about the facts."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Doubt This Story Is True....","review":"I spent two and a half years living in Mongolia, including time in the Gobi desert. I read the book while I was there. There are no large black snakes in the Gobi (Yes, this is documented; there are very few snake species in Mongolia....), and all of the information about Mongolia and the Gobi is inaccurate to a greater or lesser degree. I have severe doubts about the whole story. Still, if you take it as a work of fantasy, it's an okay way to spend a few hours' free time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good read","review":"Singularly one of the worst fact-checked books I have EVER read. This book has been hailed as a true story, but in reality, the man NEVER made the trek he describes. The writing is poor, the story-line, had it been presented as fiction MIGHT have been interesting, if only the writing wasn't so, so uninspired. I read this for a book club and was NOT impressed. Not in the least. Google the \\"authors\\" name. Read the documents. But DO NOT buy this book and read it. Again, the story-line, presented as fiction, might make a good movie and that is what Hollywood is counting on. In one word, annoying.

It is done in a narrative style which sometimes lacks powerful dramatic impact but reflects the sometime fuzzy recollection of the author.

Just a few months ago we wanted to read it again and couldn't find our copy. I ordered another one and have it stashed away for when the time is right. Last time, my friend borrowed the book to read it but I never got it back. It is as good a read as the first time around. I give it four stars for its adventure, and the vivid descriptions. We first became acquainted with this memoir about 8 years ago. My friend sat on the edge of the tv one evening and heard an advertisement about the book. He was so captivated that he read the entire book within a few days. We were so impressed with this book that we told all of our friends and loaned our secound copy out again."},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesn't appear to be accurate.","review":"I was half way through this book when I realized that the story line just didn't add up. I believe the author has fabricated most if not all of the events that take place. If I had to guess, I would say that it is completely fiction. Having said that, as fiction the book is only average. If true it is one of the most remakable tales, but as stated I believe it is highly unlikely that this book is accurate. I felt somewhat cheated after reading what I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing to say the least","review":"I love history. I love stories about overcoming obstacles against overwhelming odds. I thought this book would be one to add to my list. I will say this, I finished the book against my own obstacles of the obvious errors against truth. First, the author was not part of such a team. We was released from Russia well after he states that this had taken place. That started my slow, but steady disregard for this book. The character, as I will call him, would be humbled by this experience. However, anytime something positive takes place, he is the one responsible for the outcome. The opposite is true when a negative situation occurs, it is always the fault of the other members. Almost everything is glaringly wrong. Yes, the Russians were bad. Yes, they sent millions of people to their death. Yes they used to torture, but that is pretty much where the accuracy ends. If you can get past the issues and look at this book at a purely literary stand point it is tolerable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Walk Of Courage","review":"This book is powerful, moving, and beautifully written. The daring escape made by the author and his comrades from the Russians and their adventures to freedom will make you laugh as well as cry.I have never read a book that was more full of adventure, bravery, and hope.

If it is, as advertised, non-fiction then \\"The Long Walk\\" is a very enjoyable retelling of a harrowing, heartbreaking, and for some, deadly quest for freedom.

This book is gripping, touching, intense, and unforgettable. I've read many books in my life. This book ranks in the top five, no question.

An epic story of human endurance is being challenged. Did wartime prisoners really walk from Siberia to India?In some of the negative reviews you will learn of the above BBC program containing evidence found by investigators including Linda Willis which cause doubt of the validity of this book. You can read the BBC report by googling the first paragraph above.What I found most interesting of the BBC investigation was several online comments to the article from individuals around Europe who personally know of Polish prisoners who made treks of 1000 miles or so out of Russia's gulag to Persia, the middle East, and the far orient. The truth is that stories somewhat like Rawicz's actually happened many times; maybe hundreds at least it would seem to me. And there remains many other Polish descendants in Siberia's rural areas of those who got out from the Soviet prison system, but then traveled far less distances away."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best!","review":"I have had this book for about 35 years.

I showed it to my friends, and many shook their heads and refused to read it, because for some reason they thought it was part of a disinformation plot by Red Scare conspiracists.Now that the USSR is fallen and former officials themselves are admitting the brutality of the Soviet system, it is now correct to read such a book as The Long Walk.This is very good, because the book is actually a timeless story about survival in the face of incredible odds, the will and longing to find a measure of liberty, and the heart-wrenching tale of one man's suffering. Very inspiring, and very instructive of what is sometimes required in order to simply live on to tell the tale...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great true story of courage and perserverance.","review":"This is the true story of an ex-Polish army Officer, sent to a Siberian Labor Camp and escaped!

It is an amazing account of the trials that people will go through. Yet, like many others, the tale is too amazing to believe. Firstly, the escape from the actual camp is far too easy. After reading A Prisoner's Duty by Robert C. Doyle I find it hard to beleive that the escape was so easy. Doyle's book is devoted to how hard it was to simply breach the fortifications of even the most lightly guarded facilites. Then Doyle talks about how hard it was to often escape even 100 miles. In this book the escapers not only escape easily but trek about 2,500 miles. To me this seems too amazing to beleive.Even with this though, the book should be read to remind people to be thankfull that no matter how bad life becomes there are far worse fates."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story, wish it was verified.","review":"Incredible story!

Maybe he had a tape recorder. Oh, and the party of escapees crossed the Lena River. Just crossed it, period. No mention of the river's size or the temperature or how they managed to overcome little inconveniences like hypothermia. Did they wade or use a raft?

Well, answering question a, if you go through something so life changing, its not going to just escape your memory.

After reading the manual, concluded there is a major defect in the phone. The only way I can disconnect, is to unplug the phone line. The message sounds like one is sitting in a can...very poor quality. I am retiring this phone as soon as it's replacement arrives (different brand). It is not worth my time or aggravation to work with the manufacturer, especially considering the low price I paid.....will chalk it up to money spent on education.

I grew up being scared out of my wits as a kid of the Hulk when I regularly watched the show and the reruns that came on (which is were I saw a majority of the episodes). I am glad they are planning on releasing the pilot and a reg two parter episode on DVD. I can't wait to get this DVD and I do hope they plan on putting some future episodes on DVD or perhaps putting Season 1 or Season 2 on a future DVD release."},{"rating":"2","title":"32 Years Old - Never Saw, or don't remember pilot","review":"Although I don't remember the pilot movie, I am a fan of the TV series and remember it well. The whole nice guy / gentle giant play was done impeccably here. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It is funny, because the story, the feel, the powerful emotional aspect is so well done that the limited effects did not phase me. I didn't expect anything more. A good story like this, except for clothing and cars, it just didn't seem disappointingly dated as I watched it. Did anyone perceive Bixby as slightly similar to William Shatner overacting? Just a tad. I highly recommend both old and new movies to every Hulk lover. The new one is phenomenal. Some rant that it takes too long to get going, and that it doesn't hold true to the TV series. Great movie done in a different style, along with phenomenal effects. Well, they both made this Hulk fan very happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can not go home again....","review":"These episodes have not aged well. They never explain how David was able to wear such nice clothes when he was on the run, and why did the Hulk make-up look like green paint?! Sorry but after so many years, the series must be put out to pasture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than the Ang Lee travesty","review":"Not really a Marvel comics fanatic, but I've always ejoyed this movie very much. This is the true Hulk film in my opinion.Bill Bixby is excellent as David Banner and Lou Ferrigno also as the green giant. This is basically a dramatic film, concentrating on the human aspect of the story. It's quite a tragedy film really.Now, I higly recommend this film. But if you liked the new version, you're probably not gonna enjoy this film much. Personally I thought the 2003 film was horrible.Also, terrific extras on this disc. A solid two part episode included, titled \\"Married\\". You can probably guess how that one turns out, but it's pretty good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just rent it ...","review":"The DVD features the very first pilot episode (1.5 hours) and the first episode from the second season (also 1.5 hours). The first episode is surprisingly boring after all these years - and too may gaps between hulkism. The second episode is not as boring as the first, but comes close. I was a huge fan of this series in the 70's and know that there are much more exciting episodes than this. I assume the reason they chose these episodes because they were longer in length. I would have preferred three exciting one hour episodes than these ones.DVD SUMMARY:Are you thinking of buying it? That's up to you, but I would recommend renting this first. There are also very few extra features on the disc. The positives are the higher than average film transfer (very clear), and the sound is ok (although not surround but for 1977 what can you expect?)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Original premiere of the Incredibel Hulk DVD","review":"I watched a lot of episodes of the Incredible Hulk. Although I might not care for a lot of them now, there were a lot of good episodes. Even in the last 10 years with the new releases of Hulk movies, they just aren't the same without Bill Bixby playing David Banner. I wouldn't even say this was the best episode, but because it was the original premiere and explained how the Hulk came to be, it will always be a classic and a must have for any Hulk fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Acting and Direction","review":"Unlike the modern Hulk movies, the director of the live-action television series didn't have high tech special effects at his disposal. This may have contributed to the fact that this series was about the characters interacting with one another instead of being about violence and special effects.When I was a kid, I didn't enjoy this series much because I had to wait too long to see the Hulk in action. However, as an adult, I appreciate the fact that Bill Bixby was a great actor and the science fiction aspect of the story was ahead of its time. Your kids might not sit through this pilot, but the adults in the room will be entertained by the well-written script and superb acting and directing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hulk out on DVD","review":"I have been here from the very begining of the series. I can't say that I have enjoyed every episode, but the ones I love are most memerable, and this DVD includes the episodes that make this series a classic in TV. history. Bill Bixby was very serious about this production as was Lou as it shows in their performance. This DVD is great in picture quality, although is grainy in some spots but still above and beyond VHS and even the original broadcast. Both episodes(original pilot,Married) are very crisp and clean, with only a few flaws. The sound is mono but still clean, and has HiFi definition above and beyond what you heard back in the 70's or even on the SciFi network. Well worth the price so grab it!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Had promise, didn't deliver...","review":"This title had promise when I first saw it.

I heard these girls were trying to be like, the best girl group in the world and sorry, but you gals are far from it! Destiny's Child is by far, the best girl group out there and no one, not even 3LW, can top them! I'm so sick of hearing \\"No More (Baby I'ma Do Right)\\" that it's not even funny. Even though I absolutely hate this song, it's actually kind of catchy and the beat and lyrics gets stuck in my head. Sure, these girls can sing...but that's about the only thing that's keeping them from totally failing successfully as a group. I suggest that you do not waste your money on this once again so-called girl group and save your money to buy Destiny's Child's new, upcoming album, SURIVIOR.

It is a fantastic selection of Silly Wizard's work. The \\"Queen of Argyll\\" is my absolute favorite love song of all time with lyrics like \\"All the roses in the garden bow and ask their pardon for not one could match the beauty of the Queen of all Argyll\\". If that doesn't conjure the image of a red haired Scottish beauty strolling in a garden or meadow, I don't know what does.

For example a 90 degree setting does not produce a 90 degree cut. I can forgive that and use a square or another tool to set measurements; however, this saw cannot produce a 90 degree cut, maybe 87 degrees at best. I regret wasting my money on this and will give it away to a goodwill store. I can't, in good conscience, sell it to anyone else. Black and Decker shouldn't sell anything that it can't be proud of and no one can be proud of this mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"I've had this saw for 1 year now. So far I found it helpful. I guess the real stress test came when building a deck out of composite lumber. After trimming off boards I noticed that the composite lumber saw dust clogged up the saw and the blade got literally stuck. After this incident I noticed that I can not make 90 degree cut any longer (which is extremely annoying).I am now looking for another saw that is a) more powerful (15Amps) and b) that cuts 90 degrees."},{"rating":"1","title":"Innaccurate","review":"The saw is inaccurately calibrated, I mean WAY off, making it useless for cutting angles or any kind of precise woodworking. You can't fix it, either. I use this saw for cutting firewood, it's all it's good for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot make 90 degree cuts","review":"This circular saw has the long and flimsy front bracket (which holds the base plate to the plastic body) and it is easily to be bent up under even light pressure, which in turn makes the blade tilted a little (but noticeable) instead of a straight angle. I've had to make a makeshift bracket, bolted it to the aluminum blade guard to keep the front bracket from bending up. The process required drilling and tapping small holes, it's because I owned one already, otherwise, it's not a good circular saw for carpentry works.When I make a cut (the blade still spinning) then put the saw on the ground, the movable aluminum guard rubbing the spinning blade. This will pre-maturely wear out the blade, ruin the movable guard - over a period of time - and making kind of annoying noise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't make a 90 degree cut..","review":"Like another reviewer mentioned, my saw is incapable of making a 90 degree cut. Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"It won't cut square unless you fiddle and fiddle with it. Even once you have it square, the body flexes relative to the base because it was designed so poorly. Also, after not much use the bearings developed runout in them, I can turn on the saw and watch the blade oscillate sideways 1/8 inch. Irritatingly, the fixed portion of the guard goes so far forward and is so far out from the o.d. of the blade that you cannot see the blade begin the cut unless you manouver yourself to the side. This saw is a total piece of garbage, no thought in its design and very poor quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Screw Driver is not Heavy Equipment!","review":"The little Black & Decker may seem like a light weight, but not to me.

The only thing going for it is the nice wide roller surface."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solidly built, no bearings","review":"Good quality for a low price. The stand is essentially unbreakable. The roller, however, does not sit on bearings, as the picture may lead you to believe. Instead, there are two steel posts projecting laterally from the roller body which insert into holes on the steel frame. This setup allows for some wobble during rolling should anything get lodged in the holes."},{"rating":"1","title":"defective stand","review":"I ordered this roller stand on the strength of its positive reviews.

Unfortunately two things let it down in my opinion; firstly, the story only skimmed the surface - alot more could have been done to develop the characters and describe the scenes/events (there is plenty of material in the other factual books I've mentioned). Secondly, there were too many coincidences, i.e. the author tried to involve his main character, or a friend of his main character,in almost every Texas Brigade anecdote/episode/event that occured, ignoring the fact that different regiments and companies could have been (and actually were) involved.

I think anyone that has a playstion that's a boy{or could be girl} should buy it, I wish you would not buy this one, because I have been looking for this game for about a year, but you can buy it if you want to.

All of you out there who wanted the last NEW copy of this game I'm sorry but it looks like I beat you to the punch, no disrespect I had to add this game to my collection.

Terms are misused and mixed up in the later chapters (which I realized after further research of my own). No one example that progresses throughout the book. It's like he figured out how this works, did a quick off-the-wall example and through it in the book. In some cases, the information you used from a previous chapter will not work with a future chapter without making changes, if you would have used one example through out the book you would have realized this. I am also giving him one star b/c he felt that he needed to give himself 5, this will bring it down to more accurate rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this book","review":"I'm giving one star to balance unfair author's 5 stars. Poorly written, examples have nothing to do with the content of the book. They are full of bugs and some do not work.

(The others being: Spellbound, Eclipse and Dark Magick)This book is in Hunters point of view, and you get to know him better.(He isnt serious all the time really!) Hunter goes to canada for two reasons. One, he has to find his parents, and two, hes been given an assignment for the council. Hunters dad is a little darker than you think, he's lost somthin precious to him, and the assignment is a lot more trouble than its worth. I wont spoil it all, READ THE BOOK INSTEAD!!!!

I loved the fact that she had changed from Morgan's point of (Morgan happens to be my name too!) to Hunter's, we finally got to really understand his feelings! I found myself so involved in the book that my emotions were really strong! At one point I got so mad at Hunter! I won't say anything more about that though! You'll have to read it and find out! But I just have to say that this was ANOTHER GREAT book in the Sweep series and I am impatiently waiting for the next one to come out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh Point of View","review":"I have to say that I really enjoyed this installment in the \\"Sweep\\" series. It was refreshing to hear the story from another character's point of view, aside from in various Books of Shadows entries. Hunter's anguish is quite apparent, as well as the emotional and mental strain his father is experiencing. The only reason that I don't give the book 5 stars is that it didn't seem quite as dramatic and high-paced as the previous \\"Sweep\\" books. I realize that they were exploring some fairly complex emotional issues, but it seemed a little too quiet for me. Otherwise, another excellent book from Cate Tiernan."},{"rating":"2","title":"hunter-hunter-hunter","review":"i was so so so glad that they finally changed the viewpoint of the story!!! its nice to see what hunter's thinking ! usually all you get is entry's from his BOS! it's a nice change! hunter's a sweety!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hunter-Your big No-No made me hate this book! Otherwise","review":"called Hunter keep your lips to yourself! ( And I wish Morgan had cast a spell so green alge grew on them!)Personally this is my least favorite book of the series. Orgins is right behind it, not because it's a bad book but because it was so dark. The reason I don't like this book is simple Hunter ****** another person! Talk about loving the one your with!The only good part was how he helped pull his father back from the land of the dead. It was really sad to read about how his dad communicated with the dead and because of it was having the life drained out of him. His addiction is just like any other and was horrible to read about how it affected Hunter. Maybe He and Hunter could go to I speak to the dead anonymous? Can his son help bring him back into the world of the living or will his father become a real corpse instead of just looking like one?

Two years in, it began acting up more and taking a lot more effort (going over wrinkles again and again and yet again). Then all of the setting numbers came off.

I also tried to read Sun's specs but it was hard for a beginner. Then I bought Sanghera\`s SCBCD Exam kit. It was really good for a beginner, easy to read. In fact it was like a novel, I could not stop reading it. After a month I passed exam with %90. I really recommend this book. Now I fell like I am an expert in this topic. When I design and write codes related with EJB, It's a good thing to know what is what and what is going there.

Discovered the base isn't even close to being flat. It wobbled back and forth on the top of my saw. Measured the gap under one corner and it was .030\\". That is huge for something that is only 8\\" on a side. I called Grizzly and a replacement base is on back order and won't be available for about 45 days.I checked the other flat surfaces and they appear to be much flatter. I haven't checked whether the vertical support is parallel to the miter slot yet, but my first observations on how it is indexed doesn't give me great confidence since it only makes contact at one end of the slide rail.

From the front of the side support to the rear is rougly an 1/8\\" off. The way this is made there is no adjustment to correct this issue. From other reviews it has been said that the base rocks, yet mine was flat and that was not an issue. Just the side vertical support is about an 1/8\\" of true from te rear end.

In the summer I would normally do this with brake cleaner but since it was zero outside, I had to use conventional MS inside.I had to convert the jig to left tilt, not a problem but the face would not line up to the blade. I had to open up one of the alignment holes but then it worked out fine. The alignment instructions are incorrect and need editing.BLADE CLEARENCE ADJUSTMENT. . . .6.

However, this jig took a lot of \\"jiggling\\" to get it to work properly. I had to drill out one of the holes in the base plate to get enough play in the miter slot bar to properly align the jig to the blade. The instructions, as others noted, are in bad need of rewriting. They are not very accurate. In fact, the product is sold as usable for a right/left tilting saw, but there's not one word about this in the manual. I had to write Grizzly to get a clarification. Apparently, merely moving the miter guide bar to the alternate setting makes this a jig for a left tilting blade saw. Who knew? Once I was done tinkering with it, it is now an accurate, easy to use piece of machinery."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd give it 0 stars but the system won't let me.","review":"I have a saw with the specified slot size but the unit rocks. The technical service rep at Grizzly told me he'd never heard of my saw, like this is an important point, and they were not responsible for saws made prior to the start of their own company - even if the slot were the same size. They'd let me return it at my expense, and remember I'd already paid to ship it, and with a 10% restocking fee so to return it I'd lose about 50% of the total paid which the rep agreed was correct. He suggested two things that might work - build up the base around part of bars thickness or have the bar milled. Yes but this will cost me another $20-$25. So the summary is to make this work I need to put money into it. Other tools I've bought with the same specs fit nicely. So much for Grizzly. As a side note this unit was loaded with grease like you'd expect to find on an old car grease fitting.

Was there an opinion or conclusion belonging to F. David Peat? If the answer is yes I couldn't find it. What I found was a treatise on Carl Jung interspersed with totally unreleated quotes from Sheldrake, Pauli etc. on QM. Peat's examples of synchronicity offer no commonality with the word at all: a candle burning out at a dinner party at the time someone's father died, or a picture falling from the wall on the day of someone's funeral don't relate to synchronicity.

This book put me there quite early, and kept me pinned for a couple of weeks. If I were extremely masochistic, I would read it again and highlight identical themes. Never in my life have I read anything more redundant. It seemed as if, at the onset, the author outlined his major points, and then thought of ten ways to say each point. Then, each of the ten variations for each point were repeated two or three times. I won't go on and on about this book. It was somewhat interesting, but it was entirely subjective, every point that the author was trying to disprove could very easily be seen from other points of view, and it was about 100 pages too long.

Freeman Dyson totally caves in to organized religion, and even repeats the often-heard canard that Western Civilization would have been impossible without Christianity and the Bible. The latter thesis is patently absurd. One need only consider the contributions of the civilizations of Greece and Rome.

This book has very little about the philosophy of the Essenes and even less about the life of Christ. Based on the little amount of the speaking of Christ in this book, the title is very misleading. It is really a fictional account of a boy who is trained in the ways of the Essenes and later becomes a disciple of Christ. While there is some good spiritual imagery painted from time to time for the most part the book is drab and unconvincing.Little, if anything, of the knowledge held by the Essenes has survived till today. It is even in doubt how much, if any, contact Jesus has with the Essenes. Slightly (only slightly) more realistic are the works of Edmond Bordeaux Szekely.

The website contradicts itself regarding if it will work with 64-bit versions of Windows 7, but as far as I can tell, it only works with 32-bit versions.Secondly, the interface and documentation are ugly and unintuitive. I'm sure with several days of concentration I can get this to do what I want, but so far, not so good...Third, the \\"web based\\" interface only works with Internet Explorer. Good luck if you have a mac.I really regret this purchase.

It was. But not for the reasons the author describes and not in the way he says. Better accounts are written by Bamford, Gerhard, Findley and survivors. Not by Cristol, which is itself polemical in a different direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is refuted by recent US documentation","review":"Interestingly the latest declassfications (especially NSA intercepts) show that the US knew in short order that Israeli forces did in fact believe the ship was hostile. It is a shame that the myth of an intentional attack has become more of a story than the heroic efforts of the crew.Friendly fire incidents are terrible. We shot down an Iranian airliner, killed Canadian troops who were where they were supposed to be in Afghanistan, etc. But to manufacture motives, especially contrary to the facts, is not really helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is propaganda, the facts have been recorded elsewhere","review":"I don't understand the motivation of authors that claim the USS Liberty attack was anything but accidental. Sure they'll get some sales from the neo-Nazi conspiracy nuts, but isn't being honest more important? In short this book still can't answer the $64,000 question of why Israel would purposely attack their ONLY ally in 1967.Why did Israel use anti-aircraft munitions instead of a bomb?It is clearly obvious that this was an on-the-fly friendly fire accident.If this friendly fire incident were something else, the US would not have begun giving military aid to Israel, (they started this policy in 1968) Israel and the United States are 2 of a kind, they have the courage to fight terrorism, and this book is simply making up a conspiracy that never happened. Don't quit your day job Anthony Pearson, whatever it is.When will a conspiracy theory book come out regarding the bombing of the USS Stark in which 37 American sailors were killed?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as Expected","review":"This item was a bit more on cost than I would have liked to have spent, but I will say it works just as I had expected and needed. I'll take one star off because of the high price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to install, easy to use, secure","review":"I first tried another rack that required removing the front wheel. This took some extra time since my bike has disc brakes and sometimes the disc brakes (or the tension on the wheel mounts) needed to be re-adjusted after popping the wheel back on. I took that rack back.The Topline works perfect for me. It is easy to install and easy to use. The parts can fit under one of your truck's seats. The bike is completely secure when in the rack. It is a no hassle product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but may take some DIY work for your truck","review":"I bought this for my 2003 Dodge to use with 2 Specialized Mtn bikes. The bed rail clamp did not clamp down tight enough on my bed rail but I was able to drill another hole a little higher to move the clamp piece higher and that worked fine. Specialized Bikes do not have frames made out of round tubing (large square tubing instead) so the bike clamps only work by attaching to the seat.That being said, I'm really happy with this clamp. I like having the bikes up in my bed and the clamp really keeps them in place. The bed rail clamp has a convenient locking hole that makes it real easy to lock them in the bed. I haven't tried the included bike lock but that's a nice touch too. I would definitely recommend this rack but realize that you may need to modify a little to get a tight enough fit."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't work for me","review":"I used the brand before and it's good for me though not as good as the Shiseido. I needed the cream for dry and very dry skin. For what this new one claimed, I thought it right for me. But it turned out I wanted to throw it away, feeling so bad that I paid for nothing! Oddly it's the first one I used labeled 'Allergy Tested' and it's the first one caused itchy or allergy like reaction to me and it made my skin even drier after using it. Terrible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat pointless","review":"An odd little compilation which takes the Appalachian songs from 1971's Reflection, and adds a few traditional numbers from 1970's Cruel Sister. Which begs the question: er, why? If you're really looking for some prime Pentangle, try the excellent Light Flight collection (2 CDs for less than the price of this one), or track down a copy of Reflection or Basket Of Light."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buggy and unreliable","review":"I had nothing but problems with the Formac Studio TV. It was very difficult to get the Mac to \\"see\\" the device. It had to be plugged into a certain firewire port and wouldn't work if certain other devices were connected. When I upgraded from a G4 to G5 it wouldn't work at all. The software is very particular - if it doesn't see the hardware immediately, it halts. Don't waste your money or time - check out the Canopus ADVC convertors. I got the 300 and it is awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"It's been awhile since i have bought a CD that I absolutely thought was horrible. Well, that fatefull day came once again when Pacha Ibiza, Vol. 2 arrived. Most of the music is absolutley nothing new, and CD's 2 and 3 sound like they are geared for the Studio 54 audience. If I wanted Diana Ross 70's music I would buy it. I bought Pacha Ibiza, Vol. 2 thinking it would be smooth bumpin beats. Try shallow, clunky, and washed up. Do not buy this CD, and do not buy this cd for anyone, it's a horrible waste of money and time. Buy Pure Pacha 2005, or Pure Pacha Winter Sessions. Both are very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top-notch guide","review":"I love the way this book is organized. Rather than describe a series of hiking opportunities in New Jersey, the authors carefully culled through hundreds of trails and picked out the most exciting hikes in the state. They even patched together multiple trails in within most parks so you would get the best bang out of the time invested. The descriptions are accurate and fun to read. I tried three of them so far and look forward to doing the other 47."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best","review":"This game rocks. One of the best I have ever played! Way too much fun to put down.

It was used, but still ran perfectly in the PS3. Thank you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of donkey, very little kong","review":"I do not know why the title claims this author to be a video master -- the book reads like it was written by a complete novice. The tricks and tips offered are all of the old, well-known obvious things that everyone everywhere knows about playing the Kong. I think this author must have spent too much time at the mall arcade with too few friends that could tell him that he just ins't that good. Probably froma small town where he was the leader of the black-trenchcoat teenage recluse gang, I guess. Anyway, don't spend the money on this one . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOTAL PIECE OF PIE","review":"Intolerable nonsense with no character in woefully miscast actors.

It's not even set in America which makes it hard for mass audiences to identify with."},{"rating":"1","title":"one of the worst movies ever!","review":"This movie has bad acting, an awful plot, and it was just boring.

Awful script, weak directing, wooden acting... everyone involved with this piece of utter nonsense should be thoroughly embarrassed. No cliche left unturned, no stale trope left unused. A movie without a single redeeming feature except, of course, that it finally comes to an end. Avoid at all costs unless you want a premature aneurism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kidmans stuffs up yet another film","review":"Sorry, just can't like Kidman in anything she does. She pouts and poses her way through this, no wonder Clooney wants to piss her off and takes every opportunity to do so. Clooney is his usual likeable and capable self and Kidman tries oh-so-hard, but a Nuclear Physicist??? Oh, please. All that's missing is a BMX bicycle. Marcel Iures is casting brilliance - when does the viewer ever feel any sympathy for a \\"terrorist\\"? But here one does. And he's not portrayed as a mindless fruitloop, which is a great change, but someone to sympathise with, even though you know he's still the bad guy. Shame the device hadn't been shoved in Kidman's knickers before it went off."},{"rating":"2","title":"post cold war thriller","review":"It is a time of nuclear disarmament. Ten nuclear war heads are being transport for destruction through Russia on board a train. The train crashes into another train, detonating a nuke. Is it deliberate or an accident ? Enter Nicole Kidman as Dr. Julia Kelly, head of the White House Nuclear Smuggling group, its her job to deal with this potential crisis. In comes George Clooney too, as a Special Forces Colonel, to be a military liaison, \\"make sure he can work with a woman\\" is Kidman's recommendation to Clooney's commanding officer. Working together in close cooperation Clooney initiates Kidman into the practicalities of fieldwork. At first Kidmans' egghead approach is real slow and clumsy but soon she and Clooney are a team chasing down the bad guys. An exhilarating musical score and a top notch script keep the action moving in this Dreamworks production."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly predictible and boring!","review":"Poor George Clooney - when will he get a break? This makes several movies that have bombed that he stared in. Action is not his best kind of movie, and this was a poor excuse for an action movie all because there was so little truth to it. It must have lacked any military advise during the shooting of the film. For example, there are no night vision goggles, that I know of, that emit red lights from the front of tubes, and to the best of my knowledge,(I spent 11 years in the Army as an officer),no Light Colonel has the kind of power and authority, that Clooney had,especially at the Pentagon! The plot is very thin and Nichole Kidman is such a poor acctress, that it makes any Tom Clancy movie look like a Discovery Channel educational special. Don't waste your time with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peacemaker","review":"A action movie and then some. Breaking up a terriorist plot. The two people fight off the terriorists. It is a heart pumping movie. Not A \\"Chick Flick\\", unless you are into Action Pictures. Car chases,military action,use of guns,etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clooney as basically Ollie North - quite a trip!","review":"I love this movie! Seeing Clooney, the big lib, playing a character that was obviously patterned after Ollie North is funny. But it is an excellent movie. It's a tight thriller, and well acted all around. Kidman and Clooney were both nearing the top of their careers, but still rising, at this time, and it shows in their efforts. A+"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie and even Greater Sound","review":"The DTS version blew the regular Dolby Digital version away. The picture seemed like it was clearer as well. The plot is action packed and filled with thrills"},{"rating":"2","title":"The most enjoyable action/thriller since \\"Air Force One\\"","review":"This first film by Dreamworks delivers as an engrossing thriller. While it does wait a bit too long to \\"grip\\" its audience, the first part of the film still keeps the viewer's attention; and once the action starts, it doesn't stop until the rolling of the end credits. I particularly enjoyed the last thirty minutes--some of the most exciting sequence of events I have ever seen in a film. Clooney and Kidman, while not great, are believable in their roles. The soundtrack by Hans Zimmer could have been better (like his work in \\"The Rock\\"), but there are still a few instances of stirring music. With plot elements reminiscent of a 007 movie, \\"The Peacemaker\\" provides much more excitement than Bond ever could. END"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"I rented this rather than buy it and be disappointed, god I am glad I did. This may sound Chauvinistic of me but Women don't know how to make a War film. I blame the Director for this film's crappyness. The first part of the movie doesn't make sense at all, your left hanging as to what the hell is going on it gives you a vague idea about something with the Russians getting a nuke and then drops off from there, it lacks accuracy about the military to a severe degree, it's littered to the teeth with liberal and feminazi innuendo . And to top it all off it has George Clooney in it. hehehe anyway if you are looking for a good war movie, get a classic, like say...Patton Crimson Tide Air Force one Saving Private Ryan Full Metal Jacket The Dirty Dozen Broken Arrow Gettysburgbut whatever you do don't pay money to see peacemaker...god what a terrible waste of film."},{"rating":"1","title":"CLOONEY WOULD MAKE A GREAT \\"CORKY\\"","review":"George Clooney is about as entertaining to watch as Michael Jackson being raped by the Gorton's fisherman.

It is an exciting and original movie that manages to keep you glued to your seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than \\"Air Force One\\"","review":"Good, solid movie that misses on details. The reason I give it a 4 rahther 5 is because sometimes it slips into old Hollywood tricks. That's not how you pass a roadblock in Southern Russia and that's not how the roadblock looks like.

That woman can write! This book touches on numerous topics such as homosexuality, eating disorders, friendship, peer pressure, depression, exploration, growing up, etc. There is something for everyone and the plot keeps you hooked. Its never boring. Lani and Claire are both endearing characters what keep you interested and the mystery is addicting. this book is simply brilliant. thats all there is to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An extremely memorable and thought provoking tale...","review":"I am an avid young adult reader...from Fluffy Chick-Lit, to the more mature reads...anyhow I go through tons book and this novel is hands down the most stimulating Young Adult book I have read so far.I read this book two summers ago, I can still remember crying at he climax of the story (which I NEVER do) and thinking...and thinking...and still thinking WHATEVER HAPPENED TO LANI GARVER?!?!?This book was a captivating story that I could not put down. It leaves the reader with compelling thoughts questioning you as an individual, your beliefs and life. The book is also important because it deals with so many stereotypical teenage \\"issues\\" without being corny, just informative and thought provoking.I highly suggest reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"What Happened to Lani Garver is one of the best books I have ever read. The protagonist, Claire, is believable and most teens can relate to her in some way. Claire is hiding the fact that she worries about having a relapse of leukemia and that she has an eating disorder. When she meets Lani, they become friends, and he helps her change and become a better, healthier person. The question of whether or not Lani really was an angel is left unanswered, which is probably just as well because then each reader can decide for themselves. You should definetly read this book. It is absolutely wonderful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow - Zero Stars","review":"So this is a great book that deals with homophobia but has this line in its second paragraph? \\"I'm a Hackett native (meaning \\"born and raised here,\\" as opposed to meaning \\"savage\\") and most of us natives have no use for legends or curses or stories requiring big imaginations.\\"Maybe the author should deal with her racism. That would be interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read the Greatest Book","review":"This book was evry interesting because it helps people understand how it feels to go to a new school, move to a new town, and a new house, and try to fin some new friends. Lani had just gotten over cancer. So when she chemo, she had lost all of her hair.When it all grew back Lani didn't cut it.When Lani trys to find friends people don't know if Lani was a girl or a boy? So everyone kind of left Lani alown because guys didn't want to become friends if Lani was a girl, and if the popular girls would go over to become friends with Lani, what is Lani was a guy they wouldn't know.So things that I didn't like about the book was that they kept on draging the story on and on until Lani would find a friend or someone to even atempt to go and talk to Lani.Over all I liked the book that is why I gave the book ****. The book kind of kept my interest at the end of the book, because you found out who Lani Garver really was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"i love to read but this book was so hard to get into and i could barely get through it all. not a good book at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fell in Love","review":"I fell in love with Lani Garver, even though there was no clear answer of what he is. I'll miss Lani so much even though he is only a charactor. This isn't just a book that you read and enjoy the thoughts you get while reading it, this is a book that will stay with you and will drive you nuts wondering. I felt empty and full of questions when it was finished. I would have given it 5 stars but it kind of left me crying and depressed wondering what happened to Lani Garver. By the way, Loni isn't the typical wonderer who's helping a stranger out. He's...special, I shouldn't give it away though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could Not Put This Down","review":"I picked this book up at a store, and thought it would be an easy read. I was right, but I totally loved this book. Sometimes I re-read it just so that it's engraved in my brain.You fall in love with some of the characters and you hate the others, which is good. Also, the main concepts are really deep for such a short book and I think that the author did really well to make the book have a specific point. It really makes you rethink your life. Five stars from me. I will definitely read some other books by this author.IMPORTANT: People under 13 should not read this, it is pretty dark and deals with a lot of tough tragedies, that happen in real life. I still cry every time I read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turned off by the foul language","review":"I really enjoyed The Body of Christopher Creed and was looking forward to reading this book by the same author.

The bottom line is that this guy is an amazing talent, my favorite on the fiddle by far, and I believe that anyone who likes Irish tradtional music even just a little bit will love this recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Title Lousy Game","review":"I thought this game said it had something to do with vampires. I been fascinated with vampire lore for a long time and love some of the games that follow the old stories. I guess I was looking for more of a Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain or Soul Reaver slant but guess what no dice. This game wasn't by any means hard or challenging. Total waste of what I paid for it in my opinion. The sound tracks were well done but the storyline left a lot to be desired. I am a pretty avid gamer and have a good knowledge of a game that deserves to be played or not and this one is almost no worth renting. There are far better things to do with your time no matter how pitiful your life is trust me. Skip it Move on and get over it before it consumes you completely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Judge a book by its cover","review":"You are always told this as a child.

Character interaction isn't what the reviews claim it to be (oh sure, the villagers talk to you, but its nothing that you need to go out of the way for) and for a game titled Vampire Apocalpyse, it has nothing to do with vampires! For that matter, the endless questing and hacking of monsters (the hack and slash is the ONLY fun part) gets dull after an hour, and there's STILL no hint anywhere of a storyline or even a minor plot! If you need something to do to just occupy some time, get this game, but if you're looking for a good plot/story related action RPG (if you can really call this game an RPG) then I'd try to steer clear of Dark Angel."},{"rating":"1","title":"I almost went back to the PS1 after playing this one...","review":"It's too bad that you can't rate below one star... this was the first I bought after I bought a PS2 and I can say that it is the main reason that I NEVER buy a game without renting it first. The story line is non-existant. There are no cut-scenes. It made me down right angry that they actually released this game. I played it for about a week hoping it would get better... it didn't. I finally gave up, and packed this game, along with my PS2 back in the box, and stuck them in my closet for about a month until my friend convinced me that there were good games out there.

There would be loud pounding music one minute and all of the sudden it's silent for a long time....Strange.... The action was barely there, just run up to the monster and hack. It wasn't even fun after the first 30mins. The graphics isn't even worthy of PSone (maybe supernintendo).

As some other reviews have said, a role playing game is something like Phantasy Star (of which I have played all four of the originals... I still find II and IV the most fun, strange as it may seem to some) - but my favorites have always been PSI and the original Final Fantasy. They were for low-grade systems, and this game plays as if it were made for a low-grade system, in my opinion. It really uses NONE of the PSX-2's special capabilities, and that's a waste of energy and effort - what's the point of having the ability to have movies, speech, animations and character depth if you don't use it?. Don't even bother renting it. It's a waste of space.

I finally got one (for Christmas this year) and was a little worried about how it would work out. Fortunately, it works like a wonder. While it does take some getting used to, and was not exactly how I percieved it would work, it is still a fine piece of equipment. The small size of the tablet is really not a hinderence at all (unless you want to use the included mouse, which is about the same size as the actual drawing area). My only real gripe, though, is the over sensitivity of the pen over the pad, but that is really more of a training issue than anything else, I just need to get used to the slight differences from a normal pen and paper.

So can place 1 in a stud, and the other in dry wall. Would be nice if it was 16 inches, so both could be placed in studs- You need to be very exact 12 inches apart for wall mounts.

The coat rack itself is well made with high quality & functional flip hooks but the screws that came with it were so flimsy that both screw heads snapped off while hand screwing them into wood that was already pre-drilled. In fact, the metal is so soft that it wouldn't withstand being drilled so the screws could be removed with a screw extractor. As others have also noted, line up the template with the hanging holes on the back before you use the template as they are off by about 1/2 inch--enough to make it so not only will you not be able to hang it but drilling another hole at the correct distance will be so close that you can weaken the hanging substrate.

One of my favorite lines of all time is in this movie, when Carol Burnett accuses husband Alan Alda of always overanalyzing everything, and he says, \\"Yeah, but do you know WHY I always overanalyze everything?\\" And Rita Moreno looking wistfully at their divorced friend with the adoring hot lover and saying, \\"I wanna be like them.\\" It's a sweet and real movie.

At times, you wonder - why are these people friends ? But, under it all, you can see love for one another...love and exasperation, almost any emotion close bonds will cause to erupt or simmer.

The tape that I received, \\"The Four Seasons\\", ISBN 0-7662-0222-4, UPC 0-18713-04117-3 by \\"GoodTimes Home Video\\", is a notably poor transfer. While there is no mention of the recording speed on the jacket, my VCR shows that it is an \\"LP\\" recording. The picture quality reflects this and suggests that the tape may have been simply copied from a \\"standard play\\" VCR tape (at the slower speed as a cost savings measure).

The books are all at least 100 pages too long & always go into detail on piddley stuff but the important things we're left to figure out. Ex.: How long did Garth's relationship with Tildy go on after he met Brynn? What about after he & Brynn were living together? What a jerk! What exactly happened in Boston in June that made Fiona think there was still something going on?What happened with Cassie since that wasn't much more than a footnote?Fiona was a horrid creature who didn't deserve to be a mother.

So that's what Joanna Russ was up against when she tried to break into the field in the 1970s. So, what kind of welcome did she get from the boys? Well, in short order the evil sexist curs of sci-fi community had bestowed upon Joanna Russ its two highest honors, the Nebula Award and the Hugo Award.Understandably outraged at this shabby treatment, Russ poured her anger into this prolonged whine of a book, this manual of grievance, this feminist masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"broken product","review":"I purchased this tote and when I received it in the mail the lid had completely detatched from the rest. and nothing was broken... it was missing part of the hinge that keeps he kid attatched.

The black paint scratched off a bit in assembly, but it's not like anyone's going to look closely at it anyway.

Usually, when someone does a detail like that right (something a Steven Spielberg most assuredly does not; think of Harrison Ford running away from the natives in one of the first scenes in Raiders of the Lost Ark, a film that gets worse with every viewing, and the clouds of dust coming off his jacket ...

I remember that too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"I really didn't enjoy this movie. It definitely wasn't anything special and was rather annoying to watch.

Harrison Ford plays a man who has a great dream of living in the wilderness isolated from civilization, but who is dangerously naive about both nature and human nature, and therefore woefully underprepared to deal with the menaces of both. A true classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who Says Harrison Ford Can't be a Bad Guy ?","review":"This movie is quite often overlooked, but a great film. Ford stars as an inventor who wants to move to the jungle where it is \\"pure\\" and he can build inventions that will make him a god like figure, mainly giving ice to the non-civilized. He does a good job as getting more obsessed throughout the picture, fighting his family's desires to return home \\"America has been destroyed.\\" It's fun how he downplays everything, like when the town he built from scratch and his ice machine are burned to bits, he shrugs,\\"I'm glad\\" while looking at the ashes. All in all, it's refreshing to see Ford as someone other than the hero or the romantic. I definitley recommend this movie. By the way, the DVD doesn't really add any special features, it contains both regular and widescreen versions of the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved Harrison Ford in this one","review":"Some of the comments about the government and the world are down right scary in the truth of them given this day and age.

A gotta have it video for the fans of Ford."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay","review":"There is a lot good in this film, but a lot that's bad. It's clumsily constructed, but it's original, and it's refreshing to see a major star play a jerk. Most stars want to play perfect people. I know someone who read the book, and thought the movie sucked by comparison. I didn't read the book, and thought the movie so-so. Even though there is a lot wrong with the movie, it IS substantive, and there are fewer such movies from major studios with major stars than ever. So, it's rather an oasis in the desert of contemporary cinematic fair. It's not that great an oasis, but considering that all around it is desert, that ups the value of the film quite a bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"The story of a man too smart for everybody&#65533;s good.","review":"Brilliant storytelling (almost fable-like original novel by Paul Theroux) highlights this underrated film of a man's quest for -God only knows.Idealistic inventor Allie Fox (Harrison Ford) packs up the wife and kids, and heads off to the deep part of the Central American jungle, with an ice-making machine, no less.A man of unquenchable thirst, Fox's obsessive, driving quest destroys not only himself and his family, but all that surrounds him as well. There can be no satisfaction in his world, no accomplishment, no salvation.Saul Zaentz (English Patient) produced and Peter Weir (Truman Show) directed, this Paul Schrader script. That's a good enough reason to suggest right here, but Ford is brilliant as he turns from idealistic inventor to self-described deity.Beautiful jungle landscapes only add to the experience.But the moral to the story is?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Great Movie","review":"This movie stars Harrison Ford, so it has to be a good movie, right? Wrong. The plot is very weak. The characters are not very believable or likeable. This one is not on the level as his Indiana Jones movies. We watched this one only once."},{"rating":"2","title":"forgotten ...","review":"This is a movie forgotten somewhere in Ford's and director Weir's filmography. It's a shame, because it is compelling, well written. Ford's character completely looses his mind halfway into the history, putting his own family in danger for the sake of his \\"ideals\\". It's a good movie, based on a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Acting, Lousy Movie","review":"Although some of the acting is excellent, the movie becomes boring about half way into it. I can't tell you it is a lousy story because I'm not sure that is the problem.

I'm surprised that anyone who read the book would think the movie's better. The movie's so unfulfilling because so much of the progression between events is left out. Instead the movie jumps from image to image in many places, as if a 5 second scene here and a 10 second scene there are enough to show how the family adapted to the environment--and, more importantly, adapted the environment to them. Of course, this is an insight that one could not have without reading the book and seeing how much was left out. There is a right way and a wrong way to adapt a book to the silver screen. This was the wrong way. If you insist on watching it, try reading the book first."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie blows","review":"Three of us are contributing to this review. I'm sad to say we paid full price for this movie when it first came out at the theatre. When the movie was over everyone stood up and said, \\"What\\" \\"is that it\\" People shaking their heads and complaining and wanting their money back. Have never seen that happen before. This is by far the worst movie any of us have ever seen. We use this movie as a long running joke, comparing all other bad movies to it and saying, well it wasn't as bad a Mosquito Coast.

Heaven's Gate is number one on my list with no redeeming value as a movie. Mosquito Coast doesn't deserve the same rating because it has elements that make you want the film to be a success. The cast, the storyline, the location, the scenery are all great but the movie is just a flop. How anyone can give this a raving review is beyond me and I am compelled to write this in rebuttal.

By then I really liked Helen Mirren and late River Phoenix as his wife and son.A couple of months ago I got the chance to red Paul Theroux's novel and I was really surprised abouth Fox's character and I realised than Harrison Ford is Allie Fox Himself! An outsatnding direction by one of my favourite directors, great Peter Weir (Gallipolli, The year of Living Dangerously, Witness, Fearless)who is very attracted in developing conflicts between human beings and Mosqito Coast isn't an exception.I highly recommend this DVD (great quality, and really improved from the VHS)"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excitingly \\"different\\" type of movie...","review":"Harrison Ford, Helen Mirren, and River Phoenix star in the unusual story of a man \\"fed-up\\" with how civilization has ruined the humanity of mankind, so he packs up his family and heads to the jungle to start anew.

It only gets one star because the buildings are pretty, and I laud the attempt to make a computer game appealing especially to women. But women who like to play computer games deserve much more than Lotus Spring. The story could have been acceptable -- except we're told in the beginning it ends tragically. So what's the point of solving the truly mindless puzzles and reading bad copy (and worse poetry) in Lotus Spring's Diary that must have been written by a non-native English speaker? There are women gamers out here who enjoy playing intelligent, challenging games that aren't fueled exclusively by testosterone-induced blood lust.

It was gorgeous to look at (and I *do* appreciate the scenery, as I'm very much interested in Chinese culture), but it felt more like one long lesson rather than like a game at all, let alone one of of Myst caliber. In fact I never even finished the game -- just didn't find it challenging enough.I'm not sure what exactly makes this game \\"women-gamer oriented\\" other than it's a love story.

Furthermore, there aren't a lot of instantly accessible phrases that beginners would need to know in order to survive. The progression is too quick and can cause frustration.The thing the book is good at is providing cultural information so that a newcomer gets a sense of the place and the people. The book follows a story of Latvian Australians coming to visit relatives and seeing the sights of Latvia and can, from this perspective, provide insight for those who don't know a lot about Latvia.The problem is that there are precious few materials out there to assist one to learn Latvian.

I bought this drill 6 months ago when my 7 year old Makita 12V died. I loved the power of the new 18V and the 1/2\\" chuck is awesome, but for no reason the chuck stripped out on me last week while drilling with a 1\\" spade bit. I'm basically just a Harry Homeowner user, so it definitly didn't get abused. So, I'm not going with Dewalt again for my next drill. I just bought a Milwaukie 14.4V 1/2\\" chuck with hammer feature. Milwaukie looks to be a winner so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ha! A $200 joke... And its not funny either.","review":"Ha! A $200 joke... And its not funny either.That about sums this drill up.

The Chinese factories that make Dewalt are making Black and Decker side by side. Now that Dewalt has moved into big box retailers, they are focused on hitting the price points Big Box wants. Another annoying feature of Dewalt is that it does not provide torque ratings for its drills so that you can compare them to other brands. You cannot compare a particular model Dewalt against Milwaukee, Makita, Hitachi, etc. until you actually use it. Fortunately, most retailers give you 30 days for evaluation. BTW, the DC759KA is the little brother to the more powerful DC720KA. As Dewalt finally follows the industry into Lithium Ion batteries, expect prices to drop for this older NiCD technology."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced parts needed for repair.","review":"They are no longer worth the money. Quality has gone down and parts prices have gone up. I have several of these, and every time one fails, it costs an arm and a leg to buy a new part. I have finally given up on DeWalt and just cannibalize another drill to get a part without going broke. DeWalt is useless in helping me with repair advice, and small parts are not available to the consumer. All they say is \\"Take it to our repair service.\\"Their battery packs are horribly expensive, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift for the husband.","review":"I got the drill for my husband for Christmas and he says he loves it.

From Harbor Freight $5 specials to $2000 cabinet table saws, but I have never had a tool under perform like this DeWalt drill. Shortly after purchasing the drill I used it for a minute or two drilling some holes in some wood. I put it up and pulled it off the shelf today to drill some holes with a forstner bit into maple. I drilled two holes and the drill broke. The clutch broke inside the drill and it is totally incapcitated.Now I would expect this from my $40 Hitachi special, or maybe a K-Mart special $9.99 drill, but from a $200 DeWalt 18 volt?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap!

Will update if any issues under heavy use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dewalt vindicated!","review":"I have read the reviews on this drill and, now that I use one myself, I am ready to give my opinion. Many wrote that the chuck wobbled and I hesitated to buy it for this reason. I use this drill constantly in a retail store and have had \\"zero\\" problems with the chuck in that area. It runs true to center and stays tight. The chuck works strange in that it tightens well only when the trigger is not engaged at all. The brake holds the chuck at rest and, only then, will allow the bit or driver to grip snugly. Works well! Although Dewalt may have fixed the issue because most of the negative reviews are two to five years old. The batteries hold a charge well also. I have only charged them once in about two months time using the drill for about ten minutes or so at a time. This is a company drill and now I am going to get another one for my home use. Great product and I hope this review helps any of you out there who are undecided to make a wise choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice drill except for the useless chuck!","review":"If you need this drill for anything other than drilling wood or driving fasteners buy a chuck too. I am an industrial mechanic/machinist and have been for over 30 years. I do most of my work with metal. I do a lot of drilling and tapping at the machine which means I need good tools. The company I work for bought 2 of these about 4 months ago and for what i need them to do they just SUCK! The chuck can't hold on to a drill bit trying to drill metal period, never mind a tap! I have been after my supervisor to get replacement Jacobs chucks for these to months now. He like me are sold on Dewalt tools, but he has a hard time believing that these chucks suck this bad. He no longer is doing the work, so I don't blame him. Dewalt should be asshamed of themselves for putting such a piece of junk on the end of such a good tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expect nothing else from dewalt","review":"I am a smaller female and had been planning on buying the 12V because it was lighter, BUT...I bought this as the 'Deal of the Day' which made it cheaper than the 12V.

I purchased my drill at Home Depot and the first thing I noticed was excessive chuck runout. I exchanged it today for another and the newer drill has less runout but its still there. I guess that's what 99 dollars buys. As soon as the new rigid tools arrive I am making a purchase.

I've also nailed some ceiling joist when the wood was too old/hard to nail by hand ... no problems. I have not tried 3 1/2\\" nails yet but from the performance I've experienced so far, I don't expect those to be a problem. The nailer has double fired on a couple of occasions but I was in tight situations where my arm movement was restricted and I'm sure that was the cause.

Although I have used Senco nail guns for more than 20 years, my new nail gun will not be a Senco. The owner's manual is generic, covering a wide range of Senco models but not this particular model. When it jammed (and it does jam), I had to phone Senco to find out how to free the jam. Although the older Senco nail guns had an easy system for freeing a jam, this one does not. You have to take the lower part of the gun apart. I cannot get the depth adjustment to work consistently.

Those of us who thought that a judge's job was to be a neutral arbiter might be taken aback, but the author prides herself on being biased.It's not clear whether the book is intended as a launch for a future political run, or as a \\"look at me\\" pitch to a T.V. network.

The fact is, fat people are generally not healthy, or considered attractive. Fat discrimination is rampant, and isn't going to go away. I've spent most of my life morbidly overweight, and I finally just got sick of it - not being able to walk up stairs without breathing heavy, wearing hideous clothing, being every guy's \\"friend\\" and nobody's girlfriend. I'm in the process of losing weight, and I feel better - mentally and physically - than I have in years. You want real inspiration?

She makes the vital point that overeating and having a large size are not necessarily a cause and effect. I am a cookbook author and a proponent of Ayurveda, the most ancient health care system in the world, which states that people come in many different natural sizes. Trying to conform to one body type is both unnatural and harmful to longevity. Fearing the very substance that nourishes and sustains us is damaging.

Reality is just one look away from the mirror. To look at obese naked body is repulsive and it should be. She would accuse me of being prejudiced towards fat people which I am not.

Marilyn is very articulate and offers a great deal of factual material, and she is constantly reminding us to love ourselves and make the most of our lives.I am also a psychotherapist, and I recommend this book to my clients, fat or thin, as a way to start the dialog about body image. No one in this culture escapes the demoralizing messages that only the very thin people have the right kind of bodies, or that near anorexia is equivalent to \\"health.\\"Marilyn promotes Health at Every Size, which makes so much more sense.

For so long I was feeling horrible and guilty because I had gained weight after having kids and was no longer the thin woman I once was. After reading this book, I have found that I have a more positive outlook on myself and a better body image. I will no longer feel bad about how I look.

Part of accepting ANY body type is to dress appropriately for it.The author shows that there is not conclusive evidence that obesity is a death sentence. And I thank her for that. But to encourage people to have a physical and refuse to be weighed is ridiculous. A doctor is not weighing you to degrade you. He's weighing you for a number of relevant medical reasons.If you have a doctor who is pressuring you about your weight and you're uncomfortable with it, by all means find a new one.

Bank-buster McQueen is mortgaged out of prison by his wife's infidelity with a parole board member, who also demands another robbery to clear the debt. The performance that stands out is that of Al Lettieri, McQueen's associate turned enemy. He really shines in a supporting role as a determined sociopath."},{"rating":"1","title":"Japanese menus on Blu-Ray disc? USA cover","review":"The case is printed in English but the disc is in Japanese. Warner Brothers placed the Japanese BD in a English case. The case says the audio and subtitles are in English, French, and Spanish. The BD disc has only Japanese and English with the menu in Japanese. The subtitles are also only in Japanese and English. Can't even read the main menu for play, subtitles, or audio. This was purchased from Amazon in Dec 2012 and not imported by a 3rd party retailer. Looks like a Warner Brothers mistake. Amazon says they need three people to complain before they will look into the problem. I see one comment saying they got a Chinese disc in an English case. Since it was also in Dec of 2012 it might have been Japanese also. Anyone that speeks Japanese or can read the menus might consider buying the BD now before the problem is resolved. If you speek Spanish or French avoid buying the BD at this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"STEVE McQUEEN ALL THE WAY, BABY!!!","review":"This would be a 5 star movie, but Ali MacGraw, despite being gorgeous, CANNOT ACT! I liked her in LOVE STORY, where her acting was almost decent, but she sucked in THE GETAWAY. After watching this movie several dozen times, her performance always sours it for me. The rest of the movie is great though. MacGraw just looks lost, even intimidated by McQueen. He carries this movie, helped by great performances by Al Lettieri, Sally Struthers (she was thin once!!!), and the one of kind Slim Pickens. This isn't a masterpiece, but it's heavy on vibe and the screen presence of McQueen. He really was a better actor than Eastwood and Bronson. I recently saw PAPILLON, and was blown away by McQueen's performance. Dam, he was even better than I thought, not to mention underrated. The movie was so-so, but his, along with Dustin Hoffman's, performance was Oscar-worthy. Anyway, THE GETAWAY is worth owning, even if you only watch once a year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazon is Awesome","review":"I have ordered two different times from Amazon,I am very satisfied with the order and the product from start to finish!

Thank You Amazon"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"The Getaway\\" hasn't aged well...","review":"Being a big fan of both Steve McQueen and Ali MacGraw, I recently got the DVD of \\"The Getaway.\\" I was largely disappointed in the film -- it looks and feels very dated. Visually, I suppose it was meant to seem innovative at the time, but it looks like a lot of the bad movie-making of the early '70s now. And the soundtrack by Quincy Jones is remarkably amateurish-sounding.My biggest complaint, however, is with the pacing of the film. The action sequences are top-notch, but when it slows down, it gets REALLY slow. It shifts gears this way several times, going from edge-of-your-seat excitement to falling-asleep boredom.This film had potential that it failed to live up to, and although the actors in it are superb, they are not directed well. Check out \\"The Thomas Crown Affair\\" or \\"The Great Escape\\" for far better McQueen."},{"rating":"1","title":"The remake is much better","review":"Steve McQueen and Ali MacGraw play lovers on the lam; she helped to bust him out of prison, but they owe a local crime lord one last heist. Sam Peckinpah is a very good action director, and those sequences do work, as do the scenes that open the film: McQueen is prison, thinking about the things dearest to him (including MacGraw). The story, though, plods along, until the climatic shootouts. I saw the 1994 remake directed by Roger Donaldson and starring Alec Baldwin, Kim Basinger, and James Woods, and I thought that it was much more stylish, sensual, and was better acted. Check that one out instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great personal drama","review":"This action/chase film is the original \\"Getaway\\".

I have studied the war and this is as real as it gets. Yes, hits and misses are controlled by random dice rolls, but different units have different values. Here is an example- attacking infantry score at hit on a roll of 1, but if they are defending they would have an advantage, so the defend at 2. The economys are accurate, the unit count is accurate, and the map is on the dot. This game doesn't sacrifice fun for accuracy either.

I mainly loved the game because it has to do with World War 2, and I love studying about that time period. I also loved it because I am into a lot of strategic games such as risk. The pieces in the game are very durable. The pieces in the game may be small, but it is better that they are small (if you purchase the game and start playing it, you will see why it is better that the playing pieces are small).

(Fifty bucks can be spent on much better things). This is an amazingly complex game, perhaps one of the best board games ever made to date. It has nearly endless possibilities, since the players can make up different options for the rules all they want, as long as they keep the gameplay fair. So why did I give the 3 stars to educational value and durablity? Because that is the truth: both factors are nothing significant. I didn't learn anything new from the game, and it's not too durable either, not that it needs to be.The fact is, the game is amazing, and is up there in the ranks with Clue and. . . Clue's ilk.

It was fun game that acurrately depicted the strategic conditions of the major powers in 1942. However, after repeated play, anyone can see that the game is Russia/Germany (not unlike the real war itself.) If the Russian player is wise he will throw everything he has into Karelia at the begining of the game. The German player will have no choice but to attack with the odds against them. Whoever wins this battle (almost always it's Russia) will win the game. Xeno games has made some very similar games to Axis & Allies.

The game in itself sounds cool, believing it to be a World War 2 version of Risk. But I was wrong. The game is much more involved and much more tedious than Risk ever was. I was none to pleased with it, possibly due to the fact that I received the game on Sept. 11 and had enough of real life War and did not feel like fantasizing about it.

MADE ME EMBARRASSED TO BE A U2 FAN.","review":"This book is absolute trash! It will make you embarrassed to be a U2 fan. The author, apparently dealing with a midlife crisis by stalking the band, can't write. On most pages, her insights are obsessive and often insipid. She whines, she laments, she fawns over Bono, she invites us into her ho-hum life without a flame or even a spark of creativity. The pages, filled with diary entries dating bak to The Joshua Tree tour, are a drawn out stream of babble that had me skimming after the first chapter. How did this thing get published?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Where to begin? Well, in short, the author seems a bit out of touch with reality & I honestly have a really hard time believing many of her stories. The silliest one being that she & her groupie friends had given some flowers to one of the band's road crew to pass along. A month or so later, her friend just happens to run into Bono & asks if he got them. \\"Those were from you\\"? he says. With all the things bands go through on the road, city after city turning into a blur, not to mention the loads of flowers they receive, this little tale just doesn't seem likely.The reports of the band's wardrobe for each show get old *very* quickly, as did what the author and her friends ate for dinner each night and where they ate it! She mentions over and over again that her favorite song is \\"Bad\\" and each performance the Edge gives is \\"the best one she's ever seen!\\"Sorry, but this book really isn't worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book could have been so much more.","review":"I purchased this book with high hopes that it would provide some insight into why someone would follow a band through many years and tours and what impact it would have on that person's personal life. Obviously the music and persona of U2 has had that impact upon Ms. Ebertt Beeaff's life, but this book is a curious recitation of endless versions of the same thing. \\"I went. I saw this set and they sang this.\\" There must have been different responses to the concerts in different countries and cities, but there is no hint of that in this book. This book is curiously flat in affect and just drones on. The spirit that drives one to love U2 enough to commit to a major disruption in the author's adult life is never answered or explained. It was very disappointing. There were some enticing tidbits of encounters with the bandmembers, but they are few and far between. I finished the book, curiously dissatisfied. Still wondering. . .why?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Roll on the next tour!","review":"Now that U2 are releasing more material , all i can say is roll on the next tour. Having read 'A Grand Madness' just makes me want to get out there and share in some of the experiences that the author has! The wonderful highs by far outweigh the lows of the delayed travel, getting soaked, hanging around. The book lets you know what life is like on the road and lets you know as a fan its all worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GRAND MADNESS INDEED-- MAYBE A GRAND ADDICTION","review":"I FOUND THIS BOOK TO REVEAL A VERY CANDID INSIGHT INTO LIFE ON THE ROAD WITH THE \\"BEST BAND IN THE WORLD\\".

I don't have the same analytical skill, but what I do know is that this book made me embarrassed to be a \\"die-hard U2 fan\\" and it gives the rest of the world a silly view of how rediculous a U2 fan can be. Is this woman really a fan? Or does she simply have a school girl infatuation with Bono? There's no depth, no heart, not even a glimpse of how the greatest band on Earth relates to the world around her. It's all about her. Just her and her stalking sessions of U2 band members. Get a life, lady. It's cool that a fan can write a book about U2 and get it published, but at least write a good one for pete's sake. This book doesn't do U2 justice and it doesn't do the real fans any justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diary of a mad woman!","review":"Your money can be spent better on more insightful U2 books. In this book the author does an excellent job of keeping detailed records of her journeys and the little \\"run-in's\\" with the band.(Or as I like to call them \\"stalking sessions\\") She also does an excellent job of boring me. This book for me was the equivilant of sitting at my cousin's house watching an 6-hour slide show of his vacation to Delaware. I love U2 as much as the next fan but she goes a little overboard in the way she speaks of Bono. I don't care what Bono was wearing on March 9, 1992! Or what HER interpation of the music is. How about telling me what Bono thinks about his music, life, sports, religion etc..... Oh she can not do this because she is a physco fan. It almost makes me embarrased to call myself a die hard U2 fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"skip this one","review":"This book is not very good.

It is a wonderful compendium for both Canal Fans and local historians alike. Although I had read several books on the canal previously, it was nice to find out in Bob's work that the ruins of a stone building that I pass on Route 80 everyday are all that's left of the brakeman's house and inclined plane east of Waterloo. A wonderful volume with Arcadia's typical high quality production. A MUST for North Jersey historians."},{"rating":"2","title":"Knowledgeable author makes all the difference","review":"Arcadia Publishing deserves credit for making local histories available, but many of their books are nothing more than a collection of photos accompanied by short, sometimes repetitive, and often useless captions. This book is written by an author well schooled in his subject and it shows in a two-page Introduction (apparently Arcadia does allow text!) and in the informative and intelligent captions to the photos that are arranged in geographical order. There's even a small but readable map. This book is an informative look at the Morris Canal that will give you a good overview of where it went, how it worked (the planes that lifted the boats are nicely described and illustrated)and how it looked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Derivitive","review":"This book is an interesting look at the Morris Canal, but it's style and layout owe a lot to James Lee's previous (and superior) illustrated histories of the Morris Canal.

This game is the perfect compromise between risk and chess. I could play it for hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoddiest manufacturing I've ever seen","review":"Don't even try to punch out the pieces of this game by hand -- use a sharp knife. Otherwise, they WILL get bent and broken. It's impossible to believe that they could be manufactured by the same company (Hasbro, which owns Parker Brothers, Milton Bradley and now Avalon Hill) that made the sturdy, HARD plastic pieces of Fortress America. Also, the pieces don't fit particularly well in the bases.The wave of board games imported from Europe in the past several years shows consistent attention to high quality of component manufacture and design. Hello! America is supposed to be the world leader in manufacturing ingenuity! Why are we making junk like the pieces in Lionheart?As for game play, it's like a cross of chess, Stratego and miniatures battles. Thing is, chess is better, Stratego is better and miniatures games are better. Really, Lionheart has nothing to recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo!","review":"I love it and I am 41. My son love's it and he is 8. Just the right combination of skill and luck teaches him how to manage logic and risk in a competitive environment. Pretty good lessons for him (and mental exercise for me). Plays in just the right amount of time. The other beauty to this game is its versatility. You can alter the two forces structures and position to keep things fresh. This game is a brilliant design and it will keep you and your kids playing each other rather a computer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced at any price","review":"One of the lamest, shoddiest \\"strategy\\" board games. Apparently inspired by historical miniature combat rules, because of its crowded, gridlocked board, this piece of junk ends up being nothing more than Stratego with dice. The pieces are of such soft, low-quality plastic that it'll be a miracle if you can cut them out of the sprues without breaking at least two (and you will have to cut them out, with a knife -- try to do it by hand and you'll trash many more than two).Oddly enough, there's a game available from Rio Grande Games called L?wenherz, which MEANS \\"Lionheart,\\" that's really, really good."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Sophisticated Britney","review":"A very good pop album with dance tinged songs and a few ballads thrown in. In a world of Britney and Christina, this is a more sophisticated take on the pop music scene. It handles a broader range of topics i.e. first single \\"Two Faced\\" which deals with back stabbers. She is huge in England and has yet to get Air Play in North America. I don't know why as she is a cut above the competition. Overall, a thoroughly enjoyable CD. Her other CD's, available only as imports are worth checking out as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Merchant Marine Day 22 May","review":"Along with Great Ships Passing,(nf) what wonderful books for your mariner.

This is also not a book necessarily intended to be read cover to cover either; towards the middle of the book specific applications of Hibernate are addressed, such as Spring integration, which may not be applicable to everyone.This book was very valuable to me. If you're joining a project where you need to learn Hiberate quickly -- like I was, or if you just want to get your hands dirty as soon as possible, this is the book for you.

Finally, at this price I had purchased two very nice large (11x14) wood frames which used clips to hold the backing in and supported wall hanging both in portrait and landscape orientations. I should have spent more time researching before purchasing this a frame ... which is what I recommend you do and to buy something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cannabilism","review":"What is up with all of these cannibalism cases going on seriously I may have to start studying up on the history of it, seriously??

I was in high school myself in the 70s, and it's amazing how close to home it hits. Most of the actors even look like kids I new back in high school. The teachers have that same sleepy and resigned look I remember from the last day of school before summer. Strictly speaking, not a particularly remarkable story from a plot point of view, but a must see for anyone who was coming of age back in those days. And one of the best sound tracks I can remember, clearly showing there was more to mid-70s music than Helen Reddy and disco. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Flashcrap Edition","review":"The 4 stars are for the movie.

Linklater has said he is working on HIS OWN special edition with Criterion, which will include loads of cool stuff (much like Criterion have recently done with Linklater's Slacker).

This movie shows a perspective for life from the point of view of a group of junkies teens, has an xcellent script that will make you crack up from the beginning to the end.

It perfectly captures high school in the 1970s - if you were in school then, you'll recognize everyone in this film as someone in your class. Every detail is perfect - the clothes, haircuts, parties, parents, attitudes, cars, everything. And unlike many teen movies, it doesn't pretend to be heavy or deep - its just and all out good time. I could not stop laughing, watching it, and the soundtrack is awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"The director certainly captured the look and sounds of suburbia circa 1976 with the soundtrack and wardrobe. I'll give him credit there. However, the one thing this movie really needed was a good story with characterization. It just never took off. We follow several groups of teenagers on their last day of school as they roam aimlessly around town getting high and acting like idiots. You never really get a chance to learn more about these kids so you can at least like them. Instead, we are presented with several unmemorable \\"main\\" characters who never quite get developed. Was it the disgruntled high school quarterback or the freshman Mitch? This movie has a hard time deciding. If you want a good 70's nostalgia movie I'd recommend \\"Detroit Rock City\\" or even \\"Over the Edge\\" which was actually filmed in 1979! Both of these movies have interesting stories and characters set against the backdrop of the late 70's. Both are worth purchasing. Dazed and Confused, on the other hand, is just a renter."},{"rating":"1","title":"An overrated movie","review":"Most of the reviews here rate this movie with five stars. It must be the same person reviewing this film because this movie is REALLY bad. First off, there is absolutely NO PLOT whatsoever. Ditto. The characters roam aimlessly around a small Texas town getting stoned and acting like complete fools. Where is the redeeming value here? What lesson are the characters taught? The second problem I had with this movie is its lack of a central character. Instead, we are introduced to several SHALLOW teenagers who never seem to get developed to a point where they become likeable. At one point, I thought the story was about a disillusioned high school football quarterback. But half way through the movie he disappears and we then follow some freshman kid attending his first beer party. Okay. Yeah. The characters are as disjointed as the story. For a good 1970's era coming of age movie I would recommend either 'Detroit Rock City' or 'Over the Edge' which was actually filmed in the late 70's."},{"rating":"1","title":"YAWN !!","review":"This is a very boring movie. I kept waiting for something to happen but nothing did. The only time I thought \\"aha!\\" was when the credits finally rolled at the end. A bunch of high-school kids are hanging out doing drugs, supposedly as cool rebels against conformity (many have perfectly blow-dried hair and drive their own cars nonetheless). They get in trouble with the usual people: parents, the coach, cops (yawn). You'd expect it to build up to something remotely dramatic, I don't know, a romance, a crime, an accident, a broken heart, a sports event, SOMETHING!! but no, it just ends. In fact it could have ended an hour earlier and left you with the same feeling that watching C-Span would have been more interesting. Breakfast Club was much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just drags on and on","review":"If I could give this movie a quarter or even a minus star, I would. This movie just dragged on and on with seemingly no end in sight. I could feel my brain atrophy watching this movie. This definitely was not like the 1976 I lived in, so I do not know how some people can say that this was the quintessential coming of age movie. We did not go hunting down Sophomores just to 'whack' them or 'air raid' them. Fast Times at Ridgemont High was a much better movie. So, if you are in the mood for a mind-numbing, clock watching movie, enjoy. There is not really anymore that I can say about this movie, except...Boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I was on a different planet","review":"Having graduated from high school in 1975, I was somewhat intereted in seeing this movie. I generally don't watch R rated movies, but at the insistance of one of my kids, I watched it. The sets were authentic, as were the costumes, makeup and music. But the 'everybody's drunk or high' atmoshpere? I just didn't see it when I was going through high school. In the end I saw it as nothing more than my kid's attempt to get me to condone or lighten up on his lifestyle."},{"rating":"1","title":"This film was awesome!","review":"This movie should go down as one of the most enjoyable and wonderful pieces of cinematography in history.

But DAZED AND CONFUSED (no Led Zep anywhere!) just rambles without end, a near-complete bore. The subplot involving the bully who hazes unsuspecting freshmen is funny but smacks of Hollywood more than anything else.It is possible to make a film showing bored and shiftless people marking time. It's difficult, but it can be done (I recommend L'AVVENTURA). DAZED AND CONFUSED has no organic tension, none of the characters possesses the individuality necessary to make us care for him/her, and the story itself leaves us no more enlightened than we were before.Bubba"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible.","review":"A terrible film.

While I was one of those kids who was stoned every single day of high school, I realize that most were not. The kegger scene was perfect, the shot of the 13yo purchasing booze at the liquor store was sadly right on, and depictions of the 30something drop-out hangers-on rang true. However, we did not gamble in the hallways, big stripped bell bottoms were long gone by then, and no one, absolutely no one, listened to Smoke on the Water in 1976!

While the movie is occasionally entertaining, the mediocre story, generic characters, and moronic behaviors takes away from the overall cinematic experience. I feel that there are better teen comedies about the 70s out there, such as Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Probably the best aspect of this movie is the soundtrack, but it is NO where near a classic movie that people claim it is. If you are curious about this one, I'd recommend you rent it before wasting your money on the dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"I AM DAZED AND CONFUSED","review":"Dazed and Confused is unique because it acurately depicts a time in history.

The poor freshman runnig from the seniors that have pattels and are a holes! Great fun. So then we get some drug use, drinking, sex, rock and roll and flo0wer power. I love those 70's. By the way Parker Posey is in this movie playing a bitchy senior (love it) and makes them go through the car wash out side the car.... So this movie hasa killer oundtrack and I say BUY!Jared"},{"rating":"2","title":"DAZED AND CONFUSED","review":"This movie is my all time favorite! I can not even recall how many times I have watched it during high school. My friends and I would go over to my house after school plop in front of the tv crack open a beer and watch the movie relating with it as much as possible. I love all the different groups that are present in the movie. I think in all high schools these groups are represented. At least in my high school we had the stoners, the jocks, the geeks, and the \\"in crowd\\". The soundtrack is killer also featuring artists such as Black Sabbath, Aerosmith, Deep Purple, and Nazareth. For me this movie really had a deep meaning of what I remember in high school now that I am out. I feel like Matthew Mcconaughey's character, David Wooderson, being the senior that graduated and does not want to leave his memories behind."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY ANOTHER MOVIE ABOUT THE 70S???","review":"I really get a kick out of most of these reviewers. They give this tripe 5 stars and say how much Dazed and Confused is a \\"realistic account\\" of the 70's. Then they state that they are still in high school.Dazed and Confused is NOT a realistic account of the 70s. The characters do not act or even look like anybody out of the 70s. They look like a bunch of mall-rats from the 90s. This movie is an insult to anyone who grew up in the 70s (like I did) Listen up kids- The 70s were not all that great. Find your own identity instead of conforming to what Hollywood says is cool. We were not all stoners that drove really hot cars as this movie would like you to believe."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was to mellow","review":"This movie was just too mellow and way to slow and worst of all Dazed and Confused was missing the most important thing a good story plot. The film just centers around a bunch of annoying teenagers in Austin Texas in 1976 partying and getting high and a couple of wierd guys trying to hit freshman in the behind with wooden padles. Then some freshman kid with really greasy hair goes to his first beer drinking party and then just everyone else acting cool and mellow and just too chilled you do not get the exciting plot it just never gets there. The clothes and cars were cool they had that stuff down but the story stunk."},{"rating":"1","title":"forgetable story, mediocre picture quality","review":"I'd forgotten I had already seen this movie and it wasn't any more memorable the second time around. This is the typical teen coming of age movie with a bland cast and boring story. If I had remembered seeing it, not even the HD DVD release would have made me want to watch it again. The picture quality is only ok, probably among the worst for HD DVD. No even a rental to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Nostalgia Flick for Braws.","review":"After hearing so many good things about this film, I was surprised by how god awful it was. What I find even more surprising is how many people don't mind admitting their favorite movie is about sex crazed high school jocks who ride around town searching for young, adolescent boys so they can give them a good homoerotic spanking. If you spent your high school career as a football star nursing a secret crush on a 13 year old pre-pubescent boy, you'll want to pick up this nostalgic gem immediately. It'll remind you of the good old days."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated","review":"I hated this movie. It had no storyline or plot whatsoever. I don't mean its plot was thin or needed work; it didn't even try to have a plot in the first place. All that happens is these kids hang around, get stoned, and do nothing all day. That's basically the whole movie. I found it to be just a bunch of nihilistic trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait, wait, wait.

It's one of my all-time favorites. But this DVD is the worst \\"special edition\\" ever made. The only worthwhile extras are the deleted scenes and production notes. I wouldn't consider commercials from the 70s that have nothing to do with the movie special features. They also got rid of the trailer and cast/crew bios that were on the first release, which is inexcusable. Universal went through the trouble of finding the deleted scenes and cleaning up the picture, so why couldn't they get Richard Linklater to do a commentary track or get any sort of featurette that has something to do with the movie? Simply put, because they're the worst of all the studios when it comes to making quality DVDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool movie. I just have one question:","review":"If Slater and Jeff Spicoli were in a fight, who do you think would win? Seriously though, I love both movies and I think Dazed is one of the few worthy successors to Fast Times, the definitive high school movie. John Hughes was cool, but he was nowhere near as good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dazed...","review":"Dazed and Confused Milla Jovovich fans be warned, she is listed in the credits, but only has about 2 lines of dialog and 37 seconds of screen time in the whole movie. I think her biggest line was \\"Yes.\\" Her longest scene was about 10 seconds of looking at a lighter."},{"rating":"2","title":"DazEd is GrOOvy","review":"A perfect flick to watch before a full night of partying. Dazed and Confused reminds us that life is pretty simple when you break it down, just have fun and live it up. Although there isn't much of a plot that develops, this film's still great cause of the soundtrack and non-predictable humor that percolates in situations. Think of it as a Porky's, but add 2 stars to the rating and some quality reefer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old School","review":"It's all about the old school dayz!

All of them have a little tiny bit of an interesting extra feature but none of them have enough to justify the extra money charged. This is a blatant attempt to get the consumer to pay a lot of money for very little reason. This DVD has almost nothing to make it worth the extra $15 you have to pay. There are some mildly amusing moments in the extra features but nothing of substance. Stick with your old copy or buy it cheaper if you really must have it.(get off of soapbox, pick it up, put it away)Dazed and Confused is a hilarious movie and worth watching every time.

And the actors actors are cool, and everybody is really really funny!!!! I will definatley be watching this movie more and more and more!! And I suggest this movie to anybody and everybody!!!

Solow speaks about the old neoclassical growth theory in the first half of the book and then goes on in the second half to review the developments of new growth theory that started in the mid eighties. He comments on the essence of Lucas' work (on human capital), Romer's work (on endogenous technical change), the work of Grossman and Helpman (on quality ladders) and that of Aghion and Howitt (on creative destruction). These references have now reached the status of classics in endogenous growth theory. Solow provides penetrating insights into the new developments. The book is a must for any student of the subject interested in traversing the bridge that connects the old to the new growth theory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Solow is out of time","review":"In his book Solow describes his growth-theory. But this theory already is out of time. It does not apply to many countries. Why not you might ask. Well first, Solow leaves a very important variable out, namely human capital. Second, Solow makes assumptions, which obviously will never hold, like an equal productionfunction for every country but also equal technological availability for each country. I do not have to explain why this will not hold for it speaks for itself. Many third-world countries have based their policies on Solow's growth-theory in the sixties, seventies and eigthies, but without any succes. It is time for these countries to change policies and to discover other growth and development strategies to catch-up with developed countries, specially with ecommerce comming up."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD BOOK!","review":"THIS BOOKS WAS HILARIOUS AND WHAT I LIKED BEST WAS THAT GAME THEY PLAYED AT CAMP WHERE THEY HAD THE EGG- BABIES AND HAD TO ACT LIKE RESPONSIBLE PARENTS.

Most of Hollywood has forgotten that a good film score is important so it's always a rare pleasure to see a quality film composer still working. I didn't care too much for the film, but the music I really enjoyed. It's a very sad, dreamy score. I've been listening to it recently and it really takes your mind off things.

This should have been a classic album - and would have benefitted from full orchestrations - instead we get a synthesizer, which gives a very bad sound and ruins the whole thing.If I had to highlight any of the tracks they would be Thunderball, Live and let die and perhaps Moonraker - even though these are mediocre at best.We are all crying out for this album to be remade properly with Propellerheads or David Arnold - this version is sadly for die-hard Bassey fans only I'm sorry to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bassey (should) Sing Bond","review":"I wanted to type \\"Bassey (could) Sing Bond\\", but she still can. Her singing is fine. As in a previous review, I too was very disapointed with the arrangements of the songs, and of course the lack of an orchestra. It's almost as if she was recording a 'demo' to be re-recorded later using a real orchestra (and better arrangements). I hope some day this happens. I waited over a year for a copy of this CD to become available (and paid quite a high price) -- but that's because Ms. Bassey was my favorite theme song vocalist for the Bond films and I'm a big fan of both."},{"rating":"2","title":"Egypt History","review":"This is a typical well done Discovery Channel presentation.

His grasp of the subject is outstanding.Claude"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ancient Egypt Keeping its Firm Grip on Human Imagination","review":"\\"Ancient Egypt Unearthed\\" by the Discovery Channel will appeal the most to viewers who have already had the opportunity to view other well-made productions about Ancient Egypt. Think for example about \\"Egypt Beyond the Pyramids\\" and \\"Engineering an Empire\\" by The History Channel and \\"Secrets of Archaeology\\" by Koch Vision. Most episodes shed a penetrating light on less well-known aspects of this prestigious civilization. Episodes such as \\"Secrets of Egypt's Lost Queen,\\" \\"Women Pharaohs,\\" and \\"Why Ancient Egypt Fell\\" come to mind. In summary, the DVD set under review reveals once more, how much is still unknown, about a civilization that was a lightening tower for over three millennia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Discovery channel masterpiece","review":"Produced by Discovery channel, it is over 8 1/2 hours of a mind-blowing documentary on the pharoahs of Egypt. You are shown the discoveries of the Kings and Queens and the painstaking trouble they take to identify the mummies. They show the out-of-the-way inscriptions that spell out a detailed look at everyday life, as well as the secret personal lives of these pharoahs. From the Egyptian museum, and the Giza pyramids, to Luxor and the Valley of the Kings, and on to the Aswan quarries, they cover everything in exquisite detail, and with the best professionals in their fields to support their findings.

Very disappointed and would not recommend to anyone else to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"looks NOTHING like the picture","review":"It IS fuzzy on top, with a layer of feathers beneath, but does NOT have the heart shape at the top to make it look like 2 separate wings. It's just straight across the top. It doesn't look like wings!The straps, as everyone says, are way too big, and feel like stretched out elastic, but I knew that. No problem, except that they are attached at the TOP of the wings, which makes the wings hang halfway down the back, and reminds me of those cardboard sandwiches people wear on the streets of NYC for advertising purposes. The fact that these are not wing-shaped at the top just adds to that effect.I do have to say, I have not seen any feathers fall out yet, so 2 stars for that. She's 13, 5', about 97lbs, and they just about fit her.

If you have found scripture sometimes difficult to make sense of, then read this book. It begins when the author is asked by his wife \\"Do you really love me?\\", echoing the question Jesus asked of Peter. If you want to be more like Jesus or find yourself praying that He will show you how, then read this book. Paul Miller gives examples from his daily life to which we all can relate. Jesus came to teach us how to give and receive love and this author has made scripture come to life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written","review":"This book is easy to read and very thought provoking. Shows how we can be more like Jesus everyday in our lives and in different situations."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read","review":"This is an incredible book that not only reaches to the depths of the heart by capturing the amazing, incomprehensible love of Jesus, but at the same time convicts us of how short we fall in loving others. This is one of the most impactful books I've read about the reality of Jesus' love for us and how that can be applied as we desire to love others. Paul Miller's transparency and real life examples result in an ease of reading many books lack. This is a must read! Expect to be transformed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Learning How to Love","review":"The Gospels tell us that when Jesus saw the crowds he had compassion on them. He touched lepers. He spoke to women. He had dinner with outcasts. He forgave his enemies. He died for them too. Paul Miller's book provides a stirring study of how Jesus loved people. This book will help those who seek practical help in learning how to love fellow sinners in the likeness of the one \\"who loved us and gave himself for us\\" (Galatians 2:20)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved Walked Among Us","review":"I am using this book in my prayer group and finding it helpful.

The book seeks to examine root causes of the attack and to broaden the debate around where to go from here. Good mix of moving and heartfelt material, as well as critical analysis.Lots of input around responses and solutions from key figures ranging from Angela Davis, Deepak Chopra, Arundahti Roy, Edward Said, as well as firefighters and folks who lost loved ones.After reading this, I felt like I understood more fully the complexities of the situation we face.

Haitink and the London Philharmonic present a digital era 8th which can stand shoulder to shoulder with Slatkins on RCA or maybe Davis on Teldec, but the chestnut on this disk is the 9th. In the ninth Vaughn Williams used the addition of three saxophones and a flugelhorn which were not allowed to \\"indulge in the bad habit of vibrato and were obliged to sit up and play straight.

I loved it so much with my first pregnancy that I bought another one for my second. I will keep them forever and give them to the kids when they are older. Most of the pages I just filled in with info on what was going on that week, instead of using all of the questions it asked. The folders inside for each trimester are a great place to keep ultrasound photos!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Its ok","review":"I got this journal when I was expecting. I wanted a place to record all of my thoughts, and feelings and cravings during pregnancy. I wasn't all that happy with the layout of the book. I was hoping that after each week there would be a place for journaling but there are only notes for doctor visits or if you take a birthing class, which I didn't. I was also hoping there would be more places for ultrasound photos but I just ended putting most of mine in the pockets that the book provided since there were only about 2 spaces for ultrasounds and I have a few more than that.It was an ok book. I was able to record cravings and some thoughts but I wish the layout was a little better. I am thankful that I blogged during my pregnancy so I will probably just print out my blogs and scrapbook them eventually, when I have time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not the Best","review":"The best thing about the journal is it has a room to put stuff in it and it has a strap to keep it closed. I bought it for my first pregnancy and wrote everything it it. It didnt' have too much room for photos so I ended up putting photos over pages that had their pictures and quotes on it. Additionally there were some weeks that when it asked you to write about soemthing it didn't apply. Every week it has cravings and sickness. I never craved anything nor was sick. I just crossed it out and put my writting in it. There is plenty of room to write though. It is a good balance for both mother and father as well. I enjoyed it but I will probably buy a different one for my next pregnancy (currently pregnant and searching for a better book)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Journal","review":"I like this journal because it is visually appealing and had a spot to write each week as well as a little bit of planning space without going overboard. Really, it's best if you can see the inside before you buy these things, so I looked at several at a local bookstore and then decided this one was the best combination of personal and planning writing space."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing like it....must have","review":"I had gotten a journal identical to this one when I was pregnant with my son in 2010. When I found out I was pregnant again this year I thought I should get a different journal for different kids...boy was I wrong there. I ended up throwing out the journal I got for this pregnancy and buying another My Pregnancy Journal because it has everything a mom needs. With pockets for ultrasounds and letters to baby, many areas that help you think of what to say, and tons of places to help you get ready for baby (checklists for clothes, your info and dads info area, contact number list, birth plan area, and tons more) this is the ultimate pregnancy journal."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Thanks","review":"I was looking for a guided journal to take the place of my 40 Day and 40 Night Journal by Ilene Segalove after I completed it. This journal caught my eye I suppose because it looked nice and dreamy. It was not at all what I was looking for though. The layout just didn't make sense to me, I didn't like that it was laid out by emmotion. Sometimes I'm not sure how I feel, sometimes I'm not really having any specific emmotional issue, I just want a good prompt to get my mind and pen flowing. This book is beautiful and I'm sure is great for someone, it just wasn't at all what I was looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Advertised appropriately","review":"This was well advertised and great quality. If you are looking to discover or rediscover who you are then this is the journal for you. It will probe into some uncomfortable questions and maybe some awkward memories. When you step out of your comfort zone the best changes come. I recommend this for someone who is looking for answers and doesn't know where to start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really tried to like this","review":"When I ordered this I wanted to give it as a gift, once I received it I read through the topics. Most were very negative types of questions about not trusting, jealousy, missed opportunities. From the reviews I had expected questions that would drive me down a positive path. I tried to think of someone to give to as a gift, but threw it away instead. If you are looking for a feel good type of journal this may not be for you.

The author's have also provided space to write your thoughts and feeling within the pages, as well as artwork that coincides with the different areas of \\"self\\" that are examined in this book.

In MY journal, I have cut and pasted images from magazines to make a collage on some of the pages, and added my own favorites to the quotes the authors have on the bottoms of selected pages.

I sent it back and ordered something else because I would have been EMBARRASSED to give this to my friend. This book is terrible! The whole book is nothing but photos taken at UT football games, with virtually no text. There is no real information about UT's history, heritage, program, record, anything! The whole book is nothing but pictures, and mediocre pictures at that. There are boring pictures of fans, boring pictures of referees, boring pictures of people walking -- you get the idea. Even the cheerleader pictures are boring!! There is almost NO football in the whole book! I cannot imagine anyone, even a diehard UT fan like my friend, being entertained by this book for more than about 45 seconds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a wonderful book!","review":"Andrew Loomis art instruction books are my absolutely favorite. they are just so amazing!

Loomis found a way to bring these challenges into the realm of the achievable for amateurs, with a text that, while a bit old fashioned in style, feeds the drawing brain.As a bonus, Loomis'own pieces, particularly the finished sketches, are deeply satiafying to view. To be sure, the style is genre-past, but the evocation is sweet, recent, and wholly American. One can see in the sketched heads the tender, yearbook faces of our parents now aged or departed."},{"rating":"2","title":"great reference and instructional guide","review":"I have Andrew Loomis' other books and together they consisted of my art education. I learned more from these books than in my entire art education at the University of Missouri. Not that I didn't get plenty of practical experience in college.

But, they at least gave it a shot. But, it felt like it was being directed by 12 year old girls. They had no idea what they were doing. What a piece of crap. There's absolutely nothing that will keep you awake. The only good thing was that they tried at making a movie, but they obviously had no intentions of trying to get someone as great as Spielberg because Universal was so d@m cheap with this movie! I don't wanna talk about it, and honestly, there is no reason to talk about it.The Rating? 1.8/5. Now that's crap. If they did that to a Jaws movie, I'm ready to leave my loyalty of Universal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Box set","review":"I was going to buy this but when I saw it was a box set i was disapointed.

It played great and looked good, but sounded like crap. Since I liked the feel of it, I decided to buy it ($300.00) and save up for pickup upgrades. I saw these for $150.00 and bought them. 2 day shipping with prime, installed, and this cheap Tele sounds great! Has the nice tele \\"pop\\" in the middle position, very nice warmth on the neck pickup (I think it's warmer than a stock american), and the bridge pickup is pretty hot. Not as twangy as other teles, though, but ok with me. I prefer the percussive \\"pop\\" over the shrill twang. Very good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't miss this Garwood Story","review":"This book was a great read, classic Garwood and a book you don't want to miss. I do have to give it 4 stars due to fact it took a while for me to get into the book. It just took a little longer to have the story set up- not a reason to miss out on this book. Once the story was set up, it was smooth sailing. What I love about Garwood is the depth she brings to a story, you don't just read it, she shows it to you in her writing.This is the first \\"Frontier\\" book I have read and enjoyed greatly. I felt I was right along side the Claybourne family with their struggles. There are two books left in the trilogy, The Claybourne Brides (One white rose, One Pink Rose, One red rose) and Come the Spring. I am most looking forward to reading Cole's story in Come the Spring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"I usually love Julie Garwood's books but this one I'm having the hardest time finishing.

Three orphaned boys find a little girl in a trash pile and band together to raise her as their sister. The romance element of the book is good, as well as the part where Mary Rose finds her biological father, but the relationships of Mary Rose and her four unconventional brothers are what make this book a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A milestone","review":"This book was a first for me.

All of my friends who have read your books and I agree \\"I wish she would write faster\\" but then again we know that your books are something special to look forward to. EVERYONE read this book--you will not be sorry, you will love all of the Clayborne brothers, and Mary Rose with her sweet giving spirit.

The rest of the story however was a sorry joke. The dialogue (Page after page of it) was literally chilish jibberish -- drawn out and SO SO BORING and uncreative. Characters are also blaise. Where are the real writers?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Drives me nuts","review":"Garwood has started this really bad habit of 5 characters trying to talk at once. What was once funny in her earlier books is now becoming annoying. She tries too hard to be funny. She may have one character say something, then it's seven paragraphs later before another one answers. You lose track of what is going on. I think this is her worst book ever, followed only by the other rose books, which I call \\"Stupid,\\" \\"Stupider, and \\"Stupidest.\\" Very lazy and unimaginative writing, all designed to get us to buy them and lead up to the next one. She could learn something from Nora Roberts, who never gets lazy in any story. I've quit reading Julie Garwood. I'm tired of spending money on stories that drive me nuts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too explicit","review":"If you like reading explicit sex scenes, this is the book for you. If you want a real story, thoughtfully crafted, with an intricate plot and living characters, this is not the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"As always, Garwood has written another wonderfull romance.","review":"Julie Garwood has always had the knack for creating page-turning books. She has a witty style that never fails to elicit chuckles. She didn't fail to deliver in \\"For the Roses\\". I absolutely fell in love with her characters. The love she created between the the family is inspiring. It made me long for a family like that. It is a story that makes the reader feel good. I fell in love with the character of Harrison because he is such a well rounded individual. He is very much a \\"man\\" without being a brute like so often happens in romance novels. I recommend this book to anyone who loves a good romance that isn't just a typical romance"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I really enjoyed the first half of this story. However, it was very disturbing to to me that when Rose becomes afraid during her first sexual encounter with Harrison in the bunk house that HE HOLDS HER DOWN until she stops struggling. In this century we call that not consensual sex, or rape. Then the next night Rose is actually telling him that he's hurting her, and does he stop? NO! That's a serious problem. I think the author and Harrison use two excuses for him to ignore her obvious \\"NO\\" 1) She's a virgin so the first time having sex HAS TO BE PAINFUL, and 2) She's going to enjoy sex once Harrison once she's gets passed the pain. Which is typically not true,most women DO NOT orgasm their first time.It's not okay to force your partner into doing anything they're not comfortable with or are actively saying \\"NO\\" to.In summary, Rape isn't sexy"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"I HAVE ENJOYED BOTH HISTORICAL & modern Garwood books this story is probably still one of my favorites great characters & fast read"},{"rating":"2","title":"Julie Garwood-Love ALL her books!!","review":"I read all the Clayborns series...LOVED THEM!!!

I find it easy to worry if I'm good enough. And sometimes I see where other people are and know it isn't what I want.Besides the value in other's stories, I just find them interesting! These are stories from names I recognize as stars in the yoga and Buddhist world. It's good to see them as human. I get a feeling I know them better, which changes my relationship to them when I see them walking around at a Yoga Journal conference or catch their name in print.The question the book poses is \\"Will yoga and meditation really change my life?\\" In my own life, I've already answered this question (it will), but what this book does is help me not worry so much about needing to think my life needs changing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Valuable Resource Yoga Book for Beginner and Expert Alike","review":"What one learns by reading this book is that Yoga practice is an extremely individual and intimate practice; in ongoing practice, no one reacts or gains insight into oneself in quite the same way.

I thought as science fiction I would like it, and as a dog movie my sister would like it.The dog didn't even arrive until about two thirds of the way through the movie.The acting was sub-standard, the plot so slow as to be glacial. Even wanting to believe it was good, and having seen the five stars, I was so disappointed as the movie dragged on and on. I kept telling my sister, it's going to pick up, and then I told her again. Then I noticed her eyes were closed.Even the eventual action scenes were so dull as to be anti-climatic.I want my hour and a half back.And I lost some cred with my sister for making her sit through this. Oh I had some credits in that department because she made me watch the big lebowski, a movie neither of us could abide.There are so many good movies, I recommend you pass on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Auntie Mame' move over!","review":"I found this book reminicent of the hilarious books of the great Patrick Dennis.

I'm rarely led astray by following my insticts, and love discovering new artists after reading about them. Plus, Sally Timms and John Langford from the Mekons are guests on this album, so it seemed like a safe bet. It wasn't. I think this will be my one and only Johnny Dowd purchase. Biggest reason: I just can't get past that voice. Johnny Dowd is not a singer, yet he inflicts his harsh vocals on the listener. I can handle a little eccentricity, but this guy just makes me squirm. It's okay to be \\"an American original\\" but it helps if you have some talent. Lyrically, he's got something to say on a few tunes, although some of the simplistic lyrics in other songs make me wince. The parts I enjoyed best were the instrumental passages. Some cool guitar and organ interplay at work. But otherwise ... ouch. This is painful to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whirling images","review":"This surrealist story brings Dal��'s paintings to mind: absurd and impossible, but so precisely drawn that it captivates the viewer. Instead of linear storytelling with clear premises and resolution, this seems to approach its major characters repeatedly, from different angles, as if trying to find some point of view that Valerie can understand. Instead, the hallucinatory visions circle around the central characters until they evaporate, in the end, like morning fog.Reading this book might be easiest if you have strong visual imagination. Imagery includes bizarre revival tent exhortations, supernatural transformations, dank crypts, and more. Somehow, these scenes beg to be brought to life.This isn't for everyone. It leads the reader through a very personal vision, populated by mythic beings of uncertain meaning. If that, plus a vivid pictorial sense can pull you in, then you'll find a remarkable experience between these covers.-- wiredweird"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear, clean chi taste.","review":"This is the best chai tea I have ever tasted.

The tea had a unique refreshing taste unlike other green teas that you purchase at your local grocery store. This tea goes well with a piece of lemon and a small amount of sugar in my opinion. If you like to drink tea, give this a try. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck...","review":"I LOVE YOGI but not this tea. I wasn't expecting it to be so spicy.

I requested a installation at a convenient time for me within a few days on their website. I received a install date confirmation after my requested date, so I declined. It then became impossible to use the website. When I called the company to set up an installation I was informed that I could not do so. I have to wait for a call that will come sometime in the next couple of days. I pleaded for a number to call so I could just schedule a stupid radio installation, but the operator on the other end was adamant. I'm a busy person, and jumping through these hoops wastes way too much of my time.

And I would agree with pretty much everything. The sound quality is excellent, until you compare it to some $200+ Audio Technicas (ATH-A900), which my friend has. You can tell the difference immediately, the A900's having a much more rich, clear sound. They are also much more comfortable. The ATH-PRO700's do compress the ear a bit, i am slightly sore after a few hours. The quality is excellent, very strong and robust, as expected from Audio Technica. These fold up very compact, the folding mechanisms feel high-quality. The jack has a thread-off adapter to go from standard large size to an mp3 player friendly 3.5mm jack. Overall, sound quality, for the money, is very good. I am very happy with these, and will eventually upgrade to higher-end Audio Technicas once I can afford some."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent...but not exceptional","review":"Even though the sound quality is great, the comfort outweighs it alot. I didn't like how the cushions were too small. They overlapped my ears making it hard to listen for long hours. Another thing that I didn't like was how hot it was. Granted, most closed headphones have that problem, but this one seemed more apparent, maybe it was just me. However, I did enjoy having that coil cord. It made my music more portable. But in the end, I just didn't like the comfort. Also, I had trouble with my return, but that wasn't the headphones fault. In the end, its price is decent for the sound quality, but the comfort was annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Viewpoint of the BiPolar","review":"This has some basic ideas of what it is like but it doesn't really give you a good impression of the disease as a whole.

To me it reads like a Bridget Jones type of book, except that the main character is not as fluffy and has a lot more going on between the ears. It was much easier for me to relate to this character as a real woman. I loved the ending, which to me was much more realistic than the \\"got the man and then lived happily ever after\\" ending that is us used in most women's fiction these days. The mother/daughter relationship rang very true to me, and it was interesting to learn how the character started to understand that it would never be a black and white relationship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not well written","review":"Don't waste your money.I didn't think this book was well written.

One chapter also covers building resin car models, such as a 57 Chevy police car and 57 Ambulance. One chapter covers creating a couple of tow trucks.

There were a lot of tips on health and beauty that I haven't seen in other books. For a beginner who wants to learn the basics of applying makeup, I would recommend Bobby Brown or Sonia Kashuk (their books are better illustrated and explained).

Needless to say at war's end, the country would have been better off paying Washington a salary. Congress didn't make the same mistake when Washington became president and made the same offer.

This writing will show how Eichman was discovered living in Argentina. It will show how Mossad confirmed his identity and then went about planning his actual capture.

The ancestor girl (name slipped my mind) starts out doing one bad love spell and it spirals into this huge disaster. Even though everyone the girl should trust is telling her that what she is doing is wrong she's so stupidly arrogant that she keeps on plowing her way through, certain that she alone is right.

Yoffie have written a play-by-play of the competition between Netscape and Microsoft in an enormously detailed book that became an instant classic. Adding to the insider scoop, the authors take the opportunity to show readers how they can apply the \\"lessons\\" from this historic corporate battle to their own businesses in the context of today's fast-paced world, which runs on \\"Internet time.\\" Critically acclaimed, the book is filled with facts, figures, insights and strategies, and manages to do it all without drowning in tedium. We at getAbstract highly recommend this book to people in all business. It's exceptionally well written and flows like a good adventure saga, which it is.

I find the premise that EVERYTHING that they did was in reaction to Micros~1 is rather dubious. The authors overuse of the cliche \\"...in a life and death struggle with Microsoft\\" is annoying. The fact is that Microsoft is irrelevant to innovation, the creation of the web browser, and the internet itself. What they are about is using their monopolistic/anti-competative practices to destroy real innovation.This book would have been worlds better if it focused more on Netscape and the development of its products (more like Tracey Kidder's \\"The Soul of a New Machine\\" (an excellent book BTW) and less on playing up the melodrama of its interactions with Monoposoft."},{"rating":"1","title":"This item is an old model and does not do ther same functions as a new model.

Maybe the first work of Juenger's later phase, where he is more interested in broader issues which are hidden in a symbolic narrative. The narrative itself is interesting, being a study in the advance of fascism, but the metaphors and symbolism are perhaps lost a bit in translation. I found myself frustrated at many turns, knowing that there was some hidden meaning on the page before me, but which was obscured--perhaps due to translation, time or lack of context. Still, an interesting book. I plan on revisiting after I've worked through more of Juenger's later works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle version NOT the Maguire translation","review":"I found \\"Dead Souls\\" through the Amazon search and clicked on the hardbound Maguire translation.

The same customer reviews appeared as for the hardbound version. There was no contradicting information about the translator, so I bought expecting the Kindle version of the Maguire translations. When I opened the Kindle version, I was surprised to see credits for translation by D.J. Hogarth. This difference should be made clear, especially when the reviews on the same page extol the Maguire version and you don't get that translation."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Translation of this work","review":"The reason this is the best translation is that Maguire is an authority on Gogol and this work. He provides the most thorough footnotes for a work I have come across and explains all the Russian nuances. We read this for an IB class in which several native Russian speakers were included. They commented on how Maguire was able to maintain the quality and nuances of the language and satire in translation -- a very difficult task.

I was fortunate enough to have a friend who owned this book (which I then unabashedly stole). While the anthology volumes may give you more sheer material - Strange Wine is in my mind a perfect compilation of stories due to the more manageable size (some of the anthologies are so huge), high quality of the stories, and the variety of themes and style. I think of this book like my favorite albums - each track is different and beautifully constructed - yet each still reveals the wondrous, dark, and demented imagination of Ellison.

Ultimately though this book fails due to the fact that economic rents cannot be produced via a tick a box process as suggested. If they could then everybody would be generating them and therefore no one would be as they'd no longer be super normal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fundamental","review":"You will never look to a company the same way you do today.

The authors convincingly show how this impacts profit and growth, and why we should focus analysis on strategic moves as opposed to strategic companies.Central to the theory is the \\"strategy canvas\\", in which you rate a company on a set of industry factors. You than tweak these to find uncontested market space. This demands some creativity, but basically you decide for each factor whether it will be reduced, eliminated, created, or raised.There is a good set of convincing cases to support the point. By seeing how companies invented and exploited blue oceans you get an intuitive feel for potential in a market."},{"rating":"2","title":"The name of the game","review":"Outstanding book.

These authors have some \\"tool\\" called a \\"strategy canvas\\", but it doesn't make sense at all. It's a line graph, and they say that if the line goes up and down a lot, you don't have a coherent strategy. The trouble is, a line that goes up and down a lot can be turned into a line that makes just one transition from down to up by resorting the items on the x-axis, but they never really define how the x-axis should be ordered.

It covers 6 case studies to find the common threads of successful strategy in the \\"new\\" and future digital business world..By contrast, Blue Ocean is somewhat tired.

Most successful companies in the last 100 years have used the blue ocean strategy successfully to their advantage, but it has been regarded more as a deviation, a fluke, than an actual business stratey that belongs to mainstream and can be used by every business in every industry.

This is not how I would teach, and I would want my child not to have to learn without instruction. Also, I did not like the example of Froggy trying to swing as high as he could until the swing went over the top of the swingset. The climax and denouement involve Froggy's pants coming off in the water. If your child is older (maybe 7 or so) and still does not know how to swim, this book is for you. Otherwise, you are probably better off making up your own story."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"I love this story because it kind of teaches you to swim.

In order to avoid this problem, I suggest that you pre-drill the holes with a slightly smaller bit size before screwing thr stand together.

We purchased them because they perfectly match some wine label art we have on the walls in our nook area. While these look great, they are made VERY poorly. One of our trays is essentially impossible to unfold and fold without the support strut coming apart. Then when unfolded, it wobbles terribly. Additionally, the stand is assembly required and due to the design it is impossible to assemble it without it having considerable wobble as well.Overall, this is a $20 set of trays with labels on them.

The fights are short and irrelevant, the \\"training\\" sequence is a bust, the villian and his kung-fu are weak, and the historical elements of Drunken Style & Shoalin are not even approached. Basically, every classic element of traditonal kung fu film is missing or very poorly done. Gorden Liu is a pretty tough and good in quite a few films, but he's not really given much to do in this cheapie. I mean, even for 70s Fu, the production values are horrid.

The fight scenes are dull (this is the same choreographer responsible for Legend of Drunken Master?), the story is bland and hackneyed (someone killed his father, he was raised by a martial arts master, goes back for revenge blah blah blah) and the ending.....jeez. When I say it's bad, I don't mean sad - I mean it's bad as in IT MAKES NO SENSE. Cripes, what a letdown.

Rarely, a really brilliant white label mashup or remix comes along... but I must stress that the standout occurrances are few & far between.If any good comes out of it, at least Sinead has a chance of reaching #1 on the dance charts.

Well if that is what you want, this is the book for you. With so many other great baby books out there, I would recommend looking at some others over this one. Maybe some people liked it because it really is only 8 pages (4 double sided pages) and doesn't have much text. In fact the first two pages only say: Clap hands, stomp feet. My son is 1 and he won't sit through a long book but this is too short and not interesting enough.I would recommend these books: Brown Bear and the rest of the series (my husband reads them to my son with different voices for all the animals and he loves it!), I love you through and through (my absolute favorite), Dr. Seuss' books (a few are short and are aimed at a younger audience)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great kids book!","review":"All 3 of my girls enjoyed this book (a series of 4).

But I never thought of Wolf as a real Jazz Author, so recently I purchased both 'Best of Jazz' and another on Wes Montogomery and to be honest I was skeptical that he would deliver!I was 100% wrong and the books were fantastic and Wolf did it again! The quality of subscription, playing and production is super stuff. A must for any serious guitarist who passed the journey of Rock shredding, and now in the phase of playing classic jazz (Maybe getting a bit older as well!!)Both books are highly recommended and I would grade them more than 5 stars, if that was availableFinally, Wolf if you write down any other books regarding Jazz, reserve me a copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent how-to guide for playing the jazz guitar","review":"Best Of Jazz Guitar is a remarkable, step-by-step presentation of jazz guitar styles and techniques, incorporating the music of famous guitarists such as Tal Farlow, Grant Green, Jim Hall, Joe Pass and many more. Filled cover to cover with accessible sheet music, each song in this volume is annotated with a very short biography of its author, step-by-step instructions for proper arrangement, signatures, and also performance notes to better help beginners. Also included is an audio CD to better help amateur musicians learn how to play at a professional level. Novice and intermediate jazz guitarists alike will appreciate this singularly excellent how-to guide for playing the jazz guitar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moves very slowly","review":"Reading this book now...Usually enjoy her books, but this one moves too slowly and is not keeping my attention. Don't find myself waiting for free time to pick it up again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not her best work","review":"I've really enjoyed the author's other work, but this is pretty terrible. The characters all have unforgivable flaws, like lying and adultery, with no remorse for any of it. I read the whole thing only because I was hoping it would some how get better at the end. No luck there, I am afraid. Read her other works, skip the hot flash books."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of $15.37.","review":"This had to be one of the worst books I have ever read.

One of the worst pieces of mind numbing junk I have ever read. Stupid and pointless drivel and a bunch of characters unbearably unlikeable. Dialogue that not once rang true,(ex. \\"I saw a Trilobyte!\\") with weak attempts at humor that fell embarassingly flat.

I now eagerly await the chance to read the second book. Nancy Thayer has written a gem and it should be given to every woman going through that time of life. In reading this book I realize that I am not alone in my feelings about my body, my emotions and all the rest. It made me laugh, cry and THINK. Romance, feeling good about yourself and pursuing dreams do not have to die when you hit 50. That age can give you more freedom than you have ever had and this book celebrates all of that and more. For once someone has written a book about something other than sleek young things and all I can say \\"It's about time!\\" Nancy... you go girl!"},{"rating":"1","title":"All you wanted to know about menopause but were afraid toask","review":"I am not near the \\"hot flash\\" stage of life, but I thought this looked like it would be a good/funny book. It was a quick read, but it seemed a bit silly & contrived to me. I laughed out loud a few times but only because it was so predictable. The story moved quickly, though, and it is a good beach escape. It just lacks depth.

This book is not up to her usual standard of writing & plot development. While her characters are fairly interesting & there are some good ideas-to-live-by contained in the novel, the writing & plot development are jejune & not well-honed. Can this be the same author who wrote \\"Everlasting\\" & \\"Three Women at the Water's Edge\\"??? The conclusion was laughable---everyone running around at a cocktail party & characters sequestered in various rooms was reminiscent of a Marx brothers comedy.

Although intended for young students in 4th to 6th grades, it is written in an academic style, making it difficult for younger readers to drag themselves through it. That said, I can't fault the research or documentation that this contains, and it is surely interesting from an adult viewpoint.

It is a true and terrifying story, yet it shows great description of the disease and how it gets to people. \\"In this awful situation, the stoutest hearts begin to fail. Hope flickers, and despair suceeds distress in almost countenance. It is a invisible killer roaming the streets of Philadelphia killing peaple that stands in its path\\". I would probably change the pictures from black and white to color so if kids read it they get more out of it. I would recommend this book to anyone because its easy to learn the history from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"Finally, a great nonfiction book written for children.

I chose this book as a read aloud for summer school and it worked, but maybe not the most motivated audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book is painfully boring!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"An American Plague is about the yellow fever epidemic of 1749 in Philadelphia. The only thing I did like about this book is it goes into very specific detail about everything from the era, the culture, and how they treated the disease and those who had it. The following is a quote from the book with alot of detail \\" In Philadelphia an increasing number of cats were dropping everyday, attracting, one Philadelphian complained an amazing number of flies and other insects.Mosquitoes wereevery where, though their high-pitched whirring was particularly load near rain barrels, gutters, and open sewers\\".In this book I learned that people didn't always have cures for diseases right away.When this did happen people would flee.If I was the author of this book I would make the story about one person and the city around them instead of just about the city. I think the format the author wrote it in made the book very dull and not fun to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"An American Plague","review":"The book is about the 1793 Philadelphia outbreak of yellow fever. What I like about how this book is written is that it is detailed and accurate. It also includes clues as to how the disease came to Philly and from where. I am going to put a few passages from the book in: \\"The swamps and marshes had already lost a great deal of water due to the intense heat, while the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers had receeded to reveal long stretches of their muddy, root choked banks.\\" Here is another qoute from the book: \\"Mosquitoes were everywhere though their loud pitched whirring was mostly near rain barrels, gutters, and open sewers.\\" I learned that they have a slow way of dealing with those types of things. If this was my book I would have less talking about things that don't really matter much in the book. I rated this book a two because it is really boring and there is no action or anything. I just think it could have more interesting parts somewhere in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Companion to Fever 1793","review":"I had my students reading Fever 1793.

When we got it, the entire box smelled of rubber, from the tires. I opened the box and put the tires outside to air out for a couple of days. My hubby put it together rather quickly and my three year old was getting pulled around. The only complaint is that the turning radius is virtually non-existent which is ok if you're out in a big open space. If you're in a smaller space forget about sharp turns. Other than that we love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent value!","review":"Excellent wagon! My son is now 11 and we have owned this wagon for three years. I know, I know, he was old when we got it, but he LOVES anything John Deere. He didn't use it to be pulled around in, but he used it to give all the neighbors children's rides and he uses it to haul tree limbs, yard waste and the best of all, FIREWOOD! He loves grabbing his Deere and filling her up with as much firewood as it can hold and bringing up to the house for us. The wagon is durable, sturdy and you'd never know its age by looking it at it. I love the rubber wheels! Makes for a smooth ride and it handles the bumps well!You never will regret buying a Deere!"},{"rating":"2","title":"John Deere wagon","review":"This wagon is well constructed.

Unfortunately, in our extreme, northern climate, the plastic handle broke. I am having trouble finding a replacement part for it. I don't want (or need) a new wagon, I've had this only 3 years. If it were metal, it would hold up better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid wagon, safe for a young child","review":"This wagon made a great Christmas present for our 2 year old granddaughter; and it will be a good yard wagon for her parents too. The construction is very robust, with a wide wheel base and a limited turning radius to prevent tip-overs. The John Deere logo and yellow hubs are a lot of fun. The wooden sides bolt to the wagon body so a child can't take them off - probably a safety feature. The wood comes unfinished. We put a couple of coats on spar varnish on the wood to nice effect.The only quirk: the wheels have a real odor when first unpacked, which took about 2 weeks in the garage to go away. Allow some time for the off-gassing to run its course before presenting the wagon to a child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Wagon","review":"GOOD:When compared to other new wagon's this wagon is very well made. It is all metal.The tires are better quality than any other new wagon I could find. They have steel wheels and rubber tires.Bad:One thing I wish the description would have been more clear on is the wooden sides are not easily removal. To remove them, there are 10 screws that have to be removed.The handle does not fold completely under the wagon. I cannot fit the wagon into the trunk of my car without removing the sides and handle.The wagon does not turn very sharp. It's fine for making a big turn but for a sharp corner I left to front off the ground."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unstable - CHEAP- Made in China -","review":"I thought a John Deere Wagon was the Best. This wagon is CHEAP - Raw unknown wood stakes - unsafe - My hands do not fit in the wagons pull. The pull only fits 3 fingers. The worst is that this wagon does not turn freely. It only has a 3\\" lead side to side. So you always have to pick up the front end of the wagon to move it. I am thinking that since this is made in China that tells me that the paint is LEAD.John Deere sucks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"John Deere Wagon","review":"This wagon was purchased for my grandson and appears to be very durable and well made.

The author neglects to provide motivation or sufficient characterization for the individuals who inhabit his stories, and he seems to have trouble maintaining a coherent timeline or plot. The stories are misogynistic - I can't think of a single positive female character - or, actually, of a single sympathetic character, period. They (the characters) fail to evoke any positive emotions, or any response other than boredom and nausea. If you appreciate the genre of horror, and specifically the short story, please, pick up Poppy Z. Brite's \\"Wormwood\\" or any of the Borderlands anthologies - you'll be saving youself both the price of shipping and a wrenching sense of disillusionment with the publishing world. (P.S. - I honestly tried to avoid the more vituperative statements - it just honestly, really, truly is that bad.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books ever!","review":"After years of looking for this book I didn't have any luck. One day I was checking out a second hand book store and I wasn't even looking for anything in particular when I came across this book. I couldn't put it down.

I feel very lucky on finding this book, it's so hard to find."},{"rating":"2","title":"A TRUE WORK OF ART","review":"A friend recomened this book to me and I love it. Del James makes you think about stuff that is going on in real life and describes it so well. With the way he describes stuff you can fell the pain that the character is going through or what is on his or her mind. And when you put the book down I still get impacted on what went on. Its hard to put into words you just have to read the book.I think him and Stephen King are tied to be my favoriate authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not As Good As Hoped","review":"Bought this for my son in college as he had heard about it and was anxious to read it especially since Axl Rose recommends it.

Tom Dorrance keeps searching for words to explain what seems to be his metaphysical relationship with horses and comes up short.

Very frustrating to read (what I did read)."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Unity hard to read but worth it","review":"I liked this book because Dorrance tries to explain how a horse thinks. This is not an easy task and he gives lots of examples of this. Horses think in pictures. It all comes down to that. If we can see them doing what we want consistently, then it can happen. It's all about understanding the horse. Not an easy book to read but worth taking the time to try and understand what a true horseman is telling us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to read.","review":"Tom Dorrance sure was one of the fathers of horsemanship and a great horseman, but he wasn't a writer.

The stats that were quoted about things like twin birth rates, mothers returning to the work force and even baby gear were terribly outdated.

I'm sure it will be a decent resouce seven months from now, but I need a source that tells me what I should do today. If you're fewer than eight months pregnant with multiples, I wouldn't recommend this book at all. I wish I had a good recommendation for you, but I'm still looking myself.

It was unable to cut the tailpipe and the tool actually failed before a single successful cut. The tool is poorly designed and one of the arms collapsed as the tool was tightened around the pipe. I can not recommen this tool. It may work better with a 2\\" tailpipe or smaller. The tool is too fragile to be considered a serious automotive speacialty tool. Lisle makes great products, but this is not one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your moneyl Poorly made.","review":"When using this product the rivets that hold the cuttwheels on have broke and off made the cutoff blades come off of the device. HAKF WAY THROUH THE FIRST USED! It is also flimsy and will cut at spiral angels when tightened. I know it is cheap but please remember it is cheap for a reaon. Spent more and get a chain one!!Pros: Cheapt price. Might get you through the first time use.Cons: Too many to list. A clever idea for a tool but it didnt do the job!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ok tool, but flimsey...get what you pay for","review":"Got this to replace my broken chain type exhaust cutter. This tool is very flimsey. You really have to take your time to make sure your cuts will be lined up even while your cutting & if your not careful you can easily make the pipe out of round. On the positive it gets the job done and its less tedious then using a handsaw, but the same if not better results can be had with a cutoff wheel. If you want a nice clean cut I strongly suggest paying the extra for a decent chain type exhaust cutter. This was on an aluminized steel piping, I seriously doubt it would cut through any kind of stainless steel. What can I say, you get what you pay for"},{"rating":"2","title":"Time Saver","review":"This tool worked fine for me. You need to use a light oil (Ex. WD-40) for the cutting wheels to do a proper job and -do not- try to dig in deep quickly. Let the tool do the job and it will serve you well. It helps if you are already familiar with using a rolling type tubing/pipe cutter.Not having to drop the entire exhaust and getting a nice cut is great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Did the job","review":"I used this tool to make three cuts in 2-inch stainless piping. The tool worked as advertised and did the trick. My only complaint is that it is difficult to get a perfectly square cut. Meaning, I ended up with a slight \\"spiral\\" cut. You can get a really clean cut when you are cutting pipe off the car as you can check all sides of the pipe to make sure the wheels are all lined up in the same groove. But if you're under the car and working in limited space, it may not be so easy to get the tool square with the pipe to get an absolutely clean cut."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easiest Tool I've Ever Used!","review":"This tool is the easiest hand tool I've ever used.

This thing produces a far superior cut without all the drama.Occasionally when you are done there are a few strands holding the pipe on that you need to trim off with a sawzall. Sometimes just wiggling the pipe back and forth is enough to break it free.I don't use it off the car. My chop saw is much quicker tho it raises a lot of toxic fumes and makes a big mess which this tool does not.If you've got to cut an exhaust pipe on the car, this thing will get it done. I'm ordering another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fulcrum of World History","review":"After the era of the great Classical Age of the Greeks the slow motion shift of the geopolitical center of gravity westward in the Mediterranean world is reflected in the inexorable conflict of the Carthaginians and the Romans for dominance. This first-rate no-bones account describes this ominous collision of world history that lies at the threshold of the world of the Roman era to come. It also shows the strains on the cultural politics of the Roman Republic as this will disintegrate to produce the world of the Caesars and the Empire. The book comprehensively covers all three Punic Wars and clearly lays out the tale in a manner that still, for being told a myriad times, evokes dramatic suspense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Academic History, Boring Story Telling","review":"I was a little hard for me to read this book.Altough the author makes a very good book in terms of a scholar work, the work lacks life and vigor.Probably the Punic Wars is not an easy sell to readers but still, the author could have done a better job in presenting a more colorful and living history.I am not saying that he should turn the Punic Wars into an Indiana Jones movie, but the book is too scholarly,too Oxford, which makes for a pretty boring book.I found myself reading a couple of pages and then putting down the book for another time.It took me almost 5 months to finish it.If you are looking for a college course, this is your book.If you want living history get another book"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent history of the punic wars","review":"The best book on the Three Punic Wars that I have read.

An excellent story based in the life long romance between the lord of the manor and his wife. The lord succumbs to a toturous illness and his wife bequeaths the estate to the Abby at Shewbury. In return for the manor and its lands, the Abby must provide lodging for the wife and a rather special rent.The rent? Only a rose cut from the rose bush on the manor grounds. However, this isn't just any old rose bush, but rather the one her husband use to cut roses from for his love in life: a remembrance of the great love they shared.Well this all sounds great deal for the Abby, so what's the problem?

The dialog is a little tech-heavy, but the concept of time travel as it is explained in the film is completely plausible, if not entirely believable.I have always believed that true science fiction is not an end in itself; it is simply a means to an end, a method used by a writer or director to shine a light on human nature and compel us to take a closer look at ourselves. This movie definitely falls into that category.Some may find this film a bit slow and may not like the fact that it demands more than one viewing to be fully appreciated, but I believe most true sci-fi fans will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget the budget - its good on any terms","review":"No idea why people keep going on about the low budget. It sells for the same price as any other movie.That said i liked it - I needed to watch it twice and with subtitles the second time because it was sometimes hard catching the dialogue including one key plot point which was mumbled off screen . Sometimes the dialogues seemed unecessarily deep (when discussing super conductors) and sometimes too shallow ( when discussing the output of a 12 volt car battery - yeah we know its 12 volts).I am still not clear on exactly how many times they went round or really entirely sure what the outcome was. I think i know but maybe not.But its clever and quirkly and makes you think. If you like altered universes or shifted time state movies this is one of the best so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing.","review":"I was interested in some time travel movies so a friend recommended this in addition to Back to the Future and Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. This one was the most confusing and boring out of the three. I persevered and watched the entire thing even though I was tempted to turn it off. I thought the telephone booth in Bill and Ted's was a dumb vehicle for time travel but the boxes in this were a little less imaginative than that even. On the whole I think time travel movies are hard to follow with people coming in and out of the past future and seeing duplicates of themselves. This movie added a whole other level to that kind of confusion. It was recommended I watch it again but I think I may just move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, Bad, Bad!","review":"Worst film ever do not rent or buy this film. cheap production and bad acting.

Time travel movies and scenarios are not new to me. Having said that, I'd have to watch this movie numerous times to figure it out completely.

To think that a bunch of techies with no formal film training could produce a film of this calibre foe seven grand is just unbelievable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quantum mechanics as myth.","review":"Primer is a metaphor for the value of a great premise over the buck. The film was made on a shoestring . . . for far less than Closer or The Day After Tomorrow(sorry I couldn't resist the left hook to Hollywood's schlock conveyor belt).Part of its appeal is the film does not show(or tell) what exactly is happening. The story draws us in as we guess what is happening-and when! But, how could the film explain how time travel works? The time travelers themselves cannot fully explain what they discovered. Their staccato dialogue about mathematics and physics serves the film well. Myth, bubbling under the surface, involves quantum mechanics; an object's position in time and space can only be assigned a probability . . . not a certainty.The excitement is not the wild ride of time travel and its effect on the world, but how a discovery rips apart a deep friendship.If you are in the market for an engaging sci-fi fantasy trip, this is your flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Post-Modern Indie SF Masterpiece","review":"In brief, this film was a masterpiece. It takes an ax to antiquated beliefs about the concept of time and our place in it, particularly the concept of time \\"paradoxes\\" in favor of a more quantum-theory friendly, new-school take on time travel. A refreshingly new tale revolving around two greedy young entrepreneurs with a dangerous new invention, brimming with potential. Their caution with the device has driven a few moviegoers mad, however I felt it added to the realism of the film in favor of huge, massively disbelief-suspending blockbusters. Original, powerful, chilling cryptic and refreshing. The sound and dialogue timing could have been better in a few spots, but these minor issues did little to overwhelm the complete piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, not good","review":"This was a boring piece of crap. Unlike some other SF movies like Buckaroo Banzai and Starship Troopers which don't make complete sense but challenge you into trying make sense out of them, this one was deliberately, pretentiously obfuscatory but in no way made it enticing to attempt to find out the details. At the end all we felt was relief that it was over and no desire to understand everything that happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie I have ever seen. And that's being kind.","review":"No amount of time travel will give you back the wasted hour and a half you will have spent watching this drivel. Just because you give someone a camera doesn't mean they are a filmmaker. I am quite confused to as to how this film won something at Sundance.I tried to give \\"Primer\\" the benefit of the doubt; I am all for independent gems succeeding. I made it through about twenty minutes still thinking \\"Ok, it's gonna get good any second.\\" By the time the end credits rolled I was pissed off at the filmmakers and myself for not quitting the film a long time ago.Do not waste your time on this film. The only reason to ever watch \\"Primer\\" is if you are in the film or know someone who is in the film. Otherwise, you will not get it, and will have wasted your valuable time. And no scientific box that you made in your garage will be enough time travel to get your life back. Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 Yawns","review":"This movie has an interesting concept.

This movie belongs with the 90%. The screenplay of the movie The Big Sleep was written by William Faulkner. He admitted later that even he didn't know who committed one of the murders. That ignorance didn't detract from The Big Sleep being one of the film noir classics. But the writer, director, Jack-of-all-trades, master of none who put out Primer obviously doesn't have any better of idea of what was happening in his movie than most of his audience did.For certain audiences, the inability to understand a movie is an indicator that it is a great movie. I suppose that's possible, but it is far more likely that the movie is crud, not worth the 78 minutes it would take to watch it. Primer is not worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst time travel movie ever made","review":"This boring movie is totally drek. A complete waste of time. It is FAR worse than the time travel movie in one of those Mystery Science Theater 3000 sets.The extremely low budget of this movie is very apparent throughout. The film makes little sense, the acting is terrible, the wardrobe consists of the 2 dullard stars wearing the same shirt and tie throughout, no matter what the occasion.Almost the first half hour is a bunch of dull guys talking dull stuff in a kitchen!!! And the movie hardly improves from this!This movie won a prize? I can't believe it. Did people actually pay to see this in a theater?I would say to the movie's maker: Don't quit your day job!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it's total production budget..$7,000","review":"Arguably one of the top five worst Sci Fi films ever made.

If you have trouble falling asleep, you'll definitely want to buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I dare you to watch this film and not think about it later.","review":"Not only did I want to watch Primer again right after it was over, but I immediately had to watch the director's commentary followed by the cast and crew's commentary. I later went online to find reviews. Then I hunted down other people who have seen Primer so we could discuss it. Basically, this film inspired some slightly obsessive behavior-but in the best way possible. Mr. Carruth, your film got under my skin, ignited parts of my brain that felt dormant, and made me remember why I love experiencing (not simply watching) movies. Thanks for that.Oh, and you've got to love a film that features an original Weeble.Primer is required for any quality DVD collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"All of your brain is needed....","review":"This is a film in which ALL of your brain has to be used. It's really an interesting, intelligent, and thought provoking film. It was shot on practically no budget, but that doesn't detract from the film at all. In fact, I think it enhances it because there was no budget for special effects, which may have hurt the story. The intricate plot and intelligent execution of it make this film work. I generally dislike indie films, as they all fall into the same formula. They are either quirky, silly, or done for shock value. This is a real film done with a purpose other than being just a little bit different from Hollywood, but not too much. I'm glad this film got picked up for distribution. It's a remarkable piece of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"unsatisfying","review":"I didn't find it confusing, and I didn't find it too cerebral and I didn't find it over my head; I found it unbelievably tedious. A movie about time travel where almost nothing happens. Granted, having read SF for more than thirty years, I suppose I'm a bit jaded. There's nothing, after all, about the subject that Robert A. Heinlein didn't already do to perfection sixty years ago. 95% of the film consists of a couple of yuppies talking, yay. And they're not even particularly likeable yuppies. The acting is unimpressive at best. No offense intended to those who liked the movie or to the writer/director/ producer/actor Shane Carruth; I liked the idea of the movie, and what was accomplished on $7,000 budget was impressive, but I didn't find the movie enjoyable---and barely watchable after a point."},{"rating":"1","title":"77 minutes I'll never get back","review":"I love time travel stories/movies but this was awful.

Actually, they were so irritating at points I was hoping something terrible would happen to them.I thought this movie would get a lot more exciting. There was a build up to nothing.

It gives you a tremendous cross-reference to identify the images to the saints. For example, if you see a wheel in the painting, you can look it up in the index.

The movie tells the story of a bickering couple that wind up in a backwoods motel, where they are terrorized by sadistic men as their ordeal is caught on camera for others.The movie is painfully unoriginal, filled with tedious dialogue, and is riddled with plot holes. Michael Madsen, easily the best-known actors in the film, phones in his performance for an easy check. Jeff Fahey turns up the volume on his performance as one of the film's bad guys, but neither his performance nor Madsen's are enough to salvage the movie.Once in a while, I discover a hidden gem amongst low-budget horror flicks that go straight to video. Terror Trap is not one of them. It's not worth a rental, so I can't imagine why anyone would actually buy the DVD. If you're a diehard fan of Jeff Fahey, or wouldn't mind a Vacancy rip-off, it's worth a watch. Otherwise, renting it is a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"it keeps breaking!","review":"I got my Zire 71 as a Christmas Gift.

It still does this periodically and the screen does not respond just the buttons. After a few weeks of jumping from program to program and freezing it will work well for another month and then do the same. I will not buy another palm. PalmOne service is not good and takes forever to send and receive for repairs. I plan to only have this expensive ball and chain for a year. All the accessories are expensive but made cheap. I paid 25 bucks for a leather belt case from Palm for the Zire and the rivets holding the loop ripped within a month.

Routine PDA functions like calendaring, contacts, desktop synchronization and such are fine, and the screen is good.

Despite the fun with the camera (I'd email a photo, but I can't upload those either!) the Palm is essentially worthless. Even if I do get it to HotSync, it's been many hours on the phone with Tech Support and many more hours of aggrevation. How can Palm sell a product that can't work on XP? I've been a huge Palm Fan for years, but I may be back to pencil and paper from here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good handheld.... poor design","review":"The design flaw on this handheld could be the cause of the Zire 72. The Zire 71 has a little joystick to navigate. The issues is that when it is in the slim carrying case and in my purse, the joystick gets pushed and the handheld comes on and stays on. This has run my batter down so many times. When the battery is totally dead, you have to reboot which is kind of a pain and you have to reset some options. My advice is to HotSync often to save valuable information.Other than this flaw, I have loved my Zire 71. I have almost had it for a year.

I was happy with this, but now my second Zire 71 is 3 weeks old, and suddenly Froze, completely. I called Palm Support (they're all my familiar friends across the globe by now) and resetting in a variety of ways didn't work. I was told what to do (I should know in 5-6 hours if it works) but this entailed losing the data in the handheld and I hadn't Hot Sync'd in a few days. This time I bought a service contract, so I guess I'll just get a third new one since December, if this doesn't work. I generally have decent luck with these things, but I think my Zire 71 is jinxed.

Despite being panned by other reviews (and rightfully so because the picture is [bad]) the camera is well integrated into the system. It is good only for reference pictures much the way polaroids are. They are not good enough for snapshots unless if your standards are low, but it is fun.

It feels like a slipper and it looks nice enough to wear when I need to go out. My grandma loves hers as well. I would recommend this shoe to anyone that needs comfort and ease."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will not seat to toilet tank, and leaks around valve.","review":"Model includes two different gasket for the large nut connection to the toilet tank.

An excellent product if you want slow, accumulated water damage to your home."},{"rating":"1","title":"worth the rental cost just for the bad acting!","review":"This movie is hilarious. Pity that it isn't supposed to be. The acting-especially the police chief-is so terrible at times that it almost makes up for the rest of the \\"plot\\".Just a bad movie overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"PEPPERMINT PATSY SHE AIN'T","review":"Move over Glenn Close, here comes Patsy. Kensit is riveting and dynamic in her role as the really wacked out \\"Agnes\\" in this unusually graphic and tense movie. From the opening sequence in which the young Kensit is tortured and almost raped by a looney who thinks he's Jack the Ripper, the movie descends into the sheer depths of madness. Kensit reminds me both of a young Donna Mills or even more eerily a young, blond Barbara Steele. At any rate, she is one vicious woman.Amy Locane doesn't have the experience to really inflect anything in her role as the wife; Patrick Muldoon does well, but at times seems lost in daydreaming; and yes, Patrick Byrne as the detective is pretty awful.There are some great suspenseful scenes and the ending has a delicious little twist.RECOMMENDED"},{"rating":"2","title":"creepy movie with an awesome ending","review":"This is about a woman named Agnus who believes to be a reincarnation of Jack the Ripper's mistress, helping him commiting crimes. In the present day, Agnus thinks her pychiatrist is the reincarnation of Jack. The film making is very stylish and moody, especially the visuals of England in the 1800's (I thought they made this scenery better than From Hell). Without giving anymore away, I recomend this movie to anyone interested in Horror or Artistic films."},{"rating":"2","title":"good movie","review":"It was a good movie.

It steps in the footprints made by bands like Gamma Ray, Savatage, Allen/Lande and even Dream Theater. The music is decent, but not groundbreaking, which is why I give it 4 stars, not 5, even though I enjoy it greatly. The solos are great, the rhythm guitars are strong, and the drumming/bass is solid as a rock. The album is very well produced. However, the biggest reason I enjoy it so much is DC Cooper's vocals. He's one of the best (if not THE best) out there. His voice is just perfect for this style of music. If you're into melodic metal, I think you'd like this album a great deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leatherworking kit","review":"My son and I had a great time putting together the various items in the kit.

Taking the opposite approach from the other books that tell you what to do to maintain a healthy loving relationship, Ben goes through all of the most common things that people do to ruin a relationship, or even to keep out of a relationship at all. Everybody should be able to relate to this book in some way. I know I've been guilty of some of these behaviors, and I've certainly been a victim of some of them, too. If you want to learn a little more about how good relationships work without getting bogged down by some tedious psycho-babble nonsense, Ben's book is a very entertaining way to go about it. He even manages to squeeze in a nice little plug for Jimmy Kimmel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way under-powered","review":"Don't waste your money on this CD player. The volume is pre-set way too low. The music is very faint and if there is any ambient noise, such as in an airplane, train, or bus, you can hardly hear anything at all.

Some CD players are so loud that other people can hear the sound at the other end of the bus or train car despite the headphones, but even you won't be able to hear music on this model."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"This book has a reference manual style.

In fact, he was at Sensation two years ago. That shows you how good he really is. When I first listened to this song, I thought that \\"Back to Cali\\" meant back to California. Boy was I wrong! =P (You'll realize that Cali probably meant Calcutta, since the video was shot in India.) Anyway, back to the music. IMO, this song was very enjoyable to listen to. I'm a fan of Picotto but I occassionally find some of his songs hard to listen to. This song is just right. It mixes in some of the harder beats with some of the more softer and soothing tunes. Great job Mauro!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best album since Passages ...","review":"First of all, excuse me for the following english mistakes... For me, Frank Gambale is the best guitar player of the universe. His approach of speed picking is just the best technique I've ever known on a guitar. And 'Coming to Your Senses' prooves it again. There are good melodies, and the solos are simply great. And I must say something : he plays an Ibanez guitar, not a Yamaha ! So if you like good guitar with great technique, you'll enjoy this album. Once again, Thunder signed on !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Jazz Musician","review":"I have never really liked much Jazz, but as of hearing Frank Gambale's song 'The Italian Job' it totally changed my oppinion.

Just as the psedo-antiquarian lie was used to sell Bugnini's de novo Freemasonic fabrication, the Novus Ordo Missae, as a return to First Century liturgy, so too the lie that Vatican II merely refined perennial dogma is used to subvert the Faith. De fide Dogma cannot legitimately be \\"refined\\" into its diametric opposite.Visit your local Novus Ordo \\"worship center\\" and notice that the \\"presider\\" regales you with every error from Bl. Pius IX's Syllabus of Errors. The compiled papal documents reveal that the Novus Ordo apes the Pharisees in their defection, \\"...voiding the commandments of God for the traditions of men.\\" - Mark 7:9.

The standard pipe here is about 2mm thick and I had to go to a muffler shop to get it expanded. What happened was the pipe expanded about 1mm or less then the bolt snapped and the spreader popped out and ended up in the muffler, this took a bit to get out as I was assembling the exhaust and had to remove a section of pipe to get to the muffler in the exhaust tunnel. I would probably recommend getting a grade 8 or higher bolt and see if it works but I think the bolt it comes with is about a grade 3 bolt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't do it.","review":"This size was wrong, it was too big and it came apart, and the paint was annoying.

He wanted to do this sort of under the radar, with a cast of virtual unknowns, but due to its uniqueness, the movie quickly gained popularity and today is considered one of the best horror movies of all time. The cast are all household names now and the ending of this film is legendary. Twists, turns, paranoia, accusations, one liners, and good looking people is what Scream is all about. The story is a great one, the cast is solid, and when it comes to writer/directors, you can't get much better than Wes Craven.

You get a genuine sense for the time and place. The downfall, and it is quite a fall, is the wooden prose. I have never seen so many characters grimace. Tremayne uses the word \\"grimace\\" frequently, conspicously, and awkwardly. In addition, Sister Fidelma's character is one-dimensional. She isn't a medieval feminist from an enlightened society; she is just a grouch. If she isn't angry, she's irritated, impatient, insulted, or otherwsie bothered. Once in a while she is pleasant, but then she grimaces and your back to square one. The plot is crafted well enough, though the murderer wasn't hard to guess.

A better story and a better story-teller are needed, however. The characters are paper thin, unconvincing, umsympathethic. The plot becomes entangled in itself and looses coherence. Most distasteful to this reader is the homophobia that underlies the plot. There are two homosexual characters, both unattractively portrayed and, of course, both doomed. I tried this book because I enjoy medieval settings, but this is a series I'll skip.

Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting history, clunky writing","review":"The Sister Fidelma books are about a fascinating period in history, but Tremayne is one of the most excruciating and clunky writers I've ever had the misfortune to encounter. I spent one book counting the number of times he uses the word \\"grimaced\\" (approximately once every ten pages and often incorrectly: she grimaced bashfully). The guy's a knowledgeable historian but not a novelist. There's a LOT of repetition, not just within one book, but from one book to the next -- he just lifts chunks of text and transposes them, as if it's too much trouble to write something new. I've read the first handful of these books and then just gave up expecting him to improve as a writer. The introductions to the time period and conditions in Ireland are far more interesting than the stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Little Wordy","review":"For the most part, the story is well done.

Women \\"could and did, aspire to all offices and professions as the coequal with men.\\" This book is particularly valuable to us because it sends Fidelma in 644 to the famous monastery at Whitby in Northumbian England. Whitby is headed by a Hilda, a real mideval abbess who is featured in our unit The Garnet-Eyed Brooch.

I would have appreciated an estimated age range listed. Interesting story line for an older child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"A mindless, inane book. The story is dull.

Considering how many coming-of-age stories are published every year, it takes considerable talent to write one with as compelling a story as Faith's. The storytelling here is superb and the circus scenes made me want to run away and join one, too. I've already bought a copy for my sister and recommended it to my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting Voice","review":"Amanda Davis' book with it's haunting voice of the fat girl will keep you curled up on the couch wanting to read more. I think everybody has an inner voice whether it's the\\" fat girl\\", the \\"ugly girl\\" or the just plain \\"nobody\\" that haunts them sometime in their life. I think it's a shame to loose Amanda Davis, with all her potential, so soon. The circus backdrop with its colourful carnie folks and the way Miss Davis writes from the view point of a 15 year old girl really make you feel a part of the story. Its a coming of age story in an age of uncertainty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply amazing...","review":"I picked up this book because I was bored.

Life is about choices, and Faith didn't fail us there."},{"rating":"2","title":"We'll Miss Her","review":"I thought this was a lovely book and looked forward to more from Amanda Davis. Just read that she was killed in a plane crash with her parents on February 18th 2003."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stunning in its utter lack of insights","review":"What a forgettable waste of paper (and my time). There isn't one insight, one surprise, one bit of pathos between the two covers. And obvious? The book practically jumps out of your hands and conks you on the head with its lack of subtlety. If you're looking for an interesting, meaningful and riveting tale about a journey, try Life of Pi. (Or The Odyssey.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite books EVER","review":"I am astonished at the quality of Amanda Davis's prose. I'm overwhelmed by the at once harrowing and compelling story.

What I want to tell you is that you must buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of ideas!","review":"This book is especially good if you're just starting out in the medium of assemblage (sometimes referred to as \\"mixed media'). The author provides project examples and instructions for those who don't know where (or how) to begin.If you've done similar projects before, this book is still worth checking out for inspiration and examples of what other artists are doing. Great photographs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I should have taken the advice of the \\"mean\\" review. The photography is nice and it would be a good book to use with children, but beyond that I was not impressed with the projects. I'd want them around my house about as much as a macrame owl plant hanger. I do think the \\"Soldier's Prayer Shrine\\" is a nice idea given the current climate of our country. The \\"Ultimate RV Shrine\\" in the gallery is interesting and I would have appreciated directions for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was hoping for","review":"I bought this machine hoping to use it for a variety of chores.1. Chop vegetables like onions, peppers, etc for omelets and basic recipes.2. Grind coffee3. To make protein shakes and smoothies.When I try to chop vegetables it makes them into a soupy mess. When I try to simply pulse the machine it sticks or locks and instead of pulsing it purees and wont stop until I turn it a bit and unlock the mechanism. By the time I make the machine stop the vegetables are a mess and the machine smells like it is burning rubber if I unlock it too fast. This is because the gear keeps moving and rubs against the lid piece. I feel this could break within a week of use, but I wont find out because I am going to return it today. So I didnt bother to check out if if would grind coffee or make shakes, it already failed my first test."},{"rating":"1","title":"Max weight less than listed","review":"I bought a lightweight tripod with this head on it for hiking trips. It does a good job until I switch to my 100 mm macro lens; then it cannot hold the weight and slips slowly out of position, even though I torque it down as tight as I can. I weighed my camera with the macro lens, it weights 3 lbs, 1.5 oz. The specs say 3.5 lbs is the maximum load.

You have some extra space marine models or 2. you know how to use magnets.The box has 5 marine models but 9 heavy weapons!!! Well you will use one marine model to make a Sergeant so that leaves half of the heavy weapons you can use with the models provided. I think the best thing to do is buy a space marine Combat Squad box (5 tactical marines) for around 20-25 dollars and then outfit them with the remaining heavy weapons from the Devastators sprues. that way you can avoid the hassle of magnetizing these figures and just pick the models you want for your battle.One downside is that this set only comes with one missle launcher but two of each of the other weapons (plasma cannon, lascannon and heavy bolter).The extra heavy weapons is a nice bonus and the detail of the models is very nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Music Bad Sound","review":"I love Linda Perhacs voice and music.

I listen to my music with good Audio Technica headphones and its really quite distracting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something special","review":"This album is a breath of fresh air away from the current crop of talentless people in the charts and headlines. An intoxicating set of songs, beautifully sung and created with real attention to detail which we haven't heard since Joni Mitchell's Court and Spark or perhaps Judee Sill's Heart Food. Sometimes one gets the sense that certain substances had been consumed - particularly on listening to the opening Chimacum Rain, Linda intones 'I'm spacing out...' - but it's really on the title track Parallelograms where we hear something wonderfully otherworldly. But the entire album is a multi-faceted gem, well worth anyone's attention.

Granted, romance novels are generally churned out with similar plots, similar characters, etc... however; Heather Graham basically takes the characters from Rebel, renames them and then switches their loyalties. Basically, Risa is sweet and boring and Jerome is a weaker Ian. I wouldn't recommend this book. Pick up one of her Shannon Drake novels instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"too many repetitions","review":"This book has a nice begining (about 30 first pages out of about 300). What happens afterwards, seems a movement on a spiral. With a refren \\"you are a rebel; no, you are a rebel\\", all the sexual encounters of the heros consistenly occur in the same setting: close to water (ocean, lake - whatever). Plus several rather predictable splits and reconciliations. All in all it becomes a rather boring read. The historical setting is rather fresh (Florida, Civil War), however, it is described rather vaguely and not very believable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlikable Main Characters","review":"The \\"connection\\" between the hero and heroine of this book is disconcerting. Though their sexual encounters are told to be sizzling, all other behavior towards each other is consistently disrespectful and often intentionally hurtful. The author spends a considerable amount of time trying to convince the reader that Jerome and Risa are compassionate human beings, but they never display ANY kindness or tenderness towards each other. This is not my kind of love story."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've seen better.","review":"This is just another \\"kit\\" with very useless things in it. Honestly I only wanted the nail clippers and the brush/comb. I should have gone with a cuter set for a girl. I used the medication syringe for a med for my 4yo and it didn't even hold the medicine, it leaked out all over the place (no suction like a syringe should have). As a pediatric nurse I'd prefer a higher quality medication administration kit. Also the bulb syringe in this kit is small and won't be very useful. Use the one from the hospital if you deliver in one (we're having a homebirth and I ordered a hospital grade bulb syringe instead). This kit was a waste of money, in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"I bought this product for my daughter. I loved that it has so much in it. What I really wanted to use was the nail clippers. The clippers wouldn't cut my daughters nails at all. I went to use the medicine spoon, and it leaked.

Don't waste your money on this set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap","review":"Although the idea of having all of these handy items in a nice case is a good one, the items in the case are pretty cheap and the case takes up too much space unnecessarily.The bulb syringe doesn't suck anything and its very stiff. The thermometer takes forever to take the temperature and I am not convinced it does it accurately. The nail clippers were difficult to use on soft newborn nails, but now that our baby is 3 months old its a little easier to clip her nails with it.The comb and brush are not bad.As for the rest of the stuff in the kit, an opportunity to use them has not come up.As for the case, I recycled it.I would have rather gotten a good bulb syringe (which I am about to order) and a very good nail clipper like the Tweezerman brand (though they are quite expensive compared to this)."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The envelope please. . .\\"","review":"The winners--and except for one stinker these short films were all interesting, all excellent--were: \\"One Too Many\\" (over the short live film which won the Academy Award \\"West Bank\\") and \\"Maestro\\" (over the animated short which won the Academy Award \\"The Danish Poet\\").The best of the bonus shorts was \\"The Passenger\\" (over a number of short films that enchanted and one that revolted, the stinker, \\"Surviving the Rush\\".

I have burned many backup CD's and made my own personal mix, audio CD. I did all these without a flaw. The CD-ReWritable works great for all my quick backups that I won't need for a long period of time, just for a quick storage. The only thing wrong with this CD Burner is speed!

But when I tried to install the software that came with the drive, I ran into problems. The software will not complete installation on my Compaq Presario 5304. It unpacks some support files, and then just hangs there at the blue screen. The drive will read computer disks and audio CD's but if I try to write anything, it tells me I need to install the software. When I tell it to go ahead and install the software, it does the exact same thing, EVERY TIME, which is to unpack the support files and then hang there doing NOTHING. This has been a nightmare so far.

Specifically, one cannot write a customized volume label on the CD - It writes one for you. So your CD is labeled X56zsFSFD: (or something similar) when you open it in \\"my computer\\" (or explore it in the windows explorer).The worst part is the customer service! I educated quite a few HP technicians on what a volume label was. Every single one thought it was a sticky label that you paste on the front of the CD. It took about 1 zillion emails to HP \\"support\\" - each one with a different technician - to find out that their product just couldn't do the job.

Nouwen shows the need to forgive as well as the need to receive forgiveness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the book","review":"Very insightful thoughts from the author on one of the most important parables in the Gospels. While the author starts with telling us how his interpretation of Rembrandt's painting increased his insights into what Jesus was telling us and on struggles in his life, you will end up focusing more on your own journey with Christ and how each of us actually plays each of the 3 main characters in the parable at different times in our lives. My men's group has been using this as a basis of discussion for 3 months, and it's opened us up to new ways of thinking about the parable, ourselves and our mission in life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forgiveness","review":"This book is wonderful for people who feels the need for forgivness of God.

When we are drawn into this study of the Rembrant painting we find a darkness that leads us to an illumination of our own lives. In this book it is with great joy that we discover love and forgiveness as well as hope. This book is a must read for all Christians. In going to the place that I did not want to go I found the place that I needed to go. This is the best spiritual book that I have read in years. I wish we had published this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"From one Prodigal Son to a world full of others","review":"I read this book last winter, and must say that my life view has been altered.

It touches on parts of personality that are inherent in all people, which makes it relevant to all people.

This book is no different. He opens up about his own fears and where he feels he falls short of what God wants - and at times it feels like looking into a mirror and facing a part of yourself that you do not want to face but need to. He is blunt and open without pointing fingers.

So i started using the 2nd channel and then that went out about 8 months later. Keep in mind this has been sitting on my computer table the whole time in a non smoking environment. When i contacted Presonus i was told the price to repair would be $75 which in my opinion seems excessive when you consider the item was made in China.

I wish I would of read more about it online.."},{"rating":"1","title":"well......","review":"Where do I start? It can't be called a horror movie because nothing scary happens. It can't be called a slasher because even when a head gets cut off there is no blood. It's not a porn even though there are 3 sex scenes (1 of which has minimal nudity). The actors probably aren't good enough to act in a porn flick. The writing is horrible. For example, a 5 minute conversation takes place where every form of the word do, (do, did, does, don't didn't) is used about 10 times each. (did you do this, no i didn't do this, i don't do this stuff, who does this stuff, I don't know) i didn't exagurate that at all. At one point, the clown ambushes someone in the woods. He rips through a random wall of black construction paper in the middle of the woods. hmmm....big sheet of construction paper, plus woods, doesn't make sense. This would be 5 stars as a comedy.

The 'monster' in the movie is 300 lbs. of sweat and flab. He's barely in the movie. You get more scenes with the mask on the camera as the viewer looks out the eyeholes.Surprise twist ending?

One of the worst horror films ever! such a rip-off!","review":"I cannot believe how crappy this low budget horror film is! This movie also is such a SUPER rip off of Friday the 13th, I think they should sue! I mean come on! \\"Jason Voorhees\\"! \\"Trevor Moorehouse\\"! The people who thought this one up were totally retarded! DER!!! The film was only about 23% enjoyable, and the gore was not that scary. The ending did not make sense and the there was a huge plot hole! I mean...what? This movie is not even a good rental. If you just want to see every horror movie that comes out might as well rent this and see how dumb it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable","review":"My boyfriend and I rented this film mainly because of the cover. Neither of us had seen the first \\"Bloody Murder\\", but we figured that it wasn't necessary. What we got was a very predictable and almost laughable attempt at a horror movie. From what I've read in reviews about the first movie, this one is supposed to be much, much better. That's amazing to me because this one was terrible. The acting is absolutely horrible and the plot is very predictable. I and my boyfriend were able to figure out who the killer was a quarter of the way into the film. Don't get me wrong, if you're in the mood for one of those stereotypical slasher films, then this is perfect. There is gore and the obligatory nudity - everything that people have grown to love in these types of film.Overall, I would only suggest this movie if you're having a party or if you're in the mood for a good laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Direct to video garbage","review":"Don't waste your money. Katie Woodruff is cute but you'll hate yourself if you sit through this rubbish."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than part 1","review":"Well, if you have seen part one and hated it. Check this one out. I think even the directors thought part one was pretty bad. This one has almost the same storyline, but the acting is alot better (still not Emmy quality, by far) the gore is pretty up there (the opening killing scene was pretty gorey), lotts of blood, some full nudity, and the killer looks a tad bit more intimidating.On this one they actually tell you why Trevor is killing, who he is, etc. Part one had no indications who this guy was and why he was there... That for me took alot out of the movie.If you are a fan of slasher films, even if they are cheesey.. then watch this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than the first","review":"The first \\"Bloody Murder\\" movie was a pretty routine \\"Friday the 13th\\" retread. It wasn't that it was bad; it just lacked any real originality. \\"Bloody Murder 2\\" on the other hand, is a well crafted little horror film. The pacing is a big improvement over the first, which tended to drag along. This is a credit to the director(replacing original \\"Bloody Murder\\" director Ralph Portillo).Overall, it seems that a lot of effort was put into making this a quality horror film that can stand alone rather than just a by-the-numbers sequel. Don't be put off by the derivative cover art. \\"Bloody Murder 2\\" is a solid chiller with enough plot twists to keep it fresh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even Funnier than the first!","review":"This is so funny, and it is bloody, so get out there and have a good laugh.

I can't compare it to the first Bloody Murder, because I didn't see it. This movie is about a group of teens closing Camp Placid Pines. Right about they play a hide and go seek game called, 'Bloody Murder,' the murdering begins. The killer doesn't have a hockey mask in the movie like it did on a cover, it was like a Michael Myer's mask with out the hair. The deaths scenes were kind of stupid, the acting, well I guess it was okay, but it had no ending! Not even a twist ending! Watching people get killed is obviously the point of the movie. It's not even worth a rent either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid storyline, actors looked too old and the naked girl","review":"This movie was stupid.

In BLOODY MURDER 2, Tiffany plays the wild Angela, a slutty gal w/ a heart of gold. While not the central female character, Angela is the most interesting of the bunch. BM2 is a decent film anyway, w/ its masked murderer and ample supply of knife-fodder.

Christian metal ensemble had so may releases out.The eleven cuts here seem to have plenty of well played guitar riffs.Haven't heard that many 'metal' bands like this one.Tracks that make this disc worth repeated plays are \\"Drinking From The Poisoned Well\\",\\"Servant Of The Bones\\",\\"Martyr's Pose\\" and \\"Immunity Vector\\".Basically,just good thinking man's metal.You know,a band with something to say.Line-up:Luke Easter-vocals,Aaron Guerra-guitar,bass&vocals,Cameron Stone-cello,Jennifer Hall-flute and Ted Kirkpatrick-drums.Might possibly appeal to fans of Fates Warning,Nuclear Assault,Leatherwolf and Crimson Glory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tourniquet's best album since \\"Pathogenic...\\"","review":"This album is by far the best album of the Luke Easter era for this band. The album is very steeped in classical music, with organ, cello and flute featured in places. It returns to the style of \\"Pathogenic\\", their best album. There are some songs that miss, but on the whole, this album is very good. Ted Kirkpatrick's drumming is sensational as always, with Aaron Guerra doing mighty fine on guitar. Luke's singing seems stylistically out of place at times, but he does very well on the sections that emphasize the metal. This is a recommended album for those who are into Metallica, Anthrax, etc.--and even those Dream Theatre fans out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"tourniquet sees things two different ways","review":"if slayer ever copped a positive attitude, you'd have the idea of what tourniquet sounds like. the lead singer one minute sounds like tom araya of slayer, then the next minute, he sounds like dave mustaine of megadeth. tourniquet is a very cool and interesting band."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best heavy metal CD I've ever heard yet!","review":"I first heard this CD at a friend's house and didn't know Tourniquet was Christian. I was a little skeptical at first because of all the screaming, but I got used to it and bought it a couple of weeks ago. THIS IS THE SWEETEST CD EVER. I really enjoy it. If you like rock or heavy metal, you should get it. OK, so they scream alot and endlessly bang out chords (the first two songs drone on for seven minutes) but so what? Kirkpatrick is a superb drummer and Guerra really belts out that guitar. And Easter has a really diverse voice that can be raucous or can be almost harmonious. Frankly, I've not had alot to really listen to seeing how much of Chrsitian rock well...just isn't the vibrant stuff I loved from the 80's and early 90's such as Petra or White Heart. This band as well as P.O.D. makes up for all of it! I especially love the songs like SERVANT OF THE BONES, ERRATIC PALPITATIONS, and 90% of the rest.

If you want to just use this as a portable tool and don't mind manually adding what is not there, this is great; just like using a PDA.

Lastly, there probably is less to throw away overall; but, the ink holder, the tools and the box itself likely add up to as much waste as the original cartridge.

Also, people eat really fatty foods when they come to the carnival and that makes my job so very difficult. You may enjoy this book, but if you have friends who are real carnies, tell them they are better off spending their money at their own carnival and winning a goldfish that will die within a week.

When I first discovered Bobby Susser, his songs, vocalists, and musical approaches to subject matters important for children, I thought I found a treasure. I feel that way about all his CDs, records, and tapes. But, having this one feels like a privelege. He takes you through the seasons with his songs and you and your children feel the pleasant journey. Fall, Winter, Spring, and Summer feel present as the songs are played and the children sing along. From the first,\\"Cool Cool Cool\\", to the last \\"Fireflies\\", nothing is spared for your children to experience the feelings of the seasons.

When I read about the beach, it was, as if, I was standing right there on the beach. It was the same with every scene of every page, I was there. I felt Karen's fear of the shark, her struggle to believe in herself, everything she felt I felt. The same with Vogarr, Captain Richard's, and Admiral Stefan.

The outer flap is secured by velcro closure. There is a white patch on the back where you can use a fine-point Sharpie to write stuff. When closed, there is still a large enough gap at the top to allow dust, liquids, bugs, and other stuff to enter. Also, the bottom 4 corners are not perfectly sealed, so don't set your box down in a puddle of soda thinking the cards inside will be safe. Overall though, a nice product that I plan to buy again as needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good case if you dont want an album","review":"My son has a couple of these cases for his yu-gi-oh cards and they are much more functional for his age (8yrold) than an album.

When I think of all the indigenous people who died and my ancestors, Africans, who were enslaved, I can't get excited about the \\"adventurers\\" who played a role in causing these two tragedies.There is a universal theme in this work, knickers aside.

Cool design, and easy to install and use software. Music capacity is defintely skimpy, however. MP3 format takes up much more memory than WMA format, so it helps to search for music in WMA format. Even more helpful would be the upgrade, and frankly they should make it with the higher memory to start. Out of the box I would say the memory capacity can sometimes be closer to 30 minutes than 60 minutes. Biggest problem: after only a couple of weeks of using it, it died. No warning, it wasn't dropped. Everything appears to be fine except that no sound comes out of it.

They were very unhelpful and ran me around the bush when it came to getting a fix for the bug \\"it will be out in a day or two\\" (two weeks later still no fix).I tired then to return the product to Best Buy but since they have a very poor 30 day return policy were unwilling to help me out (i returned it 5 days over their 30 day agreement) I even showed them pages and pages of email between myself and Diamond. Needless to say do not shop at Best Buy beacuse they are unwilling to do that little extra for the customer.On a positive note, Diamond was willing to refund the purchase price of my unit without any problems. Maybe Best Buy should learn from them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for audio books!","review":"I use the rio 600 to listen to audio books that I download from audible.com. It works well for this purpose. My main complaint is that I can't get the volume loud enough for situations where there is a lot of fairly loud background noise (e.g. traffic on a busy street)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its Great!","review":"Its great, I also take it everywhere with me, its lightweight, small, stylish and does not jump. The quality of the music is exellent. I have been able to get the rio 600 to hold at least 18 songs each lasting around 3.5 minuets long. Its great I really recomend everyone to buy one its worth it and it is suitable for all ages. As soon as you buy it, put a battery in it, and listen to it, there is a commentary running to tell you how to use the rio 600, I found that this was really helpful.I hope you enjoy your Rio 600.Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Software and Customer support","review":"I wish I could tell you how this product performs. Unfortunately the software, real Jukebox that comes with it or the Windows Media player intermittingly does not recognize the device. It took me several hours to figure out how to load songs onto the device. The Real Jukebox software is very intrusive, loading many things onto your computer. When I tried updating the software, it would only give me a 14-day trial to the new software and asked me for a credit card. I am a literate computer user and fond this device to be very difficult to load songs. Customer support give you the wrong email address and cannot forward you email to the proper division."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Good","review":"I think that the Rio 600 is really good. Umm, I'm using the 64 MB backpack right now. I love the rechargable battery thing. It only takes like 10 minutes for it to be finished. I really like the light on the LCD screen. I can see it when I'm in bed. I really like the shape and color it's \\"snazzy!\\" There are two small things that I don't like about the Rio 600: it runs out of batteries kind of fast (so just carry extra), and the search buttons are a little bit hard to use. Other than those two things it's a really great MP3 player at a really great price too! Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice, but reliability problems","review":"I had a problem from the day I bought it, when the battery gets to about 60% power, the player would restart when pressing the play button. Happens every time when this situation exists. I have sent a couple of e-mails to the company asking how I can get the player fixed, but no reply yet after about a week. I am quite unhappy because of the product being defective out of the box.Not counting the reliability problems, it seems like a nice player, but 32meg is not enough. I cannot put one album on the player at higher quality levels."},{"rating":"1","title":"spend more, get more","review":"POS. Pause is a joke with this thing. 75 percent of the time pausing just gets you back to the beginning of the file. Also once the battery is down to 50 percent it just shuts off.I notice the used price keeps dropping. Once it gets to \\"free\\" I might suggest it as something good for throwning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Man this is total GARBAGE","review":"When purchasing an mp3 player there are many things to think about, such as, price, size, memory, sound, etc. When i asked my parents for an mp3 player for Christmas i expected a high quality futuristic piece of machinery. Diamond should really make a recall on this product - scratch that they should never have released it. When i opened it i knew it would have problems, i have a spider like sense. Anyway, the DIAMOND RIO 600, iss garbage, its ugly, the software has constant errors, the usb cable/mp3 transmitter is total crap, again error messages are constant, so i was never able to rip a song onto the rio 600. However, the sound is quite nice, but thats if you want to listen to the intro and some nasty songs over and over again, because you'll never get the transmitting process to take place. Overall its a 1, because it practically ruined my Christmas and its a P.O.S if you will, in fact, im taking it back tommorow. My suggestion: DONT BUY IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Premature Termination of Tracks","review":"At least two other reviewers here have posted about the problem of some Rio 600 units abrupting ending the play of a track before reaching the tend. Despite these warnings, and consoled by the large number of positive reviews, I took the chance and bought a unit from the local store of a large national clicks and mortar electronics chain. Sure enough, my unit exhibited the same behavior; of the three MP3 tracks I tested, ranging from six to eighteen minutes, all would end after less than a third of the track had been played. A repeat download of one MP3 did work, so the problem seems sporadic. Despite a nice design, the execution is flawed. Who wants a well-designed can opener that opens a can only part way? I returned the unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"satisfied but","review":"I like it a lot, it dos not bother me that it only holds 6 to 8 snngs , but i cant seam to get any length of play time out of my batteries if i let it sit for a few days without use the battery goes dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Digital Music Fan in Beantown","review":"WMA's play fine on computer but have skip like noises when transferred...MP3's over 2 minutes never finish, will go right into the next song unexpectedly.Nice package...bad product."},{"rating":"1","title":"The third time's the charm?","review":"My pre-teen son saved his money for quite some time to be able to buy himself an MP-3 player. He bought an open box Rio 600 the first time,(saved $25) and it never worked for more than 1 hour. There was either no sound or alot of crackling/popping sounds. Thinking that it was due to the open box or the headphones, we returned it and were able to exchange it for a new Rio 600 (and he bought new headphones). This one had the identical problems as well as a great deal of trouble turning off and on. Once again, we returned it. We decided that this couldn't possibly happen again, and tried one last time. Although, the power switch seemed lose,it worked for about a month, then the switch completely broke (you can hear the plastic rattling around inside). Tech support has been NO help at all, and my son has learned an important but expensive lesson...stick with a company which will support its products (not Sonicblue)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flawed Design - Beware!","review":"I've been through three of these little suckers in six weeks! All broke in exactly the same way: the on/off switch drops out, and eventually the unit won't power up.

I have still not been able to register the device to unlock its software to allow me to continue making MP3 files from CD. There is no documentation that comes with it, there is virtually no on-line documentation, and there is no technical support. I have gotten three on-line responses so far from people who obviously did not even read my question and problem. The device seems to be working ok so far, but the software to use it and the technical support are garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just got one...","review":"I just bought one of these at a local electronics store. I can't say for the device (since it hasn't worked, yet), but the software is trash. If you get one you should know that you will:a) have to register it with the manufacturer with unique ID codes and your email before it will run. (before that, it will just crash anytime you try to send data to the device. But, SURPRISE, once you register it, it works perfectly! Or, at least, it starts working at all...)b) pay them a monthly fee to use the software. You are allowed a free mode, disabling several features, including storing data on CD's, but to use the rest of the features, you have to pay a monthly [fee]...P>Just keep these things in mind, when you're considering the low upfront price of this device."},{"rating":"1","title":"FLAWED...buy something else","review":"I am waiting for my third Rio 600 replacement...the first one broke within a few weeks (the on/off switch broke). They did replace it fairly fast. About another month later, the sound stopped working...all I hear is static-exactly like another reviewer here described. After 3 emails, I am still waiting for them to send me a confirmation to send it in AGAIN for a replacement. IMO, they need to correct the bugs in these things before they release them on the market.When it works, it's good and is a convenient way to carry a handful of tunes for a ride on the subway...too bad it has been broken more than it has been working!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I HAD THE SAME PROBLEM!","review":"I AM NOW ON MY SECOND RIO600 IN JUST 3 MONTHS - AFTER BEING CHARGED $30 TO HAVE THE FIRST ONE REPLACED BECAUSE THE SOUND WENT OUT ON ME.

I WOULD DEFINITELY FIND ANOTHER PLAYER - THIS IS A WASTE OF MONEY."},{"rating":"1","title":"they have been better","review":"About a month ago, I purchased a Dimond Rio 600 mp3 player. At first, I was very excited about this product, because it is compact, lightweight and sporty. But after using this product I have found several flouts, one thing is the material the manufactures have chosen to use, it might be lightweight but it's too soft to maintain its structure. Sometimes the player would turn off by it self because the battery would separate and loss connection. Also the Rio 600 does not use flash media cards, instead it uses a memory back pack which is not currently sold in stores, and since the only way to upgrade your rio is to buy the back pack from Riohome.com, Rio have managed a system that doesn't allow any competitors to create a similar product which allow them to push up the prices for this memory pack. Currently Rio is developing a new Rio 800, which I hope is better than the 600."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most horrible thing I ever bought","review":"This was a horrible and udderly usless piece of junk. When I first got mine (the first one i got) it worked for about 3 days. Then it just stopped working and i just heard static when i wanted the song to play. Along with that, the software didn't work (i have a PC). I tried countless times to upgrade on its site, called costumer support(which was very inconsiderate and didn't care if it got fixed or not), and did everything possible to fix it. Then I got another one, thinking this one was just a bad one. I was wrong. Same problems with the software, and it worked for 5 days, then i just got static again.All in all, don't buy this one and get an archos or something (archos work very well.)even if it is a little more money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unless you love headaches, go look at another MP3 player","review":"One word sums up this player: unreliable. It is very temperamental. Some days it'll work fine, while others it will just turn off by itself with no provocation. It's not funny when you are in the middle of a song, then having to turn the switch to off and then backs to on, then pressing the fwd button until you reach the point you want. I've only had one problem with a song not downloading properly, so it's not a major problem with my unit. A battery will last a good day, two to three with moderate playtime. However, Rio could've found a better place to put the battery. Every time I replace the battery, I'm afraid of breaking the golden pins on the battery side of the unit. Overall, if you want a really good investment for your dollar, don't buy this product. Go look somewhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"so far 2 rio600's both trash","review":"My first rio600 waas improperly put together...

I sent them a support email from their webpage, but no answer so far...So far this product looks like a rush job to fill the super-low-end market.Others seem to like it, so maybe I've just been unlucky.

It was very simple to transfer songs from the computer to the device. The only major problem(or so I thought)was that it used up a lot of AA batteries in one week. After about 3 months, I was no longer able to add songs to the Rio library, therefore making it so I could no longer listen to newly downloaded songs, only old ones. I could still transfer songs that I had downloaded before though. About a month later, I was unable to transfer any songs to the device. It said on my computer screen that the songs were being transferred, yet they failed to find their way to my player. Now, the mp3 player won't even turn on. I've tried putting in new batteries, but nothing will get it to turn back on.

I did not mind getting only 32MB because I was lured by Diamond's promise of 340MB backpack. Rio 600 is small and stylish and 372MB of memory would make it an ultimate player. However, five months past and Diamond still has not released any of backpacks 32MB, 64MB or 340MB. Later it became clear to me that Diamond abandoned 340MB backpack.Software program for is adequate but it might take time for users to get used to it. File transfer was fast and reliable using USB connection .My unit functioned flawlessly but I need more than 32MB. I sold Rio 600 last month on auction.If your are in market for MP3 player I strongly discourage you from buying Rio 600 or Rio 800. Personally I am going to take look at Iomega HipZip and Nomad N-64"},{"rating":"1","title":"Still is vaporware","review":"Despite being on the market for many months, the add ons that are supposed to make this a truly useful machine are still not available. There is no memory add on: with decent quality mp3's you will have less than 30 min play time. There is no fm tuner. The machine is very fragile and the parts come apart with any rough handling. Rio continues to show hostile disregard for its clientele.Avoid this turkey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some bad units out there","review":"I purchased a Rio 600 at CompUSA and returned it a week later.

The power switch which controls on/off/hold functions fell out almost every time i used it, and if you have seen this mp3 player you know that the switch is pretty small. So after i took off the backpack and opened up the mp3 player i had to get out my tweezers and carefully place the switch plate back on to the actual switch that is about the size of a pinhead. Not Very fun since music is my life and i bring my mp3 or Cd player every where i go.

My only real criticism is the skimpy 32MB and the use of non standard memory for upgrades.But.....In three tries, I could not get one that functioned properly.

They informed me they would send a new rio, 2nd day air, but it took over 2 weeks to arrive. The worst part was the fact that the \\"new one\\" was actually a Referbished one that was even worse. From the first time that I used the rio it began to freeze, infact the only way to remedy the situation, was to remove the power supply. Once again I emailed customer service and requested either a refund or a non-referbished replacement. The only response that I got was that they would try and send me another referbished replacement.

The Rio 600 also supports WMA files which is a nice addition to an MP3 player. My ONLY complaints about this player is that 1. Some of the buttons and the switch on top feel kind of cheap and 2. I'm afraid that I might break the little guy. It actually would be pretty hard to break but I still like to be very careful with it :) The backlit LCD is nice and bright.

It could not have added much to the manufacturing cost, I don't think, except maybe dip their profit margin a fraction. The other reservation I have is the curvy body. I like my electronics hard and straight and this design is a little too fruity for me (Stupid Apple Computer!). Also there are some annoying quirks.

'there there' truly has a demo-ish sound to it, with one fuzzy guitar to the left, and quieter scratch vocals with harmonies. the percussion was in place early on for this song, and is nice enough. in sum, their b-sides are still better than most people's a-sides, but these rank as some of their thinner efforts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of scatter, no brain","review":"The b-sides on part 2 are slightly better than part one, but still not worth shelling out the cash for. The Scatterbrained remix is pretty good and fits well with the track, but it's nothing special. \\"I Will\\" has the full band backing and some alternate vocals, and is maybe the best of the 4 \\"2+2\\" b-sides, but remember that there's a reason they used the other version on the LP -- it's better. So buy this if you must, otherwise stay away.And can someone tell me why the greedy record companies can't just release all the tracks on one darn CD? This is getting out of control."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately, these are not good single...","review":"The latest two single of Radiohead are not like the other ones.

So this duet of single doesn't worth it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"just a response to the other review","review":"Yeah the problem with them releasing the tracks on one cd is that In Britain, the equivalent to Billboard (i forget what its called) has guidelines for a single that says if its more than 3 songs long or 20 minutes long, then it's declared not a single, but an album. For obvious reasons, radiohead doesn't want to release an ep every month."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, enlightening, poignant, entertaining...","review":"This is a great book!

The Judy character is well cast, and the story is pretty fun. But for some reason they cast a boy with a speech impediment as Stink. I think we've read all the books, and there is no mention of speech problems. I can't figure out why the film makers would have wanted to add this; it makes it hard to watch.

I can put a brand new disk in there and it will skip. I put the same disk in my cheap portable or my car changer and there's no problem. A disk has to be completly perfect for this player.

Chalk up another cool and groovy track from Ms. Halliwell!Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps - I like this track. Geri's cute chuckles at the end are just precious. In spite of that, the song does tend to not be very original. Don't get me wrong, I like it, but I wish it was more dancey. I was expecting it to be like Samantha Fox's version, but alas, it's cute and fun and all Geri!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Ode to Girl Powder","review":"As popular as remixes are becoming, it is the rare B-sides that attract many would-be buyers and fans of Geri Halliwell have waited patiently for more of those B-sides.\\"Bag It Up\\" Part I is no exception. Containing Miss Halliwell's latest #1 smash (original album cut) this CD contains, \\"These Boots Are Made For Walking\\" and \\"Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps.\\" Also included is the video of Bag it Up which you can play on your computer.The extra songs contained here are worth the purchase of this single. She takes us back to the 60s with funky beats and tamborine shakes. These Boots sounds like an unreleased track from the Austin Powers Soundtrack. Even Doris Day would have to agree Geri's take on her classic is all in Geri style, a feat that no one could duplicate.Although not widely available in US record stores, Part I can be found at many an auction house.

However, for just a few dollars more for the domestic pressing of the entire album you'll get more highlights than you will here. 'These Boots Are Made For Walking', an unoriginal choice for a cover, is featured here in an out-dated, stiff production; 'Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps' simply demonstrates Halliwell's straightjacket vocal limitations as much as the latter mentioned does her flatness.

It seems the editors should have been more demanding instead of, apparently, simply accepting uncritically was was submitted to them.In addition, there are several factual mistakes that were not corrected. For instance,the Seventh United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention was held in 1985, not 1983 (pag. 17).

Too bad, because the material contained therein is of great importance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overall Pretty Poor Stuff","review":"This really isn't any good. The story itself had possibilities, but the book falls prey to two major problems: Levinson doesn't write very well, and he doesn't know what he's talking about.The first problem might be overlooked by science fiction fans of the old school, who don't place terribly high importance on literary style. Levinson's awkward prose and unconvincing dialogue are not particularly bad by space-opera standards.However, the science in this novel is simply ridiculous. In attempting to use the language and concepts of quantum physics, Mr. Levinson is obviously living far beyond his intellectual means.Furthermore, I am assured by Native American friends that the \\"Iroquois\\" material is even more wildly wrong than the alleged science.

In fact the ending was the biggest disappointment -- it is definitely a cheat -- almost as bad as one of those \\"it was all a dream\\" things.They tell me the writer is a college professor; perhaps that's why the book is as dry as it is.

I'll try not to spoil the book with details, but the science is weak at best and the attempt to get metaphysical seems like a feel-good way to overcome a lack of knowledge of basic physics. For example the so-called \\"boomerang effect\\" is nothing new for space travel -- Jules Verne predicted it! -- but is presented as something far out. Dr. Levinson's background in media and internet (check his amazon list!)turn the book's \\"hero\\" into a kind of wishful thinking \\"Mary Sue\\".

I enjoy fantasy mixed in with my science fiction. I completely lost it when he said:1) Making a return trip will cost twice as much fuel as a one way trip.(try many times)2) Tea brewed at 0.78G is so much better than tea at 1G because of the different pressure. (how much water in the cup has a much bigger impact on pressure)This part wasn't supposed to be fantasy. I have no problem with rudders on space ships in Stanislaw Lem. I have no problem with elves and return of the dead in Peter Hamilton. I can't deal with stuff that's supposed to be physics that isn't. Why couldn't he have asked someone to proofread his book?The story telling and language wasn't grabbing me either. I found the dialog implausible. I didn't finish. I finish about 100 books/year, so this was unusual for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring and pointless","review":"The only reason I finished this book was because I was confined in a car for sixteen hours with nothing else to read.

It is a non-Nokia part and will no easily interface with the Nokia software. It uses a different chipset than the Nokia data interface cable, which prevents it from using the standard Nokia drivers. You may be able to get it working, but I have spent about four hours and have not met with success. I installed the drivers provided. I installed Nokia's drivers. I even installed the PL-2303 serial driver, but I could not make it work.Also note that this cable is a serial interface. If converts the USB connection to your computer into a serial port, so you will likely not be happy with the data transfer speed.I would recommend against this purchase.

Embouchure, posture, the parts of the horn, the history of the horn, reeds, fingering, you name it and it's in this book. It's surprisingly in depth on every front, even having a section on the altissimo register. This really is among the must haves of any saxophone player's library.Having said that, this is in no way the ONLY book you should have. While it contains warm up exercises, actually buying a decent scale/chord study book should be a high priority. Also, if you're serious about learning the 3rd and 4th octaves, you need to buy a good high register book.Ultimately, for me at least, this book comes down to more of an encyclopedia as opposed to a bible. It can take you really far, but you're eventually going to need to buckle down with specialty resources."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-have book for saxophonists","review":"Great book!I just started learning to play the sax, and this book has given mean invaluable insight into the instrument and how to play it.I recommend it to anyone starting to play the saxophone, but the information is valuable even for established and professional players."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"I didn't find this book usefull at all.

Some new material, please?","review":"Mr. Stein is nearly always witty and often imparts useful advice. But this offering is well below his usual standard. Actually, the contents were provocative when they first appeared several years ago. But they've become as stale as week-old bread in the ensuing time period. In fact, one might argue that Ben had a lot of crust releasing this slice of white bread. That he was, in fact, loafing -- when he should have risen to the occasion. But that would be too much of a pan. So I'll just describe this book as half-baked and advise would-be purchasers to avoid this collection of crumbs and await a new confection from Baker Ben."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ben Stein you let me down","review":"Very disappointed.

There was a place in the book, however, where I felt like a page had been left out as it jumped from one subject to another with no connection.

There are many variations on that theme (the unrecognized genius, the failed genius, the temporarily failed but ultimately triumphant genius, the evil genius, the genius who doesn't recognize his/her true talent until given proper encouragement, etc.). However, reading about geniuses can eventually become tiresome.The striking thing about this book is that the main character is perfectly ordinary. Of course, there are lots of novels about ordinary people, but very few about ordinary _mathematicians_, and that subject matter gives this book a peculiar charm. It's rather well written, too.Overall, I'd say it's not a masterpiece, but well worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that interesting","review":"I am sorry to say, I didn't like this book. The story is about a mediocre mathematician, struggling in his career, who thought he got a proof to the Wild Number Theorem. However it was flawed. But there is this eccentric old-age student of his who declares that the mathematician stole his proof. The story is not that attractive. Compared to this Uncle Petros and Goldbach's Conjecture is far more attractive - in narrative, in thrill, and in mathematics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Difficult, but well worth it","review":"Toby Olson's novel is complex, and its details may seem tedious to undisciplined readers. However, for those willing to give their full attention to Olson's prose, you will be rewarded fascinating insights, rich characters, good humor, and most important the golf scene, which is easily the greatest description of the game of golf in American literature, and rises to the highest levels of prose American writers have written. Yes, the scene's that good - but you'll have to work for it. Oh yes - the book takes a funny turn toward the end, so stick with it. Overall, quite wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Novel about the end of westward expansion and Golf","review":"Golf and native americans and returning home and moving east are the themes here a great novel that ends on Cape Cod after starting somewhere out west on a golf course..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably the most influencial book I've read","review":"Having grown up reading all the Tarzan books, the Chronicles of Narnia, Lord of the Rings, Dune and any other fantastical book I could get my hands on, when I read this book in college over ten years ago, it was like when I had discovered Bob Dylan in music or Gerhard Richter in Art for me. It was the perfect book that bridged the gap between what was always thrown to me as serious literature and the adventure and mysterious spirituality of the faerie lands I always imagined. This is the most beautiful book I've read among thousands and even though it's now been a few years since I last read it, it is still one I treasure and think back to as I read the modern fantasy masters like Neil Gaiman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much plot but some nice lyrics","review":"I was shocked to see that the few reviews for this story were so positive. Not much happens in this story that could have aptly been called _A Walk Through Fairyland\\". There is no main 'objective' just the main character (the only character) wandering around meeting people or fairy creatures in a very linear fashion. The ending really didn't have much of a conclusion and the extremely liberal use of quotes was distracting from the story.It would have been much better if the prose was dropped and the songs were just collected. If you like no action, no character development and overwritten description give this book a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"7 out of 10","review":"Phantastes is a small, yet complex book. I enjoyed this book even though I often felt compelled to put it down. I do not agree completely with Lewis when he says that McDonald's writing style is not his strength. Although the prose is sometimes rough or overly drawn-out in places, I cannot imagine this book being written any other way. Also, this book contains passages that convey great beauty. I recommend this book to all who have finally grown old enough to love fairy tales again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A difficult, but worthwhile read","review":"After reading \\"Surprised by Joy\\" by C.S. Lewis and learning of his life changing experience with this book I decided to give it a try. I read the introduction, by Lewis, in which he states plainly that MacDonald's talent lies not in his writing style, but in his story telling ability. As I read through this novel, it became clear to me how true this statement is. I found the main difficulty in reading this book penetrating through the seemlingly average writing to the excellent imagery and story. MacDonald is a romantic author and those who like this style of writing will enjoy this book while Grisham and Clancy fans may find it slow and boring. If you thrive in a book filled with imagery and emotion, but not much action, this book would be an excellent choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"phantastic","review":"Awesome book! I understand why even C. S. Lewis considered Macdonald a genius with words.As Macdonald draws wonderful pictures with words in the reader's head, I dislike the illustration on the front. But no biggie.Also, something I may be targeted for termination by Amazon for saying, this book IS freely available online on sites like project gutenberg."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvelous Book","review":"This is my first MacDonald book and it is truly a gem. Some of its stories will be memorable for years to come. It was a bit difficult at times to follow given the older writing style (written in 1858). One should not give up but trod on, because \\"great good is coming.\\" What is probably the most striking thing about this book is the absolutely beautiful use of the English language. Though many credit MacDonald with writing with a Christian bent, I actually felt Phantastes as having a strong pagan/heathen undertone. This, in fact, make more sense given the \\"age of spiritual discovery\\" which began in mid/late 19thC."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good but some typos","review":"I would agree with the others that the approach of this book is exactly what I was looking for. Too many of the other books spend hundreds of pages on very elementary descriptions of how Access is used. This books skips right to the programming. However, I am only on page 48 of the book and have found two typos (page 48 and page 45) in the example code Barker uses that would render the examples unworkable. The CD ROM versions of this code appear to be correct, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the experienced Access/VB Programmer only!","review":"This book taught me how to do a lot, but also left me puzzeled on the very advanced stuff. On some things it tended leave out a step and seemed to just assume I knew what to do. But over all I did learn a lot. Whoever can master this book really will be a master of Access."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly disappointing!","review":"I gave up on this book after going through the first 6 chapters. The writing style is terrible. The book is not designed to teach rather dumps out information in a disorganized fashion.You could go through this book, cover to cover, and still be unable to handle a simple Access project.

Similar to Feinberg's collection, but I think he says more with laughter and tears than Feinberg did with anger. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Panoramic Survey","review":"Eakin certainly provides an in-depth, panoramic survey of Brazil that is quite interesting. As to \\"Brazil being the country of the future,\\" that's really a tired old cliche. Brazil is what it is, and it's not a world power. As far as Eakin's book goes, it covers most everything except for the very important category of music -- for that I would recommend \\"The Brazilian Sound\\" (Temple University Press)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads like a collection of disparate essays","review":"While it was informative, overall the book was more like a collection of different essays rather than a coherent and well edited whole.

That makes it hard to stay awake. There is not a lot of meat. You could not use it for a reference, too much filler and makes the assumption of no particular expertise by the reader. It leads the reader in the exercises and the accompanying CD to believe that the test is about memorization of fine details that would take years to memorize. I have taken a half dozen certifications, they are not about memorizing details. I do not expect to take the certification exam after plodding through this book. This book is pretty much the way other Microsoft Press books are written, some may be happy with that, but I find they kill my interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"a hidious waste of time if you are studying for the exam","review":"I bought this book to study for the exam.

The book gives no such information nor insight. a complete waste of time as an exam preperation tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"nowhere near enough","review":"Supplemental material is absolutely required. The book provides relatively scant information on what appear to be the most heavily weighted exam areas. The exercises don't really prepare you for the exam since the exam questions focus on abstract/theoretical concepts as opposed to practical application in realistic scenarios. The study test questions are a pretty good inidcator of the difficulty of the questions on the exam, but there are at least a few errors; one of the more glaring ones tells you one thing in the pre-question objectives section, another thing in what is supposedly the correct answer to the question, and then BOL completely contradicts both of those.

A lot of people have criticised this book for its lack of more sophisticated material. Putting that aside, the book is very poor on the things it does cover.This book is written in a very confusing style. There is no didactic elegance and it is hard to acquire a clear understanding of the subject matter. The writers seem to assume that their readers have no understanding of statistics.

At first it was okay, but recently it started dropping the connection more often than not. After resetting it, updating the firmware, buying the high gain antennas for it, I broke down and I bought the D-Link DGL-4300. It is fast, reliable with a solid signal. Sure it's a little more expensive than other non-N routers, but it's a great device."},{"rating":"2","title":"This saved me From KILLING my Brother","review":"Until I got this router I was going to kill my Brother. I couldn't get him to stop Downloading from P2P programs, but with this router I can limit the bandwidth so the internet still works like BROADBAND. I love this produce and would recommend it to anyone looking for a router, even if they don't have the same problem I did. The user interface is well laid out and easy to get around. The wireless signal is very strong. Plus it has cool blue lights on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Programmable","review":"I like this router because it's programmable, detailed information on exactly how to program evry little thing in it is a bit scarce. I was expecting it to noticably give my VoIP more bandwidth but since I have to plug the VoIP in front of the router I don't think it helps it at all. Overall, it's a good product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not get it to work wirelessly","review":"Now, it is used as a wired router in the house. I gave up on setting the router to work with my laptop after several days of struggle. Unfortunately, I was out on a long vacation when the thing arrived, and so could not return it in time.A waste of money this, atleast for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Router works well, Support is week","review":"There are only a few more things I would like to see the router do, such as SSL or HTTPS or the admin interface.Also I would love to see a router that let segment out the Wireless from the wired. But none that I have seen do that.But other than that I like this router. I like the options to open just a few ports for one or two apps and open my whole system.D-link support for 1st level is off in India some where and there fools. Lighting Strike took out my router and warranty covered it. But going the many level of hoops 1st level has you jump is not fun.Always get a case number, some India tech will tell you, you won't need one as your phone number is your case number, They LIE! Your phone number is junk. Get a case number. If you don't get one then they never enter your info into the system.Once I got to a D-link tech here in the US, they where great. It was just getting to one that sucked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less then meets the eye","review":"I purchased my DGL-4300 to replace my DI-614+, only to discover it dosen't support PPTP connections. After waiting two months, D-Link finaly released an upgrade that enabled PPTP connections.When trying to use the router, I kept getting disconected from the net, every time I try to use a program that transfers high volumes of data, like video confrencing or on-line gaming. Every time I contacted D-link, they didn't know what the story was. After a long time, they finally said they have no idea what the problem is, and blamed other factors.The router's firewall kept dropping packets without any reason, and kept causing the connection to reset. This problem, and others, when searched on the web, turn up often enough but without a solution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gaming Router","review":"Works great with my cable modem and sharing between two desktops, a laptop, XBox 360, and Wii. Very fast throughput and great for tinkering with the settings. I found some great advice on the web about settings for XBox Live and to give the XBox360 a set address (instead of DHCP) and tweak the settings for optimal gameplay.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I was deciding between this and some comparable Linksys products and this was the best \\"bang for the buck\\" router I could find. I plugged it in and everything just worked. This has been the easiest router I have set up yet. I have had zero down time, with the exception of when configuring some settings that require a reboot. I would recommend this router for anyone who wants gigabit lan speeds and a stable wireless connection. The only thing this device lacks is the new 802.11n specs, and that's no big deal because of the built in MIMO system that gives you the higher speeds with other D-Link devices."},{"rating":"2","title":"No more dropped connections!!!","review":"I had originally bought a Linksys, without doing any research beforehand... thinking all routers were more or less equal... oops! Hardware was poor, the interface was wonky, customer service was a joke. I was re-booting it every few minutes under moderate usage, because it keep dropping my DSL connection or completely locking up. I just replaced it with a DGL-4300 based on all the positive reviews, and have been very happy so far. I don't need or use any of the advanced features for gaming; but already I've been very impressed with the DGL-4300 since it hasn't dropped any connections since I bought it last week. You get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"impossible to figure out","review":"i spent at least 12 hours trying to configure this thing. i finally gave up and purchased a different wireless router that took me two minutes with an instillation disc (belkin n wireless router). I do have a different d-link router at work and it has never given me a bit of trouble, so i think it may be the model rather than the brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"The rebate experience is disastrous","review":"I bought this D-Link wireless router and adapter together in February and expected $50 rebate from them. I received a card from them today saying they did not receive the UPC symbols for both products.I taped the UPC symbols to the rebate form and made a copy before I sent them out. I insisted that they lost the UPC symbols to no avail. I think their processing staff was not very careful. They also misspelled part of my name.I am suprised to find many bad rebate experiences with D-link on the Internet. I will write a letter to the company to complaint formally."},{"rating":"1","title":"Known Wireless Problems","review":"Stay away from this product, it has a well known wireless connection problem that few people were able to fix, most people had to buy something else.If you don't believe, search \\"dlg-4300 wireless problem\\"Unless if you use the 4 ports to connect physically, the wireless part doesn't work well.For my part, only one device can connect and I have to unplug the router's power for 30 seconds at least once a week.And D-Link doesn't even dare making another firmware to fix this problem since 2008 and even ask to pay for support of old products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was expecting","review":"I would not recommend purchasing this product, unless you have very few people using the internet or you are using this as an access point. For me personally, I have multiple people/computers/gaming systems/phones connected, so the router was pretty slow. Also, the router would constantly drop its signal...it is extremely annoying to unplug and plug back in at least once or twice a day...will not recommend this router (or brand) to anyone in the future...go Cisco/Linksys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Far from Regret","review":"I bought this router back in 2006 and i am still working with it, the signal range is good for my house where i put it in a central place.It has been working since i opened the box non stop and i only had to config it once. I play online games like World of Warcraft, use connections peer to peer to download( torrents which sometimes may be a little tricky setting the ports ), VOIP.I have 2 PCs attached to the router through Cat 6 cables and 3 by WiFi, the network works very good and all the computers has good lan and internet speed.It is compatible with my iPhone and none of my friends have had problems connecting to the WiFi when they come to visit and some of them has Macs. The router is very stable, even having a good ammount of machines connected, i don't remember a single time it has reboot or similar.I am very happy with the router and don't plan in changing it unless it stopped working."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made my Ping lower","review":"First unit I received was defective so I got a replacement. It's been almost a year now with no problems. It definitely made my online gaming faster. I have Wii, PS3, Blu-Ray Wi-Fi for Netflix and 2 PCs connected to it. Works great. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Going strong for over three years","review":"No real reliability problems in over three years.My laptop picks up the wireless even when I'm outside about 20ft away. Streaming netflix etc always looks good over wireless.For gaming on my main PC I get good low ping and low latencies with this hooked up to my cable modem. I'm usually the first to sign on a game server when cycling maps.There's a lot of features I don't use. Never tried Gamefuel, never felt the need.I haven't evaluated the gigabit throughput...My only gripe is with the admin interface, it's nice that it has an HTML interfcace so you can manage it from firefox, but the layout is a bit kludgy and I'm always forgetting where to go to do something simple like turn wireless on or off. Not too bad though... probably has more to do with my own neural network experiencing temporal displacement.EDIT: still working great everyday late 2011 - about 5 years of use so far"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stable!","review":"After having routers by belkin, netgear, linksys and a few other smaller brands, I decided to give this one a try since it supported gigabit (back in 2008 there weren't many). Since day one it has been trouble-free...I haven't had to restart it once. Part of this might be due to the fact that I keep it on a wire shelf without anything stacked on it, so it stays cool.The wan throughput is good...it's faster than my connection (~20mb). The lan connections are fast and make large transfers a breeze. There are lots of configuration options and considering when it was made, lots of features. If I could say anything bad about it, it's that the lights are very bright and could be annoying for someone putting it in a bedroom.Considering the stability and features...I probably won't replace this until it dies, which might take a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"funny story with rhymes!","review":"This is a funny story about pigs.

It never fails to get everyone's attention, parents and children alike. The rhyming works so well, and it is very easy to fall under its spell. The bright, pig-filled illustrations are comical and eye-catching. The page \\"Pigs from London, pigs from France, pigs in just their underpants\\" always gets a big laugh from the kids. Parents laugh at the fact that when pizza is ordered, the narrator laments that while the piggies get their fill, he gets nothing, just the bill.After almost fifteen years of reading this story to small groups, it never gets old.

I only wish the shelves were about 1/2 inch taller. Then I could have 3 shelfs in it. You will be happy you ordered this. It ended up taking about 12 spices out of my cabinet, but I put the ones I most use in it. If you put the square cans in it you would be able to store a lot more. It's 12 inches wide, 10 inches deep, & 3 inches tall. It folds down into a great length so everything is easily attainable.
