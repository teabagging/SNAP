I bought this book hoping for some challenging, fun puzzles and I have yet to be disappointed. There are approximately 64 puzzles in all which utilize a variety of skills including basic mathematics (e.g. averaging, fraction and decimal conversions, data comparisons and conversions, sorting). Don't be fooled: although a few random puzzles are very simple, many of them are quite complex and require careful thought and lots of critical thinking in addition to the math skills to reach a solution. Take the word of a civil engineer, this book will have your mind bending for hours. I also recommend that you magnify and xerox or recreate the charts that are provided to help you work out the solution (include space for notes). And make sure you use a pencil and a big eraser.Solutions are provided in the back of the book for all problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of errors, not challenging, also a rip-off!","review":"I bought this book and started working some of the problems.

This is about as nice as Bossa Nova gets. Beautiful music with substance and a lot of heart.The reason I only gave this four stars is because my experience with \\"Samba Blim\\" is limited to the LP. One of the LPs virtues was the tasteful recording job done by Rudy Van Gelder.

Brock Canfield comes across immediately as a sleaze, kissing and fondling our witless heroine, Stephanie, moments after meeting her, while his girlfriend is in the next room! He treats his girlfriend with contempt, which should give Stephanie a clue as to how he'd treat her eventually. Stephanie lets him know at once she'd do anything for him, and all this after just one day together. He paws Stephanie on the dance floor while his girlfriend is sitting in a booth right there. Yet Stephanie questions nothing. All she wants is Brock. It is incomprehensible why he is interested in her, other than as a challenge to get a virgin into bed. This book is not romantic at all.

Unfortunately, I was wrong.This razor is pretty rough on the skin. I always feel like I've rubbed my face with sandpaper after using it. I don't get this feeling with my Braun or my other Panasonic. I can only assume it is because the motor on this razor is not as fast as my previous Panasonic razor.

There is nothing deep or methodical about this story, in fact it seemed pieced together at the last minute.

In trying to incorporate anthropology, linguistics, and sociology into one book, Errington merely glazes over the topics and falls short of elucidating the interpenetration among the fields.

The directions are clear, mostly. There are several experiments that require an adult (using candles, for example), but they are clearly labeled as needing assistance. This book has kept my daughter busy for quite a while, just reading through them and doing several experiments without my help. My only gripes are that the book is published on coloring book paper, with cheap coloring book style illustrations which do not accurately show what should happen. A child who cannot read well would have difficulty figuring these out. Also since it was published 24 years ago (as of 2010), the paper is disintegrating.

I would not have had the confidence to do so without the clear, step by step and good-humored instructions in this book. What a service!

Fortunately Nissley, et al, and the State of California have made this possible for typical small family estates. Working through our own actual situation, with the help of this book, provided a much-needed education about what to do and what not to do in planning my own estate matters. What the book doesn't address is the difficulty the Executor or representative faces in managing through the attitudes, complaints and opinions of the others affected by the death of a loved one.This edition seems to have been edited piecemeal to keep up with changing laws and tax matters, and some of the references within the book are incorrect.

If you are looking at an estate that involves a substantial amount of money and may be potentially complicated (different types of assets, mortgages, descendents) then you will benefit from reading this book. This book is not a substitute for having a lawyer but it will at least prepare you and make you aware of issues that may come up. By having an idea of what might come up and what is involved you will not be completely in the dark when dealing with your lawyer.

But after viewing it, I found myself uncomfortable with the visual presentation - musically it is wonderful, even if some of the vocalists are not \\"top notch\\". The staging is awkward, it plods and is uninspired, and really doesn't add anything to the production. To make matters worse, the photography and lighting are awful and more appropriate for a live sporting event.

It was good, but not as good as the 1973 broadcast. This production doesn't compare. It is a concert production so there is very little staging. The soloists do a fine job with the singing, but for the most part, I have seen more believable acting at my local high school. The classical chorus in the background is small and weak. The climatic scene where the Celebrant hurls down the communion chalice and wafer and removes his vestments and dances on the alter has been emasculated. This is a poor production in most aspects.Give us the first two video productions on DVD instead of this poorly staged and acted concert production."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"For anyone who had a chance to see the original production or televised version of the same, this is absolutely horrific! It was as though this production was thrown together quickly and haphazardly. It had seemingly no direction. What was forgotten in this production is that this glorious, brave, daring work is not merely a genius piece of music but it is also a brilliant piece of \\"theatre\\" of drama. In this, the performers seemed to have no idea of who their characters were or why they were singing (except for Anika Noni Rose). The director didn't seem to know that this was a piece about faith and doubt and worldliness and choice. It questions who is God, what is the Church, how does it all fit into our daily lives as we struggle here on earth. What it means to believe in ones religion and be a part of the world. In fact there was no direction.

Metal dusters tend to work a lot better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite pleased with it","review":"We bought this to dust our carpet with fluffy diatomaceous earth (DE)for fleas.- It distributes the dust evenly and lightly, just as I wanted.- It is easy to fill.- As others pointed out, the wand tends to fall off unless it's twisted on really tightly.- A bit of dust comes out the pump end, probably because the DE is so ultra fine, but not enough to be a problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"You'll be dusting yourself!","review":"At first I loved it: setup was easy and I was able to reach the tops of my tallest tomato plants; but after the first few pumps I noticed that every time I pulled the handle dust was shooting out at me from the shaft hole. About as much came out the wrong end as went out the right end. There's no telling how much dust I inhaled before I realized I was dusting myself. There is no instruction manual, the instructions are printed on the duster canister and are simple: open container and fill with up to one pound of dust. The warnings on the container instruct to wear protective clothing and don't spray people or animals. I had to go online to find the customer service number. Needless to say I will be returning this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Duster is fine!","review":"This garden dust applicator is just fine. It works, and it holds a good supply of powder. Though plastic, it seems to be pretty well made, fits up nicely, and is sturdy. But you do have to hold it just right or you get almost nothing coming out....I dunno, maybe that is the case with all dusters of this type. And it makes a dreadful squealing sound with each stroke of the pump, but it doesn't affect the function. All in all, I would say it was definitely a good buy and certainly a much cheaper option than a power duster."},{"rating":"2","title":"this thing squeaks","review":"good size and works okay but it is very squeaky when pumping the plunger.

If that could be resolved, it would earn the 5th star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might as well send your money to me","review":"This thing is, to put it politely, excrement.

Attachment keeps falling off when I pump it and the inside attachment (the 4 inch tube) that connects to the applicator nozzle keeps falling off when I pump the duster so that huge clumps come flying out. I then have to open the top up, find the tube, and re-insert the tube back in the applicator and it will work a short time before falling off again and sending out huge clumps again. It would have been much better if this tube was SCREWED into the canister rather than PUSHED into it. Maybe like some of the others who posted here, I just received a bad one.

In any case, a musical in which \\"it's the music that counts\\" is a musical in which the principals have voices and actually sing their songs. Lowe's work is slaughtered here. Some points of (possible) interest: Lancelot's songs are dubbed in (by someone other than Franco Nero); Guenevere's songs are not: Redgrave sings them--sort of. Arthur never calls Guenevere \\"Ginny\\"; he calls her \\"Jenny\\". (Those who have read the book--\\"The Once and Future King\\"--know this. Those who have not read the book ought to.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good movie, but somewhat long","review":"This was a good movie, but at times it became long and tedious, and the watcher just sits there wondering when it will be over.

This \\"collectable\\" release does nothing but take up twice the shelf space of a standard bluray case. Trust me.

My bit of advice would be make sure you never listen to the broadway cast recording of Camelot if you want to like this movie. Julie Andrews voice is so superior to Redgrave's it is not even funny. Julie should have been the Queen. At least they asked her to be. I loved the way she declined and since she wouldn't perform this show fell through. I hated the way the director says that there was no one else better than Vanessa for the Queen. He must have been in denial that Julie said \\"No.\\" Julie clearly would have been the better choice. I also think the storyline is slightly terrible. I have always had mixed feelings about the King Arthur legends. I hate how the Queen falls for Lancelot, he is the most self-absorbed snot that ever lived. THe singing isn't wonderful and I would highly recommend the broadway casts version to the movie.

Guenivere (Redgrave) is very convincing, as are Aurthur (Harris) and Lancelot. Harris is amazing as Authur. One feels all of his pain, his hopes, his confusion. King Pellinore, Aurthers good friend, is a welcome comady relief. My favorite line? \\"How can you get a fair decision from people so impartial?\\" from Pellinore. The songs are generally very lively, although there are a few beautiful love songs. The costumes and scenery were amazing! (Keep an eye out for the guys with lots of dark eyeshadow, and remember, everyone in the movie has blue eyes.) The first time I saw this movie it climbed the list to one of my favorites. Camelot is a true classic, a must-have for broadway lovers, a must-see for anyone who has ever dreamed an impossible dream!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Camelot does not disappoint!","review":"Having seen Camelot on it original roadshow engagement in Atlanta, GA....I have loved this movie ever since. I have bought it on Beta tape and lastly laserdisc....and finally in Blu Ray. The Blu Ray is about as close as one can get to the original experience of seeing it on the big screen in 70 mm. This release seems to be the uncut orignal roadshow version... with scenes restored that had been missing when released to local run theaters. The colors and sound are crisp and beautiful.

It SHOULD HAVE been made with Julie Andrews, Richard Harris and Robert Goulet. Vanessa Redgrave looks wonderful, but her character seems depressed most of the time and the woman can't sing a note to save her life. Franco Nero was handsome, but looks Italian, not English... fortunately they found a very English voice to dub his songs. The other problem with this film, which bothered me when I first saw it was that it has the most cardboard looking stage sets for some scenes I have ever seen, and worse, the cameras move about exposing the painted backdrops even more. I do believe in the late 60s when this movie came out they had cameras that could be transported to real locations. My hope is that this beautiful musical will eventually be re-made with a SINGING cast using real outdoor locations.... please!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Disappointment!","review":"I recently picked up a VHS copy of this at a local thrift store for almost nothing. Having never seen it, I was looking forward to an exciting 3-hour musical. What a disappointment! Virtually the entire film lacked consistency and cohesiveness. Though some of the musical numbers were quite good, the acting on the part of Richard Harris and Vanessa Redgrave was unimpressive. Overall, the film was very labored and there was little to connect one scene to another. If you want a truly excellent rendition of King Arthur and the knights of the round table, get a copy of the 1997 film, First Knight starring Sean Connery, Richard Gere and Julia Ormond. The acting is first rate and the film is filled with action and does not drag along like Camelot does.

The parts were packed methodically so I had no trouble taking them out of the box by myself. Weber has the best packaging I've ever seen.This is a natural gas grill and requires a dedicated outdoor gas outlet. All the connectors are included in the contents. Initially, I couldn't get the temps above 350-400 degrees! But, soon realized that all the burners were set at the lowest flame settings. Now, the temps routinely get over 600 degrees. Awesome.

To return it, apparently you have to be able to disassemble it, get it back in the original box, and then you're charged a $150 return fee. The fee is bad enough considering what good customers we are for amazon, but the worst part is THIS GRILL IS NEVER GOING TO FIT BACK IN THE ORIGINAL PACKAGING with the various parts.

Moon shots, animals at a distance, even objects acroiss a small lake - this lens performs and performs well. I find myself looking at potential subjects differently and taking pictures that I would have just passed up.If you are use to going manual, then this is a great buy.

The process was messy and annoying for both of us and we're throwing away the finished lip balm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as much fun as I thought","review":"I bought this for my granddaughter (who is 10) as an activity we could do together.

This product was difficult to use - you could hardly scrape the goo into the tiny measuring cup. And using warm water to \\"melt\\" the mess? All that happened was we swirled it around until the colors mixed and managed to smear most of it into the container. It didn't harden after that so it was like putting glue on your lips. So Gross. Clean up was a disaster. My tip - use paper towels instead of soap and water. I hope I didn't clog my drain.The containers and stickers are cute but the bag was too small for all five.

On another note, my daughter decided to put some of this in her hair one day...Lord knows why! We tried clarifying shampoo, Dawn Detergent, Corn Starch being rubbed in then brushed out then shampooed again, a gentle hair stripper from our hair stylist and nothing would take this mess out of her hair! I called the company directly and they said \\"oh just use soap and water\\". Yeah that doesn't work! I explained everything to them and the advice they gave was useless.

'Journey Through this World' covers the time until 1949, the year when Gurdjieff died.Meetings with Gurdjieff, Ouspensky and Orage are described in detail, but there are also meetings with people not directly involved with Gurdjieff and his ideas. These include the great architect Frank Lloyd Wright and philosopher Bertrand Russell, both of whom Stanley Nott was close with.In this time from 1928 to 1949 Gurdjieff lost his possession of The Prieure, completed his writings, visited US many times, held 'toasts to the Idiots' and readings of Beelzebub's Tales in his flat and composed music and movements right until 1949. Ouspensky was active in London, moved to United States during the war and back to England in 1947, when he also died.The book has a wealth of information for those interested in different aspects of Gurdjieff's Teaching."},{"rating":"1","title":"In the trash it goes, it goes...","review":"This is a nauseating disk.

A few were on the soundtrack for \\"Hell's Kitchen\\" with Angelina Jolie and Rosanna Arquette and when I heard them I had to know who it was. Joseph Arthur is haunting, for lack of better words. I've noticed lately, he's going a little more mainstream, which is slightly disappointing. But I think he's incredibly talented and I would definitely recommend this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a great album, but you MUST see this guy live","review":"The album, the music and the lyrics are all well above average. But if you ever see him live, you'll have a whole new appreciation of what JA does. What you hear on the album (if it's like it is live, and I think it is), is all him. No background vocalists, no additional instuments (except the occasional harmonica, also played by JA). And he does it all in real time with no tape. Just JA, a guitar, a harmonica, a mike, some petals and a sampling machine. The drum sounds are him hitting the guitar, sampling it, and replaying it.A remarkable live performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Chemical\\" charms, most of rest falls short...","review":"Hearing \\"Chemical\\" on the radio gave me great hopes for this album, but I was quite disappointed. This may clearly be a personal issue, but the mode of my disappointment came in the form of Arthur's seemingly banal lyrics. Because the music is sparse, the vocals and lyrics are highlighted, and in listening to the album for the first time I found myself easily completing Arthur's couplets without having heard them. This could be a sign of my deep connection with the artist, but I think not. However, \\"Chemical\\" remains a great song and a good intro to this artist. If I perhaps was too sensitive while listening to this album, give it a try for yourself, but be forewarned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bricka-Bracka, Firecracker, Sis-Boom-Bah!

For example, when talking about Jupiter, I would have liked Mr. Carroll to say something about the fact that Jupiter guards our vulnerable planet like a soldier in outer space, protecting us from meteor impacts which would destory life on Earth.

And America has given a lot to support Israel but, we have betrayed her on many occasions. America (it's people)now stands at a truly critical juncture in it's history and it's future and I hope we make the right the decision. Because if we choose badly the results will be catastrophic.

Though I do not agree with his escatology, I found the info very important and put together in an easy to grasp way. Excellent! Very important to read and to think very seriously about his conclutions that deal directly with the future of America.I am not surprised that this book is under such vicious attack. Historically, anyone who has dared to say these things has had to deal with similar reactions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Book on Prophecy!","review":"This is the best book I have ever read on prophecies. I literally could not put the book down. Michael truly has insight into this most important subject. It was extremely interesting to learn from this book how past presidents have supported Israel. Why? because they knew (by reading the Bible) that the Jews are God's Chosen People. The Bible states that God will Bless those that love and support the Jewish people. (This is one of those absolutes from God - just because some people don't believe it doesn't make it not true.)The Bible also states that God will bless those who read and heed the prophecies in the Book of Revelation.This book is a great addition to any prophecy library. All born again christians should read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"","review":"I just finished reading Evans' The American Prophecies and could not put it down. I found it extensively documented, compelling and a must read for Evangelical Christians seeking to make sense of our current world. Contrary to other reviewers I have read, I do not find Evans a man of hate, but someone who is deeply saddened by the world events he has witnessed and feels a moral responsibity to let others know the dangers we face. In doing this he is well-aware of the attacks that will come his way--but our faith demands sacrifice. Ignoring history in the name of political correctness has cost us so much. The tone of some of the negative reviews reveals much fear and confusion about what is happening right now. While Evans may not be correct about where we are in God's timeline (only God knows), he is brave about pointing out the signs--I just hope even one reader benefits from his \\"voice crying out in the wilderness.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The American Prophecies","review":"It is a good book - worthy of reading and passing along as a Christimas gift. It is interesting to note that books that are totally fictional and even insulting to a thinking person are listed as something worthwhile to read (as DaVinci Code) but not a book like this that shows what our future might well be - and soon. It will not hurt anyone to read this,The American Prophecies, and consider - it is better than fiction by far and very thought provoking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone should read this.","review":"There is no doubt about it, Mr. Evans has hit it right on. Only the foolish would not be prepared or unwise as to think they can escape. I think if I were those on the outside looking in (secular humanists), I would surely be afraid NOT to read God's word and what He says about His people - all His people, whether they be Jewish or Christian - and by that, I mean, those who have accepted His Son, Jesus Christ, as their personal Lord and Savior. You will miss out on eternity - now, how long is eternity, and are you willing to take that chance?Good book, Mike. Most excellent. I bought another to give away as a gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly Eye Opening","review":"The information I've learned by reading The American Prophecies by Mike Evans has been an eye opening experience. Though I know of the importance of \\"the apple of God's eye\\", Mike brings Israel even closer to my heart. Walking through America's history in the book also makes one pray for America, President Bush, and it's support of Israel. May God continue to bless America as we Christians stand up, work so that none are left behind, and await the soon coming return of Christ."},{"rating":"2","title":"The American Prophecies","review":"This book is excellent. If every American read it with an open mind and took the facts as they are, we would certainly be more informed and would know just why our nation is in such a state of peril as it now has become. We need to know who we put at the helm of our nation and be better informed of the people who are able to guide our nation in the direction it was originally intended -- that of righteousness to be our main goal. If it is carefully read by people who want our nation to stand, we most certainly will extend our nation's security and health of its citizenry."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Historical Must-Read!!!","review":"Whether you are a Christian or not, this book does an excellent job of tracing the history of the Jews from Biblical times till now. It's worth your time, just from a historical perspective. I found the history of the United States relationsip with the Jews to be especially interesting. Not the stuff you'll read in our schools' history books! The book also covers the prophetical timeline of Israel and the Jewish race. Evans outlines what the Bible says will happen, where we are now in the that timeline, and what America must do to be in God's will and under God's protection. If you are interested in a down-to-earth book based in biblical truth rather than political correctness, by all means buy this book and read it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not to be Ignored","review":"Though not all people would agree with his interpretation, Mike Evans has presented a reasonable interpretation of Scripture and tied it effectively with U.S. and Middle East history.

He writes, \\"The American Prophecies has been in stores less than 48 hours, and we are receiving an organized wave of attacks against the book. Obviously, there are large numbers of people who hate Israel and the Word of God. They are trying to destroy the rating of the book in the hope that the book will die.\\" As with a great many fundamentalists, Dr. Evans sees the world in extremely stark, black and white pigments. Because some dare to criticize his book, he erroneously deduces that these people \\"hate Israel and the word of God\\".

In today's world, the only people who are not given tolerance are Christians. You have to take a stand on issues....and the Bible, God's Word, is our guide. Every prophecy has been fulfilled except the second coming of Jesus....and no one knows when that will happen. Whether or not you believe the Bible does not change the truth of God's Word.

Our future as a nation will indeed be determined largely by our attitude toward Isreal, the apple of God's eye. To touch Isreal is to touch God, who will always keep and honour His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Out of this covenant Christiantity was born, and the United States constitution has its roots in it.

The hardcover volume is easily worth the price and I bought two more after reading my first one just to have copies to loan. I have not regretted it. Recommended for a primer as well as fact-filled resource for dispensationalists and other Bible students who go along the path of Scofield. I am one such (after training in other theologies as well as other fields) and would say hands down this is the ONE book that covers the subject adaquately and comprehensively. As a bonus it is written by a convert to Christianity from Jewish heritage so you have both perspectives blended and with a nice outcome.

This is a grade A pile of nonsense, speculation, religious ranting and raving with very little actual context to back up any of his claims. A monkey can take the bible and make it read any way he wants it too, that's not a problem, what is a problem is when some two-bit hack takes it and starts feeding it any which way he wants.I found it funny how he convienantly threw in 9-11, as if he was such an expert on the matter. If Evans had any credility, don't you think he would have made these assertions PRIOR to 9-11. \\"Ah yeah, I'm an expert on Jesus,\\" Anyone 2 AD.

The problem with that is that this idea is NOT found in the Bible. Where is it found? Hold on to your hat people. It comes from Arab mythology...including the Quran. Given that, Evans is tacitly accepting those two sources as divinely inspired :) It's not very often you see a Christian unknowingly endorsing Islam...and then receiving tons of praise for it.I suggest that anyone even remotely interested in this subject look this up for themselves if they don't believe me. They will not find even one passage in the Bible stating that Ishmael is the progenitor of the Arabs.

It's worse than nonsense, as it plays on the extreme political and cultural tensions of our current era, seeking to motivate already unstable fundamentalist Christians toward a goal that would be disastrous for our great nation. The author is careless at best to take this course; it's likely that he is of the utterly insane Dispensationalist stripe that actually wants to hasten the \\"end of the world\\" by engaging America in a nuclear conflict.

This planet and its peoples are spinning deeper into the cataclysmic vortex of Biblical prophecy; and we must know exactly what direction our national leaders have heretofore taken us and are now directing us, as well as understand resulting consequences.

I admire the author and support him for giving us such an important book. It is not simply another religious book. It is a guide and inspiration for us to lean on during the perilous times of anti-Bible and anti-end times.I was so impressed that I ordered another copy to send to my former pastor and his wife who are now in China doing mission work.All of the bad reviews are from those who disagree with the Bible."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a most informative book!","review":"Mike Evans does his homework when he writes a book about Bible prophecy and other issues, and this time was no exception. He not only did much research, but he also relied on his numerous interviews with politicians and many others. If anyone understands the dangers the Jews face and what America needs to do, to bless Israel and not be guilty of cursing her, Mike Evans does. I urge everyone to read it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate","review":"Though the DC is entertaining, it is so inaccurate as to true history.This book, in a subtle way depicted as fact, however, it is an attempt at revisionist history.

Why aren't people satisfied with the better, eternal, timeless principles of the Bible that apply to all people in all times and all places?Can anyone see how this approach tries to turn the Bible into a crystal ball? Can anyone see how a need to know exactly what's going on, and why, and how my uncle's dog Pete relates to world events -- really unds up being a fear issue? What I mean is, people don't want to trust God's sovereignty and so they have to pretend to know what tomorrow will bring.Can anyone see how this approach takes people's eyes off of Jesus?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please stop the hatred","review":"The American Prophecies is full of distortions of God's Holy Word and outright lies about Palestinians. Terrorism is wrong - period- but the majority of Palestinians are simply trying to get through the day just like you and me.

Leader Y. Arafat. The revelations are coming to pass before our very eyes. We are living in an exciting time.

This may create confusion for many readers. For Christians, who are biblically illiterate, this book won't mean much.For those who have studied the Bible and, in particular, the prophetic tellings of the Old Testament and New Testament, much of what Michael Evans writes will still be of great interest. He places events and times in context with all presidents under scrutiny for their public words on the subject of Israel and then follows with what actions occurred on their watches.Though God has blessed America mightily, it is sad to realize that America, blessed by God in the beginning, is now under a curse for cursing Israel.What we are left with is an appeal to \\"Pray, Pray, Pray!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"The Religious Right At Its Worst","review":"Evans is crazy. No, we do not have to militarily support Israel and kill all Muslims. What is he trying to do, start World War III??????

Are you, as a Christian, thereby admitting that you aren't intelligent in the first place?Anyone who takes the Book of Revelations seriously is unworthy of respect. Silly Christians, truth is in science!"},{"rating":"1","title":"crap","review":"If I could give this book less then one star I would. I always wonder how it is that guys like Mike Evans can lambast others for interpreting the bible as something other than literal, while at the same time interpreting biblical prophecy to suit their own brand of facism. Literal interpretations of the bible are still interpretations. The whole message of Jesus was about forgiveness, gentleness and non-violence; not once did he encourage any to destroy those that didn't agree with them. How sad that the beautiful teachings of Christ can be turned into more reasons to hate and kill each other. God is not an angry and jealous God. Christ came to tell us that he is a loving father. I suspect Christ would weep after reading something like this that justifies the anger, hatred and death that we pile on our brothers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rattlesnakes Constricting In Prayer.","review":"I was raised in the help the poor Lutheran Ministerial tradition & attended Parochial School.

T., the thread of Prophecy - Fulfillment. The scepter and the promise, the kingdom and the blessings to Israel. This is true whether one believes God's church IS Israel, or is SPIRITUAL Israel. Whereas, though the descendants of Ishmael were to be a great nation, there were no blessings - indeed the prophecy is that his hand is to be against EVERY man (except his own). Please read how Mr. Evans explains how The Bible reveals this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful TRUTH--Not Politically correct","review":"This book has been an eye-opener for my husband especially. I have been to Israel three times, studied their history and the scriptures regarding Israel for years--this book finally puts much of what I learned in one book. My husband finally gets it. What I could not do with my words and experiences, Mike Evans has done with the pages of this volume. Thank you.It is a MUST read for every Christian and every American. There is not a one of us that this book will not pierce to the heart with its truth. It will move you to self-evaluation and you will see America and the Church in fresh revealing light.

There's some techno stylings thrown in on a few tracks, some trip hop, and of course the piano, horns and funk that makes acid jazz so appealing.What I love best about the CD is that each track is very individual. Many trip-hop and acid jazz artists seem to create a \\"mold\\" and all their songs sound interchangeable. Outside really sound like they think out each song on its own.All of these songs are top-notch. About half have vocals.

I have to say that I struggled through this book after having read a GREAT book, Jonathan Kellerman's BILLY STRAIGHT. To me, this book was a wrong turn down a reading DEAD END. Okay, to be fair, I must explain that 1) the characters were cardboard cutouts, 2) the suspense did not show up at all, and 3) the writer's mastery of good descriptive words is non-existent.

The book is about a boy, named Neil Chapman, who moves to the wryd museam with his father, he meets very stange people (and things!) goes back in time - AND fights a demon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange and wonderful","review":"Robin Jarvis' Wyrd Museum Trilogy is a fantastic blend of Fantasy and Horror with interesting characters and a great story line.Jarvis starts his trilogy with the slightly more easy going, \\"The Woven Path\\" which is an exiting journey into the the past life of an old teddy bear. Neil Chapmann and his family move into the Wyrd Museam as his father takes a job as a caretaker. While exploring Neil comes across a room filled with mysterious treasures and meets Ted, the reincarnation of a world war two American pilot. The two of them are sent back in time by Ursula Webster one of the three sisters who own the museum. They end up in London during world war two. Unfortunatly an ancient power has been unleashed on the city and Neil and Ted only have a little time to finish their quest before the demon finds them.This is a great book although it may be frightening for smaller children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible book - not worth a star","review":"I suggest any parent read this book before letting your child do so. I was unable to finish it due to the very graphic and horrific description of a dog being stoned nearly to death by some boys. The writer excelled at getting the image of the little dog trying to crawl to a friendly human with his broken legs and his bloody lips where his teeth had been knocked out and wagging his tail at his friend even in that battered condition forever stuck in my head. Then the person in the book picks up a rock and bashes the dog's head in to put him out of his misery. A few pages later the dog's owner was eaten by the demon. That's where I stopped. This is not a good book and definitely not for kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Smart Scare for those who dare!","review":"The Wyrd Museum trilogy has some of the most spine-tingling moments I have ever come across in juvenile fiction. While it is probably a little too gruesome for the 9 and under set, it provides plenty of thrills and chills for everyone 10 and above.When you have grown weary of the exploits of a certain young wizard, come and visit with the Webster sisters for a magical tale of a more sinister sort. Nothing in or around Hogwarts has ever been this creepy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My First Motions Hair Product...","review":"First of all I love this product! The dispenser makes sure you don't squirt out too much product and that's good. I have so much hair that once I just took the top off and used a lot more of the product and it was NEVER GREASY! I have brown hair that always looks sandy but when I use just a few squirts of this stuff, my hair has a healthy shine that lasts until my next shampoo!!! That was my test that this product would be one of my weekly top hair products to use! Secondly, this product is HARD TO FIND!

It looked like a pretty good one, and was looking forward to watching it as a family. However, the quality of Amazon's movie rental services through our Playstation 3 has really gone downhill. We used to rent movies all the time through Amazon, but not anymore. We couldn't get through 2 minutes of the movie without it buffering or pausing and saying it wouldn't work.

My children loved it. For grown ups, it is good too, but I would give3 star for grown ups. Thus the average 4 star.At first this movie leads you to believe that it is a typical good vs evil movie. In a way, it is. But thereis a twist. In this case the good character is defeated. Now what happens? See, that is the question.For me it was not as good as Finding Nemo, or Toy Story series, but still it is a good movie. I highlyrecommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good kids movie","review":"I would probably give the movie a 4.5 but it's not possible. Overall I think its a good movie; however, I think most of these movies are getting a bit short. I think there could have been a little more meat in this.

Unlike other travel books which cover only the sightseeing aspect of Japan putting weight on traditional Japanese culture, this book is well balanced in describing everyday life, the real Japan today, The Japanese mind (important in getting acquainted with Japan), as well as the tradition. The book is also good at pointing out the interesting mixture of the past and present (for example, kimono-clad woman talking on a cell-phone). The facts and advice are all practical, up to date and accurate based on the author's actual experience living in Japan. As a Japanese citizen, I recommend reading this book whether you plan to visit/live in Japan or not, to find out what Japan is all about now. (which is not just Geisha, samurai, Toyota and Sony. :-))"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Agree With Jersey Reader","review":"I've been replacing my lamps and shades, one at a time, for over a month now.

Matt Bumgarner has pulled off a scab some would want left alone but there is no healing either way. War is total. The story is real as are the people.

I was expecting a book that explained the idea of and how to do Arts and Crafts by welding. It gave very little information about which welder might be best and then a bunch of old outdated projects. I found this book mostly usless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very useful","review":"I bought this book thinking it would show/describe common techniques for art related projects (some do's and dont's). Or even a bit on brazing (for welding with exotic meatals like copper and brass). Instead, it is just a step by step for several really uninspired projects. And then mostly tack welding. Not much serious welding.It does cover some very basic information on the different welding processes, but you can get that online for free. I would suggest saving up for weekend welding classes at your local community college. At least you will learn proper welding techniques from pros. You can then determine what equipment is best for you for your needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth $30","review":"I picked up this book as a present for my brother, who has made some simple lawn art (dogs, frogs etc) while learning to weld. I wasn't expecting instructions (which this book doesn't really provide), but rather inspiration/concepts to checkout. So, I was quite disappointed when I opened the package and saw a small magazine style \\"book\\". The pictures are very poor - they are black and white with really terrible shading, so you cannot see hardly any detail. When I say poor, I mean you can see the individual pixels on the pictures without even looking close.While this book may have value if it is priced more appropriate to the printing quality, $10 or less, it doesn't have enough information to justify the $30 price tag."},{"rating":"1","title":"AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE!!","review":"This \\"book\\" is just a reprint (actually, it looks like a poor Xerox of a newspaper item, miniaturized) of a book from 1860, and each page contains a single column of print, so small (I would estimate about 8 point) and blurred that it would be almost impossible to read without a magnifying glass, and would still be difficult.

The author, writing in the early 1940's, enjoyably intertwines references to ballet dancing, war news, radio programs, status of working women, immigrants, apartment house living.

However, as the story progressed, I realized I didn't like the main characters, Allissa and Strell, because they were very flat and static characters. And the villain was just awful. when the reader is first introduced to Bailic, you think he is going to be a very smart villain; however, he ends up being very stupid and unobservant; he reminds me of the stereotypical villain you would find in a melodrama. Characters are extremely important to a story, and because there were so few, the author should have spent much more time developing her characters.The plot was so-so, and the climax fell flat. I believe it was only in the last chapter that Allissa found \\"her book,\\" the item she was so set on finding since the beginning, and nothing really exciting happened.I know this is the first book in a series, but I do not plan on continuing reading it. One of the few fantasy stories I have read and did not like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliche Fantasy with Clunky Pacing and Low Creative Level","review":"Kim Harrison and Dawn Cook may be the same person, but the writing is worlds apart. I tracked this novel down after being totally wowed by the nine books in this author's urban fantasy series, which starts withDead Witch Walking (The Hollows, Book 1). \\"First Truth\\" is a cliche fantasy coming of age story with temperamental and immature characters, tons of useless scenes, a random pet kestrel named 'Talon' (yeah, expect this creative level), and an extremely slow plot with little resolution. I do not recommend this novel if you expect Cook/Harrison to be as good in her early works... you will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sorry dissapointment","review":"I was expecting a lot more than was given from this book. Alissa, a half-breed, is on a journey to find her dead father's magic book. On the way she encounters Strell, who soon after becomes her constant companion. They are heading to the Hold, where her book and Baellic, her father's murderer, await. Dawn Cook unconvincingly tries for a sense of danger throughout the stay in the Hold, but makes the mistake of turning the situation into a lighter one with Alissa and Strell's loving banter. The relationships are developed, but not realistically so. The antagonist isn't so great at antagonizing, and the story falls flat. Maybe Cook was saving the good stuff for the sequel, but I guess I'll never know. I could barely finish the book, much less drudge through the second. I only finished because I can't stand to leave a book half read."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your time and money","review":"I really wanted to like this book, but it was so bad I had to give up about half way through. I found it to be totally confusing, poorly written and the two main characters were so boring I simply didn't care what they were like or what they did (which was actually very little).

There was nothing I could discover of explaining why we're here. Nevertheless, this is a fine book that does reassure us of an afterlife from an author who has had more than her share of life problems and heartache. Some of it was brought about by herself, such as allowing her husband to almost kill her more than once and not leave him 'til around 15 years had passed. This is an autobiography and most interesting indeed. She talks of events that happened to her and of her realization that she could communicate with the other side of life and how she has helped others for many years now.

I can not wear thin toe rings because they slide and turn too much and dig into my toe, so a wide ring is best for me. I highly recommend this ring! I have worn it through many showers and it's holding up nicely!Edit - June 29, 2011I wrote too soon! Last Friday, I was walking and this toe ring split in two and fell off.

It's tough. So it was with curiosity that I ordered this VHS and I am delighted to watch an expert at work.

Thanks to Amazon's Video-on-Demand option, we were finally able to see this excellent film. It avoids the home-front romance of many films of its type, focusing on Douglas Bader's ultimately successful struggle to overcome an apparent disability to prove to himselve and others that disabled does not mean unable to excel. Reach for the Sky is also superb in that Bader's injury is part of his character, but not the only reason for the movie. I'd put this alongside 12 O'Clock High, The Dam Busters and other excellent WWII movies.Reach For The Sky"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reach for the sky.","review":"I first saw this film in London as a teenager in 1956. Douglas Bader's dogged determination to overcome his disability was an inspiration to me. Kenneth Moore did an outstanding job of portraying this gutsy Brit who never gave up, and served his country admirably in the time of her greatest need. Imagine, flying Spitfire and Hurricane fighters with two artificial legs. I have searched for this film for years, and I can't express my excitement when I found it on the Amazon website. Bader became a legend in his own time, and richly deserves the renewed recognition of his achievements that the reissue of this film brings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor transaction.","review":"As stated, we have returned all five DVD's which were not compatible for our New Zealand region, as we require them to be changed over for the Pal version."},{"rating":"1","title":"REACH FOR THE SKY DVD","review":"I returned this DVD to Amazon because it would not play.

Since this was a film originally I expected a film transfer to NTSC. That's not what I got. Why does this matter? The resolution is not crisp and when the camera pans left or right the video stutters. I played this in a new Blu-ray player. They shouldn't be able to market this as a factory original if it's simply a not so well made PAL conversion.

When my fellow hunters arrived the next morning, they woke me up and got us out of the tent as the smell of propane was heavy in the tent. My son and I had headaches for hours after getting into fresh air. Upon inspection, it was found the face was not fully igniting allowing unburnt propane to enter our air. On the positive side, the heater did put out some heat allowing my son to warm his hands and feet. I will not be using this particular product again. To add to the product, the built in thermometer did not work. Spend the extra money and purchase a buddy heater.

If you're looking for some fresh interior design ideas, by all means read and enjoy this book. The photos are attractive, and the book itself is well ordered and thoughtfully written. On the other hand, if you're serious about authentic, traditional feng shui -- meaning real, honest-to-goodness theory and application -- start somewhere else, and pick this book up later as a study to test your knowledge and eye for authenticity. Stasney authorizes liberal use of intuition in your interior design. Which is fine ... but just remember that feng shui is a science, not solely a mere feeling or preference.

I don't necessarily believe that choreographers cannot choreograph known music to their whim........ provided it works. In this case very little does. There is hardly any dancing.... even of the modern variety.... The conceit of a dream sequence showing multiple Coppelias all in red with blonde wigs, some of them in travesti, could have been fun if they were given something interesting to do or to dance.

Based on the title, I expected an original book that would be well written and instructive, to complement the more dry technical online documention. I opened the book and found it largely an effort to make a quick buck, providing little that is not already freely available on-line. The first section of the book is not original as another reviewer has pointed out, however at least it organizes some help section material into a readable flow. The bulk of the book is just reprint filler. I feel I got \\"taken\\" on this purchase. As you may have seen, Macromedia was notorious for having complaints over its published books. Hopefully Adobe will operate this end of the business in a different fashion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wait Till the Moon is Full is a winner!","review":"This was a Christmas gift for one of our granddaughters. She immediately became involved in reading the story and enjoying the beautiful artwork."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly as good as I'd hoped","review":"Our family loves Margaret Wise Brown and we also love raccoons, as we sometimes do wildlife rehab and work with raccoon babies. Our son's favorite book is Little Fur Family, so we thought surely this would be a hit as well. Unfortunately the book drags on and on, nothing at all happening until the very end when the little raccoon finally gets the okay to go outside to play. That's it. My book-loving son was pushing this one away a few pages in, and I wanted to do the same. So much buildup for a fizzle at the end, and it's not even as if real raccoon babies would wait for a full moon to go out anyway! This book was surprisingly dull. Imagine an entire book full of \\"wait, you can't go outside yet\\" page after page, then finally, \\"okay, now you can go out.\\" There you have it. Definitely lacks the magical charm and sweetness of Little Fur Family."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have been looking for this book for years.","review":"My mother read this book to me when I was a little girl.

Book.","review":"What can I say about this book? I opened it up, read the first page, nearly retched, and literally drop-kicked it across the room (this was back when I was taking karate classes).People looking at this book need to be aware that it is vanity printed (not edited or produced by a conventional commercial publisher) so does not meet the standards in either design or content required by any normal publishing company. If that bothers you, don't waste your money and then feel bitter about it (like I did).Edited to add: by the way, I do wish people would stop referring to this book as Medieval, because 1499 is actually in the historical period known as the Renaissance and those are distinct periods which ought not to just be fuddled into one because it was 'before TV and stuff'. Come on, people - if you can't be bothered to check some books, at least search google..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nat Geo 1152 Medium Camera Pouch","review":"National Geographic products are made with the highest quality material. This is my 3rd bag or pouch & I'm already looking for another. Can't get enough. The pouch is perfect for a light trip to the Zoo or Park & you just need to pack a point and shoot small camera with a memory card and an extra battery. Adjustable over the head or shoulder. You can even tighten it around your waist and wear it on your hip. It has a front pocket for a wallet & velcro's closed. Well worth the money in my humble opinion. Very durable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who needs an entree? Go straight to dessert.","review":"The desserts in this charming book are simple to make, gorgeous to look at, and scrumptious to eat. Ms. Gourley's childhood years on a North Carolina farm are remembered with an embracing warmth, and lovingly filled out with old recipes from family and friends. If that isn't enough, her art is as mouth-watering as her desserts, especially the divider sections of the book. Each section opens with a double-page spread watercolor of fruit ripening on trees, and the deftness of her brushwork is almost oriental, but with an added American exhuberance. I guess you can tell I loved this book. I bought one copy for myself, several more to give as gifts, and I'm certain that anyone who buys or receives this book will be delighted. And they will soon be in the kitchen, making magic."},{"rating":"2","title":"best blade i ever used","review":"I have used a lot of different blades in 15 years of laying tile.

Never had that problem and I install 50,000 sq ft a year or more. I alway mark my tiles though and cut them the proper way. This blade also lasts about twice as long as any other blade if not longer. It cuts faster and smoother. I just can't say enough good things about it. Love this blade.

It is hard to belive that as a 5 year old girl she was out herding cattle androunding up wild horses by herself.The descriptions of the landscape in the southern part of Arizona were well written. But, I would have liked to know more aboutwhat happened in the author's life beyond those two years of childhood. Luckily for me The person leading the discussion has researchedthis information.

The authors provided a balance in accounts so that the reader could develop an overall understanding of the man. I found the intricate details of his sexual habits interesting. That the authors could trace to a source to learn such intimate detail, showed the detail to which they researched the book. The book perhaps focused much on the music industry, how songs formed, the bands and musicians that created the entire package \\"Tom Jones\\".

As mentioned by another reviewer, I found the pacing extremely slow. Additionally, however, I found the characters, especially the central one--Materena--dull. As far as I got, there was no real plot, and that in conjunction with unappealing \\"simple\\" characters--the writing tended to reinforce the stereotypical images I know from Gaugain's paintings of Tahitian women--made me quite happy to abandon the book.

It is not a battle of the sexes. Men and women fight against other men and women.A much better movie of this kind is \\"Kilma, Queen of the Amazons\\".

I was quite annoyed when the kick from my $200 kit sounded better than the kick from my $1200 kit. Turns out, replacing the evans head with an aquarian solved 90% of the problem. Then, adding a Remo Falam Slam made the kick sound like it should, a bit better than the export.Notes: As mentioned, I play with a Falam Slam patch, which adds quite a bit to the sound.

If you're into electronica or drum n' bass, you should check this album out.Ultravisitor- 8/10I Fulcrum- 9/10Iambic 9 Poetry- 10/10Andrei- 10/1050 Cycles- 7/10Menelec- 8/10C-Town Smash- 6/10Steinbolt- 5/10An Arched Pathway- 6/10Telluric Piece- 7/10District Line II- 8/10Circlewave- 9/10Tetra-Sync- 6/10Tommib Help Buss- 9/10Every Day I Love- 9.5/10"},{"rating":"1","title":"Man this thing is ugly and freaky looking too","review":"I bought this for my baby's room because we have it decorated in a Bumblebee decor. The animal looks scary, freaky and ugly. The legs and wings sort of flop around and have very little support. The eyes are a shiny green and overall I would not buy this again. I bought it only because of the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Selling Made Simple","review":"I am a sales trainer and consultant and most of my clients are big multi-national corporations. I believe this is one of the worst sales know-how books I have read in a long time. There is no coherant sales processes or concepts in this book. Just whole bunch of war stories and random tips. The content was so disorganized, I stopped reading it about half-way through...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Colonialism.","review":"Loti was a professional seaman. When his ship is moored in Nagasaki, he contacts a matrimonial agent for a 'temporary marriage' with a young Japanese girl, Madame Chrysanthème.The novel narrates his sexual (?), and in any case loveless, relationship with the girl as if Loti is keeping a diary, very anecdotally.Loti has not the slightest interest in the Japanese soul. This work has absolutely no psychological content. Loti looks as a real colonialist disdainful and amused upon Japan and the Japanese.If this novel would have been written today, it would certainly be called racist.But it gives a good picture of Nagasaki at the end of the 19th century.To be read as a document about the relationship between the East and the West in the 19th century and about the arrogant mentality in the West at that time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Plesant Exciting Surprise","review":"This delightful book was recommended by a friend who I did not think was into books. Boy was I wrong. A couple of high school teenagers witness a murder while courting on a moon lit beach in Florida. They naturally report the incident to the authorities, to find their lives could be in danger. The tale moves at a fast pace thru their going to college and their 1930's courtship in the south Florida and Atlanta, Georgia areas. While following a mystery that is suspenseful and not solved until almost the last page at a college football game the reader is treated to an intimate visit with the way it was in the 30's. Entertaing and great for teenagers and seniors alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as shown","review":"The harness I received was different from the picture. The harness was much thinner and less substantial than in the photo and had fewer \\"buckles\\" to adjust to your rabbit. Plus, it just came crumpled in a bag (no cardboard rabbit cutout), and there was a plastic tag with nothing attached as if the tag had been cut. There was short printout of the text that was written online stuffed in the bag as well. Disappointing. Perhaps a different supplier would have provided the proper product."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"CD Cover Wrong\\"","review":"I am wanting to know why the photo says other CD Albums: The Complete Collection with Connie Scott with Forever Young, Hold On & Christmas in Your Heart and not the photo of Heartbeat & SpiritMover?Also do you have the lyrics (words) with the CD's?Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Reading Roget's Thesaurus, But With Lots of Sex","review":"In \\"Total Surrender,\\" Cheryl Holt attempts to join the growing movement of women writing intelligent and romantic erotica for other women. Unfortunately, that boat has sailed without her this time. Holt's idea of writing an intelligent story seems to consist mainly of filling her prose with as many \\"big words\\" as she can find, even if they often make little or no sense in the context, or when a smaller, much more common word would have been the better choice. Yes, this book is very steamy, but the heroine is a dolt, the hero is a cad, and the prose is very purple, so unless your idea of great erotica is the \\"Letters to Penthouse,\\" you should pass on this one. Cheryl Holt's first book, \\"Love Lessons,\\" was better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring! A big let down","review":"Well I was excited to read this story. I had enjoyed LOVE LESSONS so much that I started this one right away. I was very disappointed in the story. It lacked the emotion of the other book. This one was just sex and not much else. I didn't like Michael and he didn't improve any along the way. Sarah was a bit more likeable especially towards the end. I like finding out what had happened to James and Abigail from the first story. I wish I could have liked this more. The sex scenes are hot but I wouldn't call them love scenes. This book will not be read again by me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less 'sex' please and more romance!","review":"I am by no means prudish and enjoy a romance (in whatever form, i.e. historical, thriller, etc.) with sex scenes as long as they move the plot along and/or are important for the characters' development. This, I feel, can not be argued for this book. The sex is tawdry (note: sex not making love) and dare I say it, made me feel icky; the reason is that it's not romantic or special and just plain dull. I felt that once I'd read one scene that I'd read them all - and there were more than a few. As for the plot, it's standard historical romance fare - tortured hero meets spinster and forms a 'relationship', a misunderstanding develops that separates the two lovers and all is resolved in the standard happy ending. There is no panache or real originality in the writing of this, and the author's style of writing is not attractive. All in all, I won't be buying another of Cheryl Holt's books - this was my first and last experience of her writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"I have previously read Cheryl Holt's Love Lessons and enjoyed it tremendously. It was romantic as well as very erotic. I cannot say the same about Total Surrender. There was something missing in this book. It never really captured my interest and it took me weeks(!) to complete this novel.I will think twice about buying her books, simply because they are very repititive."},{"rating":"1","title":"1.5 stars","review":"This plot line had me very annoyed. It's almost a given in romance novel-especially Regencies/historicals, that the hero acts in an asinine way towards to heroine. Usually we expect that the said hero sees the error of his ways, and seeks out the heroine asking for forgiveness. Or maybe he doesnt seek her out, but when he does realise he acted like an a$$, he either begs forgiveness, makes some speech, does SOMETHING...ANYTHING to show REMORSE.Cheryl Holt decided to not have that in her novel (how provincial, she may have though).It really bothered me that for 6 months the heroine was scared wondering how she could eat/live because she was sent away and had no income, and the hero was so caught up in himself he didn't try to find out if she needed aid. And when they did meet up, it was all about sex- or sexual congress as Holt would have called it.All in all, ineffectual hero and silly plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware...","review":"This was a very strange book. I read a lot of historical/regency romances, and don't mind explicit sex, but I thought this was really in the category of soft-core porn. Why? The scenes were extremely explicit -- no euphemisms -- and it felt to me as though the plot only existed as an excuse for the sex scenes. At the beginning of the book, the heroine watches through a peephole as the \\"hero\\" is \\"serviced\\" by several different women as part of a house party turned orgy, all of it very explicitly described. I don't think of myself as a prude, and of course I don't mind at all if other people enjoy this, but don't buy this book thinking you're getting a steamy romance along the lines of Stephanie Laurens, Eloisa James, or Lisa Kleypas. This goes well beyond those, and is a novel that you may be embarrassed to have in the house if you have younger teenagers (or maybe even older ones)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Total Waste of Time","review":"Ah, where do I begin? There were so many, many things that were wrong with this book. Both the hero and heroine were largely unsympathetic characters. Mind you, I have nothing against unsympathetic characters--if they make sense. Michael Stevens and Sarah Compton did not, nor did any of their actions. I was vastly disappointed with this book--Michael was such an interesting character in Love Lessons. In this one, he was nothing like he was depicted to be earlier. To compound this flawed characterization, the storyline was bland and the repetitiveness of the author's word choice irritating. This was a total waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sex, little else","review":"In sum, this tale serves as little more than a frame around a bunch of interesting sexual encounters between a spinster and a rake. Neither come across as particularly appealing or sympathetic characters. I was, in fact, sympathetic to the heroine until she was unjustly accused of scheming to manipulate the hero into matrimony...and then she started to burble happily about it to him at the wedding, when it should have been glaringly obvious to the woman, shown until this point as highly perceptive and intelligent, that her new husband was furious, had just been trapped and tricked, and he plainly thought she was in league with the villain who had put him in this situation. There was no logic to her euphoria, which just made her look as much a user as her villainous brother. Indeed, the heroine is actually very manipulative and pushy in this book, and I didn't much care as to her fate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time...","review":"Trash. Trashy trash at that. Don't waste your time. No plot, no subplot and no substance to the characters. Certainly no integrity in either one. Rubbish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half steamy sex, half ... wait there IS no other half","review":"Yes, the sex was steamy. But there was no relationship between the two main characters. They spent more time talking to themselves in their heads than they did to each other. Sarah, apparently, is extremely good at reading body language, as this is how she learned all about Michael. Michael only needed to know that he lusted after Sarah. Michael's relationship with family friend Pamela was better developed.

It looks good now that it's installed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing soundtrack","review":"With the declining quality of soundtracks these days where most of the tracks are not even heard in the film but put on there for the sake of having a hit single, this soundtrack was a breath of fresh air because it does an amazing job of what a soundtrack is supposed to do: take you back into the movie as the music drifts through your ears. I can't listen to \\"Yumeji's Theme\\" without seeing in my mind the characters slowly passing by each other with longing glances. Every piece of music fits the moment in the movie that they were used in so beautifully from the Chinese opera to Nat King Cole's tracks. This soundtrack is definitely worth owning if you're in the mood for the movie but don't have a DVD player available (like when you're driving in your car)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soulful Longing","review":"The music in this soundtrack is so fitting for the pace of this beautiful but sad love story told to us at a slow easy going pace. My favorite tract being Yumeji's Theme evokes deep emotions from within. Each time it plays in the movie there is no need for words as every glance, motion and thoughts are made known though left unsaid. In a time when movies only include the latest pop music for the sake of profit making this soundtrack rises above all as one which is fitting for the story it unfolds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful movie and soundtrack","review":"The CD is great. And the film is even better. The movie is very subtle and sensuous from the colors, the gestures and the cinematography. I loved the scene where she walks down that narrow stairway to the noodle shop and how the tango music or waltz just breaks your heart. Also how her landlord comments that she dresses to the hilt just to go down to the noodle shop. Gotta go to see the film. It is my best film pick of the year.

There are multiple pockets for pens and other small things in the very front compartment. The back compartment has a built in sleeve and another compartment is big enough for my folders and books. I could really pack a lot in this bag if I need to and I think it would be a great traveling bag for weekend trips or even backpacking. Overall, the bag is comfortable to wear and the straps are nicely padded. I have it in the garden/white/ash color.

Overall I rate this a two due to the premature tearing I have encountered and the lack of space for all my books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"Great product that holds up well.

When it came in the mail, she immediately placed all her school supplies in it for the next day. Since my daughter isn't much of a girly girl, she choose to get a dark green one, and this backpack has a variety of colors, very flexible. There are many zipper compartments to carry many items. My daughter's backpack has been through heavy rain, which I think makes this backpack very durable, and nothing inside got wet. Though everything has it's good side, it also has it's bad. The only flaw for this backpack is that the largest compartment's zipper can get stuck when you pull it. Who knows...maybe it's just this bag. Overall, this bag is very durable and I believe that it will be able to last my daughter's six years at her school until she gets into college."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelent","review":"It is very confortable and it is well-divided for every school needs.

The worst software and support I have ever seen. This scanner is as stable as Charlie Manson on crack. It would work one day, then not even found by it's own software a week later. I would have to use the windows scanning software or my OCR just to scan. It is vulnerable to unstable updates, both HP and Microsoft. After 3 years of this pain it finally got to the point were nothing would work. Device manager would find it but that was it.Support is useless. It's not worth the phone time or emails. Their script monkeys can barely read, let alone help. This POS is on the porch with a hammer in it and I am fishing my old reliable 6200c out of the attic. Oh, for you Linux fans out there.

READ THIS FIRST!","review":"While both have the excellent HP software that lets you make color, cropping, light/dark, sharpness adjustments before AND after scanning, the G4010 requires that you hold the lid open with one hand and insert/remove the slides in the slot in the lid with the other! The slot is wide enough for the plastic negatives insert and too wide for slides so they tend to overlap each other. It can be difficult to get them to stay straight. The G4050 model has a template that lays flat on the glass and holds up to 16 slides at a time rather than just 5. And, I found I could not even insert all 5 slides into the lid slot as I could not get them out without slipping and touching the slides. This is not a problem with the G4050 since the template indent for each slide makes removal very easy. And, gravity is working with you, not against you and the lid stays upright so you can use both hands to insert the slides. The G4050 is definitely worth the extra $$!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Vista, XP didnt work","review":"Good scanner...but software to eliminate red eye or crop pictures didn't work with XP...and is not yet avail for Vista.

Then when I logged out and into my non-admin account the s/w would not run. I had to change the properties to Run As Administrator; kind of defeats the purpose doesn't it? Then my scanned documents were not accessible because they were stored with the admin account and not accessible to a non-admin account. removed the Run As Administrator and tried again. At first, it would not run but then miraculously it did and I've been running fine ever since. The scanner is a nice piece of equipment, but the s/w is not on a par with it.

This time, 45 minutes chatting with a HP technician led me to the same conclusion- a hardware malfunction.I really urge you not to buy this scanner.

The OCR and pdf functions DO NOT WORK with Mac OS 5.X and I got NO response from HP when I reported this problem. I never was able to get a satisfactory slide scan. The seller DID accept a return--less a 15% restocking fee.The Canon CanoScan 8600F is a little more expensive, but all its functions work flawlessly, it comes with at least a hard copy getting started guide, and a single, reasonably user-friendly on-screen guide.

Software included with the scanner does not work with Windows Vista. You can download a Vista version from HP and get the scanner to work, but no matter how many times you install, re-install, search for patches, etc., it is cumbersome and gives a lot of errors. From a quick google search it's apparent that HP scanner software and Windows Vista compatibility has been a problem for a lot of people for a long time, and you'll find a lot of work-arounds but no solutions.

The film makers attempt to add a tripping erie set of sequences which will only get to someone under 14 years old or someone who is actually tripping at the time of viewing. Try Eric Stanze's Ice From The Sun for a low budget acid nightmare feel. This movie fails on so many levels I wonder how it even made it to DVD. After 30 minutes (which seemed like 2 days) I was checking the clock.

This movie is brilliant, straight up. It combines symbolism with atmospheric gore and surreal sequencing. The result: it is terrifying yet artistically delivers a message.

Hollywood simply doesn't know how to make scary movies anymore. With all the gloss and [special] CGI effects so common in blockbusters these days, one has to turn to the indie horror sub-culture for real thrills.DESECRATION hits on several key fears:1) Nuns2) Clowns3) Hell4) Blood. Lots of blood.DESECRATION tells the story of Bobby, a young boy under an overbearing Catholic upbringing, who starts a horrifying chain reaction when he accidentally kills a nun with a remote control plane (!). Not much more can be told about the plot, mainly because the film is by far the scariest at times when the viewer has absolutely no clue what's going on. For example, in one scene, Bobby is trapped in a room where vines are tying themselves around him, and a bloody statue of the Virgin Mary is swiveling around in circles. What's the significance? I don't know, but it's ... scary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very dense and intricate; rewards patience","review":"I have a 1971 Panther paperback copy of Roger Peyrefitte's 'Knights of Malta' that I've had since I was a teenager. I've just re-read it and it does take a deal of patience and a good memory to follow the intricacies of 1950s Vatican politics - complex then as now. At just over 250 pages, it's hardly a door-stopper, but it is a challenging read. The interest is in the fact that the characters were real people, but you can never know how much of Peyrefitte's narrative and dialogue is as real. Try reading something like Focault's Pendulum beforehand to get into the right frame of mind, but recommended if this kind of thing is what you like and if you can find a copy anywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Duchamp Revelry","review":"I am not a Duchamp scholar, just a big, big fan who has spent years pursuing my admiration of the artist, the prankster and the genius. This book revels in all three aspects of Duchamp's oeuvre not to mention it is a true joy to hold, read, touch. A bibliophile's appreciation combined with a scholarly interest make this book highly enjoyable and frankly, lots of fun. For the German scholar, all articles are printed in both their German as well as English translations. From an art historical perspective, the text is very well integrated with the presentation of artwork, which includes vellum overlays, making the experience interactive and a sensory delight. This is revelry in true Duchamp; his fun, whimsy and always revolving and diverging vision."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quibbles with the narration","review":"I've listened to George Guidall before, and especially enjoyed his wonderful reading of JOHNNY TREMAIN (coincidentally another Boston book, albeit 230 years before DARK HARBOR).

It grated on my ear to hear Whitey Bulger's name consistently mispronounced as BUHL-gher (like the grain) rather than BUHL-jer. The Anguillo crime family, or what's left of them after Whitey Bulger helped the FBI put most of them out of business, is pronounced An-JEW-low, not An-GWEE-low.

I think my personal favorite (though it is hard to choose) is a photograph of farmers washing their sheep in the river before shearing them, as opposed to washing the wool afterwards. That is just one of the many wonderful images presented in this book. Along with the pictures, the writing is very clear and provides the needed background to understand the story told by the photos.

This is, in my opinion, a great workout. It is exactly 30 minutes, does not require any equipment at all and is easy to follow. Leslie's personality is right for the job - she trully motivates you without being too perky, annoying or pushing too hard.But, unfortunately, this DVD has very poor sound and video quality. Sound is just awful. There is noise from the microphone, music is practically inaudible and the voice level is way too high. Camera work is amateurish and there seem to be someone behind the camera that Leslie and group look at and talk to all the time. Picture quality is like an old VHS tape.

Really? Then why are two of them wearing huge, unflattering, low-self-esteem black T-shirts - I've been known to hide in these garments myself, but I am NOT a fitness expert!), plus some of the cues are so haphazard, even the \\"instructors\\" flail their arms goofily trying to catch up at one point.Sansone can be brilliant - but this walk was incredibly dull, lacks the sort of perky flow between moves that make so many of her dvds a pleasure, and made me horribly aware I was just another broad wearing out the floor in front her tv."},{"rating":"1","title":"A DVD Walking tape?????","review":"I have to take part of the blame on this one - I didn't even think that a Walking tape would be in DVD form and purchased it without thinking.

Leslie does her basic 4 steps with a nice little warm-up. The pace quickly picks up and her movements are never boring. I like the fact that she uses the arms with her walking steps so I feel like I get an upper body as well as a lower body workout. There are no weights in this one as in some of the her other videos. I have about 6 of Leslie's DVD's and I like all of them. I gave this one a 4 because she's a bit chatty and the music is sometimes difficult to hear. All in all, you'll get a great workout in just 30 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout!","review":"This is the 2nd Leslie Sansone walk video I purchased. I like it very much. The workout is good. She increases the speed and intensity of the workout gradually so it is easy to keep up. The 30 minutes goes quickly and it is easy to get this video in every day. There are only two things I do not like. First, she talks way too much (she even admits that during the workout). Second, the music is hard to hear.

Some students even waited to let him finish his math first, yet when it was time to help him find his seat (a legitimate need) the teacher discouraged it.

And, carrying paper also adds weight, so my suitcase regularly hit or slightly exceeded the 50# limit.

After watching this film I found the few reviews here on Amazon (which initially convinced me to give it a try) to be rather misleading. In reality, this movie is just one step away from being awful. The story line was widely implausible, and the majority of the actors were amateurish and flat. Many of the filming angles in certain scenes were just bizarre. The narration during the beginning and the end was merely compensation for poor story telling, and the violence (mostly unreal) seemed far out of character with the rest of the tone of the movie. The movie does depict a moment or two where the lead characters show heart, and for that reason I give it two stars.

However, I don't see as well as I used to so I kept wishing they would turn on some lights somewhere or do more of the filming closer to the windows. It was tedious straining to see what was going on. Also, the movie moved slowly and seemed repetitive for endless minutes. It bothered me too that the King was tense and unable to speak up until the very end when he gave the WWII speech, when he suddenly became confident, smiled, and was able to speak.

I couldn't bear to look at him. i left wondering how much artistic license was taken with this \\"docudrama\\". Indeed, I think it to be a work of pure fiction based on a skeleton of trutn.

However, one must have some sense of decency when having the stage, when having the ear or attention of a great number of people. Some sense of what one should portray as good, evil, or as 'okay'. And the more artful one is, the greater the shame when bad is portrayed as good. The British royal family was portrayed as a cuddly bunch of 'okay' folks with the impediments of wealth and, occasionally, stuttering. Subject matter matters. To do a story about a member of this group of people in any light other than dark and brooding, is disingenuous. However, power can and often does create its own mystique, and its own legend. This film, along with the upcoming wedding, is rated RG, for rational guidance suggested."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"enjoyed this movie. I was a little girl when this was history.

However, long before Bertie becomes king, he seeks the assistance of a speech therapist (Geoffrey Rush) to help him get rid of a lifelong stammer. This is a wonderful film about friendship, duty, and perseverance.

Apparently the copy protection on the disc is so strong it fools the players into thinking they don't have enough memory to play it. My experience was that the player took nearly ten minutes to grind haltingly through the first ninety seconds of the movie. To add insult to injury, a group of inane movie previews you are basically forced to watch before getting to the main menu play fine. The DVD is nearly as good quality and plays fine in any DVD or BD player. Don't waste the extra money on the unplayable Blu-Ray disc!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every reward","review":"First and foremost The King's Speech is the story of a friendship and of the triumph of King George VI over his own daemons.

First and foremost this is a touching story of a true friendship that lasts many years and has its ups and downs and survives. That one of the friends becomes a king adds to the interest of the film but to me was not the main stone in the crown. The settings are beautiful and the cinema photography is superb. The only slight negative for me is that I felt that the actor who played Churchill -- Timothy Spall -- was unconvincing. Spall played Peter Pettigrew (\\"Wormtail\\") in Harry Potter and I thought he was great there but only so-so here. But that is a minor weakness in an outstanding film well worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"GEORGE VI AND THE WOMAN HE LOVED","review":"I LOVED this movie, The reason I LOVE this movie so much is that FINALLY, FINALLY after 75 YEARS Bertie and Elizabeth get to be the A plot story instead of ALWAYS being relegated to the B plot story in the abdication of David for the woman he loved pffffft. Added on to that the fact that Bertie had a stammer that I never knew about until I saw this movie and that he had this friendship with Lionel Logue that people were not aware of and you realize that Bertie and Elizabeth had just as an incredible a story as David did with the abdication and the woman he loved. In the end I would choose Bertie and Elizabeth's life story over David's life story in an instant. I know this is a little late in the game But did ANYBODY give any thought or consideration to a MAKING OF BOOK for The King's Speech.

This is an engaging, entertaining, heart-wrenching, and rewarding film to watch. Except for a few--actually extremely funny--short scenes of expletives, this film is suitable for ages 15 to adult.

Hence, there are a lot of bad fantasy films. This movie easily finds its way into my list of the top ten worst fantasy films of all time. It simply lacks anything to recommend it, except possibly for some 8 to 12 year old children. Most of what the other one star votes have said is true.

A race of reptilian aliens? Give me a break. I don't like the Christopher Pike books that envolve the supernatural and science fictiion, I like the stories such as Chain Letter and Weekend. Scavenger Hunt is definitely Pike's worst, and I'm his # 1 fan. Better luck next time. Try Master of Murder or another one of his other books for something really scary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and wierd","review":"This book was hardly horrifying for a horror book and when I read it at night I wasn't the least bit scared. The ending was idiotic, but surprising. It was totally unrealistic. I would recommend Chain Letter as one of Pike's better books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I dunno about ya'll but this book was awesome I really enjoyed this book like all his books I've read they are all really good I haven't found one I haven't liked so far but this one was really good I really liked they way the girl liked him and he didn't know about it it was really good but there was some sad parts in it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Twisted, but creative!","review":"This book was very interesting, but to really enjoy it like I do I'd reccomend being open minded. Although some people find the ending far fetched, but I think it's just as reasonable as aliens in outerspace. I loved this book, and I love how Christopher Pike keeps the knowledge that anything's possible alive!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Replying","review":"i totally agree with the customer that read this book in NY,NY. I luv Christopher Pike's books, but not when he takes them into the paranormal. I don't like anything he writes about aliens or sourcerers, but I do luv his books that involve a good suspenseful mystery. If you ask me, his series Final Friends was excellent. I'm on my way to read the Remember Me series. I hope it will be as good as Weekend, Final Friends, Master of Murder, and Chain Letter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy this book if you love to be confused and frustrated","review":"Jumpin' Jim's book begins with some very basic instruction on the fundamentals of the ukulele. Then it proceeds with some \\"simple\\" songs to play, that would be simple if Jumpin' Jim didn't expect you to inherently know where to place your fingers on the fretboard to acheive the particular notes, and rather informed in the introduction. After flipping through the book to see if there is any sort of diagram that would shed some light on where to place your fingers you will find an incredibly confusing diagram on the second to last page. If you don't know very much about stringed instruments, and wish to learn to play the ukulele, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK for you will find it both confusing and frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the best","review":"very little instruction on strumming styles, patterns, or tricks, no audio files and the songs included are exclusively hokey old bible-camp songs from the turn of the century that nobody wants to play (home on the range, buffalo gals, you're a grand old flag, etc.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Music for an Excellent Cause","review":"I was fortunate enough to be at this concert, and it was truly awesome. I've been waiting ever since for the cd and dvd to be released, and I was not disappointed. The album has that vibrant quality only live albums seem to pull off. It's a great mix of the best of the Austin music scene, and generally just a feel good, rocking album. If you're not familiar with some of the artists on this cd, namely the Joe Ely Band, Bruce Robison, Kelly Willis, & Patty Griffith, and Alejandro Escovedo, this a good way to check them out, and help out a good cause."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice book, but with little detail","review":"This book is a masterpiece when it comes to picture quality and when you are looking for a book that covers the most common species. If you have special interest in one or some species, the book is far from detailed enoughAlso, the book makes a great present for a bird lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic adventure through time, space and sacred secrets","review":"Sarah and Alexander is one of those stories that brings to life the characters and situations so vividly that you immediately start assigning actors and actresses to play them in your mind.The heroine, Sarah Manning discovers the secrets of her lineage in an adventure that spans from when her grandmother Rose is saved from the Nazis in WWII into the future. The story brilliantly intertwines the best of what you would read a sci-fi/time travel, spy or conspiracy novel for; taking along you on a DaVinci Code-esque mission. This book is a fun, touching, mystical and gripping page turner that reinvents the classic battle against good and evil."},{"rating":"2","title":"PERFECT!","review":"I purchased 6 of these for scrapbooking paper - the 12 x 12 sheets and they worked perfectly!

The pause and pour feature is fine - if you can pour in less than five seconds - if not it drips hot coffee on your hand as you replace the pot. The worst feature, consistently, is the burner. All three have given me problems from not keeping the coffee warm enough to being so hot the coffee gets a strong bitter taste. Take my advice and skip this as your purchase choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"This coffee maker is driving me nuts!","review":"Have had this Mr. Coffee for about a year now and I can't wait to get rid of it. I've always been satisfied with this brand in the past, but no more! There is some defect in the pot design that causes drips and dribbles from every pour, have to hold the pot over the sink to minimize the mess every morning. And the too-bright blue LED lights are harsh on the eyes in the early morning dark kitchen. I keep a paper towel over those lights. This thing has to go, am real sorry I bought it and wish it would break so I don't feel like I'm wasting money in getting a new one. Keep shopping unless these issues are not a problem for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two makers when bad.","review":"I had two of these makers and both went bad. The first one I used every day for a couple of years. You know how these makers gurgle at the end of the brew cycle as they suck the last of the water out of the reservoir? Well, one morning it just wouldn't stop gurgling, and when I investigated, the back of the unit was getting real hot. So I ended up tossing it away. I had another maker in the house for guest to use (I drink decaf). So I was going to use it, but it seemed that the programable clock/delay chip must have crashed because the maker would turn itself off and on as I watched the lights, and it would not turn on at the delay time. So I tossed it too and bought a different brand.I also experienced the dripping lid problem that other reviewers have commented on, as well as the filter that would cave in and let grounds into the carafe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't wait to toss in the garbage","review":"What a piece of junk. This thing always drips and makes a mess when you remove the carafe, regardless of the brew cycle being complete or not. The teflon on the hot plate is flaking off after a few months use. I had a Gevalia that I received free with a coffee subscription that lasted a few years with none of these issues. When my kitchen renovation is complete this will be tossed as quickly as I can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr Coffee","review":"I have been buying Mr Coffee coffee makers for years and loved them until I purchased this design.This redesign is awful.First,the coffee keeps dripping when you remove the pot; not just as brewing,but always.The new design is strange in that the lid that opens in order to pour water in the reservoir is the entire top,therefore, so large you cannot fully open it if you have upper cabinets. You have to pull the entire pot to the edge of the counter to open the lid.Very poor design.I disliked it so much I threw it away after 3 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"dripping pot","review":"I returned my Mr. Coffee after 2 days because I couldn't pour a cup of coffee from this pot design without it srteaming down the front of the pot and all over everything. I was pretty sure it wasn't just me since I have no problem with my old Bunn pot, but still felt better when I saw another reviewer with the same complaint. Like that reviewer, I can't believe Mr Coffee doesn't know it is a flawed design and already have corrected it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A note about the music","review":"This is not a review of the DVDs, which I have not seen. I have, however, heard broadcasts of these performances, and a word of warning is in order. Many of the reviewers here have commented on the rewritten dialogue in these productions - but there has been little said about the rewritten music. These are emphatically NOT Sullivan's own graceful and apt orchestrations, but rescorings by Stratford Festival music director Berthold Carriere. To my ear, they infinitely cheapen and coarsen the score. This isn't just a matter of reorchestration but of additions, unecessary hoking-up, and elevator-music touches like upward modulations between verses. Such things may be fine on Broadway - most B'way composers didn't orchestrate their own shows anyway - and they may not bother some listeners, but for lovers of Sullivan's music they may be painful to hear. They certainly make these productions unlistenable for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed this with my family.","review":"It was very nice!!Especially,I admired Eric Donkin's performance. Of course,everybody was really vivid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good service. Questionable product quality.","review":"The Vendor got this to me very expeditiously. The discs do NOT operate properly.

I have seen high school productions, and none as bad as this. Mikado should NEVER be \\"modernized\\" - American Express has no place in any production of it. It was all just too, too precious for words. Terrible, terrible, terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor","review":"I'm tempted to say terrible. I was taken in by the promise of this book, after all it is a good subject, but Ms. James falls far short in delivering on the promise. The book is riddled with inaccuracies and is condescending towards the reader, of whom it assumes very little. Unless you're totally unfamiliar with the modern world then this book is a waste of good reading time"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting title with lack of content","review":"Like the other reviewer, I was also taken in by the promise suggested on the cover, but I was shocked by how little the book tells us to \\"think in the future tense.\\" Many of the examples that she gave about modern technology are false and naive at best. It makes one question where the author has been for the last 20 years. The section titles did offer some interesting guidelines for how to think differently, but the content was just horriblely wrong and bland. The best way to approach the book is to read the section titles only and skip the rest of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thinking in the Future Tense: A Workout for the Mind","review":"If we compare Jennifer James' \\"Thinking in the Future Tense\\" with Daniel Burrus' \\"Technotrends,\\" we may feel disappointed that James seems to be falling behind the hightech train. But if we understand that James is operating from an anthropologist's stand point, we must actually thank her for making the effort in helping us to appreciate the use of cultural anthropology in formulating practical philosophy.I am especially impressed with her ability to drive home her points using anthropological terms such as perspective, culture, values, etc. without long paragraph of definition and at the same time not betraying the professional understanding of those terms."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Halloween show ever!","review":"This show is funny, spooky, and packed with adventure. My daughter first saw this in school during show and tell, then we bought it at a Rite Aide Drugstore. A tap dancing pumpkin who protects children from Halloween monsters leads a group of neighborhood kids to battle an ogre. My kids were riveted. Unlike Charlie Brown's \\"The great pumpkin\\" this pumpkin shows up and triumphs over evil. There are wrestling skeletons , a flying snake, and Rotundra Lord of the Thunderbellies(pumpkin king). The animation is great, like Shrek, and it's funny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Video For All Ages","review":"Excellent film for children of all ages, even a \\"big kid\\" like myself. My four children, ages ranging from 12 to 6, also enjoyed it. The story line keeps you interested throughout the entire video. The animation is great and you'll love the \\"Thunderbellies\\"!!!! This is a \\"must have\\" for Halloween, but you can watch it throughout the year as it sends children a message that they should never give up. The video - a few dollars, getting an important message across to you children while they're enjoying a great video - priceless!! Get yours today; you won't be disappointed. For the big kids, the Casper cartoons on the DVD are an added bonus!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable Durability","review":"I love these shoes.

Her accounts of the races and the set backs are so true and fair that it brings back a LOT of memories from that time. Her gutsy personality comes through on every page. Cars from the North with part-time racers were treated almost as rough as green cars with female drivers. Janet was and is so much a lady. I am buying copies for all my former crew so we can remember a wonderful time in our lives. AJ was and is true gentleman. The Woods brothers were also. If you have raced, you need this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Excellent for writing Author/Publisher contracts from the perspective of the Publisher.

This 2nd book, covering the 80's horror gore films, should have never even been published, let alone written. The editor comes across bitter, frustrated, and downright mean about the films he's reviewing...which is strange considering the films from the 60's and 70's are even worse than the ones from the 80's. I just don't see the point of this book. Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was Stine thinking?","review":"First of all he seems to hate Splatter Movies of the eighties. Every second film is worthless in his opinion. Of course some of this films are cheap and senseless but Mr. Stine seems to lack any kind of objectivity. He was nastier than most of the films effects putting everything down, especially Rock and Metalmusic of the eighties. And that really made me mad because i love this music.

There are Egyptian words, with English spelling, throughout and these are supported by a glossary in the back.

While there is plenty that younger children can learn from this guide, it is definitely targeted towards a more mature audience. In general, this is more of a \\"how to\\" guide than the others.

There isn't much outstanding about Wand's quite conventional conducting, and the sound quality is no better than good FM stereo. I feel like I'm putting nails into coffins, but the cologne Radio Orch. is nobody's idea of a great ensemble, although it's a good one.The CD ends with a very forceful, well-conceive Coriolan Over. that held my attention and a conventional 'Fidelio' Over. that lacked a bit in dramatic suspense and featurees a feeble horn section.

I had no idea about the life of Boy George. I DID NOT put this book down. I only read biographies and this is the best. He has a great sense of humor considering what he has been through, and at times I had tears in my eyes from laughing(at the expense of Marilyn). It is a long book but you may want to read it again...I did. Boy George had courage and held nothing back telling us about his life,good and bad. It makes you feel sad to know he went through such events as close friends all around him dieing and to feel good about him facing the fact he had to change his life or he would not be here now.

I think his handling of \\"traditional\\" church wasn't as well thought out as it could have been. I selected the book knowing I was reading something profoundly different from some of the other church leadership books I had been reading. I would have much rather he just outlined this as a \\"House Church\\" model and marketed the book as such. Sure we can make the claim that the early churches in the New Testament were house churches but that was because Christianity was so new. The church building was a product of the need for a house of worship that evolved from the house church.My advice to church leaders considering the book? Take the basics that are presented here and give thoughtful study to the paradigms that are presented. I felt those were helpful. The rest is just rehashed material.

This is so perfect for those situations..u pull out a piece of the bag, tie it at one end, slip in the diaper, and tie the other end.

Since the prints are from Chaplin's archives, the quality is excellent, with all films projected at the proper speed. Though \\"Sunnyside\\" (1919) and \\"A Day's Pleasure\\" (1919) are among the comedian's weaker efforts, the First National DVD contains much of Chaplin at his best. \\"Shoulder Arms\\" (1918) and \\"The Pilgrim\\" (1923) represent the high-water mark of this collection - both featurettes comparing favorably to Chaplin's groundbreaking work for Mutual. The Little Tramp's final shorts, \\"The Idle Class\\" (1921) and \\"Pay Day\\" (1922), are well worth having and display a stylish advance in cinematic technique. Admittedly, the Chaplin First Nationals do not equal the sustained brilliance of the Mutual period, but they remain a fascinating chronicle of his transition from shorts to features."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"This book did not deliver its promise even though the topic as such is very interesting.

And on the other hand, this blending makes pieces such as \\"Zwielicht\\", \\"Nessun Dorma\\", and \\"Larghetto\\" more accessible to a larger audience.A major consideration here is that neither the classical nor the popular works are compromised.

Don Byron, that's who.The personal highlight is definitely 'It's Over' which former Pat Metheny Group vocalist Mark Ledford handles adeptly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creatively Clever","review":"Interesting and creatively clever idea with equally clever play. Mellow and enjoyable from beginning to end, with Byron excelling throughout. This is an intriguing lineup of music and song which at first might seem a bit odd or disjointed, but it ain't. It actually sounds thematic, like an aural drama of some sort..., with one possible exception. The song \\"Reach Out I'll Be There\\" dosen't quite seem to fit the motif. It's well played, but seems misplaced within this lineup (so program it out).

Most of my hand tools are Bosch, but they don't have a full size right angle cordless drill, so I purchased the Dewalt. The Dewalt is inferior to Bosch in so many ways. First, the reverse switch is too small and hidden. It's difficult to switch when you're under a cabinet or in a tight space and try with just one hand. Secondly, the chuck is difficult to tighten and again requires two hands. Try a Bosch chuck, and you'll instantly know why the Dewalt chuck is worthless. Third, if it falls, the battery typicall falls out. Hey, no one wants to drop their tools, but it happens. When it does, I just want to pick it up, not reassemble it. So, in a nut shell, I haven't been impressed and only use this when it's absolutely necessary for the space. I'll be selling it soon as I'm getting the new Bosch Lithium drivers. They work great for the occasional tight space with none of the draw backs listed above."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too big to be useful","review":"This drill is very large. My big hands can't even make it all the way around it to squeeze the trigger comfortably. Very unsteady.Not typical of DeWalt, mine arrived with a chuck that spun around in an elliptical fashion, instead of circular. It would not drill a single hole. But that is rare. My review of 2 stars is based on the disappointing size. For what you need this drill for (getting into tight spaces), maybe a Makita would be better.

It appears that it is better to purchase your tools where they can be tested.

The plot is difficult to read as dialogue is cut short and some scenes feel more like a summary. The plot twists (and I use that term lightly here) are so ridiculous you will just roll your eyes. The switch between the present and past reflections were ok, but every time they did it the voice changed from third to first person so you had no idea which character was speaking. It's a shame since the male character, in particular, had promise. This book is a big miss when it comes to writing, character development, storyline, and plot.I rarely write revews but this book was such a disappointment I had to warn others about purchasing.

However, with a little more work and a little more imagination the idea this movie was based on could have seemed much more original. With better acting, the same director, and a bit more true to life scenario, this could have been a fantastic film. I reccomend watching it to see how unlike real life it is, and to compare notes with your friends on how you would alter it. Definetly a rental, not worth buying, unless you like movies that will collect dust on your shelf, seeing it once is enough, but I do reccomend a viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The \\"Big Chill\\" for Lesbians gave me the cold shoulder.","review":"This film starts off with bad acting, and continues with it to the end. The story throws you into a group of friends that have known eachother for 15 years, and you forever feel like the outsider looking in. They go into the history of everyone's relationships within the first 5 minutes, before you can even get a grip on the charactor's names. The plot is simply a group of whiney-something's that reunite for a weekend of frolick, and sex. The characters have a few moments where they actually seem endearing. Unfortunately, the moment quickly passes, and they are once again flat, and uninteresting. This was one movie I wish I could have walked out of and asked for my money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!

I see this has not just been happening to me, and in some cases it has happened more than once.

If the deal sounds too good to be true, it is. I read where someone bought this, so I looked it up. The only problem is you only receive one bottle of liquid instead of the 25 promised.

I called Amazon and they gave me the number to contact BZB Global, but of course you can not get a hold of them, because their mailbox is full. So I sent BZB Global an email and have never received a reply and that has been a couple of weeks ago. It would have been different if the pricing was an actual mistake, but the price on this product was the same for almost a month.

This book along with the course is God inspired.","review":"This book was not written by Henry T. Blackaby & Claude V. King. They were only God instruments. This is a wonderful piece of God-inspired work that should be mandatory in every church. If you want your life to drastically change in a God-filled way, read and take this course. May God bless these two brothers in Christ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read with caution.","review":"The author says 'agree with God even when you're not sure what He's saying'. When you read such you should proceed with caution because that's exactly what a cult would say. As a Christian, Jesus wants us to know everything - how can we follow something vague? God gave human beings a wonderful gift that seems to be dormant in much Christian teaching these days -it's called 'common sense'."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book is Changing My Life","review":"A friend of mine suggested I use this workbook to help me in my walk with God.

Simply approach the exercises with a prayerful, honest and open heart, God will do the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff","review":"Just started going through this material, and I am really being blessed by it. Given my own theological background, I can't say I agree with all of it (when do you find something you always agree with!), but I really like the overall emphasis: it's not about you, it's about GOD! You can't just fill in the blanks; you've got to think about what they're saying, and apply it to yourself. Then I think the lights will come on, and the Spirit will start pointing you toward a radical God-centeredness.I was studying this book along with the book of Jonah, and the parallels are neat. Anyway, this book is helpful. Good stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Experiencing God review","review":"I looked for the description of each available book and I choose this one because it had the best description that I was looking for.

Since then I have facilitated a couple of groups myself and I cont to learn each time I go through the book. I highly recommend this book to everyone. This is for those who don't know the Lord and want to gain a foundation and for those who are new, and highly recommended for those of us who have been called, but cont to need the challenge and encouragement in our walk.

I honestly felt as if I were in grammar school again, and being asked to fill in repetitive, simple exercises. Definitely no deep thinking here!God has given us everything we need to know about His will in the Bible. As long as you are following the Bible, you are free in Christ to choose your options using Godly counsel. If God wants to close off an option, He will do so.I would recommend instead: Gary Friesen's book *Decision Making and the Will of God* or *Finding the Will of God: A Pagan Notion?* by Bruce Waltke & Jerry McGregor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone (Blackaby) understanding of God-not mine for sure","review":"This book had me going for awhile but then I saw its narrowmindness . In a way, author made a \\"spiritual theory\\" of experiencing God under which he invites you to put your own life. After reading this book I am seriously start to think about Orthodoxy. Taking verses from Bible putting them out of context or putting them in a way that will be profitable for spiritual theory of Blackaby. I mean every one of us Protestants can write a book about his or her own spiritual way to God and then present it as the right way to follow God!?!?

However, when I followed the directions for the folding chair the measurements for some of the lengths of wood and the measurements for many of the holes that were to be drilled were totally inaccurate. If the author actually built this project, then the errors are in the review before publishing. Since there are no measurements on the drawings that are shown, the text must be accurate.

Grapevine & Willow frame: completed but it is not very strong - again nails used, being nailed into soft pith wood does not work;Basket Planter: Top of basket sides will not hold if directions are followed. I have made this basket a few times but have had to adapt and change it radically for it to work and be strong.Hostess Stand:worked. I keep trying these projects because the ideas look so great.

It gives you what you might expect given the painstaking chore of citing locations of over 1300 monuments & markers: \\"very general locations\\", in short, it will get you in the vicinity of a marker, but I would gather you could travel two miles on a road trying to find a marker location described as \\" West Conferderate Avenue\\" (I'm not kidding here). A very general road map with the names of main roads is provided on the back cover, but you get no other graphics what so ever, like a grid identification system (i.e. A-3, B-8, etc.), to get you closer than just the name of the road. This guide is good for determining/confirming IF there is a marker on the field for a specific regiment (say a distant relative, great-great grandfather) and where you can wander around to find it, but beyond this it will not save you alot of time or aggravation. Look closely at the Thomas description, it doesn't promise you alot, and you don't get a whole lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculously short jacket","review":"My son is only 2 1/2 and the bottom of the jacket came to a little over an inch above the waistband of his jeans. If it is this short on a 2 year old, I can't imagine what it would look like on a child who wears a size 3 or 4. If your child is just barely growing into a 2T, then it might work. My son is beginning to grow out of his 2T clothing and this was way too short. Size aside, the jacket was in good condition. It would've made a very cute costume if it fit properly. It would be nice if the manufacturer would make the jacket length part of its description."},{"rating":"1","title":"2-4T Toddler 50s Rebel Costume Jacket","review":"The jacket is quite expensive but in not made very well.

Both Mark Wahlberg and Christian Bale's performances are spectacular. Wahlberg plays a down on his luck boxer who though has a ton of talent, his manager/mother keeps lauding the past accomplishments of his brother Dickey (Bale) a crack addict who swears he'll have a comeback. Bale is eerily on point as an addict and shows the raw face of crack addiction with depth, (but then again did you expect any less from such an amazing actor?), Wahlberg is convincing as a boxer having prepared for the role over the course of two years. A spectacular movie well-worth seeing whether you're a boxing fan or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fighter","review":"Very well done movie with great performances by Christian Bale, Melissa Leo and Mark Walhberg.

My family saw it in the theater and just had to add it to our home collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less of a boxing movie, more of a re-hab family drama flic","review":"Not a treat for the boxing fan, it's just too dramatic and focuses on the family drama surrounding a crack addict. There's barely any action, suspense, romance, or comedy in it (or boxing for that matter). The best part of the film is the original HBO footage of the older brother fighting. The preview is a huge spoiler too, I can't recommend this film, it's mildly entertaining with a good cast, but the parts of the story they choose to focus on were quite unappealing for a boxing fan like me. The choreographed fight scenes are pretty unrealistic as well, all in all left me with a bad taste in my mouth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but only because of Bale","review":"I am writing this review as a casual boxing movie fan. Having seen all of the offerings over the past decade or so, this movie was entertaining in comparison only because of Christian Bale's excellent representation of the would-be champ who (tripped) knocked down Sugar Ray. He nails the quirky and witty remarks & mannerisms of Micky Ward's brother, Dicky. Wahlberg's performance is essentially a mail-in ... he fits the role well, but seemed uninspired. This is coming from someone who typically enjoy's Mark Wahlberg's movies, too. Amy Adams plays the (at first) hard-to-get bar maid and eventual love interest of Micky.Obviously, the movie is more about the messed up Ward family dynamics and the love/(not quite) hate relationship between two brothers carving their niche in the boxing world.Overall, 4 stars ... something for both men & women in the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie!","review":"This was one of the best movies of the year. I thought it was a little too short! Mark W. and Christian Bale did an excellent job with their characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pugilistic Pap","review":"We sat through the entire nearly two hours of this, waiting for it to develop into more than a bunch of low-lifes throwing insults and fists at each other. We were disappointed.The film offers an up close view of the incredibly depressing life of a bunch of losers in Lowell, MA, one of whom eventually manages to make it big. And, oh yeah, there were a few boxing scenes thrown in there. But there were no characters you'd be interested in enough to care about what happens to them. When the end credits rolled, my only thought was 'so what'?Judging by the high ratings many other reviewers gave this, my opinion is apparently in the minority. The only thing I can think of that might explain this is different attitudes toward dialog. So, if your idea of a clever, inspired script is one where the f-bomb gets dropped every 30 seconds or so, add another star to my rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low life trash in predictable story","review":"How many boxng movies can be made where you know the star's going to win the big one at the end? Not much story line and the characters were all total low life trashy people who had to use the 'F' word in every thing they said. I was bored and started fast forwarding the fight scenes to get to the 'big finale'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Degrading and awful","review":"I have met Mickey Ward several times at the International Boxing Hall of Fame, and this year he and Dick Ecklund were both in attendance. They seemed to be fine men, a far cry from the drug-addled trash depicted in the movie. The movie's plot hopscotched all over the place, making it impossible to follow, and the dialogue was largely unintelligible -- except for profuse use of the \\"F\\" word. In short, a piece of trash, not worth the film it's made on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Been done before !","review":"Goofy & boring 10 mins was all I could handle of this dvd I am glad I did not pay to go to see it the dvd was a gift. I might even see if it can be resold on Amazon that how much I did not like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Fighter, disappointing.","review":"Rented \\"The Fighter\\" last night. What a disappointment. This could of been such a great movie if they would of focused more on Ward's boxing and less on his nutzo family. Thought I rented a boxing story and instead I rented a Jerry Springer family with a little boxing thrown in. The acting by Bale was superb and Whalberg's acting was pretty good too. In the end great acting, or any other part of great film making cannot rescue a story line that would of been better suited for \\"Jerry Springer, the Movie\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Too much reality. I guess I just don't like these kinds of movies. I don't like watching crack atticts. I don't like to watch what really happens in life. I like to escape in movies and to be entertained, not be brought down. Though it has a good ending, most of it concntrates on family fights and drug addiction. Not the movie for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate the fact I couldnt watch it!","review":"In order to download the movie I had to buy the movie first. Seemed odd. Then when I tried to download it, AMAZON told me they could not dowload it because I was not in a country that AMAZON was permitted to dowload to my machine (I was in my apartment in Paris). So I was charged anyway, with an incipid apology.By the way, after this awful experience I tried iTunes. They didnt have that prohibition. Score: Amazon 0 iTunes 1"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yo Adrien!","review":"I will start off by saying I think Christian Bale and Marc Walberg are crap actors. I also don't like the fact it appeared as though Christian Bale was on crystal meth in this movie, hence all the weight loss and cracked out looking face. The other factor why I didn't like this film is that the premise of the movie has already been done, 5 times. Rocky 1,2,3,4,5. This was an overated piece of crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE MOVIE!","review":"EVERYONE IN THE MOVIE WAS SO LOW-CLASS.

Although difficult to watch at times because it was hard watching lives fall apart the movie as a whole is inspiring. I want to get out there and box now. Great, inspiring movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"It stalled a couple of times...","review":"I thought the \\"Used - Very good\\" condition would let me watch the entire movie but it stalled 2 times. You could notice multiple but minor scratches. In the end, I went back to the main menu and selected the following chapter and was able to continue and finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Against All Odds?","review":"The stories surrounding this instant boxing classic is really what makes the magic happen. Mark Wahlberg spent over a year of his life preparing for his role as Micky Ward, researching the boxer's life and times in Lowell MA and training for this authentic portrayal. He gave place to Christian Bale, who found his niche in history with an Oscar performance as Best Supporting Actor in playing Ward's brother, boxer/trainer Dicky Eklund. Ward's Rockyesque rise from club fights to the world title is paralleled by Eklund's triumph over crack addiction. The authenticity of the flick was guaranteed by the true-life figures in the tale remaining on location in Lowell for consultation as Wahlberg sought to make this saga as accurate as possible.For those who want to see Ward at his absolute best, get a video copy of his first fight with Arturo Gatti. It is an astounding \\"Fight of the Century\\" that would be the icing on a magnificent cake presented by master chef Wahlberg."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christian Bale IS the film!","review":"This is a film based on a true story that we've all heard before in one form or another. All the acting was pretty good, but I have to say, Christian Bale made this film. When I first saw him on the film, I actually thought, \\"Wow, is Bale now on drugs?\\" As I quickly learned the story, I started to admire every aspect of his acting to capture the essence of the character - his looks, his accent, his walk, his chewing... He deserves his Best Supporting Actor Golden Globe!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Christian Bale saved this movie","review":"I watched The Fighter last night. I believe the \\"white trash\\" family was so oversimplified/caricatured that it made them all look like their IQ's hovered somewhere around 70, just above the cut off for intellectual disability and definitely bordering on emotional/developmental disability. Anyway, Christian Bale's performance was outstanding... the only well written/played character in the movie. I had a difficult time keeping Mark Walberg's \\"Boogie Nights\\" character separated from his performance in this movie! Except for Bale, the movie was a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Fighter","review":"The acting was fine and I know that in real life that people are prone to profanity but it isn't needed to get the point of the movie across. It diminishes the quality and, in this case, there is so much of it that the storyline becomes unimportant. If you tire of movies with an over-indulgence of profanity then this one isn't for you. This is a 'NO BUY' movie for us and I'm happy that we only rented it. It's a strike against Mark Wahlberg."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story combined with great acting","review":"A great story is one where you have to watch the film so you don't miss the plot. That is one reason that The Fighter works so well as a film. Christian Bale is about as far removed from being Batman in this film. His crazy eyed, crack addict is an amazing performance. Mark Whalberg is also amazing as his brother who was one of the most underrated fighters of the last 25 years. His inner struggle between wanting success and wanting to be loyal to his family but also feeling the need to succeed and seeing that his family may be what is holding him back. His lack of an Oscar nomination was a vast crime.Simply put this is a terrific and incredible movie. I recommend it for anyone who is tired of the usual garbage we see at the movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thumbs up for Film, Thumbs down for accuracy","review":"This is a great film for entertainment purposes. Mark Wahlberg does some of his best work in this film and the attention to details for \\"retro\\" props is FANTASTIC! However, the important key to staying close enough to a true story for the work to be considered a true story this writer and director failed. Let your fingertips take you on a search engine excursion and look up the real facts and you shall see for yourself. I would HIGHLY recommend this film to anyone who likes boxing, Wahlburg, or just wanting to be entertained."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie - hard to watch - at times","review":"This movie caught me unaware - it wasn't a movie - it was so REAL. It was a stark docudrama of epic proportions. At times the characters were so real and nauseating, it was hard to watch. In the end it was about a person rising above his elements of environment and his family to be his best. The cast was incredible and as soon as you are swept away by their realism - it is an incredible journey. Christian Bale was exquisite and his talent at transforming himself into someone else's persona so incredible that one can forgive almost all the hipe of his ignorant, violent behavior. Mark Walberg is sold short. His acting was a suitable juxtaposition for Bale. See it. It will take a few moments to understand that this is more than a movie... it takes you away - to another realistic place and as soon as you adjust - it will take your breath away!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I hoped it would be...","review":"...not just a great boxing movie, but a great movie. I've been a Bale fan since American Psycho, and he went nuts here too. Some of his facial expressions in The Fighter are classic. I'll admit too that Mark Walberg has really impressed me throught the years. He doesn't do much, but he does it really well. Seems the Boston area has had its share of movies the past many years. Add this to the great pile of those. Melissa Leo played a very believable trashy and medling mother. She and Bale both won Oscars. Amy Adams also had a super part, and wears black undies well.I'd call this film a must for anybody that likes a good sports drama, great acting, the cast, etc. It might be the best boxing movie since Rocky 14."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok, but dark and dysfunctional.","review":"Comment: I can see why this movie was nominated for 7 Academy Awards including Best Picture. The acting was superb and the situations were real enough. For me though it was \\"dark\\" and a downer dealing with drug abuse and nonfunctional family life. I see enough of that for real. This movie reflects what I have heard about the \\"sleaziness\\" of boxing and the way some boxers rise from the bad side of life through it. The movie was technically ok but not my cup of tea. You should be in a \\"neutral\\" frame of mind as you watch it. It could be good for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should have recieved Oscar","review":"Christian Bail was once again an outstanding performer. Marky Walberg was Mehhhh.

Basically they just want you to buy a new one. Had I known that up front, I would have passed or at least made sure I bought the protection plan.

I am very happy with the color screen and easy to organize menus. The software makes updating, managing, and using your IPOD a breeze. My only real complaint is that the button system is a little slow to respond. I sometimes end up hitting the play button 2 or 3 times because the IPOD is slow to respond. The color display is KEY and having the album art on your IPOD is a really cool feature. The only downside to that feature, however, is that if you don't get your music from ITUNES, you have to manually add your artwork for EACH SONG!!!! When you have 3,000 songs, it can get a bit tedious.Overall I am very satisfied with the IPOD and would only stick with apple as I am sure they will hammer out those types of problems in newer versions of the software."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally","review":"I finally found out why almost everyone who has one,loves his/her iPod.I have purchased 4 flash memory and two HD based mp3 players,and the second I held this one in my hand,it was an epiphany.\\"This is what everyone is raving about!\\" It feels almost silken in your hand.It's operation is completely ingenious.The sound is incredible.And downloading tracks from iTunes or my vast CD collection couldn't be easier.Even the supplied earbuds are comfortable!! really!!

I think that he should make the plot a bit more realistic...with the ghosts of Fear Street...I don't exactly know how, but I am sure a great writer such as him can do it.

It isn't very exciting in the start, but like all R. L. Stine books gets better quickly. Trisha's party had me hooked - and it was gross! But Josie fixed everything up just in time - she was about to be killed! Anyway, it's a great start to an even greater series. A must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price","review":"I purchased these gloves for a costume. Please be advised that the color of the gloves is not exactly true to the picture. I bought these gloves thinking that they would be a darker red. The color of the gloves I received was practically a neon-bright red, like the misbegotten love-child of Raggedy Anne and Crayola. Seriously, they are a red so bright it hurts my eyes to look at them.These gloves are also not designed to fit most women- they were incredibly large in the upper arm, pretty loose in the wrist, and far too long in the fingers, and the gloves went up way past my elbows.All in all, these horrible things weren't worth the price I paid for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet story, but we can only read it when Mama is home!","review":"We love this book. My one-and-a-half year old likes the book, and enjoys finding her favorite animals in the illustrations. She asks for this story specifically, and will sit through the whole thing, but... we can't use it for our original purpose (comforting her when I'm not home). If I'm not around, thinking about Mamas going away just gets her upset! Even though the whole point is that they always come home. So, if you are thinking about having this book for your child to read while mom is out, it might not work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"this book ws wonderful!

Sometimes they play, sometimes they don't. And when the video is a dud (like mine was) It's not worth the expense to return it. It took several dozen attempts to start it up twice, and each time it wouldn't display a menu. And failed to play beyond chap 4 of the first episode. I'll probably order the standard edition of \\"Love Affair\\", but I'm unlikely to find a separate 1934 edition of Jane Eyre, which is one of my favorites.

I have three in there cuz you really need them to get the air flowing. When the computer is running its so noisey and vibrates so much I am surprised it dont fly right off my table.. You would almost be better getting a plastic one. It's HUGE so make sure that you really need a full tower. It was my first FULL size and had no idea it would be so big.

While this is not Dave Dawson, with air combat, it is still a wonderful window into the past. And when you add a few mysteries and a few gun fights it isn't the Bobbsey Twins either! The first book I red had a murderer running about in it! This are NOT for the kiddies but for the teens and maybe the young adults. Unlike today, the books still hold onto the wonder of flight, in its early history. When the food was good, the service was always done with a smile, and nobody thought about crashing into the ground with all the flames and screaming and stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"Very informative.

The manners and attitudes of the characters are impulsive and careless, not like behaviors in the early 1800s. The motives of the characters seem a bit random, or, at least, poorly explained. I stopped reading when the author has one of the characters propose the use of a welding torch... at this point in history, any welding activities required a blacksmith and a forge. This was the last straw in an unconvincing book. A waste of money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Her Best","review":"I really enjoy most of Joan Smith's Regency Romances. This one I didn't even finish. I didn't think the characters were fleshed out to her usual standards - it seemed almost as if another author wrote it. An author not nearly as talented."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aunt Sophie's Diamonds","review":"Joan Smith has written several amazingly fun and witty books. This is not the best of them. The \\"witty\\" dialogue is sometimes overdone, coming across as tedious rather than delightful. There are occasions, of course, when the dialogue shines. But it is not consistent. In addition, though the romance in Smith's books is often subtle and understated, in this book, it was understated practically to the point of non-existence. The heroine goes from tongue tied in the hero's presence to amazingly bold and witty, all in the space of a few hours and for no apparent reason. As for the hero, it seems to be some species of love at first word...The back story of the diamonds is rather obvious from the beginning, but there are some nice capers while one waits for the characters to catch on. If you're a fan of Joan Smith, by all means, read it, but I'd advising checking it out from the library rather than buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy air conditioner/heater","review":"My husband & I bought this air conditioner from Lowe's last year.

Now it's been a year since we replaced it and obviously the warranty period is over and our replacement unit is doing the same thing except now it first got itself stuck at 90 degrees.

Standard tunes are played at various tempos with Lee displaying his prowess on mute as well as open horn.

This front line appears again 3 years later on Art Blakey's final Blue Note session INDESTRUCTIBLE recorded in 1964. In 1962 & 63 it was Freddie Hubbard on trumpet in the classic sextet recording numerous sessions for Blue Note and Riverside records.

My biggest problem with it, however, is that it is too narrowly focused. There was way too much emphasis put on this concept of \\"texturizing the hair\\". All of the styles in the book assumed you would have a texturizer and all of the photographs (every single one) were of the author herself (By the way, she never mentioned whether her hair was texturized or not). It would have been very helpful to see the hairstyles discussed on OTHER women, with other textures and lengths of hair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money, nothing new","review":"After reading the reviews i got excited and ordered this book, There is no substance in this book.

This book was short (98 pages) and easy to read. She didn't go into too much detail, so it's a great book to read if you're thinking about going natural.The author was very honest about her own experiences with her hair growing up. She also discussed the fact that black women try to fight with their hair only causing it to break, which makes it seem that the hair is not growing (which it always is growing).She talks about relaxers, weaves, braids/extensions. She explains the difference between relaxers and texturizers.In going back to natural hair we don't have to fight with our hair and it takes less time to care for. She not only explains about daily maintenance of natural hair, but she give step-by-step techniques on how to style your natual hair.

Sure there are plenty of style tips if you can figure out what she means by 'getting a texturizer'. I still have no idea of the best way to proceed in this arena and the author provides absolutely no info about this but yet all her hairstyle assume you can get one or you hair naturally has the same texture as being 'texturized'.So ladies don't think this book can be used on it's own, you definitely need other resources."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite the book for everyone","review":"I was disappointed by this book.

We tried to pull our light tent trailer, and unless you're a monster truck (we've got a minivan), the safety chains don't have enough slack and got ripped off when driving--there's not enough arch available under the car for the chain, due to the length of the chain needed...

One would love to know the true story of this so-called 'survivor.' Whose lap was she/he sitting on? The play itself is a long drag, a monologue delivered to the audience about how fascinating the playwright found this person to be.

The Suite Life of Zack & Cody is a great show but am disturbed with the type of DVD release. I would prefer a season release with all 26 episodes on DVD like the Lizzie McGuire Vol. 1 boxed set which had first 22 episodes of that show.Theme DVDs are terrible. What a ripoff. I am not buying this DVD. It's a waste of money. I'd rather buy all the episodes off iTunes Music Store which has most of season 1 already and some of season 2.This DVD only has 1 episode of season 1 and like 2 episodes from season 2 -- with one being a never before seen episode. I don't care if its never been seen before. I think I'll wait for the episode to air instead of buying a terrible DVD.Great show bad DVD. Disney why don't you get it together.

The jokes are rarely funny and the show consists of shallowly-attractive celebrities who are rich somewhat spoiled and get their way nearly every time. None of them act that well, and London is the most spoiled, terrible actress that Disney has ever spat out at us. I totally despise her stupid, ditzy air-headed persona. It makes me sick, how stupid she has to act to get 10 year olds to laugh.I didn't like the program when it first arrived on the Disney Channel over two and a half years ago, and I grew to loathe it, episode after episode after episode.Watch Lizzy McGuire, Kim Possible, That's So Raven, or The Proud Family; they're much better, well-rounded Disney programs.Cover Art: CDialogue: D+Characters: C+Length: C-Overall: D+2.3 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"thank you nane:giuseppe","review":"hey JK. thank you for saing that in august they are going to pass the never before seen episodes.

However, I would say that--99% of the time--it is even more kid-friendly than those shows (when it comes to young children).Each episode features a moral lesson; something that is severely lacking in today's television entertainment. The characters are enjoyable and mix well with each other. Unlike many shows of the same genre both adults and children take their turn at wearing egg on their face: proof that we all make mistakes and that \\"growing up\\" doesn't stop with physical height.I hope that Disney will eventually issue a season of this series on DVD and I wish ABC (owned by Disney) would begin showing entertainment like this during the eight o'clock hour (once known as \\"The Family Hour\\")."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Never\\" before seen episode...

I have 3 kids so loading and unloading was more of a workout than the actual bike rides! This has made it much easier and is also more secure with the built in lock. The only drawback is the need to buy bar adapters for children's and women's bikes, but it is worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well after modification","review":"Bike rack works very well with some modifications. I put the rack on the back of a 36' 5th wheel camper, it tends to get a lot of bounce with 5 bikes. I did away with the pin that lets it fold down and made it a rigid assembly, drilled an extra hole in the receiver, welded 5/8 washers to the side of the bike receiver where the pins go to get rid of the play, so I could bolt the receiver tight to the vehicle receiver.I did have some difficulties initially trying to put the bikes on the rack. I had to use some of the bike seat posts to attach to the bike rack, if they could only make frames the same on the bikes, or is there another bracket that would help in this situation?We just got back from a trip, and worked well after everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really nice rack!!!","review":"I really like this rack, it fits nicely on the back of my Dodge Grand Caravan. The rack is made of high quality items and is worth the money.A couple of suggestions for improvement would be to, first, make all the bike holders locking, instead of just the one at the end. Second, some provision for mounting extra lights to the rack would be useful, since five bikes do tend to block your tail-lights. I'm planning on jury-rigging something to my rack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality control","review":"I was so excited about the reviews here, that I ordered this rack. However the assembly is/was a nightmare. The nuts don't fit on the bolts (they screw on part way and then stop). It took me an hour to muscle (and I mean this was hard) 3 nuts on the bolts. Then the 1/2\\" pin does not fit through the hole (to keep the rack upright). Just doesn't fit. Nothing I can do but wait to call them about it. VERY frustrating! How can they send parts that don't fit together?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Too many syllables","review":"This book contains thoughtful essays that critique Frank Jackson's story about Mary. The selections offered what seemed to my unprofessional viewpoint to be wide-ranging and comprehensive. I thought Frank Jackson's own commentaries were among the most readable and penetrating. Excepting Jackson and maybe one or two others, the various authors, all professional philosophers, seem helpless when offered opportunities to use big words when small ones would serve. Did they want to be understood, or admired at a distance by lesser beings? If I were grading the essays, writers in the habit of using words greater than 6 syllables would be encouraged to revise their sentences.

There are comprehensive lists of everyday household items to let the toddler play with, and some of them are big NO NOs; i.e. bottle caps, buttons, bubble wrap. The bottle caps must be large enough so a toddler cannot get it in his/her mouth and the same for the buttons. Very few buttons are made that large. Bubble wrap could be fun for an older child, but it's kind of like playing with your puppy with a shoe. What happens when you are not around? The puppy often gets the shoe and destroys it. Bubble wrap could be a choking hazard. Those are just examples from the letter \\"B\\" that she has listed. This may all be common sense to most people, but if not, the possible consequences could be deadly.I think the book should be reworked with an eye for safety and then it is ok."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"It just was a lame book.

Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mommy's Busy Book","review":"Do I really need extra paperwork to do to plan my child's day/week/month? Some good ideas, well stated and some ideas that don't have enough detail to be helpful. A lot of this is more for preschool age or very late toddler stage(at least if you have a boy). A lot of very talky filler. As a busy Mom I don't want filler to go through, I just want easy to find ideas with complete and clear instructions for materials and methods. Much of what is good I have seen elsewhere.

The suggestions are either common sense or so crazy that no one would ever attempt. Such as preparing 3lbs of spaghetti with oil and filling up a baby pool for your children to play in. Or put a mirror in a box so when your child opens the box they see themselves, unless you don't want your children playing with glass (and who does?) then the book suggests an alternative of placing pictures of the child inside the box. Really, pictures in a box is a busy activity? Save your money, parenting magazines have way better ideas for keeping little ones busy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money!","review":"This book is not bad, but it certainly isn't worth the money.

It is full of great ideas. I especially love the travel section: as a mom of two toddlers, I am always looking for fun and educational ways to keep the kids occupied in the car. As another reviewer said, there are some activities in this book which may not be age-appropriate. I gave the book 5 stars despite that, because the other suggestions in the book are so excellent. I don't mind letting my kids play with marbles, balloons, and other such toys as long as they are being supervised; therefore, I save activities that use those kinds of toys for \\"Mommy and Me\\" time and do the safer activities when I need to cook or clean and can't hover over the kids.I recommend this book to any mom of toddlers; it has great suggestions for travel, rainy days, outdoor play, and more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful resource","review":"Well organized and very user-friendly, this is a fantastic resource for all.

Unless you have never been a mom, ever baby sat and never around kids in your life you know almost everything in this book. The author seemed to really be stretching with coming up with 365 ideas. Really...as a mom you should know that kids like to paint, color, etc. Do we really need a book for that? I gave it two stars because their were a few crafts I thought were neat but nothing I probably couldn't have found by doing a search on google. And the worst is there were no pictures what so ever. I returned the book..not even worth my $10."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very boring","review":"I have read half of this book so far and so far I do not find any of the activities listed to be interesting.

We tend to do the arts and crafts projects because they are easy and fun.Some of the games are so simple, that you can grab your household items to give your kids something new to do very quickly. The clothespin drop was a hit in my house, as was the pull box.My favorite activity (so far) has been making kool-aid playdoh. Oh yes, and the kids liked it too. As well, the paste recipe my grandmother used to make is in this book. The kids had great fun pasting pictures from catalogues onto paper with this goopy stuff(and I joined in too). This book is an endless array of ideas for your kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that useful","review":"Most of the suggestions in this book were not useful to me. Many of them were totally obvious. First, quite a few were different versions of \\"make a box of toys for a rainy day\\", or different versions of \\"gather kitchen tools, tupperware, pots and pans\\". Second, a lot of the activities take a lot of time to prepare and then keep the kid entertain for just a couple of minutes. Third, some suggestions are just home-made versions of very cheap toys that I just rather buy than spend so much effort and make a mess at home preparing them. In this class you'll find home-made playdoh, bubbles, stacking cups, markers, puzzles, etc. Overall I found this book a waste of money and time. Not a single original idea that I could use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh.......","review":"I was so excited for this book. I was pretty disappointed when I sat down with a cup of tea and notepad ready to prepare my funfilled week of activities. Some of the activities require a lot of preparation and then last 30 seconds. Others require materials that most of us don't have \\"leftover\\". The energy and time some of these take in preparation actually take time away from my toddler, for example, making crayons out of old crayons on a hot stove, melting them in tin cans and then setting them in a cast, just so she can colour with them is really time consuming when I can buy a box for $2 and enjoy my time with her. There were a few fun ideas I liked, but overall, these are just unrealistic or things that my toddler invents on her own, like turning a shoebox into a doll bed.I am sad that I had to give this book a bad review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots Of Ideas for Fun","review":"Not the best in the world, I am sure, but its not a bad book either. We, as a creative family, keep many of the suggested items on hand (and I would recommend that anyone with small children keep a storage area filled with craft supplies), so it was nice to have some ideas of what to do with my 2 year old. While some of the ideas ARE very basic, sometimes the brain of a frazzled parent needs a jump start, and while you may say \\"well duh\\" after reading it, it might not be something you would have thought of right off to begin with.We have enjoyed lots of activites with this book, and while its not arranged by age groups, parents should be somewhat aware of what their child as an individual will be able to do/enjoy. If you have a two year old who likes to put small objects in their mouth then dont do those activities-its that simple! But the amount of games and ideas are good for a variety of stages in your toddlers development and can be great spur of the moment activities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Disappointed","review":"When I ordered this book, I thought I was going to find a lot of really great ways to entertain my almost two year old. By page 117, I had found maybe 2 ideas that were new and moderately interesting. Most of the ideas are repetitive or ridiculous, if not so simple you have already thought of them on your own. This was a waste if time and money and I would not recommend it to anyone. You will have much better luck spending a little time doing an internet search."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing special and quite repetitive","review":"It's better served as a 'check out at the library' book rather than purchase - Flip through it once and you've got everything you need out of it, I would not consider this a reference of any kind. There were multitudes of entries that were repeats with small changes...at least 5 different crayons to make just with different mold types, games with the tiniest variations and things like 'sing nursery rhymes'. So many of the entries would not keep my toddler entertained for long, maybe my 8 month old but by no means any older. Out of the 365 entries I found only about 25 to be new or creative ideas however my 2 year old has not had any held interest with the 7 I have tried so far. I am constantly looking for new activities for my children and this book would have to rate as one of the lowest quality activty books I have read. I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT, Fun Ideas","review":"I love this book! I just pulled it out again because my 21-month-old daughter and I have gotten into a little bit of a rut. There's been a lot more TV time than I like. Going through here again to pick out some activities, I've noticed so many new things she wouldn't have enjoyed or understood when I bought this book several months ago. Things I dismissed at the time for this reason will now be perfect for her age and current interests. That's the best thing about \\"The Toddler's Busy Book.\\" There is almost too much to do in there. There are simple ideas and more complex ones with some real planning involved.

Unless you have never been around children, are a first time Mom and have never babysat in your life, the majority of the suggestions in here have been tried already. Perhaps when I had my first in my early 20's this would have been more helpful as there are numerous inexpensive imaginary ideas but now on my 2nd child I had already tried the things suggested.

I like the ideas in the books, but in reading some of the ideas, we get much more use out of them as my toddlers are getting older - and can see many activities being even better when they are 4. Also wish the book came with an ASSISTANT that could help put together these projects, because many are time consuming and take a good deal of planning and nap time prep. I would still recommend the book to come up with ideas but don't get your expectations too high - lots of time and effort for some activities that may only last as long as they took to prepare. I use it as a resource and like the book, but it hasn't been as helpful as expected based on the reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good to have handy","review":"This book has some creative ideas. Some are simple things you could think of on your own, but if you're home with the kids every day, it's nice to have a reference to remind you of good activities you may have forgotten about.

But defective merchandise has got to be the absolute nadir. When I received my copy of the Season 6 DVD, it was defective and had to be returned. Now the same thing has happened with my copy of the Season 7 DVD. It won't play and I have to return it. If Fox did not want to distribute MTM on DVD, why didn't they just turn it over to some other company that did and that would treat the series and its fans with respect?

I called Fox this morning and was told to mail the entire set to them at my expense, and wait six to eight weeks for its replacement. Not just the bad disc. The entire set of discs.Wondering which disc will be defective this time?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I expected","review":"Waiting patiently I was finally able to order the last three seasons of MTM. I have to say I was sadly dissapointed. The packaging is sub-standard, cheap plastic covers with no additonal documentation. The video quality is very poor and appears to have been recorded off the TV. I don't know who produced these but they were done on the cheap that is for sure and if you are expecting to complete your box set collection you will be seriously dissapointed.Update 2/20/2011 I watched all the episodes, in broadcast order of course. I saw a couple of my favorite all time episodes and Season 7 did include the curtain call. I'm still a big fan and glad to have all seasons on disk."},{"rating":"2","title":"A timeless classic.","review":"Those of us girls growing up in the 70's, had a great role model in Mary Tyerl Moore.

Sadly I can't because my copy of season 7 had no 'Final Curtain Call' on it. Amazon were very good and despatched another set almost immediately. Unfortunately that was just the same - so how many is 'just a small amount' of these DVD sets affected? Also, how do I now go about getting a replacement disc? I e-mailed Fox Connect but got no response - I guess because I am in the UK they won't honour the replacement promise. What a pity - I suppose I will just have to miss out on those final few magic moments...SMUDGE"},{"rating":"2","title":"Requested replacement disc","review":"My DVD set didn't contain the final curtain call, so I phoned the number on back of the box. The person on the other end was very polite and apologized and mentioned a replacement disc would be sent out right away. All she asked was where I bought it (amazon.com) and if it was a pre-order and that's it. After I gave my name and address she said the disc would be shipped right away.Excellent customer service, but it's hard to believe it took all these years to complete the MTM series. Now they need to finish the remaining Bob Newhart Show seasons and release Phyllis on DVD.When Season 1 was released almost a decade ago, I was one who paid full price ($49.99) and paid full price also for the subsequent seasons.

I have stopped using my alarm clocks because I so dread their jarring beeps and buzzes and dings. The coffeemaker turns itself on by magic and the process feels so much more gentle.

That was a big disappointemnt - maybe because I didn't pay \\"Keurig\\" price? The coffee came out weak, without much flavor, even though I tried 2 and 3 pods at the time. Now, I had all those pods, bought and paid for from Amazon, and seeing they smelled absolutely delicious, I had to find another way to use them. Well, this little Mr. Coffee does the trick for me. I break three of the pods open (I think the paper, even though very thin, kills a lot of the taste)into a filter, add 4 cups of water and enjoy my coffee the way it was meant to taste - strong and flavorful.

One of the cheapest I could find that actually has a programmable starter.Only con so far after a week is that the coffee is not that hot when it first brews. I can literally drink it without burning my mouth as soon as it gets done brewing, which is a con for me because I usually put it in a mug to sip on during class so I want it to be hot.

As other reviewers have mentioned, the carafe spills consistently when you are pouring coffee in your cup. It is not a big deal - just annoying because you will always have to wipe your counter after pouring your coffee. This is a case where Mr. Coffee should have left the original design in place, but I suppose this new model is cheaper for them to manufacture. I have noticed that the coffee filter occasionally folds over at the edge, causing the grounds to get in with your cofee, but this is not very common. If you make sure your filter is pushed out around the edges, it will decrease the chances of that issue. Overall, I am not impressed with this coffeemaker, but it gets the job done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shorted out after one pot of coffee","review":"I was able to make one pot of coffee and then the wiring shorted out.

I have not been able to use this coffee maker because it requires a different filter than what I've used in the past, and Mr Coffee is just to stingy to include a few filters with this coffee maker. I spent the past couple of days trying to find these needed filters - and I live in a big city - and I couldn't find them anywhere. I ended up going on Amazon where the most reasonable bargain for these filters was 23.99 for 1200 filters - much more than I need and more expensive than the coffee maker itself. This does not please me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seemed like good value, but machine broke after 2 months","review":"The 12-cup machine is what you need. Don't buy the 4-cup machine because that's barely enough coffee for large mug. I know because I had to ship the 4-cup machine back and re-order this 12-cup one. So the coffee was OK (not great, but not terrible) but then the machine suddenly stopped working. I can't turn it on. I tried returning it, but because I didn't buy it from Amazon directly (but through a vendor) that was not an option after the initial 3-4 week returns window. I'll call Amazon again though... a machine shouldn't last only 2 months.Lessons learned:1) Buy from Amazon directly so you can return items if you need to. Otherwise hard to return to small vendors. Amazon is so much easier to deal with.2) You really do get what you pay for. I'm sure others had this machine work for years and it was fine, but I didn't get so lucky. Keep this in mind.

I started to brew another cup and when I poured the water in it immediately started to brew. Turns out the On light had burned out. Brewing this cup was taking an awfully long time so I lifted the lid and looked at the coffee filter. It was about half full of water and was not doing anything. I jiggled the filter and then the coffee finished brewing. It seems that the coffee blocked the bottom of the filter so the water could not go through. I returned the coffee maker the same day and requested a refund rather than a replacement for obvious reasons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked well for a few months, now it burns the coffee","review":"This thing worked well when it was new. About 3 months in, despite keeping it clean, the coffee started tasting burnt and overly bitter even using quality beans. Tried using the Mr. Coffee cleaner and it made it a little better, but it's still no where near new. The issue appears to be that the water simply overheats and burns the coffee. All in all, this thing is good for 2-3 months, after that it's a piece of junk and ruins good coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"The coffee wasn't hot","review":"I chose the low rating because the coffee was not hot when brewed and it didn't stay hot.I did like the design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor coffee, smaller than advertised capacity","review":"I bought this coffee maker to replace a Melitta 4 cup coffee maker that had literally worn out; the filter and lid were falling apart. What a disappointment this coffee maker is. The capacity is listed as 4 cups. I understand that's meant to be 6 oz cups, not 8 oz cups, but it doesn't even make that much coffee. My old 4 cup coffee maker made enough coffee for 2 12 oz mugs. This one makes a total of 2.5 8 oz cups, which isn't even enough for 2 mugs of coffee. Plus the quality of the coffee was poor. I'd been using a cone-shaped filter. This is the basket type and the flavor and strength is much weaker. The result, I just bought a larger Melitta coffee makerMelitta 46894 10-Cup Thermal Coffeemaker. I know from past experience, that I will be able to depend on the Melitta. This was a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"just the right size...","review":"I bought this coffeemaker to automate the coffee making process for me in the morning and it does just that.

I've never owned a 4-cup coffee maker before, and I don't know if this is standard measurement, but I was a bit surprised with how small it was. I made an entire pot this morning, and it didn't quite fill up my 20 oz. thermos. You do the math on that one.However, it doesn't bother me because I'm the only one in the house that drinks coffee, and it makes the perfect amount for me.

I wanted to replace it cause the green light (on) went out and I thought that might be a bad sign. And after all it's been 8 years!Well, long story short, I got my oldie out and plugged it in and the full amount of water went through just like always.Maybe that green light out is OK, doesn't seem to effect it.If anyone knows what's wrong with this new one, please let me know and even though I am a klutz I will try to fix it... hahahaMy One Star rating is on the product NOT the company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"I have had this coffee maker about a week now.

I have only used the large basket filters (didn't know there was a smaller size) - as a result at times the filter flops over when the water runs through and the coffee doesn't taste as strong as I would like. A proper sized filter would solve this - and it only happens when I am not careful about inserting the larger filter correctly.As with all coffee makers this one measures by the standard 5oz = 1 Cup. Some people find that frustrating (my husband included) - but as long as you take that into account when brewing, this coffee pot is a great solution for the smaller batch coffee with the added plus of a small countertop footprint and a timer not usually found in coffee pots this size."},{"rating":"2","title":"does the job nicely","review":"The coffee is hot, it's easy to clean, and it takes up very little space.When you unplug the device it doesn't retain the time settings, so if you are a coffee \\"programmer\\" you'll have to leave the machine plugged in all the time. The auto shutoff is a big plus for this reason.For under 20 bucks this is a great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good starter coffee maker","review":"This is a good starter coffee maker, for someone that only needs one or two cups in the morning. I obviously don't make the requisite 6fl.oz. cups of coffee, more like 8-10fl.oz., so I only yield two cups instead of four out of the maximum capacity of the unit.I haven't used the automatic brewing feature much over the course of my two-month ownership, just a handful of times. It works as advertised, but watch out. My clock is showing a 14 minute fast drift after two months, and it will probably only get worse. For this I gave it four stars rather than five. Luckily, you have to set up to brew the night before, so you should adjust the clock accordingly if it gets too fast. No NTP for a coffee maker, but that'd be really nice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little coffeemaker!","review":"Ordered this in May, and have been using it ever since without any problems, and I only use it a few days a week. I'm the only one that drinks coffee, my husband will never touch the stuff, and it's perfect for making one or two cups at a time. And it's small and compact - our previous apartment didn't have much counter space at all, and this little coffeemaker didn't get in the way. I definitely recommend it for those who want something small and like a cup or two of coffee in the AM, or whenever you like!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr. Coffee 4 cup Programmable Coffeemaker","review":"Love this new coffee maker, it's a perfect size for me. Brew has excellent flavor and each pot tastes great. I drink three cups through out the day, each one must be fresh, there is no waste. Does not drip when caraf is removed, filter basket lifts out, and cleaning is quick."},{"rating":"2","title":"misleading!","review":"I bought this because I am the only one who drinks coffee in my house. I also liked that it said it came with a permanent filter. IT DOES NOT. just a permanent filter basket. So just be prepared to pay the extra money to buy the permanent filter if you would rather not deal with paper filters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed to work after 6 weeks","review":"This machine worked very well until the day it didn't, which was only six weeks after I bought it. The clock kept working, but the machine itself didn't turn on.Very disappointing because before that, it made a good cup of coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tastes like plastic","review":"I got this to replace my 4-cup Krups Hotel Coffee Maker after the carafe broke. I am using the same coffee, filters, and water as in my old unit, but all the coffee I make from the Mr Coffee model tastes like plastic. I tried cleaning the unit with a vinegar solution, to no avail. Perhaps I got a bad unit, I don't know, but plastic tasting coffee is definitely an unpleasant start to the morning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great while it lasted","review":"This is the second one of these I have had. And both only lasted about a year. They just stop working. The on button to brew flickers and no clock. Also the style of the carafe changed and it is very difficult to pour without spilling. Changing to a different brand this time"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy coffee","review":"We've had The Mr Coffee DRX5 for about 3 years. Price it right - but it is not a good choice if you want good coffee. Why not? Bad design. It takes several minutes - like 10 minutes - for this coffee maker to stop making that 'boiling' sound at the end of the coffee making cycle, when it's making steam, not hot water. The steam mostly collects at the top and drips back down onto the boiler. But while it's boiling away it also continues to steam the coffee grounds, which I think is why the coffee tastes so bitter. Also, I think the coffee makers with the flat-bottomed holders like this one can't make coffee as well as the makers with the cone-shaped holders. Keep looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, LITTLE coffee maker","review":"I ordered this coffee maker based on all the positive reviews, and I'm not disappointed.It is the perfect size for 1 person (my husband prefers black coffee...not me!).He loves it, it is easy to use, brews quickly, and is easy to clean.HOWEVER: the pot does NOT hold 4 cups. I measured it out of doubt one evening, and it holdsjust over 3 cups. It is just enough to fill a to-go travel mug. Which is all my husband needs in the morning,but just wanted to let you all know of its short-comings!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing quality","review":"I have previously owned several Mr. Coffee products and had been satisfied with all of them; however, this coffee maker developed cracks on both sides at the junction between the black plastic and the transparent plastic within two months. Appears to be a design defect - very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute little coffee machine","review":"After deciding I can no longer afford expensive energy drinks, I put away my coffee snobbery, and went out and grabbed one of these babies. I needed a convenient caffeine delivery source, and so far this has delivered.I got the black one. It's small, and lives in the corner of my space-impaired apartment kitchen. It's perfect considering I'm the only coffee drinker in the house. If I have a friend over, I can brew up a four-cup pot, which will fill 2 mugs. (NOTE: 1 \\"cup\\" on this = 6 oz).Everything works like it should work. It's easy to program, hasn't leaked, the coffee is standard American fare- put a bit 'o honey and some soy creamer in it and everything's good in the hood. Plus it's $[...] bucks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Coffee Basket Flops Around","review":"Alot of times this coffee maker works fine, but it's by chance. The directions say place the coffee basket in securely before brewing the coffee. And IT DOES fit in securely as long as there isnt a coffee pot in place. As soon as the coffee pot is set under the basket it wobbles around and it \\"lifts\\" up some from the spot it should be in. Sometimes thats fine, then sometimes you go to get coffee and you find all the coffee grounds all over the coffee pot and counterspace. A big mess on occasion. I've had Mr Coffee's before and never seen this problems, so maybe I just got a lemon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serves the purpose We bought it for","review":"My girlfriends beloved Phillip bit the dust after 4 years at college and two years at grad school. She has traveled the world with it. It was not a pleasant experience.I saw this particular product, and was BAM, her personal coffee maker. Brews very quickly, setting up time to brew very easy, and for a small plastic device, no after flavor.So far, Ralph has proven to be an admirable replacement for Phillip.We use it more for the flavored coffees so as not to contaminate our larger brewer.Cleaning is very easy.For value and lower usage an excellent buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"It DOES make plastic-tasting coffee","review":"I bought this with great hopes, but the first cup of coffee, even though I carefully followed the instructions to rinse, etc., tasted and smelled VERY much like plastic, as another reviewer had warned. I could barely drink it (and wouldn't have had I been less in need of caffeine). This was with the same type and amount of coffee I always use. I carefully measured 1/4 cup of ground coffee per 12 ounces of water, rather than relying on the pot's markings. Considering the dangers of BPA in hard plastics (see the Milwaukee Journal on this, at [...]), it seems foolish to drink anything that reeks of plastic. So I took it back. I expect that this is the kind of product that ultimately will be outlawed, if the FDA can get the right to regulate it.Oh, and another thing. The 4 cup capacity is indeed four 5-ounce cups, not 6-ounce, for a total of 20 ounces. If this matters to you as much as my first paragraph, all I can say is \\"Good luck!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Coffee tastes like plastic and clock doesn't work","review":"I've had this coffee maker for several years but rarely use it. As others have noted, the clock doesn't work, but the most important thing you should know is that it makes your coffee taste like plastic, even after years! Yuck! N.B. I did not purchase this coffee maker from Amazon. If I had, I'm sure Amazon would have been great about a return. I just wanted to caution any potential buyers of the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looking for it's replacement....","review":"This thing is ready for the trash. I have owned it for several months and about once a week, the filter folds over during the brewing process and all the coffee grounds go to the pot. NICE! I also agree with the previous review about pouring and spilling."},{"rating":"1","title":"hard to read display","review":"My old coffeemaker like this one had a minor problem (the clock didn't keep the exact time) but I could live with that easily. It broke after several years, so I ordered a new one to replace it, however the new model is far inferior. Besides the minor clock problem, the display (including the clock) is not lighted as it was in the earlier model and the new display is very difficult for me to read because it is black lettering on a grey background. Also the lid on the new coffee pot doesn't open very wide, and it doesn't stay open. Finally, the lid to the new machine is hard to close and keep closed. The new unit works, but I don't like it at all. However, if you never use the clock or delay feature and you just use it as a coffeemaker, it should be fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice for travel","review":"This little coffeemaker is really nice for travel. I took it to the beach this summer because everyone else in the house preferred regular coffee and I prefer decaf. This did the job!"},{"rating":"1","title":"new design","review":"The previous machine was much better with the swing out basket. This basket is hard to use. It wobbles around and as a result the top lid is difficult to close. This machine is definitely not as good as my old Mr. Coffee 4 cup unit. I do not like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tiny and Effective","review":"This is just like the size coffee pots you get in hotel rooms, except this has the nifty timer. Specifically liked this pot because the timer conviniently makes the coffee for me while I get ready for work. This is a great size for just one person, or people that do not drink much coffee. I drink out of a large mug, so the 4-cup equates out to 2 mugs for me. It is a great little pot and does the job just fine (I'm not a coffee connoisseur, just want that extra help getting waking up in the a.m.). It is also small in size, so takes little counter space or is easily moved to the pantry or hidden in a cabinet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little coffee pot for the Single coffee drinker","review":"I just purchased this coffeemaker about 1 week ago and I love it. It is easy to clean and works wonderfully. I really appreciate the fact that it is programmable and has auto shut off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks water everywhere","review":"For the first year that I had this pot I loved it. The coffee tastes great, is nice and hot, and I love the timer. Now it leaks about 2 T of water through the bottom as it makes the coffee. This is my 2nd straight Mr Coffee product which has developed this problem, although the last one lasted 3 years before it happened. My next coffee pot will be a Sanyo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"I purchased this coffeemaker in January 2011. It broke last week. The water stays in the reservoir. I only use this coffeemaker on the weekends. I really expected a little more use than that. I went on the website to locate an authorized repair shop. I called the one nearest to me,which is Howard Beach, only to be disappointed and disgusted by the rude man who answered the phone. I am not wasting my time, gas or energy to go there. I chalk this up to a life lesson. I will be sure to let everyone I know not to buy Mr. Coffee coffeemakers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"Pass on this product. Mr Coffee used to be the word in drip coffee makers but not any more. I bought this one in February and by July it is dead. Keep searching as I am."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, but tiny","review":"Works well, at least so far. Only complaint is that it is smaller than I'd imagined, and it is not really four cups. I actually measured out four cups to put in the pot, and the fourth one overflowed. It looks nice, however, is tiny, and I have no complaints about the coffee. Holds about two normal-sized coffee cups."},{"rating":"1","title":"plastic smell problem","review":"I followed the directions when I opened the box and ran water through the coffeemaker before using. The smell in the house was horrific! It took me a minute to figure out it was coming from the coffeemaker. How can they sell a new coffeemaker that smells so bad when it heats water? After about 20 pots of coffee and several water cleanings, the coffee still tastes bad . . . plastic smell and little coffee smell for the amount of coffee I used. The unit is cute, but it misses the mark on making a good cup of coffee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to Basics - 12 cup Mister Coffee","review":"We had been using Hamilton Beach brew station coffee makers for years. They are great because they do not have a carafe. You just press your cup against a lever and it fills with coffee. BUT they always developed leaks within 2 years.When our last one gave out, we decided to go back to basics and get a Mister Coffee. We have the 12 cup. It is great.It keeps the coffee much warmer than the Hamilton Beach did, because the carafe sits on the hot plate. The coffee tastes great. We have not had any problem with it dripping on the counter.I wish they would have designed the basket so that it had a flat bottom to make it easier to fill on the counter.I definitely recommend this coffee maker!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Affordable and efficient","review":"This coffeemaker gets the job done quite easily, but you pay for what you get. The lid sticks sometimes and is hard to pull up, and setting the delay brew feature took me some time to master (due to my own lack of wanting to read the directions multiple times), but its easy to clean and use. Perfect size for my single person household, and the most affordable option I could find for the best ratings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value","review":"The bottom line is that the coffee tastes good. I only drink Starbucks, ground immediately before brewing, so I'm picky about my coffee maker. For the price of this coffee maker, it brews the coffee at an appropriate temperature, in a reasonable time-frame and has a cone filter. The settings are intuitive and it doesn't really require instructions, unless you've never before owned a coffee maker and haven't programmed one. I would highly recommend this product to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fourth One in Six Months","review":"I once had this model and it worked fine for quite a while. Then I got a new one when the carafe broke and it did not work at all. Got a replacement which worked fine for about two-three months. Now it is does not work at all. I have checked the manual but none of their suggestions works. I feel like I have the coffee maker curse. In any case, I will not be buying another of this model or brand. Too many coffee makers in the landfills :(!ADDED 11/01/12 Another not even one month old just died. I am so DONE with Mr. Coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks","review":"I have to use a ton of coffee to make it any good. Or I turn it on with just water and the lid open and let it run till it makes constant noise. Then I add coffee and let it work. I guess the water doesn't get very hot so the coffee comes out weak. Also the lid flexes when the coffee maker is on and it opens while brewing. All in all STAY AWAY"},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes fine coffee, programmable","review":"I have to admit I cannot read the lcd time window without my glasses because it is too dim, so if I want to use the programmable feature I have to be careful that I have not inadvertently hit a button that has changed the time. That is pretty easy to do. No problem with the coffee-making, and I like being able to program it...just be careful because one tap on a button when you move the coffee maker and you may change the time...and it is kind of hard to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second Mr. Coffee","review":"The unit is faultless.

Then I decided that I would my betta out of the security house and put another one in his place. Somehow he lifted the bottom up and got out. So I had two male betta's in one tank, so scary.

After that, the suction cups came disconnected and females came in while he got out. Luckily I was right there or it could have had a very poor outcome for all the fish.

I am still working my way through it, but have noticed both an improvement in my play and attitude toward the game since beginning it. (As result I am organizing my approach to the game.) I like the fact that the problem level varies throughout, so I do not get discouraged when I miss a couple of hard problems in a row.

Now, with their songs, \\"Hey Leonardo (She Likes Me For Me)\\" and \\"Storybook Life\\", I'm starting to re-think my opinion on Blessid Union of Souls and actually like them now. I also heard \\"I Believe\\", which is another great song. I haven't heard this complete album, but I've heard most of the songs and they are pretty good. If you're a Blessid Union of Souls fan, then this is a definite must-have for your B.U.S. collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have!","review":"Blessid Union of Souls is a band that deserves much more credit. Lead singer Eliot Sloan's expressive voice fits perfectly with the pop-rock music reminiscent of Barenaked Ladies or Hootie and the Blowfish. You have no doubt heard the band at least once on the radio - but not many have dug deeper to discover more of their music. \\"The Singles\\" is a great opportunity to have all of their best on one CD. This album is something that any fan of music will appreciate. Included are the hits \\"I Believe,\\" \\"Hey Leonardo\\" (original and live versions), and \\"Let Me Be the One,\\" as well as two new songs: \\"And Then She Hit Me\\" and \\"Storybook Life,\\" I suggest you purchase this immediately - and see what you've been missing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book Overall","review":"My daughter is in love w/all the Spot Lift the Flap books.

The flaps are sturdy and the pages are as well, which is perfect for my rather rambuncous 2 year.

The self-adhesive tabs didn't work at all even to just put the spice rack up to use the screws. Very awkward to use the screws. Doesn't allow for any room especially the back screws. I did the wrong thing by taking the extending arm hardware off to get the spice rack in place and to make it easier to screw it under the cupboard and that is where it sits.

You have to wonder what lonely pizza-faced eighth-grader came up with this garbage, or what pot-smoking Hollywood big-shot decided that it should be done another two times.

She's trying to entrap you and make you her slave forever!Liberally enlivened with stories from believers, some who say they have actually encountered a fairy of one type or another, Ms Briggs' book is especially interesting in light of the recent popularity of books and films based on traditional folklore (Tolkien, Rowling, CS Lewis, to name a few). Readers of The Fairies in Tradition and Literature will be able to spot time honored themes and characteristics, and will often be able to predict outcomes in modern stories based upon folkloric history.

It is good, but not the best rose extract on the market. I suspect it is best for adding a mild, secondary flavor to delicate dishes, like another reviewer's rose ice cream.I used it to add to simple syrup for cocktails, and to add to seltzer. I find it has a soapy flavor when used in anything but the most minute amounts. This is common for many floral extracts, but it was more potent here than in others I've worked with. This should be fine if you're making lemon-rose or vanilla-rose or cardamom-rose cream dishes, but you may be disappointed with stand-alone flavor.I prefer the rose extract made by Silver Cloud Estates. It's about 3x more expensive, but worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great flavor for cooking","review":"I ordered the extract to make rose ice cream, because you can rarely find it.

This book is about a group of four women whose friendship supports them through the pitfalls of life. Only one of the women (the cancer patient) has any backbone. The others seem to be incapable of confronting and solving their problems. Reviewers have called this book emotion packed. I failed to find much emotion here. Instead it was filled with whiny, boring women. It drips with everything you see in a daytime soap. I finished this book only because I bought it in hardcover. I kept hoping it would get better. It didn't. I'll give this one away to the library.

I just came across the Saving Graces as I was desperately looking for a book that had substance yet was light enough for summer reading.Reading Gaffney's novel was pure pleasure. Her characters were so normal and at the same time I wanted to follow them. Why? They weren't fancy people living lives that we can only imagine. I recognize so many of my women friends and so many aspects of my own life.All this said, there is,in my opinion one prerequesite to meeting The Graces: one MUST have lived long enough,at least 35 to 40 years to really understand what they are made of.Definitely a book for a somewhat mature reader but just as simple as your life or mine and written by a powerful hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked the story...","review":"I am a \\"Ya Ya Sisterhood\\" fan, so I found this book about more reserved women interesting.

Emjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An entertaining novel","review":"This book is about four women who are bound by friendship and by shared joys and sorrows. The chapters are narrated by each character in turn and each one gives her unique perspective on what is going on in the lives of her friends and herself. Sometimes it seems that these women are all headed towards destruction of one kind or another and they struggle with problems of infertility, terminal illness, controlling men, and hopeless love affairs. Somehow these problems seem less overwhelming when shared with the other \\"Saving Graces\\", and in the end an uplifting spin is put on all of their lives.

I had to put the other books I'd brought along on the back burner ... and I'm so glad that I did! First, the book is written in a refreshing format -- each chapter is \\"written\\" by one of the four women, a/k/a Graces, featured in the story.

Having a close group of friends that I would trust with my life, I was looking forward to a good read. Was I ever disappointed.The switching of voices between the four main characters was confusing and became irritating as there was very little distinction made between them other than their names. I had to keep jumping back to confirm which \\"Grace\\" was speaking.

I really enjoyed the book. The audio production however, was pretty awful. Not so much the abridgement of the text, but the voice! Judith Ivey may be a Tony Award winner, but that doesn't necessarily make her fit to do audio book readings. I would much prefer to have a reader use the same voice for all characters and narration as opposed to having someone vary their speech and accent, with disasterous results. I listen to audio tapes while in the bath, and this one was so awful that I had to get out of the tub and drip water all over the bathroom floor in order to turn it off so that I could have a relaxing bath. Please, read the book, but steer clear of the audio production!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for women","review":"My book club read this book. We all loved it. I especially loved it. The characters were so well developed. You may not have always agreed with them. But you did feel like you knew them, and cared for them. The only thing with this book was at the beginning it was a little hard to follow. Every chapter is one of the friends. I did what one reader suggested, I made little notes on each character. I used that instead of back tracking into the book. Before I was even half way done with the book I didnt need the notes. You get to know the characters so well. Then the book just flowed for me. I thought the story was great and nicely told I hated to see it end. If you just want a good story about friends read this book. Or if you ever read \\"Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood\\" and liked it you will like \\"The Saving Graces.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Subtle but moving","review":"The general review is correct: there is nothing particularly surprising in the plot of this book. It will not drag you along in suspense waiting for the next unforseen plot twist. But if you are anything like me, you will get completely swept up because you care for these flawed but wonderful, completely relate-able characters.

I identified with a little something in each of the characters, and ended up caring a great deal about what happened to them. Gaffney's writing style is straightforward and simple, which allows the characters' emotions to shine. Gaffney does a masterful job of weaving humor, love, and tragedy into a cohesive plot, which is pretty amazing, given the fact that the characters take turns telling the story of their lives and the events that unfold. Indeed, this structure allows the story to be more subtle, revealing the dynamics of the friendship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Women talk...too much about not much","review":"I percieved this to be more women talk about trite, everyday problems that go on an on, and on and on. Nothing new, nothing enlightening. Same old middle adult whining, crying, neediness, divorce, infertility, struggling mental health, searching for approval; it was another shallow soap opera type despite the emotions that were described. My mother would have loved it. This, after Ya Ya Sisterhood and The Red Tent, I've read enough about the delightful gossip, oops, meaningful observations of female [support] groups. Yes, my book discussion group will like it, but I remain among the bored minority and in need of finding something more adventurous in fiction, or with more substance in non-fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Madame Butterfly Goes to Washington","review":"Perceptive to how the myriad of feelings we humans possess becomes tightly wound from the girdles of our souls to the crests of our hearts like the reverberant and brooding strings of a vintage cello, Patricia Gaffney has composed a masterful orchestration in this her magnificent opus THE SAVING GRACES -- a billowing drama of operatic proportions arousing the improbable images of Maria Callas, Kiri te Kanawa, Joan Sutherland, and Sarah Brightman as castaways on the Isle of Suburbia singing lamentations on a theme of fleeting camaraderie."},{"rating":"2","title":"More of the same, please","review":"This is a perfect accompaniment to any major Switzerland guidebook that you may already have.

Bama Lee Cotter is a protagonist one would love having as a friend - and Granny should be everyone's grandmother. All the characters in the book are so vividly protrayed by this new southern writer that they seem to be people you meet in everyday life.Bama Lee Cotter owned and operated an Art Studio in Woodville, a small Alabama town.

A certain section of the book I have marked and have referred to it from time to time over the years. I guess I need to read her other books which, from other reviews, are short stories?

The first time I listened to this song on Dannii's website, I thought... she's a bloody queen of recycling. I didn't like it all. The instrumental is not originally produced and the lyrics are in a total mess. It didn't blend nicely. Thank goodness for being able to download it from the net before it got released. I forcefully listened to it quite often and eventually this song grew in me. I'm glad the Perfection(Dancing DJ's Remix) version reinvented the original version of the song and gave it a more unique feel. The original version especially Bobby Blanco & Miki Moto Remix heavily used the instrumental sample that made it sound like a \\"cut and paste\\" production. I believe Dannii is creative and she can do better tracks than this. She just have to pick the right DJ collaborators. I would suggest she should try Wayne G. or Full Intention. In summary the Dancing DJ's Remix really saved this song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Usually, I regard the lonely planet series as one of the best traveling guides.

And while I certainly love a good debate, I must disagree with CreativeFolk; so the authors differ on a few points. I am just so happy that there is more to read! But instead of suggesting to you all another book on Harriet, I --like the author of the Time magazine article--see Clinton's book in a very fascinating dialogue with Jean Yellin's recently published biography of Harriet Jacobs.

I have done alot of his other videos and this is one of the best ones. He keeps the cardio pace throughout the 45min long workout, but you don't feel tired because he keeps the sets small, so you don't burn out as fast. You get a great ab, buns, arms, legs workout but you don't feel the strain of it, like in other Tae-Bo videos. Yes, the people look like they having fun, but it is a great motivation to see them smiling and having Billy coax you along.

He is an acknowledged musical genius loved by millions and worth as much. What more does he want? Barry Miles was horrendous with his factual errors and in the world of Beatle fans, who know EVERYTHING about their beloved group, this is the ultimate sin. I was looking forward to understanding how Lennon/McCartney truly created their music. Instead I got Paul winking at me, reminding all that he was basically responsible for every innovation the Beatles came up with. Overall this is not a book worth having."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Many Years From Now\\" this won't be reread!","review":"\\"Paul McCartney: Many Years From Now\\" should really be titled \\"Total Chaos\\" or \\"Store In A Cool Dark Place.\\" There were quite a few factual errors that die-hard fans caught. For instance, the song \\"I Don't Want To Spoil The Party\\" was NOT sung by Ringo. Another song, \\"Money\\" was NOT written by Lennon/McCartney. Along with snags like these was the remark on pg. 158 regarding Walter Shenson, the producer of \\"A Hard Day's Night.\\" In this book it's stated that Mr. Shenson \\"cleverly recognized\\" [sic] that the Beatles would be famous. In fact, in the video, \\"The Making of A Hard Day's Night\\" (released 1994) Mr. Shenson admits he DIDN'T know that the band would have lasting notoriety, as far as a \\"pop group\\" was concerned. Facts like these should have been checked thoroughly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Truly Sensational Book","review":"Some people are trying to say that this book is just a load of bull and Paul was just falsly justifying himself so he wouldn't look like such a brainless idiot to future generations. That could not be further from the truth. If there are any John fans out there who think that he was the be all and end all of the Beatles and their avant-garde stage, then they are truly deluding themselves. This book was fascinating and insightful. Recommended to anyone interested in the group or the period."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I've ever read!!! BUY IT NOW!!!","review":"This book gave me the sense of traveling through Sir McCartney's life from the time he was a young teenager up to his Knighting in 1997. He seemed to give an honest assessment of all the things whirling around him during his legendary life and did not sugar coat the bad stuff. As a McCartney/Beatle fan, I throughly enjoyed this book. It was almost sad when I had read the last page........"},{"rating":"1","title":"McCartney Exposed","review":"This year Santa left me the John Lennon Anthology box and this book. Many Years From Now I'm sure I'll still be playing the CD's but hopefully I'll have forgotten all about the time I wasted on this smug, humorless and self satisfied piece of drivel. Dame Paul obviously chose Miles to \\"ghost\\" the book because he knew that he'd not be challenged on any of his rather ridiculous claims and Miles does nothing to analyze any of Paul's statements.Does anybody know if Geroge Martin has commented on or reviwed this bbok? I'd love to know what he has to say.Now, having revealed that he invented MTV, avant-garde music and every other major art form of the 20th century, what is left to be revealed in the inevitable 2nd volume?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Intimate...I thoroughly enjoyed it.","review":"I really liked the the book because for the first time I got a glimpse of the inner PM. However, the book lacked details of Paul's Wings years, his Michael Jackson fiasco(where MJ screwed him out of his songs), and his Tokyo jail saga. Even so, the book's a worthy read, especially for those who labour under the illusion that paul didn't love john and value that friendship--this really comes across in the book, as does his love for his family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astonishing!!!...at one point","review":"The only thing that this biography needs to be really good is showing a bit of Paul's post-beatles career, his Wings-period, his incursions on classic music... all the things that a fan would REALLY like to know. Otherwise, this book is very good, the only thing being the fact that everybody knows a lot about Paul's life during the Beatles times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relive the Fab 60's through the lives of the Beatles","review":"If you want to relive the sixties, this is a great book in which to do so. Can you remember the first time you heard a particular Beatles song? Where you were, what were you doing? The sixties were a time of peace and love, caring and sharing with our brothers and sisters. This book shows how they (the Beatles) were living their particular lives at the time. A good read. A bit too many details about certain things I found irelevant but throughly enjoyable with many new facts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great behind-the-scenes biography!","review":"I really appreciated that the book was NOT about all of the things we usually read - concerts, ON STAGE personae, etc. It was very inside. It gave me a much different impression of Paul McCartney. I loved the way Paul described the way he and John would sit facing each other when they co-wrote their songs. I felt the intimacy of their eye contact - a sort of love affair, a magic that really clicked for a time. I'm hoping Barry Miles will do one book for each Beatle."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book I would want to read again","review":"I must say I disagree with alot of the people who say this book was bad or Paul was crying like a baby. This book told me alot of information about the early, later, and present life of Paul McCartney. My dad has told and showed me alot of things and compared to this, my dad was still a student learning this stuff. This book also had a lot of pictures that I enjoied and I give a \\"thumbs up\\" to Barry Miles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"A very worthwhile read. A wealth of information about how the miracles happened, and how the mistakes happened.-It's coming out now; both of the Beatles' engineers, Norman Smith and Geoff Emerick, admit that Paul was the \\"producer-on-the-floor\\" as well as arranger of most of the Beatles songs. Certainly he contributed what we consider most Beatlesque as a group, what distinguished them and what vaulted them over the top: those intriguing, keening harmonies; as well as the focus on drive and quality.With many comments from Paul, many self-deprecating, you'll feel like you know him. Many laudatory comments about John, quite a bit more balanced and nuanced than what John ever wrote or said about Paul. You'll have a better understanding of John's contributions and virtues.-Read it, combine it with what you know, and judge for yourself. Excellent grist for thought. Don't miss it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This \\"biography\\" makes one long for a true, objective biography such as the recently-released \\"Lennon\\" by Philip Norman.While there are some fun little stories sprinkled throughout the Chapters, so much of this comes across as bitter, revisionist and petty. McCartney seems obsessed with claiming songwriter percentages - nearly every song discussion includes the likes of \\"oh, this was 70% me and maybe 30% John.\\" EVERY freaking song!Who cares?McCartney has often been portrayed as bossy, self-serving and, yes, petty. That this is the \\"authorized\\" biography sadly confirms those claims.This book isn't a complete waste of time - but almost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very unecessary","review":"Hardly any we didnt know yet. The books mostly a book on Lennon, whose biography by Albert Goldman is by far superior and more objective. We all know by now that Macca was mostly responsible for Revolver and Sgt.Pepper (the two records which are easily hiscreative peek, his white album material was horrible(only 3 good songs out of 12) and, he \\"forgets\\" to mention Lennon come-back round then was easily superior to his), while john died the well-knows ego-death. Thanx for reminding us though, Paul.nevertheless maccas claim to be as arty as Lennon doesnt gell completely; none of his songs have the same avant-garde approach of, say, I Am The Walrus or Happiness is A Warm Gun. Not one new, or deeper, insight here. Read Albert Goldmans Lennonbio instead!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best McCartney Book Out There","review":"So far, this is one of my favorite Beatle related books. Using what must have been amazing interviews with Paul over the years, the author lets him do the talking. Paul has quite a memory (thank God) and he doesn't hold back. His casual attitude towards 'pulling birds' may hurt some feelings, as it did mine, but once Linda appears all is forgiven. A nice balance of personal and professional activities, and quite an insight into Paul's interest in art which one never hears much about. A must for any true Macca fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like spending an evening with Paul","review":"Paul -- who usually hides behinds glib answers and the \\"thumbs up\\" sign with interviewers -- is remarkably candid this time around. And we're the better for it. He was more sophisticated and world-weary than I'd expected, but that in no way detracted from my enjoyment of the book. It's a portrait of an artist who has been around for more than 50 years, famous for more than 30, and who managed to both leave an indeliable mark on his century and have a fulfilling home life. If some things are factually inaccurate, well, this is how Macca remembers them. The book is very honest about that. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves the Beatles, pop music or pop culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest and well written.","review":"I found the book fascinating and enjoyed its' honesty. It was very interesting to read the where, how and when of all the songs that I have enjoyed over the years. I also found it interesting and fascinating to read how the contributions of people close to Sir McCartney helped to develope his immense talent. It was a plus that the words were from Sir McCartney himself. The history and facts that were included by Barry Miles made the story even more captivating. Barry Miles is to be commended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Complete Insight to Life As a Beatle","review":"I have been a \\"Beatlemaniac\\" since 1964. This was by far, the most insightful description of everyday life from one of the world's most talented men. The pre-Beatles stories of the early day's with John sitting around their homes constructing songs was fascinating. I felt like a fly on the wall sitting there watching them construct some of today's classics. The descriptions of the drug culture of the mid 60's and how it affected each one of them was mind boggling. I never realized how overboard John went with his drug use. The song by song analysis of all the Beatle songs written by John and Paul was fantasic. I recommend this book any Beatle's fan who wants to learn more about them. This book is great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mesmerizing","review":"I ordered this book on a whim, expecting the usual dry history lesson about the Beatles' beginnings, middle and end. However, instead I found myself mesmerized by the many (and sometimes surprising) details of Paul's life in London during the mid-60's. And I thought I knew it all. If half of what I read is true, Paul came through to me as much more intellectually curious and aware than I had previously thought. I disagree with the complaints of his 'whining.' It seemed to me he took great care to give John the respect he deserves. John clearly wasn't an easy man to love but Paul chose to see the sweet, vulnerable side of his friend -- even at the worst of times. I felt myself transported right back to the 60's as I read this book. It's a fascinating ride. Lots of fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING--MISLEADING TITLE","review":"I post this simply as a warning to buyers, after being misled myself: the title and the names of the plays (prominently displayed on the cover) would lead you believe, as I did, that this is a collection of those plays, like The Best American Short Stories or something of that sort. Far from it. This is a theater yearbook, and the plays are represented by essays about them--certainly not what I thought I was getting.

It isn't intended to replace reading his actual books. But each little essay is a gem...you can read one a day in 2 minutes and it will give you food for thought for the rest of the day. It will also inspire and motivate you to go read the full text from which the essay was taken. All four books are absolutely wonderful and they are an excellent way to introduce a friend to CS Lewis. They are also excellent gifts to give when a friend is dealing with one of the four topics the books cover; grief, faith, joy, or love. I have sent this books to many friends when they are dealing with one of those issues, and each time the friend is very moved by C.S. Lewis' insights."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lewis needs more pages","review":"I admire C.S. Lewis, the fact that he came to know Christ, after being an atheist. However, I agree with the previous review that this book does not do Lewis justice in that it only represents small outtakes of his thoughts/writings. There are some sections in the book that you can take to heart, like enjoying the simpler things in life, like nature, that God created for us to enjoy.

There was no mystery, no puzzle, no story, just a sequence of random, and very mundane, pretty realistic events. If I had to guess the theme I would've said: some people are happy, but some people are lonely, or possibly, everyone's a heavy drinker and you will be too after we've had our two hours worth of say. In fact, the best part of this movie was the burrito I ate while watching it. So, watch this movie if you want to be annoyed by most of the characters, and bored by the others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great acting wasted on utterly BORING movie","review":"I bought this film based on the directing of Mike Leigh and the lead actor Jim Broadbent, who had so successfully linked up in Topsy Turvy - a remarkable insight into the lives and music of Gilbert and Sullivan. While I found Broadbent and the other actors in this movie to be convincing, I found the story itself and the sad sack loser characters it portrays to be painful to endure. Basically nothing happens in the movie - ends as boringly as it starts.This is a character study of lost souls propped up by draining the energy and time of the \\"normal\\" main characters they rely upon. The \\"normal\\" main characters are portrayed so convincingly you want to wince when they have to survive the burdens imposed by their well meaning friends and family. If you are into slow-moving and intricate character pieces about the burdens of ordinary life, you may enjoy this. Frankly, it seemed like a well acted but depressing soap opera piece to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad Sack Fest","review":"Downer on steroids.

Tried contacting Thule on-line (twice). The instructions had some drawings of the screws - presumably to scale at about 1/2 inch or so - however the actual screws that were provided were longer.The lack of proper seating (screws too long to completely tighten) means that these bars wobble and are unsafe - a serious accident waiting to happen.Half-inch screws would have made these ok - unfortunately these aren't provided (the Thule screws have specialized heads).Thule really needs to address this. These would have been simple to replace.Other than that, the rack system seems fine (except that the system doesn't accept existing bars from other Thule systems).But the screw length is a show-stopper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat interesting, but ....","review":"While the soundtrack for this DVD is Stravinsky's famous ballet score called \\"Le Sacre du Printempts\\" [The Rite of Spring], the film is not the ballet story at all, except possibly for some common theme of redemption. The film plot is a rather different, surreal story, somewhat interesting, but hardly as compelling as Stravinsky's own ballet plot.

It starts well enough with an upbeat attitude, but the heroine is so stupid you find yourself wondering how she functions. Reading this book was like watching a horror movie where the girl hears a scream and instead of running the other way, has to go out into the dark corridor without a weapon to investigate. Abby is like that character. She has clues literally hitting her over the head and yet she can't connect the dots. Knowing someone has tried to kill her twice, and that she has been spotted by the bad guy trying to get away with a sample of coke disguised as fertilizer, she goes to her shop alone without making sure she has back up and then she doesn't turn on the alarm to her shop so no one can break in. I finished the book, but I will not buy another in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"The mystery itself wasn't bad, although it was easy to figure out. However, the character of Abby had to be one of the most annoying I've come across, and because of her, a book that would normally take me two days to read took me more than two weeks.Abby's meddling was stupid. There was no reason for her to be involved in the first place, let alone keep putting herself in more jeopardy.

Muscular Paul Sloan plays a convicted serial killer who is used to host the body of a \\"friendly\\" alien who is out to stop the hundred or so aliens invading us. Colleen Porch plays Logan, his earthly partner whose role is minimalized and romanticized, too.

All of the singers have rich, beautiful voices, the period instruments are a pleasure to watch, and the audio and visual qualities of the DVD are excellent. The filming of a live stage performance is handled unobtrusively excerpt for the parts when the Messenger sings directly in front of the wide-angle lens camera. Among the things I disliked was the fact that the Spirits and Euridice wear opaque veils in the underworld scenes; the veils not only obscure the dramatic effect but also seem to interfere with their singing. Orpheus's plastic lyre looks like a high school prop. The timing of the English subtitles is also awkward and there is no option to display the Italian libretto. The acting is sometimes a bit exaggerated and artificial (on purpose?), but the music throbs with emotion and is always stunning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful, but dull, ultimately disappointing.","review":"It's terrible to see something so painstakingly beautiful yet so dramatically inert. Musically there is much to enjoy. Visually, as lovely as the costumes, settings, etc. are, I found this Orfeo to be a crashing bore.Mr. Zanasi's Orfeo, while at times beautifully sung, is almost comical, looking more like a plump, Spanish businessman at a costume party and his acting is close to nil.Trish Brown's stunning, minimalist production of Orfeo with the simply amazing Simon Keenlyside dancing and singing the title role with Brown's dance company was shown throughout Europe on television (and available on inferior quality pirate DVD), is far and away more moving, equally musical (Rene Jacobs and an early music ensemble) and would be a better choice for DVD release than this production.Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful production","review":"This is a wonderful production of an early Baroque opera.

[I wish it were out on DVD!] That was even MORE baroque in its look but there was action, where there needed to be, and people standing there singing, where that needed to be [Ponnelle was a master at this]But, since this is my favorite opera [well actually \\"Le Nozzi\\" is my fave....this is 2nd] I am delighted to have a beautiful, rich and excellently sung version even if they do just stand there."},{"rating":"2","title":"MAKE THAT CHANGE","review":"CALL THE PHYSICIAN IS A WONDERFUL PIECE.THE HIT, WEDDING SONG IS NICE, A COUPLE CAN'T GO WRONG TO CHOSE THIS SONG TO BE PRESENTED IN THERE WEDDING.MY FAVORITE IS (MAKE THAT CHANGE).

The lack of a CD is devestating and is it just me or does someone have a serious ego trip going here (the motion blur employed on the author's mug on the cover is actually telling because most of the techniques within the book are brutally fuzzy at best). I'm puzzled at all the five star reviews. Either there's a lot of people who want a good looking coffee table book, or Curtis has a lot of friends pullin' for him.

He shows how to work within this system to deliver beautiful animations to the average user rather than crying for broadband. I find the \\"Behind the design\\" sections the most unique for this genre of publication, explaining the technical constraints and design process for each project. These sections provide both connection to the real-world issues of web delivery and insight into his creative process.

Hillman deconstructs and explains his thought process on jobs that he has actually has produced for actual clients.There are books out there on Flash (and other software) that only emphasize the software aspect.

Absolutely useless book both for beginners and experts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money","review":"After completing a Flash 5 course, I asked my instructor what would be a good Flash book to purchase. His response was \\"Hillman Curtis\\". I didn't regret it. There are books out there dedicated to Action Script, others to the basics, etc. As a designer wanting to build Flash sites, this one was perfect. It covers a lot of \\"why\\" when trying to figure out how a site should look and feel. So many flash sites have interaction and animation simply for the sake of movement, with no real reasoning behind it. Fluff with no substance. The examples here go beyond fluff and get to the real.The deconstructions are literally step-by-step with explanations along the way. Some examples use software outside of Flash in the preparation stages, but Flash is not an end-all product.If you want a reference book on Action Script, this is not it.

A terrific read."},{"rating":"1","title":"excellent writing except....","review":"This book had very poignant moments but overall the characters seemed just too idiotic to be believed. The main problem for me was that it wasn't obvious why Claire Marvel was so great, why she was worthy of unremitting love. She has a few witty remarks and is supposedly beautiful but what of it? Her acts are not justifiable and therefore you can't relate to her or to the protagnist. In the end I just wanted to knock both character's heads together because they acted so stupidly. I suppose their inability to commit to each other might be some underlying theme of the novel but it makes very frustrating reading!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Marvel that I Managed to Finish This Book","review":"Most of this book was pointless fluff. Why do we need to know every detail about the main character's teaching and his marriage and blah blah blah? The few chapters with Claire in the beginning were not enough to convince me of a great love -- and the reason for their (prolonged) seperation didn't convince me either, so nothing in-between held me. At many points I wondered what I was reading for. He seemed obsessed, she seemed morose -- I didn't care one way or the other by the end. And I'm a romantic!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"pretentious and silly","review":"I did not find this book believable -it read as if done by a high school student. The characters had no depth.

It is not genuine Christian fiction. I read the Preacher's Daughter and The Englisher and I found them to not be an accurate view of the Christian faith. The books (and the Amish faith) portray a legalistic religion, put their authority as supreme rather than a direct relationship with God, and don't allow people to say they have been saved through a personal relationship with God. This thinking is contrary to what the Bible teaches. The Preacher's Daughter also leaves you hanging. There is no good closure to the book and it does not stand alone as a book. You have to read the next book to continue the story and it doesn't conclude well either. I would not want people to buy these books thinking this is what it is to be a Christian.

In other word this book is worthless to read prior to the lecture on the subject mater.

The \\"plot\\" or story line seems to get lost at times; it becomes rambling, episodic, and seemingly endless. At times, it reads like a \\"bodice ripper\\" instead of a mystery. It is told in the first person by Ellie Haskell, interrupted by occasional comments from the Tramwell sisters. But would Ellie really tell her most personal and intimate thoughts to the Tramwells--complete strangers? I think not"},{"rating":"1","title":"There IS Another Choice","review":"I'm so thankful that I saw this bizarre production before I actually spent money on it. Most of the reviewers seem to like this intrepretation of the opera, or accepted it as being the only one available. I'm not into avant garde staging of operas, particularly if they're being committed to DVD for posterity. I want to bring hope to the masses. There is another production available. A German television production of the opera is available through Premier Opera, featuring James King and Karan Armstrong. You can also view clips of it on You Tube. You couldn't ask for a more electrifying or traditional staging of this wonderful opera."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Korngold, but it's also Hello Dolly","review":"This is a dark production, and one in which many viewers will find cause to quibble (that ever present dolly clutched by our troubled hero). It is also a well sung and recorded performance that is quite moving at times. Until something better comes along, this will do nicely."},{"rating":"1","title":"garish mess of a lovely work","review":"If you've never seen/heard this work, please don't let this be your first experience. The opera is a lovely ghost story, a mystery set in the magical mists of Bruges, fragile romance offset by the passionate lyricism of Korngold's music. It is totally lost in this garish. grotesque production, more grand guignoll than ethereal. The artistry of the excellent singers is often harshened by the full-out volume of the sound engineering. Buy any other production!"},{"rating":"2","title":"o dubhthaigh knows not of what he speaks","review":"o dubhthaigh's review of the song \\"DRIVIN' THUNDER\\" is not only moronic but naive. \\"DRIVIN THUNDER\\" is not about racin for two hours and only turning left, it has to do with Stephen's love of OFFSHORE POWERBOAT RACING! Check out the CSN&Y 1988 release on AMERICAN DREAM to preview the original song. The moral of the story? Every CD is worthy of 5 stars in the artist's eyes. Listening to a moron, oh sorry, you can't call a person that over the airwaves... listening to a maroon whose only claim to fame is being the first person to review any CD over five hundred times, needs to get a life. It would help if history was on his side, but it was not. Heck, I helped the Buffalo Springfield unload the truck when they played at a Bay Area Jr. High School probably long before o dubhthaigh was born. So, until you get the facts straight, o dubhthaigh, review yourself first before you review the work of others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Stephen","review":"I am a huge longtime Stephen Stills fan....all the way back to Buffalo Springfield. I am uncomfortable saying it, but I waited soooo long for this new music, and as it turns out, it is almost unlistenable to me. I don't like the \\"sound\\" of the guitar in almost every song....there is no memorable melody to be found....and Stephen's voice is shot and difficult to listen to. How anyone can give this 4 or 5 stars is absolutely beyond me. I think Stephen has made wonderous music over his career, but not this time. There is nothing wrong with getting a bit older, and maybe slowing down the tempo bit and even changing styles, but has anyone heard Paul McCartney's new \\"Chaos\\" album? It is a revelation.....and has set another standard for both the \\"young and the old(er)\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgetable","review":"This is a forgetable album that diehard Stephen Stills fans should pass on. The man was an icon in his day but peaked 30+ years ago. Stills has clearly lost his once beautiful voice. He alternately sounds like a drunk or a retard. The backing vocals are horrid. A couple of the more up tempo tunes are mildly interesting and the increased volume serves to disguise somewhat the key weakness of the entire effort - Mr. Still's voice. And the guitar playing is still up to snuff. But, oh yeah, in case I didn't mention it. He sounds really BAD. It's a real shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long awaited CD hits the mark","review":"Just received Stephen Stills new CD \\"Man Alive\\" and I am very pleased. The depth and variety of the musical styles showcased here is, as always, what has attracted me to Mr. Stills' music. From rock, to blues, to social issues, to ballads, to blue grass, to cajun, to latin,this album has it all.

And by all means try to catch one of his solo shows this year where you can see him perform several of them live. \\"Ole Man Trouble\\" itself is worth the price of admission!Please Stephen, not so much time before next one, ok?

But all in all the little one loved it and that is what mattered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for hand-eye coordination","review":"My 18mo daughter received this. She still hasn't gotten the idea of trying to throw the animals into the basket. She does love and play with the brightly colored animals though. I take the game out once a week to practice throwing with her. My 4-yr old also plays a some with it. The game is really great for practicing hand-eye coordination with throwing. It's actually a rather simple concept made cute with the animals. My only gripe with it is that the supports for the lid which make the backstop for the game are not very durable. I think they are made of fabric wrapped around cardstock. I have to be careful not to leave the game out otherwise the lid inevitably gets smushed bending the supports."},{"rating":"2","title":"review","review":"This product was as described, purchased for my 18 mo old grandson.

I've purchased two of his CDs already. Duke's original songs sound like new standards, and even his covers sound like his own; his arrangements are fresh, entertaining, and even at times humorous (in concert). Check him out!!!

Dorothy Day lived a cruciform life. She took Jesus seriously at his word, and lived a life that most Christians could not make sense of (which is telling in regards to whether or not any of us would be able to recognize Jesus amongst us). This collection of her writings are quintessential Dorothy Day. She address Christian fidelity in light of money, war, abortion, class, and race. Her words are so simple yet so difficult. She continues to stands within the prophetic tradition of Christianity. Read her writings, look at her life, re-imagine Jesus, and then just try it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dorothy Day's Loaves and Fishes","review":"This is an excellent book inviting the reader to a look inside the life of the Catholic Worker movement.

In America we look to large agencies and government programs to alleviate the hunger, homelessness, and health problems of our very poor brothers and sisters. This little book is an early history of the Catholic Worker movement, begun in 1933 during the Depression. It also is a guide to small, personal actions for these same social ills. While the movement remains focused on individual and personal actions on behalf of individual persons, somehow hundreds and thousands of very poor people have been and are fed, housed, and loved into lives which alleviate those problems for themselves.

I also agree that it isn't as easy to hold as a full-size mouse that is contoured to one's hand, but that's not why I bought it. It is perfect for use in the classroom with PowerPoint as it undocks me from the front of the room so I can move in the classroom and see what the students see.

Nelly doesn't even think about rapping here either, you can hear him crying \\"SHE'S RIGHT YA KNOW, SHE'S RIGHT\\" in his annoying high-pitched voice, also displaying his feeble lyrical abilities as well.

Then the music, Les McCann had a very political period, and as I analize it, by the way he sold out in the 80's, he'd sell out for whatever was campy at the time, to hell with the art of it. He really did some great work with Lou Rawls (which makes a more honest statement about the black experience than all that \\"power\\" stuff this one has.

I would have preferred to hear more of these people'sjourneys. As it is, sometimes the emotion is just building when weswitch to another reader and another story.Also, inter-cutting somewhat forced feeling 'backstage banter' as theactors prepare for, or finish their readings feels a bit distractingfrom the more powerful simple, straightforward readings.

The second is defending her aginst charges that she has murdered the owner of the toy company. He is also battling the after-effects of his own recent near-death experience. Matthew has to work through all these difficulties without the help of his favorite PI's Warren Chambers and Toots Kiley who are embroiled in a life-threatening subplot of their own.

Meanwhile, Matthew's cohorts, Warren Chambers and Toots Kiley, in an entirely seperate subplot, are engaged in a drug battle on a drifting boat.McBain's laconic, mannered prose lends a familiar rythm to this well-paced story laced with moral ambiguities, some of which are Matthew's own."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"I am a big fan of Ed McBain / Evan Hunter, expecially his 87th precinct books.

It works as advertised, but it is not as precise or heavy duty as the PacTool. The PacTool does scratch up your siding, so you would have to go with their special plastic version if you have pre-painted siding.

What one must bear in mind is that this is a DYNAMIC microphone, so it's ideal for recording instrument cabinets or even loud vocals. In order to record acoustic instruments one must employ a CONDENSER micrphone, which has a wider frequency response (it's highly sensitive) making it susceptible to even the faintest sounds.

There is always a good mystery in the books, and they have great endings.

This might not be so much the fault of the blade, as it is the fault of the reciprocating saw in the set. Since there is no adjustment for the blade guard, you will do all of your cutting at the same location on the blade, and wear it out faster than you would if you have an adjustable guard on the saw. If you have the same set of tools, or any recip saw that does now allow you to adjust the cutting location on the blade, then you will find that the blade wears out in the only location that you can cut with, and the rest of the blade is still perfect, but utterly useless.I have used other brands, with far better results, these are throw away blades, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"decal removal frustration taken to a new height!","review":"Ok, the saw blades, they cut fine, no complaints on them, although I have nothing to compare them to.

They were nearly impossible to remove- even using a hair dryer they still came off in pieces- and then it took several applications of paint thinner with paper towels to remove the adhesive on the case.

Your editorial reviews state that the Virtual Gold package gives you \\"everything and more\\" to handle the simulations. This is flatly not true--the actual test simulations are totally different than your package. I was very frustrated when I took the test to find the simulations so completely different. Also, they had troubleshooting simulations your package did not offer, as well as portions not even covered by your package! Someone obviously just changed the 640-507 to 640-607 in their editorial review. This package needs to be updated, and someone needs to pay attention to the accuracy of their claims!

I was trying to follow the course of Todd Lammle's book: CCNA Study Guide, and half the commands do NOT work. Simple little things, like trying to trace the path taken to another host using \\"TRACE 172.16.10.1\\" comes back with INVALID INPUT! Not to mention many other basic commands, which also produce the same result.Todd Lammle was co-creator of this piece of software.

My first issue is with the number of commands available - there aren't enough. And there should be a different response for unsupported ones, so the user knows if he/she has made an error or simply exceeded the scope of the trainer. More importantly, though, is the \\"bugginess\\" of the software. Commands don't \\"take\\", or they show as configured but then don't perform as they should.

The name 'Heaven Leigh' makes me laugh, but is a good indicator of the dreamy storyline. It contains an absolutely unrealistic plot full of cardboard-cut-out characters. This C-grade 'soapie' is nothing more than a pathetic 'rags-to-riches' fantasy. It's full of 'beautiful' women with perfect figures and faces that 'ignite arousal' in any man. And 'dashing' men who are 'handsome', 'dangerous', and 'mysterious'. If you like your characters shallow and romantacised with no hints of reality or complexity than you'll enjoy the characters in these books. It contains as much depth as a puddle and is boring and predictable. Quite frankly, I'm embarrassed to have the series in my bookshelf but am not so cruel as to give them away to poor, unsuspecting victims."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heaven..","review":"Even though this is the last series i've read,((i havent read celste yet, but i've read all the other books)), i truly believe it is one of the best...Just sum of the things she went through...it was really great..I recommend this for a summer read, definitely.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"Heaven is a touching story, that has you reading it until your vision blurs like many of V.C Andrews stories. A poverty stricken family full of terrible burdens and so much grief it seems never ending. Secrets nobody wants to remember. Living in a shack up in the hills, isolated from those better off, and having a last name -Casteel that would always taint their reputation. The only thing keeping them alive and with a little hope was each other, until their fathers desperation and greed took over, once their mother had left. He sold them, the ultimate nightmare of separation! The characters were sometimes bordering a little unrealistic in their actions, but it was still an enjoyable read, full of surprising twists and turns, making me want to continue with reading the rest of this series. I recommend this to people wanting to absorb themselves in a book that evolves into a great story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I loved this book. By far one of Virginia Andrews best! The whole series was really good.Sherry A. Mauro's new book, EVEN ANGELS FALL reminds me a bit of this story. Her writing style is similar to VCA's. Another great author to read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A real girl who can take anything!","review":"So touching I enjoyed every word!

The story was truly magnificent and it really kept me reading. This is the first book that I have read by V.C. Andrews... but I will definately read more of her books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Story","review":"Heaven and all the other books in this series are incredible to read. The characters aren't the most forgiving people, (though they did love their siblings) but they have very good reasons and I believe under the circumstances I would probaly act much the same. It has a great storyline, great writting that really does put you in the picture and the characters are priceless. It really is a book worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I LOVED this book. Heaven went through so much and I felt sympathy for her. However, Kitty Dennison deserved to die. Thank god she did. How could anybody not see through her. Cal should have left Kitty right away. Perhaps Kitty abused him too? I don't know. That was twisted and kept me on the edge of my seat. Logan should have not run away on Heaven. That was childish and it wasn't Heaven's fault that Cal was attracted to her. I was Kitty's, of course. If someone treated me the way Kitty treated Heaven, I would beat them up. Another book by VCA that you should read is Darkest Hour! That's also wonderful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not VC's Best","review":"I know I differ from other posters but I truly believe that VC Andrews went downhill after Flowers in the Attic. The idea that a parent would sell his own children is plausible as it definitely happens but it does not seem very believable in this book. Additionally, someone commented that there is no incest...yes there is. There is a brief moment when Heaven's father looks at her in a sexual way and her grandfather has to stop something horrible from happening- easy to miss but it is definitely there! Also if you follow the series she end up falling in love with her half-uncle! I admit that as a teenager I loved this book but rereading the VC Andrews books I found in my house recently, the only one I can recommend is Flowers in the Attic- the entire Heaven series as an adult seems contrived and amateurish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still WAITING!!","review":"I have not received this book yet...It's been over a month I've been waiting. If it ever comes I'll let you know."},{"rating":"2","title":"FLOAT LIKE A BUTTERFLY AND STINGS LIKE A BEE","review":"The Casteel saga was my favorite out of all the novels that V.C. Andrews wrote. Everything that Heaven did was something that I understood, but it hurt me so much when she couldn't forgive Luke. He wasn't the best father, but selling her to the horrible Kitty was one of the best choices he've made. She suffered there, but at least she didn't have to worry about starving. Her romance with Logan was the sweetest, and when Cal started taking advantage of her I was ready to pounce. Grr! This is a great book though. V.C. Andrews wrote this book herself, and if you enjoy her original works you will love this."},{"rating":"2","title":"After all these years- just gotta love it!","review":"My mother forbid me to read any V.C. Andrews after the whole Flowers In the Attic epidemic. I was 12 or 13, snuck this home from the library under my winter coat (it was my very first of this author). Twelve years later, after reading anything and everything, I'm reading this book again for the ? time. Yeah, Heaven goes from from 16 to 17 to 16 to 17 every couple pages (anybody ever pick up on that?) but this is one hell of a story line, and the best of any of her series.Read it, love it, you'll live with it forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"captivating, addictive....two thumbs up!","review":"I loved this book so much! I really admired Heaven's personality...sweet, but strong. She had the strength to overcome all the hardships. Reading it really made me be thankful for the good life that I have. I cried all through the book. Pick it up and read it, like, now! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"suitable for teenagers","review":"I was first introduced to V.C. Andrews about 7 years ago when I was in 7th grade. Although I think that \\"Flowers In The Attic\\" was really Andrews' breakthrough, \\"Heaven\\" is a novel that is more suitable for pre-teens and teenagers.The novel reads easily but this does not weaken the moving story. Heaven, the main character, is followed by the audience as she grows up and struggles the cruelties of life. Despite the fact that most readers will not find their own lives analogous to Heaven's, this book is still the perfect coming-of-age novel, emphasizing the importance of facing problems head on and being able to find goodness in dark places."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was drawn into the storyline and felt like a character.","review":"This book was the one that set me off on the hunt for all Virginia Andrews books. I could not put the book down and had to search the book stores for the remainder of the series. Each time I felt I was in the story myself. A real tear-jerking storyline. An excellent book by a very talented writer. This one comes highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A stab of reality. A life of tragity. A world of fantacy.","review":"I feel this is the ideal book for the average life of a 'normal teenager'. You really don't know how bad life can be until you live it in someone elese's shoes. Heaven's character I use now as a rolemodel. She was forced to grow up faster than she wanted to yet she wouldn't let that take away her life long dreams. I strongly encourage anyone to read this novel. I found it amazing how V.C Andrews was able to put me in a daze of imagination and make me feel such emotion while reading the Heaven series. It was almost like creating a new dream world. If you continue to read on to other series of this novel you will find despite the grat tragities of Heaven's life there are some amazing things too. I am 14 years old and not a very big reader, but I promise you, if you read this novel you will agree it's the most brilliant, heart-throbbing story you will ever hear in your whole life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lebo M and Nathan Lane highly represented","review":"This album seemed more like the Lebo M and Nathan Lane album.

Thats worth the price of the whole CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"The soundtrack is Great except for the song by raven. It's a bad remake of a good oldie. Digga Tunnah is my favorite by far! I was dissapointed though that there wasn't more music from Lebo M.

It seems to average about a typo or two per page. At times these typos actually confuse the reading, since they are not only misspellings, but also whole words will be replaced with entirely different words. I can take a typo here and there, but in this book it is so common that it begins to affect the enjoyability of reading it.I will say that the book itself is great and I highly recommend it. I have not seen any other versions of this book, but if you can find one published by other than 'Boomer Books', it would be much better. There is no introduction or translation notes or anything like that.

There are an average of 3 typos per page, not to mention incorrect word substitutions, improper italicization (almost every instance of the words \\"by\\" and \\"my\\" is italicized), and downright bad translation. The worst crime is that the \\"editor\\" chose to peremptorily truncate the novel on the basis that the last chapters aren't good enough to bother to print.

As a young student, our narrator is drawn to this brooding man and his mysterious wife. He is drawn into the web of their lives and the terrible secret that is hidden there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not surprising","review":"This short novel tells the story of a student who gets entangled in confusing sentiments between his professor, the professor's wife and himself.Although the different players are well characterized, the plot is too evident and the final revelation not surprising.This is not one of Stefan Zweig's most successful stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack Quality","review":"The quality of of this dvd was poor, it paused several times in the beginning, but finally got on track after about 5 minutes into the movie.

I also like the heat adjustment feature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great with just one downfall...","review":"This is my first set of hot rollers, and overall I was pleased. I have a lot of fine hair that barely keeps a curl, and I don't have time to use the straightening/curling iron to curl my long hair. These rollers did the job well! They are definitely a healthier alternative to the straightening/curling iron. I only had to set it to heat-level 6 and it kept my hair curly for about the first 5 hours and after that they gradually became a more natural-looking wave. I didn't use any hair product, but I'm sure that the curls would've held longer if I had. I had no problem handling the rollers with my bare fingers either. The clips were the only downside. They are definitely a little too long and therefore top-heavy, so I suggest to go ahead and buy a different set of clips."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who designed this?","review":"This is a very poorly designed product, especially considering it is far more expensive than most sets I have bought before. The clips that hold the curlers in place are huge, there is no where convenient to put them like the small metal ones. They are heavy and feel clumsy on my head. There is no where nice to grab the curlers so I burn my fingers sometimes. I guess it heats up fine, but they are so difficult to deal with that I have yet to get a nice curl."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as described","review":"I bought this because it contained Jumbo rolllers as part of the set. When it arrived, the largest rolller was 1 3/4 inches , not Jumbo which is 2 inches, I sent it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great curler set","review":"I really like these curlers, they heat up very quickly and curl well. I like the retractable cord too, definitely a bonus, really like that feature. The clips hold very well, but the drawback is the dent they leave on your hair. Some days the dent isn't bad and hardly noticeable. On days the dent is noticeable, I just use my big barrel curling iron to quickly \\"iron out\\" the dent, takes just a moment to do that. I have long hair though and I guess if you have short hair, it might be a problem.One improvement for me would be to have more of the large rollers and fewer small ones. Overall, I think this is the best curler set I've ever had. It's the most expensive set I've ever purchased, so I'm hoping it will also be the longest lasting set. My last set was also Conair, was half the price, and lasted about 6 years. I'm hoping I get at least 10 years out of this set!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Conair Infiniti Nano Silver Hair Setter","review":"I own this product and it is fab-u-lous!

And I love the tv version which stars Jason Robards. Both of these versions are well written and very funny. But the Frank Capra version just tries too hard to be funny and ultimately falls flat. And they changed the stage play beyond belief. Jimmy Stewart's character was built up and the other characters were cut back. The continuity of the story suffered because of that. But the worst aspect of the movie is the overblown effort of all involved to be oh so funny and zany and madcap. It is terribly overdone. I usually like Jimmy Stewart's acting. But not in this movie. I usually like Frank Capra's movies. But not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"....Tedious'...","review":"..Way to much time spent on the Stewart/Arthur \\"romance\\"..and the man hating real life lesbo Ann Miller..The print is so appalling I did a rent & rip and put it with another film and burned it to DVD..sorry SONY !..You did'nt get my $20..!..I'll buy a copy when you RESTORE it."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible disaster from Frank Capra Jr.","review":"The villain here is Frank Capra Jr. who continues to allow his father's wonderful films to be released on DVD in absolutely horrible transfers.

Great opportunity to awaken."},{"rating":"2","title":"An old movie, that makes a good point, although a bit exaggerated","review":"This movie is instructive in these days, where individual or corporate greed takes over the natural concerns for fellow human beings, co-existence with mutual dependences and above all the source of happiness. People clamor for happiness in life and seek for it in things that they can do to outwit another. This film shows a rich man's reckless expansion of his business by uprooting poor people that live adjacent to his building and finally how he comes to terms with reality, when his own son breaks off from him. It is an old black and white movie - but is very refreshing to watch again these days."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all time favorite movies.","review":"Such a delightful film. I think this was the first film Jimmy Stewart did with Frank Capra. they of course collaborated later on such films as \\"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\\" (also with Jean Arthur) and the classic \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\". The chemistry between Stewart and Arthur is wonderful, and Lionel Barrymore as the grandfather is perfect. I've watched this movie every year since I was a little kid, and it gets better with each viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Who's asking you to be rational?\\"","review":"The zany Kaufman-Hart play with the Depression-inspired message of forsaking the making of money and doing what you want to do instead, brought to the screen by Frank Capra. The Capra corn is present, though one wishes for some more pop to it at times. John Barrymore plays the ringleader in this madhouse of xylophone players, dancers, fireworks manufacturers, playwrites, etc. James Stewart is the rich kid in love with Jean Arthur, Barrymore's granddaughter. The ending, though utterly predictable, goes right for the heart - and captures it in one fell swoop. At 127 minutes it feels long, in the Capra way - again because one wants more zip. It's a fun movie, though, and took the Academy Award."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"Light hearted yet in-depth comedic look at family and community life, and the rights to express ones' self. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good movie","review":"I'm playing a character in the play that this movie is based on, and so I watched this DVD to get a hint of what it could look like. First, the story is excellent! Do what you want in life; don't work your whole life doing something you hate! That is basically the Sycamore family's philosophy. But when the younger daughter in this household falls in love with the son of the wealthy Kirby family, trouble brews, landing the Kirbys and Sycamores both in jail! In the end, Kirby Sr. learns that maybe the Sycamores have something and gives the young couple his blessing, leaving everybody happy. The play is a little different from the movie, but with the addition of a simple harmonica, the movie is able to give the viewer a wonderful feeling in the end and reinforces the fact that everyone should do what makes him or her happy in life! I will say that the quality of the movie is not the greatest at times, but that's to be expected since it is an older movie. Other than that, it's great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the movie is wonderful but not the DVD","review":"I think this movie is much better than It's a Wonderful Life which gets more press. The characters are loveably zany and an ensemble of great actors play them. However, the DVD is a real disappointment. It is advertised as 'digitally remastered' and HiDef quality which it is. BUT EVERY SCRATCH AND DING in the master has been lovingly 'remastered' along with it. I am amazed that they didn't clean up the movie. Movies half the price - like His Girl Friday done by LaserDisc - are absolutely clear and clean as well. This classic deserves a better effort than this so jeers to the company, whoever they are.

How could a movie like this go wrong? Well, you might be surprised.I watched You Can't Take It With You on one of our family nights in our den. We popped the movie in, and figured on enjoying an evening of cinematic enjoyment comparable to It's A Wonderful Life. By the end of the movie, my opinion had changed.Basically, besides the love story between Stewart's character, which is almost a side plot, the movie is about a pack of pirates who don't do anything...they just stay at home and lie around! Jimmy Stewart is pretty much the only thing that held this movie together for me, and the only reason that I finished the movie is that I hate to leave a movie started, but not finished.Watch this movie only if you have some time, and can stand to be a little bored, or if you, like me, hadn't ever seen Lionel Barrymore in a movie as a GOOD guy."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can't take it with you.....","review":"You Can't Take It with You (Remastered)I thought that as this was a remastered edition that it would be IN COLOR!

It was turned off in about 10 minites. The movie is nothing like the play. In my opinion the play is way better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great laughs, especially toward the end...","review":"This prize-winning play about a nutty family of eccentrics in the 1930's isn't done on stage much anymore (it is a nightmare to produce properly with typical community theater casts and budgets, and it's dated a lot), but the film version, nearly 70 years old now, is worth seeing. Just as good, but apparently not on DVD yet, is a stage version from about 15 years ago starring Jason Robards. I used to own the video tape of that one, and it was quite well done. However, it's hard to beat Jean Arthur and Jimmy Stewart and Lionel Barrymore, for Pete's sake. As an example of '30's-style comic playwriting and movie-making, you can take \\"You Can't Take it with You\\" with you, if you buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining Capra-Corn!","review":"While this doesn't feel as timeless or as compelling as Capra's other films, it is a lot of fun. A very young James Stewart and Jean Arthur shine, but Lionel Barrymore steals the show as the crusty old grandfather of an eccentric family. As with almost all Capra films, the business man is the 'bad guy', and the happy family that believes in good old-fashion American values and aren't afraid to forget about everything else and do 'what they like to do' are the 'good guys'. It feels very stagy, but it does have it's funny moments, and Jimmy Stewart and Jean Arthur make a dangerously cute couple. An entertaining slice of Americana by Mr. Capra. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 7!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio Caveat","review":"One of my favorites but I must rate the DVD edition two starsince, while the videa transcription is near perfect, the audio transcription is very poor and at times not understandable. Frankly, I tossed the DVD and had my VHS transcribed to a disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost thoroughly engaging","review":"I found the (obligatory?) scenes with young children a corny turnoff like when Barrymore and other times Stewart and Arthur are greeting these youthful hordes. Everywhere else I found the film flawless. The story like Capra's Lost Horizon has the message of the importance of happiness. BTW to another poster Frank Capra Sr. is dead and from way down below it's doubtful he knows what his son is doing with Sr.'s old films."},{"rating":"1","title":"bloated Capra-corn","review":"Capra turned a delightful Broadway play into a bloated piece of Capra-corn. I'm not berating the film for not copying the play. I am berating the film for being heavy handed and neither particularly amusing or touching. [Spoiler] To the whimsical story of the Sycamore family Capra has grafted a story about an megalomaniacal businessman who drives his competitor to death. The two stories don't mix.

It really makes you think - or, barring that, you at least get to see the anime's one elaboration on the manga sequence, Tomo clapping her hands over her ears as Yomi cheerfully 'sings' the graduation song.With a series as good as Azumanga, you sort of wish it could go on forever; but part of its charm is that it exists in real time, and the characters, innocent though they might be, are always faced with the problem of growing older and losing touch with the familiar. The humor effortlessly gives way to something profoundly touching.To everyone behind this series--Thank you.

It takes minimal advantage of the ebook format -hyperlinks are used minimally - for example in the Chapter Outlines at the beginn of each chapter you cannot jump to the subchapters, rather you must go page by page. This is very frustrating and should be one of the distinct advantages of an ebook over paper.Unfortunately the ebook Ettinger did not get a good review either.I will probably write this off and go back to my hard copy Ettinger.

Authorized Service Center has now had t.v. for 3 weeks, and I'm told they're waiting for power supply.

I've had friends whose Sylvania televisions also go dead after a few months, so this is the last time I buy anything from Sylvania.

I had to disconnect the bad speaker, thereby losing true stereo sound. The TV is now 3 years old.Note: The Slyvania can be mounted on a wall with a VESA bracket.

I ordered this DVD especially because the concert featured songs from their earlier albums which tend to get less coverage on other concert footage. This was their first DVD attempt & boy does it show! The concert itself is a bit cheesy, but the most disappointing thing for me was that Mark had terrible pitch problems throughout. He hardly ever sang in tune having particular trouble with all the high notes. If you want to see Westlife in concert and enjoy it don't buy this DVD. However, Coast To Coast (for great unplugged performances), The Number Ones Tour and Westlife Live at Wembley especially, are much better investments. You can really see how much the boys have matured and have much more stage presence and confidence in these DVD performances compared to the amateur quality of Where Dreams Come True."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dovey Coe is awsome","review":"Dovey Coe explains a lot about what can happen in life.

Being found with her knife next to a dead man didn't do much to prove her innocence, but she swears up and down that she didn't kill Parnell. Of course, she HATED Parnell, but that's not the point as she sees it. She is very adamant about the fact that she wouldn't kill him.This book goes through the entire story of Dovey's predicament and retraces the background leading up to the murder. Was Dovey really jealous that Parnell proposed to her sister, Caroline? Did Dovey want Parnell all for herself? Or was Dovey just in the wrong place at a very bad time?All of these questions are answered in this book, which is told by Dovey herself. A little predictable, but a great read, nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"COOLY!!!","review":"I absolutely loved this book. It was awesome. One minute I was about to pee in my pants I was laughing so hard and the next minute I was in tears. There was NEVER a moment where I wasn't excited. Dovey reminds me a little bit of me because when I lived in the country my sister had this guy that asked her to marry him and I didn't like that very much. I also always wanted a pocket knife and I got one and I never put it down. I really enjoyed this book and I hope you do the same!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fearless Girl","review":"This novel is about a young girl going through life with a deaf brother and a gorgeous sister. Caroline, her sister, is asked to to take Parnell Caraway's hand, a snotty well known rich boy who gets everything he wants. Dovey hates Parnell and would be mortified if her sister were to marry him. So when Parnell winds up dead, Dovey is everyones first suspect. Dovey fights for her rights and shows everyone that she is not afraid to stand up for herself. Reading this book, you'll have some laughs, crys, and surprises. This is a novel you're sure to love."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Dovey Coe Review","review":"Dovey Coe is a great book! Dovey is an inspiring, brave 12 year old girl who stands strong, even when times are tough. Dovey is accused of murdering Parnell Caraway, a 17 year old , rich snob, who's in love with Caroline Coe, Dovey's older sister. When Caroline turns him down and goes to college, he takes it out on Dovey. Dovey is knocked out my Parnell after a fight with him and when she awakes, Parnell is dead beside her. When Parnell's mother comes in looking for him and sees Dovey leaning over him, she is certain that Dovey is the culprit. But in the end Dovey was proven innocent, and the case was closed. Only Dovey knows who really killed Parnell Caraway. This story is so adventurous and exciting. You'll love Dovey in this shocking novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Mystery","review":"I loved this book so much! I really got captured by Dovey's attitude. I really liked that she would say what she wanted. The ending was very surprising, I liked how the author wrote it. I really liked how the author used grammer like they did in the early 1900's. I think the character of Dovey was incredible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dovey Coe","review":"The book Dovey Coe is very interesting. Dovey Coe is about 12 years old.There is a boy named Parnell Caraway who is in loveand wants to marry Caroline Coe, that's Doveys sister. She alsohas a brother named Amos Coe. He is deaf.

It is about a girl named Dovey who is accused of murder.This book did not have a storng plot.I would recommend books by Francine Pascal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic Portrayal","review":"What ruined this book for me was the way Dovey's brother, Amos, was portrayed. It is not likely that a child who is deaf and has never had any formal schooling would be able to lip read as well as he does, let alone be able to read Mark Twain. Many children who are deaf and have gone to school all their lives wouldn't be able to read at that level. I had trouble believing in the plot knowing this."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME BOOK!!","review":"This was a great book; I couldn't put it down for a minute. It will keep you until the very last page. It is about a girl named Dovey Coe; I think she is 12 years old. She is accused of killing Parnell Caraway. She and her brother know that she didn't do it, but can she prove it?? Read this magnificent book, and you will fall in love with it too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was disappointed by this book, despite the wonderful jacket. I expected to feel close to Dovey Coe, to understand her from the inside out. Instead I found the narration distancing, and I never really got caught up in her story. There are other great books for children that also have a strong voice, but that are somehow truer in their emotional portrayal of their charismatic, spunky narrators."},{"rating":"2","title":"Middle Grade Fiction","review":"There's not a lot I can tell you about this book that hasn't already been said. Francis O'Roark Dowell does a fantastic job building the character of Dovey Doe. Right from the first sentence the reader gets to know Dovey personally. Although we don't find out until the end how Parnell actually dies, we know, without a doubt that tough and sweet Dovey Coe could not have done it. No matter how bad it looks, we, the reader, have faith in her and cheer for her until the end. This is a great read from a great author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book","review":"This book Dovey Coe by Frances O'Roark Dowell was awesome.The book is suspenseful and mystery.The charcters are hilarious,wise,and sweet.The setting is in the south so the author gives good details and uses imagery to describe the setting. The author's style of writing and tone lets you know Dovey lives in the south. The style of writing also lets you know that Dovey isn't afraid to speak her mind. You can tell she hates Parnell and isn't afraid to say it to his face. This book won the Edgar Allen Poe Award."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dovey Coe is no Scout","review":"I found this book oddly flat and was disappointed by the ending, which I found hard to believe and to a certain extent, ridiculous. While this has its strong points, particularly the writing and in the development of characters, I felt the story needed more substance. To compare it (on the flaps!) to TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is a shame. There are far better books available for young readers than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Innocent","review":"Dovey Coe speaks her mind. She'll tell you how she feels without thinking twice on the matter. She made it clear on many occasions how she felt about Parnell Caraway. I highly recommend this book for many reasons. I could not put Dovey Coe down; I did not know what Dovey would say next or what was coming. There were many surprises in this story that kept me on the edge of my seat; such as when Paris Caraway surprises Dovey at her house with the news of her \`lost dog'. I would love to read another of this author's books because her style of writing is excellent. I think that this book is a great read for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Middle Passage","review":"Received in a timely manner and in good condition.

I called motorola, and that stated because the phones were out of warranty there was nothing they could do. They told me to clean the key pad, and/or buy new batteries to fix the problem...which is not the problem.Oh well, some companies still stand behind their products, motorola apparently isn't one of them.I've been through so many different phones the past few years, and all have ended up malfunctioning in one way or the other.

I explained how these reviews said Motorola would replace the defective handsets. After talking to a customer service representative and a supervisor I was told they no longer will replace the defective handsets and there was nothing they could do.

Trisha thinks it has something to do with her vision of a doomed senior class. Josie blames it on the doom spell she cast. Twins Deidre and Dana Palmer don't know what to think. Most of the students think it's Clark Dickson - AKA Count Clarkula - that's killing all those people; he acts and dresses like a vampire, after all. Maybe he really is one. Then there's the two new students: Jon, who Deirdre just started dating, and his creepy, accident-prone ex-girlfriend Anita. Can Deirdre and Dana find out who the real killer is before they become the next victims? This was basically the whole premise for this book. It wasn't a bad one for a horror story.

It really bothers me because Stine can usually write such good murder scenes, and now he kills people by making them hit their heads on gravestones or falling of cliffs? Come on.

True, the 16mm of the original might not have been the most professional stock, but a decent transfer would have avoided the telltail righmost outlines of a cheap \\"sharpening\\" filter.Unless you really need to see poorly transferred pictures of a couple of naked actors, you can do much better than this film. \\"Hard\\" is another indie filmed about the same time as this movie.

After all, it was recommended by a questionable male source. What I got was a great little independent horror flick. The writing was first rate as was the acting. The special effects were also surprisingly good considering the budget although the scene at the end (Ginger completely transformed) could have used a bit more work. The sardonic humor and the mocking stereotypes were very amusing. Almost every line contained a gem - a really good script. Mimi Rogers as the mother was a hoot and the rest of the cast, consisting of the two sisters, father and school chums - not to mention the local drug dealer , were brillant. The plot is the usual of this genre - the horrors of puberty - but it unfolds in quite an ingenius way. No here real flaws here.

So if you're a huge fan of the first movie, I will ammend this review later.But I did want to encourage anyone who does like this movie to seek out the sequels. The writing is better and the production values are as well, particularly in the third film (THE BEGINNING) set back in the American Frontier days.I wonder if this was like the Mad Max series: the original MAD MAX was a cheap drive-in movie that they could afford to make at the time. When it made money in America, they went on to produce THE ROAD WARRIOR (or MAD MAX 2, its international title), a bigger movie that played everywhere outside the drive-in."},{"rating":"1","title":"About as bad as I thought it was going to be.","review":"Really this movie wasn't real bad, but it was your typical \\"new\\" horror movie. It thought that it was definitely made in the same fashion as some of the other teeny horror movies like Scream, I Know What You Did, etc... which I am not a real big fan of. Also it was a little too serious for me. It had pretty good acting and special effects, but that is where it stops. Any parent that is as stupid as those portrayed in this film should be taken out behind the woodshed. All in all I think that I was generous giving this movie two stars. Something about it just didn't sit well with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool movie, great stars","review":"Ginger Snaps, in and of itself, is a decent, but not great, horror movie. What makes it stand out is two things: first, the way it tried to tie something as horrific as becoming a werewolf into something as human as a girl growing into a woman. It may seem like a rather obvious comparison, but it's done in a tongue-in-cheek way that makes the movie entertaining. Where the movie really shines is with it's two leads. Emily Perkins and Katharine Isabelle are two actresses that are far more talented than either has ever gotten real credit for. Emily is great as the awkward younger sister who has to take matters into her own hands, and Katharine shines as the older, tougher sister that the movie essentially revolves around. If you can watch this and figure out how Katharine Isabelle never became a huge star please explain it to me? She's hot as HELL, and a really talented girl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Gothic horror movie","review":"The sisters are very interesting. Preoccupied by their own mortality.

Well, Ginger Snaps has an interesting plotline, terrific acting from all cast, particularly from Emily Perkins and Katharine Isabelle, and some creepy wolf effects. Now, I have seen a few werewolf movies in my time, most with better effects, but it wasnt the werewolves that attracted me to this movie. What attracted me to it was the characters - Ginger and Bridgette were brilliant characters, very well written and well played! It was their relationship, not the horror, that makes this film shine to me.Also, being a teen, I kinda get what they are going through (even though I'm not a teen girl and not a werewolf!), with the whole growing-up thing, relationships, etc. I find this a very interesting angle in the film.Overall, a must-see movie for all audiences. Cant wait for the sequels! Bring on Unleashed!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It was... Awsome!","review":"It had a great original story.It was totally twisted flik like all horrors should be.

More than likely I will end up buying this movie & adding it to my collection of horror movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suprise...it's good","review":"Not your typical modern horror film. The producers and writers actually spent time trying to tell a story rather than to dazzle us with cgi werewolf transformations. The two female leads are quite compelling and you'll definitely stay with it till the end. This first entry is the best in the series which slowly deteriorates during Part 2 and Part 3. You should definitely see Part 1 and then move at your own risk to the sequels. However, you might be pleasantly surprised if you don't get your hopes up too high."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic werewolf film!","review":"I don't know how they did this. Ginger Snaps is a very atypical werewolf film... and it's low-budget to boot. Yet the film makers managed to produce a quirky, scary, funny, clever, original, and engrossing flick which uses werewolfism as a metaphor for puberty! (Or is that the other way around...?)Ginger Snaps is not for everyone. You need to have a taste for horror movies, and strange ones at that. But for a select few, this movie surges head-and-shoulders over almost any other werewolf film out there. (A tip on buying the DVD, however: the American version of the DVD is simply terrible. Go to Amazon.com Canada in order to get the wonderfully well-done Canadian version of this fantastic movie's DVD incarnation.)And do you know what makes this diamond-in-the-rough still more remarkable...? Its sequel, Ginger Snaps 2: Unleashed, is even better than the first!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A failure of nerve","review":"Things start off promisingly enough: arch dialogue, amusing characters, deadpan visual humor, and an appropriate ironic distance from the main premise. That's the first half. After than, John Fawcett lost his nerve, and the film turns into a tensionless and conventional B horror flick. We kept watching in the hope that Fawcett would recover his sense of humor or his off-kilter sensibility, but no such luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Werewolf Movie!","review":"I really enjoyed this movie considering it has limited special effects. The bantering dialog and character development really go a long way in making this movie a better horror movie. I couldn't imagine what it could have been if they had a big special effects budget. It is definitely worth owning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good snap! (For a bad horror movie)","review":"Ginger snaps it's a teen/horror film.But what it was sorprising about it, is the human history that hides.About two troubled sisters, that fight and love each other to death(Literally).I was hoping to see a lot of blood and violence, hoping Ginger to really snap.But it never happened.But the good actings and that human thing made it a really cool way to spend time.It's not worth buying it, but it did the rental(Don't really know).It depends in the mod you're.Do not expect to see like 100 teen girls murdered and without heads, no.You'll only see 2 or 3 deads.That's why Ginger Snaps it's good for the kind of movie it is, but bad for being such a not original and boring movie.The end had almoust no action, and the scares(...) where were them?.Ginger should have stayed at home.FINAL GRADE: C-(5)"},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT BAD!","review":"Of the two versions of IOLANTHE available this is bar far the best. The purists will certainly balk at some of the tampering, but ever since the Joseph Papp Broadway version of THE PIRATES OF PENZANCE nobody seems to be able to leave the G&S works alone!

You will waste time and money and get nowhere. Really a zero star book. Abacus publishers should be ashamed. They don't even publish corrections on their web site."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible book","review":"I have to agree with the rest of the reviews. The circuits may be simple but the code for talking to them is written in VB 4.0. The problem with this is that it makes it very difficult to talk to the serial and parallel ports because they included two dll's (which contain all the manditory code to talk to the ports) when they should have just included the code for them inside the main module of the program (at least then we may have been able to see how in the heck the programs talk to the ports.) Windows 95 and above versions talk differently to the serial and parallel ports than what the software included with the projects does. You may build some neat circuits, but don't expect to be able to control them from the included software. I have had to rewrite each and every individual program in Visual C++. I am a computer science major and this was even difficult for me. I don't recommend this book at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this book, ever","review":"The programs do not work! There is very little explanation of the code so it can't be debugged nor is it adequately documented. It seems to be someone's pet project that he typed up. Oh yes, tech support at the publisher, Abacus, is pathetic! Be warned"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO. NOT. BUY. THIS. TRASH.","review":"This is the sorriest excuse for a book I have ever read. I actually became MAD at it while reading it. The author goes into NO depth at all, explains nothing, and to top it all off, uses visual friggin basic to write the programs. I, being a sane person, do not have visual basic. This means I cannot edit the source code. I cannot emphasize it strongly enough: do not buy this piece of trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book looked promising but it ultimately disappointed","review":"The most frustrating thing about this book is that it does not explain anything about how the circuits work. This makes it almost impossible to fix the errors in the circuits as shown (yes, there are errors). Also, some of his choices for components are dubious, like the 25-pin serial port connectors (why not use a 9 pin?) and the flat (ribbon) Centronics printer cable with 36-pin connector.I also agree with most of the complaints in the other reviews.This book could have been so much better if only the workings of the circuits were described (e.g., why a certain resistor value was chosen, why one circuit needs external power and one doesn't, etc.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"One would read this book expecting to learn how to interface electronic systems with a pc, but this book leaves you learning nothing. The book gives you sample circuits you can build but can't seem to explain why or how any of them work. Nor can it furnish a schematic.

You can't judge a book by its cover because this books cover is glossy and colorful and expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"The software for most of the projects will not run at first try and you have to have Visual Basic to try to fix it. So, it is not for beginners even though the circuits are simple. The program for one project I attempted managed to show a control window, but it didn't work beyond that. There are errors in the book as well and the most important circuit components, such as sensors, are not described well enough to know what to purchase. Although the circuits could be useful, there are no complete diagrams suitable for testing on a breadboard. The author is also unfamiliar with the American market.

The film of the same name inspired me to read this book, and I'm glad I did. PD James' prose is muscular, yet beautiful. Her understanding of the nuances of human character transcend this story beyond its dark, dystopian premise: in the future, the human race has lost its ability to reproduce. With the end of the species in sight, humankind becomes depraved, depressed, and lost.PD James explores how some people confront this dismal future with lust for power, and others with unfailing hope. She touches on topics which are germane today: treatment of immigrants and the aged; violence in the face of despair, etc.The story and the movie are rather divergent at points, but that doesn't stop me from enjoying either one of them for what they are. I would absolutely recommend this book for both the fearful vision of the future PD James conjures and for her relentless, confident prose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, dull, and dull - what a disappointment!","review":"I was very surprised to find that I disliked this book so intensely, because I'm a huge fan of Lady James' Adam Dalgliesh mystery series.

I'm looking forward to my next Dalgliesh novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"After I saw the movie I was really looking forward to reading this. I was sorely disappointed.

I would have applied this rule to P.D. James's \\"The Children of Men\\", if not for the fact that I started reading the book after having seen the superb movie on which the book is based.

The edition I read had a review on the back \\"A most tender love story\\" Where? Characters did not come over well especially towards the end of the book. It did seem good at the beginning as far as the ideas of a story go, but it feels as though the author is fast running out of both ideas and interest by the end.

The characters are shallow, cliched, and very poorly developed. To make matters worse, the main character experiences a significant change in his fundamental personality that is completely unbelievable. And the final scene of the book is so cloying that it makes me shudder to remember it. If the premise hadn't been so intriguing, I would have only given this book one star.This is the only time I've ever been able to say that the movie far far surpassed the book. The movie differs significantly from the book, basically abandoning everything except the main plot line.

Aldiss's great novel Greybeard, published in the sixties, uses the same themes as James (i.e. no children are being born on the planet) but is original and funny, elegaic and sad. Yet Aldiss's novel is sidelined as science fiction and James's book, which uses very tired and unoriginal sf tropes, is described by its fans as 'too real to be sf'. This is nonsense.If you really want to see this theme explored with originality by a fine writer, go to the Aldiss. This is one of the best examples I know of a bad book by an establishment writer being admired by people with no knowledge of fine literary sf and believing that it 'can't be sf because it's too real'. If you want literature which deals with realities try some Aldiss, Ballard, M. J. Harrison, China Mieville, Thomas M. Disch, John Sladek and a dozen others.

James delivers a fascinating premise -- a near future in which the human race has become infertile and is going extinct. And she goes nowhere with it. It would be nice to see her go in a standard Science Fiction direction, exploring the psychological, sociological, and political implications of this change. (And she does some of this, and does it well. But it's not nearly enough.) If she didn't like the standard route, she could have used the premise as a backdrop for exploring character. She doesn't. I barely remember who the characters were or why they did what they did. Add to all this a trite and abrupt ending.

His undistinguishable style would be palatable if that was as bad as it got. Unfortunatley for the riveting plotline, the words that carry it often resemble a sloppy mire.

I even believe I am a genuine reader, since I never skip pages or read the final pages before I really get there. The world described is thourough but some things are to easily stepped over (how can somebody in an dying civilisation go on holidays in Europe for several months when maintenance is restricted to roads only). And the few events in the books are rare and hard to find. I tried to finish this book two times, 3 years ago and just last week. Last week I threw it away, the book is really BORING, there is no way PD James makes me turn a page, I forced myself wondering 'when will it really get started'. At 2/3rd I put it away -- again. This time I put it in my dustbin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed it, but not exactly an upbeat reading experience.","review":"Overall, I enjoyed the book and recommend it. I suspect it will be (surprise, surprise) much better than the movie. But, be prepared for a VERY somber reading experience. Not exactly escapist literature. I think there are some holes in character development and the ending is a bit abrupt. I'm still trying to decide if the ending follows logically from the rest of the story. However, I can say that reading it was NOT time wasted!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing execution of an interesting concept","review":"P.D. James disappoints in her book in the bitterest of ways - by poorly executing what is a tantalizing idea.Working backward from a concept to a (loose) plot, this novel seems stilted and forced throughout.The climax - wink, wink - leaves one giggling from unsuspended disbelief of circumstances, plot, andcharacters. What should have been an interesting exploration of the meaning of reporduction to a societythat takes it for granted (or, some may argue, disdains it) turns in to a brainy romance novel without the sex"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, but sometimes dull","review":"I thought the movie Children of Men was interesting so I picked up the book which, like the movie, describes a world moving into apocalypse due to 25 years of the inability to procreate. Many descriptions of events in the book are vivid and full of detail, yet many of them do not relate to the overall theme or later events in the book which left me wondering why they were included at all? The beginning and ending of the book are very interesting but the middle did bore me. The book and movie both have good qualities but I think the movie would have been better if it had stayed true to the book. They had an opportunity to fix the books pacing issue but, instead, they omitted scenes from the book that I thought were critical and introduced additional social issue story lines that had little or no purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book different from movie but STAND ALONE GOOD","review":"The movie was LOOSELY based on the book. I saw the movie first and loved it. Then decided to read the book and, on its own, also loved the book. I felt the movie had more of a current vibe to it, addressing more directly many issues and fears we have today, which the book didn't really point to as clearly. I say SEE THE MOVIE AND READ THE BOOK. Both are highly worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"I have to admit, I'd never heard of this book before the Clive Owen movie was made. I saw one trailer and decided I wanted to read the book before I saw the movie.

First 60% of the book was interesting enough - the main character was not to be liked, but made you want to read to find out what would happen. Then it seemed as though the author was rushing to fit this story into a quick finish. The academic seemed to lose his intelligence, the scenery and weather was described better than the relationships were built. Not a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Children of Men","review":"The premise was great, no new babies being born, the people of Earth now sterile, but it took a wrong turn. Another reviewer said it best about the ending, she wrote herself into a corner. I kept thinking about what would happen if no babies were born, how people would carry on, where all the people left would go etc. It could have great if she had developed that aspect, rather than the 5 dissidents angle. I'll try PD James again. This was a quick read, 3 days. Next up is The Pillars of the Earth, hearing great things about that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Off the mark","review":"This book does not explain religion in ancient Egypt, admittedly a very complex topic.Alison interpretes Egyptian myths in a literal fashion,pertaining to the pharaohs and their families or to cycles of nature.But,the key to Egyptian religion is that Horus is the divine soul in humans, and the various myths refer to \\"his\\" life cycle.All that happens in the myths refers to the spiritual development of human beings.This book shows no understanding of this meaning.Writers such as Gerald Massey, Alvin Kuhn and R.Schwaller de Lubicz give the best understanding of ancient Egyptian religion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Results","review":"Granted that this item is only four dollars. Thus, I should not have expected much. Each morning I would clip this to my belt to hold my keys. In the evening, I unclipped it. That is the expected usage of this product. It seemed to be just what I needed. But, after about 60 days, the leather clip broke at the place where it bends 180 degrees. The company said that if I sent the product back, they would replace it. But why pay a dollar or so to mail back a four dollar product. I will find another belt clip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turned Out to be a Bad Idea","review":"I purchased 3 of these bottles two separate times (for a total of six). I raise feeder rats and I have 20+ water bottles of this size, different types. Within the first week of using these water bottles, the rats had chewed through the bottles (the bottles sit on top of wire mesh with tube through the wire). I have not lost a single bottle prior to this from chewing. I am wondering if there is some odor, or something about these bottles that tempt the rats to chew on them. Actually, positioned the way that they are in the cages, they REALLY have to work to get to them to chew on. Although the price is good, these items were not a good bargain for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work in most dangerous way possible","review":"We bought these and set them up on two of our mouse cages. When we noticed all of our boy mice were acting up in their cage with the water bottle, we realized something was up. We checked the other cage with our runt mouse and found it curled up in a ball on the brink of dieing of dehydration. We managed to save it... I hope, it is currently in critical condition... but if we'd been so much as an hour later she would have died horribly.I cannot emphasize this enough: DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!

They are a little creepy without being menacing. They became for me the archetypical images for each of those types of characters (ghosts, jack-o-lantern, witch, and skeleton). Even the simplicity and texture of the background painting heightens the spookiness. To me \\"One Dark Night\\" and \\"It's the Great Pumpkin Charlie Brown\\" perfectly capture the spirit of the Halloween of my youth.I found a copy several years ago on Amazon in reasonably good shape. I have read it to all of my children (I have 5), and they all love it - boys and girls.I recommend it to all parents with young children who love Halloween."},{"rating":"1","title":"At Least It's Albert King","review":"I bought this DVD because I love Albert King. Otherwise I would give it 3 stars. It's short - about 1 hour - and he's only playing for about 40 minutes. I don't know why the band does a long version of Summertime without him at all. And the interviews, while good, make the DVD a little disjointed. But when you consider the rarity of King's videos, and who is playing, it's still worth buying if you are into the blues. The guy is as good a blue guitarist as anyone, ever. I have already watched it about four times since I got it ten days ago! I only hope there's more footage of him somewhere so more DVD's, preferably longer, can be produced. THIS IS BLUES POWER!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very underrated!","review":"Amazing performance, as always, from the King, Albert. The the sound of the music is excellent and the image is very clear.

It is a brilliant retelling of Oscar's life through pictures. Filled with everything from photographs of Wilde the aesthete to hilarious caricatures of him from Punch magazine to some of Wilde's own drawings and notes, this fabulous little book has it all. Many of the items I have not seen in any other volume. It goes wonderfully well coupled with Richard Ellman's gorgeous biography or it stands tall on its own. All and all, a marvelous book that I cannot possibly recommend highly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oscar in photo and drawing","review":"It is unfortunate that this unique collection of photos and drawings of Oscar Wilde is so small, thus causing many of the illustrations to be almost absurdly small. It is impossible, especially in looking at the Sarony photos, to avoid the impression of Oscar as being self-absorbed and essentially marketing himself as a \\"product.\\" Rather than being a coffee-table book, this is a tea-tray book."},{"rating":"2","title":"From the cover:","review":"From the book:In every respect, the intercultural Bible reading project documented in this volume is a major and praiseworthy achievement. It takes various critical, ecclesial, and theological developments a significant step forward: reader response criticism, with its concern for real readers and their reading sites; basic communities, with their focus on community pairings and sustained interchange; and global Christianity, with its emphasis on intercultural exchange and a worldwide network of readers and groups. All of this by way of a focused discussion on a coordinating text-the encounter of Jesus and the Samaritan woman in John 4. This book presents a path-breaking model for future research and reading in intercultural criticism. --Fernando F. Segovia"},{"rating":"2","title":"Monster Machines","review":"I love this. I first saw it as a music video by the band Front Line Assembly, called Mindphaser. I was curious what that movie was about, finally tracked it down and got it. Basically, I would recoomend it to someone interested in mecha style films, giant monster films, and Japanese films. While not in the category of such newer films by studios like Tokyo Shock, it is very good, and draws you in. It reminds me of a dystopic sci-fi film from the 80's called Savannah Electric:Monochrome Dystopia, but far more commercial and palatable to general sci-fi audiences. Fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one was fumbled","review":"Fun, overblown production design and Toho's usual level of 'special' effects should be a lot more entertaining than this.The story is simple and goofy. Some future pirates that you have to see to believe want to steal salvage (and the newly discovered element... Texmexium!) from a forbidden island with an evil computer mastermind. Lots of running, shooting, broken steam pipes and a robot brawl. Sounds like fun to me!Unfortunately it's all poorly directed and confusingly edited. It was bad enough for the director to have his name removed (from the US version at least) and substitute that old standby: Alan Smithee.

I love Japanese SciFi and I'll sit through just about anything, but this one had me looking at my watch more than a few times to see if I was coming to the end or not.

The pad slides around when you play on it, and one of the buttons stopped working about 8 days after I bought it. I thought I'd pick up a cheap one since I needed an extra pad when friends came over.Do yourself a favor and head over to RedOctane.com for some quality pads. I have their Ignition pad, which is way better than this type of cheap pad because it has a cushioned insert which slips into the middle and keeps the pad from sliding around and is easier on your feet. Another friend has the regular redoctane pad with pad cover and it works great, too. Overall, don't buy the Intec pad unless you know you won't be playing DDR for very long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soft pads are for little kids and novices","review":"If you have any aspirations of actually becoming a decent Dance Dance Revolution player and moving up to the more challenging and satisfying songs, do not buy this pad -- or any soft pad, for that matter.Soft pads slide on the floor. They crumple and wrinkle up. They miss steps and fail to register sometimes. The surface feels the same all over, making it impossible to tell where your feet are without looking down.More advanced soft pads are available, which are thicker, but they still slide and have sensitivity problems.The only way to properly enjoy DDR at home is to purchase a metal pad. Just look up \\"metal DDR pad\\" on an internet auction site. Yes, they are expensive, but they'll also last for a very, very long time and put up with a lot of abuse. They also won't slide, will be extremely sensitive, and you can tell where your feet are without looking down. If you want the arcade experience at home, a metal pad is the only way to get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"non-official dance pad provides bad playability","review":"non-offical. that word alone should prevent you from buying this piece of crud. If you were to buy any dance pad for DDR, your best choice would be to go with Red Octane, since Konami aproved it to be the best 3rd party support pad and stoped creating their own pads because Red Octane was so good. However, Red Octane is a little pricy, so the reason this pad gets 2 stars instead of one is because the cheapness allows you to buy 4 of these for the price of one red octane. don't expect this to last you a month though, and the fact that this pad doesnt even LOOK like a DDR pad makes it even worse. its confusing, and ugly.

About a year ago my friends and I had a party, and we played ddr. As soon as i started, i was obsessed! About 2 weeks later, since I already had a Playstation2, I decided that DDR would be a great thing to buy. I went and bought DDR and needed to get a mat. I got this mat because it was cheap. Unfortuneately, this pad only lasted 3 weeks. It was in perfect condition for only a week. Soon after that, the mat was so slippery when I would press the down button, it would slide so far, that the wire would unplug out of the PS2. LAter, the rubber on the wire started to peel off.It would start registering buttons when I was off the mat! IF you want to buy this mat, it will last only a week."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's ok","review":"This dance pad is bad yet good. For starters it is dangerous when ur on it but some it isn't. the BIGGEST PROBLEM is that it breaks easily, I had it for like wat 2 weeks then the right arrow stoped working.

The down arrow is getting screwed up too. It slipps all over the room while I am playing it and it messes up my game. :PThis mat works as good as any other mat until you've had it for a while. I've had a lot of fun on this mat and eventually, I knew it was going to break but I didn't expect it to break so soon. It's been half a year and I've never played it agian.

If you play on wood or tile this mat is sufficent you will still have movement but much less then if played on carpet. Lighter people also have less momevent on the mat. It can sometimes rotate a good 20 to 30 degress per song or litterally move up and down. However it is very responcive and overall a good mat.

We started with the cheap plastic foldup style pads like this, but we quickly got frustrated with them. Even the pads that are advertised as 'non-slip' tend to slide around the floor like crazy when you're dancing. This is not only annoying, it screws up your foot placement. We also tried a hard plastic version but those were really loud, hard to use, and hurt your feet after only a few minutes of dancing. We finally settled on a version that has a three-inch thick foam core that zips into the casing that houses the sensors. They don't slide around the floor, the sensors are perfectly placed and sensitive enough to register the slightest foot tap, and the foam cushions your feet. I don't know where my husband got them, but they were like $40, and totally worth it if you're going to be doing much dancing at all.

It doesn't look like the official or even most clone pads, but that didn't bother me. What did bother me was how slippery the top and bottom of the pad was. As soon as I started \\"Dam Dariram\\" on Trick, my feet when flying from under me. This is one of the most DANGEROUS pads on the market.
