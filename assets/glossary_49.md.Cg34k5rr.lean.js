Didn't have a scoop that I have found yet, but that is the little things that really do not matter. My landlady has borrowed some and is now ready to order her own; she is the one who insisted on stevia in lieu of Sucralose being healthier and most natural, that is how I found NOW Protein powder.

I recommend Syntha-6, that stuff is delicious.

The only minor complaints I would have with it are: 1. It doesn't taste very good, though I expected that since it is \\"unflavored\\". 2. I didn't come with any form of scooper.

And the \\"Coed\\" song is hysterical. The title track is actually probably the weakest of the bunch. But still, it's a great album - it's just that she has so many great tracks and albums that my standards for Dar are perhaps too high! If you don't already own most of her other albums, I'd recommend either the new \\"Beauty of the Rain\\" or \\"End of Summer\\" first. But if you have some of her other stuff, and especially if you like her more beautiful, haunting ballads, go for \\"Mortal City\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love Dar , you'll love....","review":"I STRONGLY recommend this CD! Dar is the greatest- her songs tell amazing stories. \\"As Cool AS I Am\\" always picks me up and \\"The Blessings\\" always calms me down. I love every single song on Mortal City. If you love Dar, also check out The Nields and Ani Difranco!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, Amazing, One of my favorites","review":"Reading through all of the reviews, maybe people said \\"I was loaned this album by a friend.\\" I suppose that's how you have to hear about Dar, since they don't play her on any radio station I've ever listened too. A dear friend of mine told me I had to listen to the lyrics to February. He was in the midst of divorce, and we sat together and listened to this song and cried on each others shoulders for love that slowly dies. Some songs tragic and touching, some light and whimsical. My roommates are ready to kill me for listening to nothing but Dar Williams. She's wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Albums I've ever heard","review":"I had no idea who Dar Williams was when I was given a copy of Mortal City by my then girlfriend. She thought I'd like it as I am often times drawn to guitar based folk. I listened once and that's all it took. This is one of the best CDs in my collection. Ms. Williams has a spectacular voice that shines throughout the album and make sometimes uneven lyrics fall right into place. I have no particular favorites. Different moods draw me to different songs. There are no slouches on this CD. Anyone who appreciate poignant and powerful folk on the lines of Suzanne Vega, and Luka Bloom should definately purchase Mortal City."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Christians and The Pagans is superb\\"","review":"This CD is a fine blend of nice vocals and fine insturmental work. \\"The Christians and The Pagans\\" is my favorite holiday song about tolerance and healing and restoring family ties."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite album of all time!","review":"I often tell my husband that if I ended up stranded on a deserted island with only one CD, this would be my choice.

At first I listened mostly to that one song, but that summer I went to Prince Edward Island in Canada with my parents and this album was in my Walkman as we drove through New Brunswick and onto the island. As we crossed the Confederation Bridge, \\"The Ocean\\" came on. After that I listened to the album several times while driving all over the island. To this day I associate \\"Mortal City\\" with PEI. Dar's gentle, witty, and beautiful music and lyrics were the perfect complement to the quiet, gentle beauty of the island. This album has been a friend and companion ever since, and I have also bought the rest of her albums. This one remains my favorite, however."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I can stop one person from ordering this...","review":"My time will be worthwhile.I bought this cd because it came up in my Amazon.com recommendations. I am a fan of Ani DiFranco, and I think that these two artists must exist in a \\"recommend each other\\" loop for Amazon.com. I listened to the clips available online, and thought her voice was quite enjoyable.I'm sorry, though...I suppose these lyrics are supposed to be whimsical, or eclectic or lightly-biting commentary. I call them insipid. Irritating. Downright obnoxious at times. I mean, c'mon...'Now when the Christians sit with the pagans, the only thing burning is pumpkin pie??' (Don't write to me and tell me I got the lyrics wrong, I couldn't bear to listen to it again to get them just right.)Honestly, I am not usually this cranky about music.

So, if you are hesitating...I suggest you borrow a friend's copy before you invest in the cd and shipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dar is my hero","review":"This CD jump started me into the world of Dar's beautiful lyrics, heartfelt singing, and just all around wonderful songs. I am a huge fan of Dar Williams. There is no other person in music that moves me as much as she does. Iowa and As Cool As I Am are simply classics, but other songs have a witty, yet moving lyrical content. One of my personal favorites is The Pointless, Yet Poignent Crisis of A Co-Ed. I urge you not to stop here though. The Honesty Room and The Green World deserve just as much attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good singing voice better songwriter","review":"I discovered Dar Williams on a folk station on launchcast that I selected by accident. \\"The Christians and the Pagans,\\" happened to be the first song to come on and I have been hooked ever since. Her voice is great, but what really drew me was her songwriting. Even songs like Christians and Pagans, which would seem to be just a fun song on the outside, has sly drop-ins like references to candy canes made with red dye #3!The whole disc is really solid but other than the aforementioned \\"The Christians and the Pagans,\\" my favorite song on the disc is \\"February.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Didn't work out of the box, despite change of batteries, this remained the case.

I use a C-8080 on land or, while sea kayaking, a C-5000 in a dive-housing, both take the 1GB card. I used to walk around with spare cards, just like spare rolls of film in the old days. Now, unless I'm on an extended backcountry trip, even shooting RAW or TIFF, the 1GB card usually has enough storage to hold me over until I can download to my computer. The read/write and download time may be a little slow for some, but my *instant gratification* meter isn't as caffienated as some folks - that's why I give it 4 instead of 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works better than advertised","review":"I was concerned that the Type M cards wouldn't work with my FujiFilm FinePix S5100, but I was surprised to find that this Olympus 1 GB Type M worked even while filming videos in 320x240 and 640x480 resolution.

Beware, as always with natural products this one would wear off faster than artificial bags.If you like things made of kevlar or bullet-proof plastics and wonder why you get sick some decades later, this is not for you.This one is real cow leather and won't last forever but for 70 bucks I will run and happily buy new several years from now (previous one actually lasted 4 years, also natural bull leather).So 5 stars for this item for its price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weekend Travel Bag","review":"Exactly what I wanted.

I found what essays I read to be overly introverted and psychological in tone. None seemed to deal with actual travel activities -- what the women saw, how they experienced a different culture, etc.Not that the writing itself is particularly bad; rather, I got the sense that the foreign country was mere background for the writer's angst. A closer look at the subtitle of the book corroborates my assertion: \\"writing by American women abroad\\". So, sit in France and write about your loneliness or personal obsessions -- and then it can be included in a so-called travelogue like this one.If you're hankering for the road, you'd be better off reading Marybeth Bond's \\"Traveler's Tales: A Woman's World\\".

The biggest drawback is that the app is no longer supported and, thus, in an upgrade limbo. Had I known that when I ordered it, I would have looked for another piece of software. As it turns out, there are very similar (almost identical) apps available at a much lower cost, such as Graphics Design Studio. That program will do everything LineForm does (without crashing, and at a price of $4.99 (at Apple's Apps Store) as opposed to what I paid for LineForm at Amazon: $72.99!."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buggy PoS","review":"Looks like this used to be a really good piece of software, but the current version is a PoS.

It is a funny book. That is enough to recommend it as a read. But it also shows insights into the lives and personalities of some of the most powerful people in the country and the people who work around them.Mark gives you a good story of a class clown who managed to make that a career whilst throwing a lot of behind the scenes action in.My husband and I, both with very different political views, read it at the same time, using two bookmarks. We both loved it.PJ"},{"rating":"2","title":"Most nformative and funny look into the West Wing","review":"Clinton & Me gives a totally different view of politics.Really funny but very informative about how humor can change the perception of the public views of any situation.

Well, this definitely falls into the category of \\"I don't believe what I read.\\" When it comes down to it, the book is about promoting Mark Katz -- and nothing else -- which is precisely what Katz has been doing for years and years.

It's the jokes, stupid."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Clinton and Me\\"","review":"In \\"Clinton and Me,\\" Mark Katz effectively and amusingly captures his days in, around, and near presidential politics. The book is no blind homage to Clinton, Gore, Albright, and the rest, but a clever, slightly removed, insider's view of days we have almost forgotten.

But with good reason.Season 4 of the Simpsons is the best of their long career - bar none. Where some seasons have good and bad episodes, this one has all GREAT ones.The creators and writers all hit their stride during this season. Stand-outs are \\"Last Exit to Springfield\\", \\"A Streetcar Name Marge\\", \\"Mr. Plow\\" and my favorite \\"I Love Lisa\\".If you get no other seasons worth of Simpsons, this is the one to splurge for!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll Be Dead Before They Are All Released","review":"I am only 44 but at the rate they are going I will probably be dead before I get to see them all uncut again and in DVD glory. Earlier someone said maybe it had to do with the syndication deal. I have also thought that as I noticed before Season 3 was released a lot of those epiodes were run and repeated almost every other day in the Chicago market. It got to the point that my kids and I stopped watching and would watch one from the first 2 seasons on DVD. I suggest we all start writing Fox and at least try to find out what is going on. If they all came out tomorrow is there anyone here who would not buy them immediately? As for the quality of the episodes overall i would like to use an old quote applied to many subjects.\\"There is good Simpsons and there is great Simpsons but there are no bad Simpsons\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"A great season and they finally added the option to watch all the episodes non stop... one after the other without having to go through the menu!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of the best ever.","review":"It took three seasons before the Simpsons reached their peak, but this fourth season make it worth the wait. Wheras Bart and Homer were the main characters in the first three seasons, in these 22 episodes, everyone becomes a full-fledged main character. Marge has a few episodes, Lisa gets some as well, Patty and Selma aren't forgotten, and even Maggie gets in on the action. The episodes contained in this set represent the beginning of The Simpsons as the funniest show on television, with virtually no problems.The DVD set is quite good as well - the commentaries on all the episodes are entertaining (particulary the ones with Conan O' Brian), and the deleted scenes and animation features are a treat for fans. Well worth the 30-plus dollars it costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yet another great season","review":"Season 4 in yet another great season of the simpsons it also has 1 of the best halloween episodes in Treehouse Of Horror III there are some greats stories the 1 with the killer krusty doll has to be the best in which homer gets bart a krusty doll from a gypsie and it ends up trying to kill him in another 1 bart revives some zombies and they go on killing spree around springfield in which you see 1 of the best jokes ever where they go up to homer and knock on his head looking for brains but it turns out he has no brain"},{"rating":"1","title":"This set has been censored! Don't buy it!","review":"I have only gone through a few episodes and I have already spotted a cut. The episode \\"marge gets a job\\" originally had a line about bart faking a sickness to avoid a test with a unfortunate bout of tourette's syndrome and this has been redubbed to a unfortunate bout of rabies. I guess they are going to redub the whole series. The producer must have been born without a spine. I'll pass on future sets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well and truly hits it stride in season 4","review":"The Simpsons, around this time, achieves the perfect balance between the emotional resonance and protracted narratives of the early seasons, and the chaotic pop-culture affected madness of the later seasons.It's this nice balance that makes this fourth season such a strong one. A good example is the 'Mr Plow' episode, with Linda Ronstadt singing the 'Plow King' song in Spanish while minutes later Homer and Barney re-unite on Widow's Peak.Love this season. But, I think I speak for all Simpsons' fans when I say that any wait exceeding 12 months would be too much.\\"I'll take your money... but I'm not gonna plow your driveway!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"I never knew when I first watched the Simpsons back in 89' I would be so attached to them. I know South Park and Family Guy have come down the road and made people laugh too but the Simpsons have just demoinated the TV Viewing. I bought all the seasons so far and I can't wait until the fifth one comes out. The old ones are histerical and they are really just a pure classic. 14 years on air going on 15 this December. The new season is going to start soon and I'm not going to miss any second of it.

All of the episodes start off with a bang, bringing the usual incisive wit to everyday situations, but some of them occasionally lose their level of humor just a wee bit as the writers become more concerned with resolving the main story line than generating \\"Groeningesque\\" humor, and this problem grows much more in the much later seasons of the show, where crudeness is occasionally substituted for real wit. However, even the worst episode in the season four shows is pretty funny. Standout episodes like Streetcar Named Marge, Mr. Plow, Lisa's First Word, Selma's Choice, Marge Vs. The Monorail and others are shining examples of the show at its best and I'm looking forward to purchasing this set as soon as it is released."},{"rating":"2","title":"Episodes GREAT, DVD format NOT SO GREAT","review":"Do not get me wrong, I am a HUGE Simpsons fan! I have seasons 1 through 9 and I still laugh at the jokes. This season has one of the best lisa episodes in the whole series, \\"I Love Lisa.\\" It also has such classics as the season opening, \\"Kamp Krusty\\" and the season finale, \\"Krusty gets Kancelled.\\" With so many more episodes I can not complain on any level about the storytelling or the acting or the animation.The only problem I have with the dvd is the menu format for the DVD. It certainly seems that the season 4 dvds are the black sheep of all the seasons. The menu set up is not very simpsonesque. This is the only criticism that I have for the dvd. Otherwise, Enjoy the season! oh also, with buying this simpsons dvd, as with any others, listen to the commentaries. It has some great insight for the show's running."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ahh the Glory Days","review":"If you've watched The Simpsons for awhile, (I have seen every single episode) then you have got to love this DVD set. It's filled with 23 episodes of the funniest and quite possibly the greatest show on T.V. It's filled with deleted scenes, picture in picture, storyboards, commentarys from EVERY episode from Conan O Brien!, and much much more!It's been a while, but the wait should definatley be worth it. So if you're a hardcore Simpsons fan, or just a regular viewer, you should really get this DVD because you won't regret it.And I would recommend if you were gonna buy this DVD, that you buy it here at Amazon.

It moves your soul and whiggles your body. Harem III also has a number of excellent entumental tracks but some of the vocal tracks are annoying.

IMHO, one would not be in debt if there was 20% extra to allocate to the paying down of the debt. The division of this amount to the creditors is to be accompanied by a note informing them one will be paying a certain amount which might be more or less what was agreed upon, though regularly.

This is definately not a \\"Bucket List book\\" for the average Joe or the other 95% of the population. I mean even I can feasibly see myself playing St. Andrews and Pebble Beach one day. I can't blame the author though, ask a bunch of prominent people in the golf biz a simple question, get invited to the course, mention a little bit about the person and the course and presto......a book... and free greens fees.

One of the most talented writers in a generation and that's the best you could come up with? It's not only disappointing it's criminal. Using rape as a self-serving tool the sell your books. You destroyed all the other eight along the way. For shame! And really, what's the deal with Althea like the Assassin's Apprentice getting like no reward in the end.

Gag."},{"rating":"2","title":"A conclusion in conflict but a continuation in life","review":"I loved Robin Hobb's writings, though more a fan of the Farseer series then Magic ship traders, I still paid the extra for express delivery. I found the book extremely enjoyable, though as others have mentioned the jumping from character to character is some what fustrating as is the dragon's arrogance and disregard for those she must depend on. AS the ending of Magic Ship Traders I could not ask for more, she concluded the series beautifully, with betrayal, acceptance, love and struggle.But this isn't a conclusion and everyone seemes to have missed a very important character, Amber!

I loved it, i loved how the characters grew up with each pages. Keffria went from a meek woman to a stronger woman. This book made me laugh, yell and mostly made me cry!!! THAT is what a book is supposed to do to you!! I hated winthrow and Kennit with a passion, winthrow for his inability to see the real Kennit; and Kennit for his cruelty against Althea!! (i can't believe he did that and VIVacia did not step up and rejected him!!!!?!). I hated the ending of ALthea....i mean she spent all her time wishing, striving for her dream to come true but she is disapointed over and over... i swear... a little tear came out!!!! i wish there was a sequel to it... . Despite those, i LOVE the book because it made me feel so many emotions and there are not a lot of books capable of doing that. I certainly hope i haven't given much away because it's a certain read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A conclusion that actually concludes.","review":"Ms. Hobb finishes the various story lines in a satisfying way, and resolves the various storylines.

I thought the ending was fantastic, but throughout the first half of the book i only carried on reading because i didn't really want to leave the book half finished. Saying that though the characters are excellent and Even kennit appears to be almost a hero at times! I find it good that more authors are moving away from the completely separate good versus evil, and alot of it becomes a grey area, where even the characters who are meant to be bad do some particularly heroic deeds. And the dragon is wicked, arrogant, and in control, but also very reliant on the ones she controls. Anyway cool book, waiting for another trilogy, although i must say i enjoyed the assassin books more."},{"rating":"2","title":"no complaints here","review":"In simple words ... reading robin hobb is pure entertainment.

I couldn't put it down!","review":"Ms. Hobb has a rare talent for creating characters to real you feel you will run into them someday. Her worlds are so perfectly built that you swear you will see them someday. I have read the complete series and am amazed at how she blended everything together. Ms. Hobb does not give you bits of information to propel the story along, although at the time, they may seem like it. They are actually pieces to a much bigger puzzle that if you stay around for the ride, you will understand in the end. The last 200 pages of this book were difficult to put down. I finished this book while on vacation and looked for reasons to leave my company, just so I could read a couple more pages. It's amazing how you can cook and read at the same time. I was sad to see this series end, but I was satisfied with the turns of each character. If you have never read Ms. Hobb before, find a book immediately. She is one of our generations greatest writers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Last in trilogy = 4 stars instead of 5","review":"Beware SPOILERS..... Liveship Traders is a favored trilogy, yet I was somewhat disappointed with the way it finished out. Giving us very little info on what becomes of Amber, Keffria, Ronica - and not a great deal more info on the rest of the gang. It seemed too tidy that both Kennit and Kyle would meet their ends within the course of a few pages, after reading the previous 2 volumes, an approx. 2400 page trilogy, I had hoped for more, particularly with such a central character as Kennit.All that said, this was a great trilogy altogether, and I plan on reading more Hobb - bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Parts work perfectly!","review":"I really give this item 4.5 stars and rounded it to 5 because it didn't come with instructions (the ad didn't imply that there would be).

And I knew I was in trouble when I had to endure reading a scene between the randy soldier and two slave girls. This novel continued to go downhill from there. If the wooden dialogue and flat storyline were bad enough, the sex scenes were far worse. The aforementioned scenes wouldn't have been out of place in the Penthouse forum. I wonder if Janine Ashbless is really a man using a female pseudonym. I also wonder why Black Lace published this novel. Divine Torment isn't erotic fiction written by and for a woman -- more like erotic fiction written for a women's imprint but targeted toward randy college boys. I cannot fathom the good reviews here, but I guess there's no accounting for taste. You be the judge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete Songs!!!","review":"I've been looking for quite a while for a CD full of classic hymns around amazon. I thought I finally found the set to get in this. Who could resist CD's with Amazing Grace, Blessed Assurance, Rock of Ages, Old Rugged Cross, etc. Too my great disappointment, I don't think any of the hymns come with all the verses. The soprano often takes solos and takes away from the full chordal sound I expect from hymns. They only sing the 1st, 2nd and last verses in Amazing Grace, one of my favorite songs. How can they cut out half the verses of the most popular hymns of all time? If you are looking for a collection of hymns, keep searching, because as far as I'm concerned this contains NONE of my favorites if they only sing 1 to 3 verses per song."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great purchase!","review":"This is possibly one of the best hmyns collections I have ever bought!

The book claims to be a breakthrough program, but it offers very little guidance for alleviating them. The main author, who is a sufferer of night terrors, but not a doctor, goes to great lengths to support his claim that all adult night terrors must be caused by past trauma. It is imperative, he says, that a sufferer recognize that trauma (primarily child abuse) occured and to move on. If the reader doesn't buy into this assertion, then the rest of the book is really not helpful. I was hoping for more on how to alleviate night terrors, but this book came up short, in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"I didn't find this book helpful at all. The author maintains all the way through the book that night terrors are caused by traumatic child abuse and doesnt discuss anything other than this. This is not correct in my case which made the book completely useless. I don't recommend this to anyone. Probably the worst book I have ever purchased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Options other than Napoleon's defeat.","review":"This was a hard book to read. I don't read much alternative history, simply because it is not true. I enjoy the academic debate of what might have happened if things were done differently. In this book, ten distinguished historians change some facts and show how things could have gone differently for Napoleon. Some of them are OK to read. The large majority have changed the scenario so completely that it is simply fiction. That is why I didn't like reading this book. It also may have been the reason for it being on the discount shelf.I am not sure of other alternative history for the Napoleonic era. However, readers could probably pick a better book from the thousands on Napoleon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this toy - will cause vomiting!","review":"My poor year-old terrier tore pieces of this toy apart in a few minutes and ingested a few of the tiny fragments.

I plan to keep the book because every chapter contains a few nuggets of useful information, but it is not worth the purchase price. The level of discourse is suitable for advanced high school students, and the prose style is pallid and lifeless. I found very little science in the book, despite its title. I was hoping for solid economic and demographic analyses, and found none. The social and cultural material is better, but not strong enough. Most of the authors are aware of the size of the epidemic, but in my opinion do not yet appreciate the depth of the catastrophe that is impending. No author addresses the likely effects that AIDS will have on African nations in the future (this may be the fault of the editor, not the authors).

The Ark is safe in the Temple Mount beneath the Holy of Holies, but you shouldn't look for it, instead you should spend your time searching for Jesus (the out-of-the-blue Jesus sales pitch on the very last page). His conclusion is based mostly on a story told to him by rabbis who went looking for it recently but didn't find it. Let's hear it for gut feelings. The Author does a good job derailing bogus theories of its location, while completely ignoring Oak Island (just one of many extraordinary possibilities for an extraordinary loss), or delving deep into the Crusaders time in Jerusalem (who may have attained it). Discounting the real Ark being in Ethiopia is easy...reading his awkward text is not. Lack of dates throughout the book make it difficult to know what time period he's speaking of. For a final laugh, enjoy the author's picture on the back cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essays of great insight and value","review":"This series of Essays by Pierre Teilhard de Chardin should have been shared sixty years ago, when they were first written. Unfortunately at that time Fr. Teilhard was under interdiction by the Hierarchy of the Church and his Jesuit superiors for his extremely forward-looking and therefore unorthodox perspectives on Evolution and other aspects of the overlap between spirituality and science, and therefore much of his work was only published after his death.These essays are extremely valuable, however, in expanding his ideas of complexity consciousness, the development of the noosphere, and other vital aspects of what has become foundational theology for the present day. It is to be hoped that as more and more people read his writing and reflect upon it in view of the culmination of so many of his predictions, its value and power will truly be recognized."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"A series of interesting interviews with successful screenwriters.

This is rock music in a classical setting, focusing on mood, dynamics and texture. Only rock musicians are playing, but the sound that is created makes you feel as if you're listening to a whole symphony orchestra. At any rate, the Enid are quite quirky, but definitely worth a listen, for their version of 'Scarborough Fair', if nothing else. Listen and judge for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Piping at it's best!","review":"Love this CD. As a piper myself it's great to hear his how accomplished this piper is.

Lack of having a point. Lack of creativity. Lack of acting. Lack of trying. And ultimately, at the end of the movie, it left me with a lack of giving; lack of giving a rat's ass about how it was going to end. At least Jessica Alba could have shown her knockas. Minus 3 stars for this slop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute trash","review":"This movie is so bad, I don't even really want to write a review about it. Take every dancing movie cliche, music video technique, and Jessica Alba, roll it up into a sickingly sweet 90 minute story and you get Honey which, despite its name, really stinks. Unless you are a big Jessica Alba fan, like Coyote Ugly, this movie is just way to lame once you get past the hot young female lead trying to make her way in life. I will repeat this over and over, little kids 99% of the time just ruin a movie. This holds true, with a annoying little kid that is suppose provide the cuteness, but I would prefer to see dribbled like a basketball and shot out of the movie. About the only kid I've seen in a movie that didn't annoy me was the little girl in Aliens. People need to stop putting little kids in movies! They are not cute! They are annoying!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why would Yolanda Adams agree to be on the soundtrack","review":"of this very HORRIBLE movie?!That's all I have to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE GIRL NOT ONLY KICKS ASS BUT CAN SHAKE DAT ASS 2","review":"MAN I WOZ JUST SO BLOWN AWAY WIT DIS CHICK.

This one tops them all in the \\"what were you thinking\\" category.The fact that this movie has a 4 star rating all but makes it impossible to trust the masses. This movie is so painfully, painfully, awful. I feel sorry for anyone who subjected themselves, as I did, to this joke. If I can sway one person from going through the same torture I did maybe it will be worth taking the time to write this.This is the 1st review I've ever written, and I wouldn't normally take the time. In this case however, I have to make an exception and warn you about the danger of this thing, whatever you want to call it.Sure Jessica is gorgeous, and if you must rent this to look at her, just stare at the cover for awhile. DON'T WATCH THE MOVIE INSIDE THE CASE!!!!There... I've done my part. You have been thus warned. What you choose to do from here I cannot be held responsible for. Good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitley not for everyone","review":"This film is definitley not for everyone. Personally, i didnt like it because i dont like hiphop.

(they both had equally terrible acting, scripts, characters)Jessica Alba is not cute enough to redeem this mess. Also, it obvious she's trying too hard to talk and act urban, not very becoming)"},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS HIP HOP","review":"YA THIS IS HIP HOP SO IS THE SOUNDTRACK IT HAS TWEET AND SEAN PAUL YA IT ROCKS. BUY THIS DVD RIGHT NOW."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Dancing!!... bad movie.","review":"I really really wanted to like this movie- love it more like! But I just can't. The dancing that I looked forward to the most was few and far between and even then some of it (due to choreography/camera angles/both) looked rather cheesy.Plus the acting on Jessica Alba's part was cheesy as well. Her voice changes tone when talking to the younger actors which makes it really hard to believer her when she seems so awkward.Finally, it's hard to believe. Dancing in one video does not give the dancer the kind of money this movie wants to make the audience believe. In the real world, if a dancer is lucky enough to make the cut for a video- they make around 500 dollars- not 9 thousand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrogant DVD production","review":"Every menu option comes with a long intro. You can't skip the previews. It's ridiculous. Don't encourage such arrogance by buying it.

The plot line takes a huge chip off \\"Save the Last Dance,\\" only difference between that movie and \\"Honey\\" is that the \\"Save the last dance\\" had a better plot line and talented actors, while \\"Honey\\" stars Jessica Alba, who was obvisouly casted for her sub-par looks and her worse then your high school cheesy production of romeo and juliet acting talents. The movie has as much pizazz as \\"Glitter.\\" The plot line of the road to fame was not as easy as i thought it could be is getting really old. please don't waste your money on this junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliche To The Hilt","review":"An MTV/BET hybrid film starring Jessia Alba who was clearly chosen for her looks. It is my understanding that she had to be taught how dance which baffles me because the last time I checked Mya is a trained dancer and since acting skills were not a prime concern, she could have done the role. I think the change in casting alone could have saved this movie from the absolute trash heap into at least renting class. After all, there would have been some real reason to expand on the dancing. Beyond that gripe, the numerous cliches were overwhelming to the point where my 13 year old younger sister could stand no more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Honey","review":"This movie really sucks.

Don't believe the hype. Jessica was nice to look at but the dancing was weak. Lil Romeo can not and I reapeat can not dance. If he was to come to the streets with that wack little shoulder move he would get kicked off the block. But he's just a kid you might say... so what! Rent a copy of the freshest kids if you want to see what some kids called the Rocksteady Crew did when they we're just kids and you'll see what I mean when I say his moves were garbage.Secondly the script sucked and plot was ripped straight out of breakin' 2 electric bugaloo with a pinch of flashdance.P.S. You can't learn HipHop either its in you or it ain't"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite dope","review":"The film was alrite still. It had some dope bits innit with the little kids doing there thing Jessica was really good in it showing a contrast to her role in dark angel.

The ending was rubbish and the dance scene with tweet was aswell but on the hole a great film to pick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet as 'honey'.","review":"I really enjoyed this movie. Jessica Alba is a great actress. This movie has just a few similarities to Save The Last Dance. I would say it's just as good. This movie has a wonderful lesson behind it-never give up on your dreams, no matter what happens. You can achieve anything. That's the great thing about this movie. It's heartfelt AND has a lesson to be learned. This DVD is also packed with extras, such as deleted scenes, outtakes, music videos..it's very nice. I was pleased. I would definately recommend this for a rental. I would buy this as well. The music is also exceptional. That's another thing I would recommend buying-the soundtrack.

Attractive bargurrrl with stars in her eyes gets discovered by a sleazy mentor who tries to blacklist her when she won't \\"get with his program\\". But the girl reaches inside herself, finds her \\"inner spunk\\", and shows everyone, including that evil Snidely Whiplash mentor that she has what it takes to make it after all. Add a hip-hop soundtrack featuring a few \\"I'm gonna live my dream and you ain't gonna stop me\\" songs, and the ususal \\"street\\" choreography, and you've got a movie that can be seen back-to-back with BREAKIN 2: ELECTRIC BOOGALOO."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honey the urban dance movie","review":"Jennifer Alba is on her way to becoming a wonderful actress. She's a very beautiful woman with a nice presence.You can tell that she was doing her own dancing because of the creativity that was present.I lover her determination. She was not afraid to say what she tought and she didn't give in to that evil producer who wanted to sleep with her. The proof of how good she was came in the end when Missy would only use her as a choreographer and started to bring her more business.I also liked the acting skills of Lil Romeo and Mekih Phifer. Mekih and Jennifer really had great chemistry in this movie. I hope to see more things from Jennifer in the near future."},{"rating":"1","title":"alba yes movie no.","review":"This is a marginal movie that tries to exploit albas obvious appeal. Its not memorable except as an on screen launching pad for ms albas career. It is not fair to judge an actress only for first performances that can bring attention to her overall potential. I know she is very talented.I realize that sometimes these movies are inevitable.However she has already proven herself in dark angel.I will wager that her next moves will be to try a variety of concepts leading to big screen success.In the end i do not blame her for a foolishly made production by hollywood copycats.She is super. The movie?- is your decision. now you know mine.thank you !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It sucks the life out of you!","review":"Wow, so I only watched this movie because my siblings rented it. Needless to say, they're 13 and 14 and they didn't even enjoy it. What the hell name is \\"Honey\\" anyway? And if Jessica Alba is so all about being \\"Latina\\" what is she doing pretending to be half black?? Good Lord her stupid fake little ghetto accent drove me nuts! Her dancing isn't even good. And the \\"streets\\" in the movie weren't even bad. Plus shouldn't \\"the kids'\\" focus be on education instead of having their life goal be a background booty dancer for a rap video? If you enjoy seeing a skinny fat-lipped white girl shake her non-existent ass up in the club this movie is for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some Of The WORST Wrestling skits ever!","review":"DX is a faction that appeared in the late 90's and had some fantastic and memorable moments in their glory days. Yet, in 2009-10 wrestling has changed to a more family friendly product, taking away a lot of what made DX great. What we're left with is a collection of very corny skits and not a lot of overall excitement. Pretty lame. I will say, there are a few good wrestling matches on here, like Survivor series 2009, but there is nothing here that makes it a must own or that you can't get elsewhere on a stronger WWE release. If you're a DX fanatic, then by all means complete your collection. Casual and even collector fans can skip. Your money is better spent on a different title. Just my 2 cents."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Got Two Words For You: Buy It!","review":"Yes, its not the best DX run, but it is still good, esp. if youre a Trips, HBK, and/or DX fan. The matches are typical DX fashion, which you mostly get stellar performances from both guys(I wont post spoilers to be fair to those who dont know the results or just forgot), though the segments are either hit or miss. I personally love the whole Hornswaggle debacle(Little People's Court is silly fun) and the Christmas skits! There are \\"new footage\\" of Trips and HBK in a tank, just to talk about the contents of the discs and whatnot, its not that funny though.As if the picture quality, it is great, as what you expect of the WWE Blu-ray videos. Very clear and the colors are vibrant. And dont worry, they added the whole entrances of each match.Buy this if youre a DX fan, again, its not their best reunion, but the fact that its the last DX run, get it for sentimental sake if nothing else. Now, Im hoping that WWE will release a COMPLETE DX SET in Blu-ray."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shawn & HHH","review":"it was good. It was not what I thought it would be but still enjoyed it.

He discusses the person of the man named Jesus and also the work of the God-man refusing to separate either, but keeping them intimately and intractibly connected. This would be a very valuable book for a Sunday School class or even for a special study during Vacation Bible School, for example. Placher's contribution here is wonderful. My only criticism is that I would have like to have seen or felt more passion from Placher about the Savior that is he writing about. Though this is an easier read than T. F. Torrance's The Mediation of Christ--you get a sense in that book of Torrance's evangelical fervor for the Savior, where the same passion seems lacking in Placher's book. Should that be the case? We are talking about the person, Jesus Christ, to whom we owe everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cledus-sure can't sing, but really gets ya laughing!!","review":"At first, a few years ago, I thought Cledus was really stupid and rude. But, after I heard his songs later this summer, I couldn't stop laughing. My favorite song on this CD would be: (She's got a Butt) Bigger than the Eagles. It is hilarious. I've listened to other CD's of his, so have my parents, and they crack up. Of course, my dad laughs at anything, but it even got my mom laughing, that's how funny his songs are. They make sense (Kinda) and the tone of his voice, the titles, and they way the are written makes the songs the funniest country songs I have ever heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"superb by all standards","review":"Cledus combines great lyrics and an underrated sense of humor too far for country music, he makes a big comeback from his first album, he should have titled it STEP ON OVER in parody to Shania Twain's high grossing album COME ON OVER.

I'm fairly convinced that the authors are actually robots, robots that were not programmed to be able to communicate with humans on a human's level.I also nurse a suspicion that the most basic information that you need could be written on a couple 3x5's, thus making this book ridiculously superfluous.But that's just me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always love Loretta!","review":"This is a CD I remember listening to when I was a kid...and it still sounds just as good. :) Quick delivery, and great service.

Don't get me wrong I enjoyed it but the theme was set early on, \\"My colleagues aren't playing fair and I'm still going to take the money.\\"Because the author is documenting real events, it was refreshing to get an insiders perspective on WorldCom's lifecycle. In particular, as a CNBC viewer, the talking heads are always tossing around ... \\"former head of Citigroup ...\\" and several of these players show up in the book. So that was a value added aspect that I enjoyed.The thing I found funny was that the last page of the book pretty much sums it up. I did pick up a few trading notes but things were drawn out in the later half of the book. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read- very to the point and honest","review":"I liked reading Reingold's insight and his candor. I work for Smith Barney.

Books by employees that witnessed first hand the financial wrongdoing, who knew the execs involved or by journalists who uncover shocking facts are more compelling reads.The story is that before Regulation FD, when insider information was less regulated he was paid big bucks to be a telecom analyst and does nothing to rectify bad behavior. He focuses on his raises and on another analyst, the Moby Dick character.

I can't say when the last time that happened to me was, but it certainly made an impression.This is a mature album with a lot of depth. There are some great harmonies on this album, and that's what drew me to the group in the first place. Some faovrite songs are No Matter What, One Kiss at a Time, And I, and Where Did You Go?

I assumed that the cables would carry the same attention to detail and quality that goes into their case manufacturing. I ordered 5 of these cables for an htpc build where 4 were to be used for two raid 1 arrays and the 5th was to be used for a dvd drive/burner. The slightest amount of side to side pressure on the cable ends while seated in the motherboard or hard drives will cause the cap sides to break off. This makes the cable unusable as it will no longer remain seated in the drive or motherboard. Don't make the same mistake that i did. I broke 3 of these cables from the pressure of just plugging them in. I have used $1 budget cables with better durability which is sad considering these come in at $7 a piece.

He takes too long getting to the point and provides so little clear direction or examples, that I'm left only with his sense of self-importance, not information about Photoshop. If the he had let an editor shorten the book by half and provided more clear steps/information about using Photoshop, I would have indulged him more, but as it is, this book is of very little use for someone wanting to expand their Photoshop skills. Its the author being spiritual and groovy way past the point of usefullness."},{"rating":"1","title":"unhelpful at best","review":"Strange that a book on photography has images so small I needed to use a loupe! The text is small as well. And the writing is longwinded, and directionless--in short it is a chore to read.

I thought Photoshop Artistry was a much better book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Acquired Taste","review":"John Paul Caponigro really is brilliant and his website is a wonderful resource, but he really is a difficult person to deal with and read.

His whole attitude is I am right and your all wrong, and Photoshop is such a large program that there are many ways to get things done. Yes, In Photoshop some ways might be faster and easier then others but it is the same way in real life, so do not feel obligated to follow his steps exactly.No, I have not read this edition of the book but I have read enough of his previous stuff to know his style of writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some great techical information!","review":"The book is divided into 2 sections. The 1st part is the technical part which familarizes you with the techniques the author uses most. The 2nd section focuses on his art,his vision, and the technical details of how his images are accomplished.The Technical section was superb;in the other 4 or 5 photoshop books I've read, I've never had Curves explained to me so thoroughly. His larger and more 'artistic' section is very interesting also, although at times he feels and sounds like a crazy artist, his superb techical skills make the book informative and worthwhile regardless of whether you connect with his work.This book isn't for beginners. Like Bert Monroy's Photorealistic Techniques book, the author shares with the reader his hobby, passion, and years of experience. Those working with photos as their chief source material, especially those combining photographs, will benefit the most from John Caponigro's expertise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yucky New Age photography tutorial","review":"Caponigro uses Photoshop effectively, yet you should really take a look at the book before purchasing to see if you can stomach his fluffy, new-age photographs.

Written to expose the spiritualism that was becoming popular in his time (late nineteenth century), this book is very appropriate for our times. George Hawkins Pember was a man who knew the Word of God and was fully illuminated by the Spirit of God. Using the Scriptures, Pember unveils to us how God's enemy fell, the beings who followed him in his rebellion, and how they utilize spiritualism and other practices to deceive and entrap people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absoulte Nonsense","review":"The books shows the error of using science as a basis for interpreting Scripture. What is ironic is how the author says God's creation must be perfect (which is correct), and then puts the creation of man into a fallen universe. Pember would have you believe that after God separated the light and darkness, there was day and night, Day 1,679,000,000,001 (4.6 billion years x 365 days per year + 1).The earth did not become waste. The original matter of the earth was simply not formed and empty. God then began the forming and filling process of the heavens and earth. And at the end of Day 6 God declared all that He created as very good.Satan's fall was closely associated with his entrance into the Garden East of Eden to deceive man.Unless you are interested in learning the core errors of 19 century Accommodationists in developing the gap theory don't waste your money on this book.

In fact this is a spectacular demonstration of the human ability to find any belief, no matter how nutty, justified by Biblical texts. Nothing Pember says is backed up by any significant research beyond what is said in the Bible. Since other Biblical scholars have come to remarkably different conclusions, then the only reason for favouring his view is ithat he reinforces some people's existing prejudices.The End Is Nigh, apparently.

I cleaned the heads regularly, purchased only the Epson brand ink and did everything else I was supposed to. I contacted Epson and they sent me a new printer, not even requiring that I send back the defective one, which really told me something about the product! The one they sent is the C88 model. It worked better, and for a longer time than the first one, but after several months it started doing the same thing as the C86 model. As has been stated by others, the ink is VERY expensive, and these printers use a whole lot of it.

It's so bad I have to clean them before almost every print job, and even then I rarely get a page to print out cleanly. Also, the printer has major problems with the paper feed - mostly when trying to print double-sided. After *every* page I have to push the paper feed button. Very annoying for large documents.

I looked on the Epson site and there is no download for windows 7 drivers. You can get a software package that would theoretically allow you to control the printer, but no inf file. I contacted Epson support and they claim that this is not a current model (so why is it for sale on their site?) and they do not have Windows 7 drivers and do not intend to provide them.

We are very unhappy with these because of their ink cartridge usage. First of all the cartridges are expensive. Next, we constantly having to clean the nozzle heads or align the heads to prevent gaps from appearing in the printed documents. This cleaning/aligning uses much more ink so the cartidges don't last as long as they should. By the time we get everything printing well, it is time to replace the cartridges. Lastly the printer stops printing if even one cartridge is out of ink. You cannot even print in only black if (say) the yellow is out. Several times when replacing the cartridges, I would shake the \\"empty\\" cartridge and it sounded like there was still plenty of ink left. I am wondering if their monitor get confused at times and reports a cartridge empty when it is not.

My son is about 5'10\\", and very slender - a Large would have fit him well, but he likes his jackets and sweatshirts to be loose-fitting, so the X-Large is great for him. The quilted sleeves are very nice, and allow the hoodie to slide on over long-sleeved shirts without bunching up the sleeves on the inside. This hoodie keeps him warm outside, but isn't bulky - so he can wear it comfortably inside as well. If he is going to be outside for a long period of time in very cold weather, he still needs a winter jacket - but for day-to-day school, running here and there in the car, walking to friends' houses down the street - this sweatshirt is wonderful and suits his needs perfectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap","review":"This is really junk.

It makes the pendant appear really thin and flimsy, when it actually isn't, because the surface is so flat, it appears that someone took a beautiful Star of David and glued on some black glitter. It has no depth. The reverse side of this pendant is solid silver and it actually looks better. I don't like this piece of jewelry, but I won't go through the hassle of sending it back.

First, it's almost impossible to get a droid in the Donk, unless they're a bi-pedal model.Second, the slats on the Donk offer poor visibility. It's almost impossible to accurately hit a target when you only have a 10 degree viewing angle, and almost no ability to manuver your weapon from side to side. So much for sniping womp rats.The sound system was great, easily rivals the sound system at the local cantina. And the carpeting inside is nice, but it's not that great when you're tracking in sand.It's great for sightseeing or a casual cruiser, but as a tank, it lacking. And there's no onboard computer system, no built in weapons or defense systems. It doesn't even have auto pilot.

All electrical components were immediately useless. This, of course, has led to a rather ticklish situation. I'm currently in the basement of some burned out house in Highland Park, and my hosts keep referring to me by names I don't understand. Well, my Q still has 50% battery power, so I'll probably be able to call the manufacturer in the morning to discuss hardening the Badonkadonk.

Secondly, the after-sales service leaves a lot to be desired. When the brakes gave out, they replaced them with a land anchor. I live on a hill, so I can see the safety aspect, but it's a little impractical round town especially since my model does not have power steering. Seriously - what were the designers thinking?

Save yourself the time and frustration -- pass this one by."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment, a real poser","review":"These are not animal stories and they are not dog stories, they are petty little stories about this author's excuse for not feelng like she belongs anywhere or to anyone. Ho hum, guess what, it comes with moving here and there. What else is new? How can anyone who has every cared for a pet give all the dogs in this book one personality? Don't forget the pretentious, half-hearted wisdom to justify this author's platform, which must have been added during editing to help marketing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fall in love with Dante","review":"This is one of my top 5 favorite books. Dante is a dog that you will fall in love with- one you will cry for- and one that will bring you hope.

And mean all the ones from when they first came out (not just those listed on this site.) I love Graham - seen him live three times (whenever he comes through.) BUT - this album is awful. The original reviewer was really on the money (even if he was a man of few words.) This album is wishy-washy, sappy, no urgency at all. Hey - I loved Struck by Lightning which was largely acoustic - but that has some killer songs. This album has nothing going for it. Not one song sticks in the mind.I dig it out periodically to give it another listen, but honestly - this thing is horrid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you call tops!","review":"This CD is pretty bad in my opinion.

For a stripped-down acousticy GP disc, buy Struck By Lighting which blows 12 Haunted Episodes out of the water. One or two adequate songs, but it's just not that interesting overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak GP album","review":"I love Graham Parker and love most of his albums, but this one is an exception. It just simply isn't very good. Partner For Life is a eloquent song about marital bliss without being too sappy, and it is the one highlight of the album.He has a couple excellent acoustic albums, mainly Struck By Lightning and Live! Alone In America which are both excellent albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvelous!","review":"I enjoyed this book very much! It sheds a great light on Mde.

BUT, the book only describes a robot which just walks around the floor. THAT'S IT!! There's no voice recognition, it's just like a remote controlled car, but it can go around on its own without a controller. I am now searching for a book which reveals how you build a GOOD, WORKING robot, not just an electronic car like this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book - I bulit the robot for my engineering project!","review":"The book takes a hands-on approach to robot-building, and the author goes out of the way not by promising a gizmo but rather a simple acoustic-controlled car trolley which can be extended to pave the way for a more advanced project. A course in basic electronics is recommended, the book also covers sufficient details so as not to require much knowledge initially. But the fun part of the book is the amount of possibilities that the author has actually tried out with the robot - this includes following a chalk line on pavements, and even seeking and plugging into a battery charger when its supplies go low! This is definitely a book worth treasuring, and moreover - IMPLEMENTING!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious but Deep.","review":"Super book. I'm not working in showbiz nor am I in recovery but I relate to this book cover to cover. In this book Ed Driscoll takes you through various events in his life, some tragic, some uplifting but all told in a wonderfully humorous yet insightful way. Specifically he shares some of his online dating experiences which are laugh-out-loud hilarious. Even his stories about struggling with his carreer and later making it in hollywood after being sober was funny. A great book for anyone who loves to laugh and grow. I am getting some copies for my fellow office workers becasue I can't do the stories justice when I try to tell them myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"An absolute joy","review":"This book is a delight. While the story is, on the surface, about comic book collectors, so much of the detail is fictionalized that I think it would be enjoyed by anyone with an interest in history and old things.The creator, Seth, tapped into a wondrous streak of inspiration with Wimbledon Green."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jazz Improvisation at Its Best","review":"George Russell is at his best here in this magnificent work of music, jazz, improvisation... life! The book manages to capture the greatness of such proponents of the Lydian Chromatic concept as Miles Davis, Thelonious Monk, and countless others. It is truly inspirational, a \\"must-have\\" for any serious Jazz musician who wishes to do some soul searching the only way he/she knows how: through their horn!

Before my trip to the jungles of Costa Rica, I thought I'd read up on some of the more onery snakes that I might encounter, such as the bushmaster and fer-de-lance. Not only were there no pictures or information on the bushmaster, it wasn't even listed in the index! As for the fer-de-lance, there was a single picture but no information. I have since read the entire book, and have found it to be extremely lacking in useful species-specific information. The chapter titled \\"A Few Interesting Species\\" is very short (about 30 pages), not to mention it excludes some fairly important species! For the beginning enthusiast who just wants a general overview, this would be a good place to start, but don't let your education stop here! The book's only redeeming qualities for me were some nice glossy photos and the anecdotes written by herpetologists with snake bite or near miss experiences."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Photographs","review":"A well-assembled, passionate, generalist overview of venomous snakes.

In this book, Jessie comes across as an angry, much less sweet and innocent version of who she was before. She is definitely less endearing in \\"Now or Never\\". And Michael is so caught up in his recovery that he becomes self-pitying, boring and irritating. There is also quite a bit of foul language in the book, so some parents may not find it suitable for their teens to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An illuminating framework for understanding competition","review":"I'm an engineer by training. The authors conveyed their marketing concepts in easy-to-understand terms thru analogy with warfare. I tried to apply their framework to Intel vs. AMD and Amazon.com vs. E-bay. I believe I have acquired some understanding of why the marketing folks at Intel and Amazon.com are doing what they are doing. Enough knowledge to have made me dangerous :-) Would have been nice if authors had included a few chapters on cases where the analogy of marketing with warfare breaks down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this","review":"This Audio CD is garbage. It contains just nine random 5 minute segments of the book recorded in audio. It does not contain the entire book in audio. To make it worse, it was delivered with no packaging or supporting materials, it simply came inside a blank CD case, and the image on the CD itself was obviously printed using a home printer."},{"rating":"2","title":"kudos to gen. clausewitz","review":"this book very well intimates that marketing is war. so to deal with a war, different tools are needed. offensive, defensive and guerrilla war are some of them. the book gives insight of the history of various gigantic companies and the testing conditions the came from. sectionwise coverage gives a reader liberty to read according to the industry of his interest.though the book has been written in a military style, but fun to read. the principles of warfare also are feast to grab. looks very obvious but are very profound. simply a delicious book for voracious readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ups..

I suppose it has to be the way Abe's sax alternates from near inaudible exhalations to Zorn-esque spaz attacks. The sound quality is decent for a live performance and reflects the small venue in which this was recorded (you can actually hear dishes clinking, people murmuring and phones ringing in the background). Everything adds to the feeling that you are eavesdropping on a secret Japanese jazz club where something truly happening is, well, happening.

I have calibrated all four for temperature accuracy and they all consistently read the same within acceptable limits. However, with one of the units I cannot adjust the relative humidity. I cannot correct the humidity reading with the adjustment. The dew point reading depends upon the accuracy of the relative humidity and so the dew point is in error. I need a good dew point reading to prevent mold in some air handling equipment so this unit forces me to guess on its error and estimate the dew point. Not a good feeling.

Radio stations won't touch him with a 10 foot pole even though he has written some of the greatest pure pop tunes of the 80's and 90's. However, that has not stopped him from recording and touring and continuing to write incredible songs. This album is slightly uneven, but a very vital recording, since it truly documents the power Marshall has over his audience and his incredible ability to simply rock. His also underrated prowess on the guitar (mainly on Twine Time) is also in full force here. If you would like to be introduced to Marshall Crenshaw, this is a great starter. It includes some of his classics, including some obscure cover tunes like the Byrds \\"Have You Seen Her Face\\" and Abba's \\"Knowing Me Knowing You\\" - if you have ever seen Marshall live, you will have real appreciation for the inclusion of these songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite singles.","review":"This single edition from 1996 has only four tracks but with only twenty five (aprox.) minutes of music we can appreciate more of the best actual gothic band.

The third, \\"Mutatio Spirit\\", is a great not yet released song in the same lacrimosa style. Closing the cd appears an exquisit piano version from \\"Stolzes Herz\\".

The Cuddle Chimp sits on the shelf.

Highly recommended for Amazon seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of Hambley's Electrical Engineering","review":"I am an engineering student at Georgia Tech and have used various texts covering topics from orginismal biology to quantum physics. Hambley's Electrical Engineering book is lacking in some of the most fundamental elements that are required for a successful text in any engineering field. There are very few solutions to problems and the solution that are provided are incomplete, providing mostly the final answer as opposed to a complete logic pattern to achieve the answer. The in chapter exercises demonstrate only the most meager applications of the sometimes tedious analysis steps or theorems. Finally, the clarity of author's intent is often hazed by generality or over specificity. I cannot see how an electrical engineering major can use this text for anything other than a stabilizer for a wobbling table. Save yourself the money and purchase a Schaum's outline and a problem work book complete with solutions."},{"rating":"1","title":"It has potential","review":"this book has a lot of potential. As a college student, I must say that this book really stinks. The in-text examples do not represent what is needed to do the homework. Also, there is no way to check answers to the homework problems as there are no solutions in the back and a solutions manual is not available. The lack of solutions makes this book very difficult to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This is a horrible book to start out with.

Useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book Ever.","review":"This is possibly the worst textbook I've ever come across. Vague explanations and terrible examples do nothing to prepare you for end chapter excercises.

In the real world engineers DESIGN circuits, not spend all day reverse engineering resistive networks, pretending they don't know the difference between a battery and a resistor!

The text is at times nearly cryptic (especially FETs), does not give enough examples, and unfortunately most of the problems in the book do not have answers (some are online.) And, in general, I feel unprepared academically to answer the end-of-chapter problems after reading the chapter and doing the (very few) examples. I have done online searches on some of the subjects in this book and come across free webpages with FAR better explanations. If you learn by doing problems, don't waste your money here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an excellent book for a student","review":"I had a class that required this book, and to be honest, this book is not all that well structured and written. The only real use for this book is the formulas and explaining several of the most basic concepts of electrical engineering (how to calculate resistance, basics of electromagnetism, you know, the bare basics). It is very poor on giving examples and explanations on how the concepts apply in real life situations and to the problems they give at the end of each chapters. And even the monotonous \\"solve this circuit problems\\" are not explained in the text very well. For about 70% of the problems I couldn't figure out the problems at the end of the chapters without consulting a solutions manual or the instructor. I don't recommend this text to teachers unless you'd prefer to go over the samples and concepts in much more detail than what the text covers.

The company has been around since the late 1890's. Their knives have a full tang and riveted wooden handles.

Who has time to oil and hand wash these things? You shouldn't have to in this day and age. The wood may split if you put them in the dishwasher. What's that all about?

The book outlines those formulas that makes it all clear and easy to follow when it comes to 'how to do it.' As far as I'm concerned, it turned a complex field into something I can understand and relate to as a novice. I never thought working in the commercial area of real estate could be made simple, but these methods clearly set forth all the elements needed to do it. It appears the results should be very gratifying indeed. Anyone who invests or intends to invest in real estate should read and re-read how it's done by another successful investor willing to share his knowledge."},{"rating":"2","title":"The City and the Stars","review":"A book I read during my teenage years, read again as an aging adult.

This book is such a relief after reading Riptide, which truly should have been the first Lassiter episode published. My only gripe is the incorrect use of the Hawaiian word mauka. Yes, it is mauka (toward the mountains) NOT makua. It is a sticking point with me not just because I am particular (although I am) but because Mr. Levine tries to use it as a lesson and make a point. I strongly feel that authors have a responsibility to be very careful when writing about tradition and language from other cultures. It is way too easy to offend.

I really love animes with a great emotional story, but it's fun to watch something just for fun and laughs. The production quality of this anime is pretty good. The animation and voice acting is good. If you want to laugh and enjoy yourself this anime id for you, but if you're after a deep story then look at something else. As far as being pure and simple fun is concerned, Yumeria has it covered."},{"rating":"1","title":"The bird house looks really nice in the picture...","review":"...but not so nice in person.

He wrote works ranging from philosophy and medicine to poetry and rhetoric. Apuleius is best known for his remarkable collection of tales, The Golden Ass or Transformations. It is a playful satire containing the use of many different genres, much like one would find in the Mennepian satires of Petronius, Seneca, Fulgentius, or Macrobius. It is a complex and enthralling work in which interpretation is always open-ended. Apuleius' use of allegory, his exceptional talent for imagery, and his rhythmic and often poetic prose, make this text a challenge and a joy to read at the same time. The Golden Ass is definitely a masterpiece of Latin literature and can also argue of being the world's first novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic...","review":"I only bought this books for a history class.

Together Hampton, Frears and Friend keep the tale's surprise. While Lea has been no nanny but doubly nude throughout, a delicately draped performance by Pfeiffer, Friend's dandy shows himself, in retrospect, the moralist at his wit's end.

Once you get a successful potatoe to cut through, the ends of the fries are stuck in the thick grids.

If you are slightly off 90 degrees when you start pushing through the potatoe, you are in a very dangerous zone. Think of a lot of force applied to sharp blades that is going in the wrong direction.3.) Maybe my set was off tolerance, but the blade would not stay in the housing by itself. I had to hold the blade in the housing and push it on the potatoe simulateously. Not a big deal, but that for me sealed the 1-star rating.I guess the bottom line is, if you expect nothing out of it, you might use it, or if you are slicing something softer than potatoes.

Excellent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"TRU TO FORM","review":"I feel fortunate to be alive at a time when such a revolutionary, prolific, outspoken, forthcoming lyricist as Talib and his counterpart Mos Def Black Star. Although, they are doing there thing individually, collectively they still are a mighty awesome force of freedom fighters for our generation. All these tracks just run together to make a true message of impowerment and awareness. If for anyone who does not see it's significance it is quite unfortunate and my only advice is JUST LISTEN TO IT UNTIL YOU DO, cause it is all relative. Oh Yea and Kanye you are definately in good company, birds of a feather flock together and you are just showing off, and I'm Glad At You."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best to date","review":"I've never been a huge fan of Kweli's solo efforts. However, Ear Drum has changed that. Start to finish, this was a great disc. Some of my favorite tracks were Hostile Gospel Pt. 1, Give 'Em Hell, Listen, and Hot Thing.There is a good variety of tracks from serious to fun. The lyrics are top notch as always and Kweli has a lot to say even if you don't want to agree with it all. If your a fan of real Hip-Hop and not the majority of the commercial crap on the radio these days, this disc is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tight","review":"I just want to start by saying that I didn't even know who this dude was until a few months ago. I bought his album just off a whim one day. After listening to it, man.....this dude is nice. I've got so many tracks that I like I'm not even going to list them all. \\"Say Something\\" and \\"Hostile Gospel, Part II\\" are probably my two favorite tracks though. There's probably 2-3 tracks that I FF on a constant basis and that's about it. This music is good for the ears. It was great to hear that passion and creativity that's missing in most of the music that gets put out nowadays. This guy's got it. I don't know why I haven't heard more about him. Of course....socially conscious rappers don't get much burn on the mainstream circuits which is disappointing. Get this CD man. It's hot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"This album is BEAUTIFUL. That may be an odd way to describe it but its befitting for this album. From the moment I listened to it a week ago I can't stop listening to it. And the fact that it has 20 tracks and doesn't skip a beat is very impressive to me. I love what Talib is doing and HIP HOP is not dead...at least not with an album like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"This will hit your eardrum with real HipHop","review":"Talib is back and stronger than ever with this classic album, Eardrum. The production is solid, lyrics are awesome, and his cameo's were placed with precision.The CD opens with Everything Man, which he says \\"You can't please everyone.\\" However, this CD is very pleasing and brings a fresh perspective on what Hip-Hop is and has always been, true to the art-form. The hard cuts such as Say Something, Holy Moly, to the smooth cuts such as Country Cousins, Eat to Live, Hot Thing, and Soon the new day (with Nora Jones!) shows versatility at it's finest from Talib. The collaborations worked with cohesion, the solid production enlists Pete Rock, Will.i.am, and many others deliver with quality.This is an album you will gladly buy, and listen to many times. Tracks for driving, dancing, club, within the 20 tracks you will find it all. HOT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Treat your eardrum","review":"The only thing better than a Talib CD is seeing him perform live. He has an ability to make you wish you had put pen to paper and come up with this narrative. More than just a rapper, this poet has blessed the music industry with knowledge for years. Now it is time to stop downloading and purchase some of this masters' pieces. We need more of this, not less! So drop this CD in your cart and treat your \\"Eardrum\\" to something that vividly paints pictures with passages that personify his lyrical genius."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kwelity over Quantity","review":"Being a BlackStar fan I have high hopes for both Kweli and Mos to continue their stellar rhymes over dope beats... It's hard to say it but ever since Kweli's freshman album (Reflection Eternal) each year that passes, his skills deteriorate. I thought Beautiful Struggle was bad, this one is worse!!His flows doesn't have the tricky metaphors he used to deliver and his word play skills is struggling, his vocab is elementry, and his knowledge is on a grassroot level.. He doesn't fwok with the mind anymore. And most of the beats are mediocre. There are some glimpses of Kwelity from tracks like: \\"Everything Man\\", \\"NY Weather Report\\", \\"In The Mood\\" & \\"Soon The New Day\\". BUT 4 songs out of 20?? That's not even 25%..Last good album Kweli dropped is Quality, and this is exactly what Kweli is lacking.... My advice cop the new Mos album, it takes you back to hip hop of old, it has a old skool feel to it (late 70s early 80s)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Hit","review":"I don't even have to say anything.

Eardrum was a CD that I obsessed with for what seems like a year waiting for it to be released. After the release I realized it was worth the wait. If you love real hip hop this is a must have. I love every song on the CD, but the ones that really stand out are \\"Eat to Live\\", \\"Givin' 'Em Hell\\", \\"Soon The New Day\\", \\"Oh My Stars\\", and my ringtone \\"Stay Around\\". Try it out and I guarantee you it is worth every penny you spend on it. This is truly Talib doing it the way it should be done."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD knocks!!","review":"I personally love every single track on this CD except \\"Country Cousins,\\" but my distaste for the song isn't enough to give this CD less than 5 stars. Other than that, there is depth in every single song; I say that this CD is better than Reflection Eternal, and that CD is really good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Progressive, True, and Still Thumpin'","review":"Progressive is this artist's word of the year.

Eardrum is no exception and just might be my favorite solo Kweli album so far. Definitely a strong contender for the best of 2007 (along with Pharoahe Monch, DJ Jazzy Jeff and Blu and Exile)Favorite Track: Hostile Gospel"},{"rating":"2","title":"Talib is the Truth!!

A lot of people slept on this album but this is by far his strongest effort since \\"Reflection Eternal\\". Kweli has been plagued with mediocre production on his previous albums although his is definitely one of the greatest lyricists of today. This album has it all. Very well rounded.

Excellent book.","review":"The story 'Self Storage' is fantastic. After reading it in, i believe, the Iowa Review, i immediately ordered the book. The stories are very real, very engaging.If you're into Tobias Wolff i strongly recommend this book. Actually, i strongly recommend it period."},{"rating":"2","title":"The red light, the naked man, and a toilet...","review":"Self Storage ranges from a Croatian family in America, to men and their baseball, to cars with red lights that keep coming on, to the well-crafted title story that offers commentary and philosophy on the materialistic accumulation of \\"stuff\\".Mary Helen Stefaniak's sense of character, tight and unwavering language, and especially voice, make her writing very pleasing to read. She offers a nice blend of entertainment, intelligence, and humorous observations in every story.You'll be telling your friends about Staramajka, the naked man, you'll empathize a little more with your grandma, and you might rethink your life a bit when you step back to look at your own self storage; Stefaniak's writing is that powerful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Service Ever","review":"They sent a wrong item (less value) but refused to admit it. Later they refused to do an exchange for me after my calls and email. I decided to return the wrong item. However, the owner decided to totally ignore my refund request after several more emails and phone calls. They call the people they work with \\"STUPID\\". I was shocked. Another reason they gave me for no refund is that they are \\"a very small company\\" and they \\"don't have profit\\"... It is ridiculous to speak to them. I threw away the book they sent. I will NEVER NEVER buy anything from them any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Abacus: The World's First Computer System + Abacus","review":"The text is poorly written and too much text is spent on explaining ancient counting devices and very little text explaining the abacus. The amount of time spent explaining the use of the abacus itself could be considered an 'epilogue' in back of the book and is completely in error with very poor examples for its operation. It is a shame that this book is still on the market. I do NOT recommend this paperback in spite of the free -- somewhat small -- abacus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazingly salty (in a bad way)","review":"I bought this salmon, attracted by the \\"Skinless & Boneless\\" label (I usually buy the alaskan salmon from Crown Prince).Let's just say that this was a huge mistake. This salmon has 630 mg of sodium per can, and while that doesn't sound like much, the salmon is amazingly salty. If you intend to use it in your cooking, perhaps this would be alright, however, it is impossible to eat as is. This salmon also smells less like salmon, and more like some other kind of fish (which really does not appeal to me much - if I wanted some other fish, I would have gotten it).Basically, right now I'm stuck with 11 cans of salmon that I really have no use for (the first can that I opened made it quite clear that it's the last can I would open). Unfortunately, I don't have a cat.

The one overwhelming impression I had from this book is how uncaring her family was and how she herself really was a very selfish woman, even wanting to go to a dance the night her child was deathly ill. I would recommend other books such as Doc Susie: The True Story of a Country Physician in the Colorado Rockies and also Tomboy Bride. Both of these books are about intellegent, caring individuals in the same parts of the country and in the same time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very sturdy","review":"I had purchased wire tomato cages from a local hardware store years ago. I purchased these because they were the same height as the others and I thought they would be made similar. These are made from thinner wire and not as sturdy.

I would recommend the manufacture consider using a heavier gauge wire for the next product upgrade."},{"rating":"2","title":"SUPERB DEAL ON THIS GREEN VINYL COATED TRELLIS","review":"I was amazed with how well these extremely reasonably priced trellises worked for my garden.

It's popular but challenging: thus the need for John R. Ford 's TWELFTH NIGHT: A GUIDE TO THE PLAY , which joins others in the 'Greenwood Guides to Shakespeare'. Plenty of other titles have offered critical analysis: what makes this one different is its inclusion of the play's textual history and changes, explanations of underlying history and influence, and a gathering of criticism and analogues under one cover. The inclusion of the sum of critical thinking about Twelfth Night makes A GUIDE TO THE PLAY an essential addition to any serious high school or college-level collection where Shakespeare's works are studied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed too","review":"I was sooooo disappointed. It was very slow moving and I was actually bored. I had enjoyed the series and expected much more here. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead stupid","review":"It seems as if the original staff from the series couldn't be found and instead the producers hired a bunch of beginners to write vulgarities in place of cutting edge humor.Replacements to the original cast especially the woman who played Daisy were just horrible. The comic book script was rushed and jerky; What a shame.Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacked","review":"I was looking forward to seeing this DVD. I am sorry but I miss Daisy and Rube. The actor who is playing Daisy well, she just doesn't cut it. The movie just lacked the excitement that the series gave. I would recommend that you wait until you can buy at 5.00."},{"rating":"2","title":"Missing Link","review":"For Dead Like Me series fans, you won't be disappointed by George, Roxy or Mason. They were written true to character.On the other hand, Daisy became violent, crass and ditzy. Gone is the finesse that Laura Harris brought to the character, which is what made Daisy so endearing and lovely. It's hard to say whether the problem with the character is more due to the writing or how the actor, Sarah Wynter, portrayed her. But the performance is worse than Daisy's theater debut...E-I-E-I-O.Britt McKillip did a fine job as Reggie. I liked the interaction between George and Reggie...but shouldn't breaking the rules bring \\"Reapercussions\\"???I would have given the movie 5 stars if Daisy would have been more true to the series character. I just don't care for the direction the character has taken."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with Seasons 1 & 2","review":"Not much new to add--if you loved the show, stay FAR away from this \\"movie.\\" The characters are horrible--mere caricatures of the wonderfully vibrant individuals from the TV series who act completely *out* of character--especially Roxy. The plot is heavy-handed and ridiculous, and lacks the morality and subtlety of the series. Stick with the two wonderful seasons--I wish I had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful. Just awful.","review":"Perhaps the producers should have taken the series' own advice and let the dead just move on. This sequel was too much like a zombie raised from the grave and forced to dance.The series was great. I really enjoyed both seasons. This follow-on straight-to-DVD production, however, was really not very fun for me at all. The characters, who had been developing quite nicely in the series, were slammed (painfully) back in to one-dimensional clowns that were mere shadows of what they had been.Too many \\"forced\\" scenes as well. They clearly showed the rough edges of trying to squeeze too many events into a single script. Not wanting to spoil anything, I won't describe them here, but there were too many times my reaction was, \\"where the hell did THAT come from?\\"If you liked the series, don't watch this sequel. I don't see how you could be anything but disappointed in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadness overwhelms","review":"Well, but you can never go back, can you...I watch a lot of tv series on dvd and I think DLM is probably my all time favorite. I so wish it was not cancelled. I wanted this single \\"movie\\" to be great, but it just isn't. Die hard (no pun intended) fans will have to see it, but it is painful to watch in many places. I would not do the show without Rube and the real Daisy. Sarah Wynter utterly fails to grasp the part of Daisy. Poor writing for Roxie and Mason, not enogh for Joy, and just ok for Reggie. Delores was great!! Georgia shines in a few parts and just phones it in for other parts. I have watched it several times for the good stuff, but it saddens me to have to sit through the large amount of crappy stuff. You really never can go back."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Huge Disappointment","review":"I was a huge fan of the series and looked forward to this movie to see what loose ends they would tie up. Sad to say, very few.This movie reminded me of the bad movies of the week they show on Sci-Fi more than anything else. The actors appeared to be sleep walking through their roles and the plot was terrible. The actress playing Daisy had no clue what Daisy was all about and the other regular actors appeared to mainly want to do the movie, get a paycheck and move on to other things.Like someone else has noted in their review, I wanted to turn this off after about 10 minutes, but watched the whole thing in the vain hope it would finally improve.All in all - if you are a fan of the series, skip this movie because it will do nothing but make you cry over how poor a job it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth The Wait","review":"As a fan of the series, I patiently (or not) waited for the release of this movie for a long time. But it was worth it! All the wonderful characters were back (without Rube, of course), and now there's a different actress portraying \\"Daisey\\", but in the end none of that mattered. It was nice to see how most of the characters had evolved, especially \\"George.\\" I was glad to see \\"Reggie\\" get to a place where she could deal with her sister's death and forgive her mother for whatever shortcomings she has. The tear-jerker part at the end almost totally destroyed me. Having just lost my own cat of age-related illness in December, I came completely unstuck when I saw the small \\"reaper\\" take the soul of \\"Murray\\", \\"Delores'\\" beautiful cat. All in all, a well-done continuation of the series and a more satisfying conclusion at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hope there's more Dead Like Me to come...","review":"I miss this show so much!

I loved the series, and even though Mandy Patinkin wasn't in the cast of the movie, I am a huge fan of Lost and was looking forward to seeing Henry Ian Cusick take on the role of Mandy's replacement.The movie is terrible and doesn't do justice to the series. The actress who replaced Laura Harris as Daisy was horribly miscast.

I thought it was brilliant. This movie was awful. I watched a half hour of it and that was a struggle. The acting was terrible. The actress that played Daisy in this movie was all wrong for the part. I was so excited to see this movie. I thought it would be like watching Serenity after the Firefly series went off the air. Boy was I wrong.

Daisy is definitely \\"friendly\\" in the series, but she has a heart and insecurities, and that's why people love her. This movie's version of Daisy doesn't have the heart, and loses her charm.

One of my top ten.Why this movie fails:-Loss of Rube. No characters seemed to even care that he was gone.-Loss of Daisy and replaced by someone doing a bad impression of her.-Dry boring script.-Emotionless dialogue being delivered by cast.- Different locations trying to be passed off as the originals.- Threw out old reaping rules and stomped all over what was set up.- 25 person cat funeral.- Different cinematography didn't match old aesthetic.- Wasn't made for fans, new comers wont enjoy.Just bottom of the barrel production.

George, Mason, Reggie, and Joy are all back, and there's an evil-ish Rube replacement, along with the wrong Daisy, who is both ditzier and easier without being charming.

This movie suffers greatly from lack of imagination. The wonderful characters we came to know in the series are - forgive the pun - ghosts of their former selves. At the end of the series, there were so many questions that could have been explored in a feature length film. Yet, for some reason, the writers decided not to explore anything relevant to the mysteries of life and death. They simply revisited old scenarios (what happens when you break the rules) while ignoring the rules themselves. And they apparently forgot that these characters already existed in the world of \\"Dead Like Me\\" for three years. Did the director even watch the series? I'm so saddened by this (lack of) effort and so sorry that this wonderful cast didn't get the chance they deserved to shine before a whole new audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Fan","review":"I'm a HUGE fan of the Dead Like Me TV series, but I wish I had just never seen this awful movie. There must have been different producers or something, because they tried to make the movie a drama rather than a comedy. This movie lost ALL of Dead Like Me's quirkiness and humor. George Lass basically had no personality in this movie -any personality she did have was REALLY boring - none of those funny narrated side-thoughts she always had in the series. Mason wasn't an alcoholic or a hobo - which made him really BLAH, Roxy wasn't intimidating, Joy had a creepy happiness the entire movie, the actress who played Daisy got her characteristics ALL WRONG, so don't get this movie if you want to keep your good memories of Dead Like Me. The only highlight of the movie was watching Dolores Herbig carry around her cat in a fanny pack at Happy Time.

The plot so shallowly skimmed the surface of interesting that it was something of a relief when a friend accidentally sat on the remote and turned it off. The introduction of a new \\"Rube\\" contradicts insinuations about the workings behind Reapers that were made in the shows. I cannot say enough against this movie. It's painful to see something beautiful diminished. Spare yourself if you haven't seen it. Those of us who have must endeavor to forget."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great series but bad movie","review":"Who is Cameron Kane and where is Ruben? I loved this series but the movie fell flat. They brought back all the original cast but one and never quite answered why or where he was.

This was the first I've heard of the movie. I was not impressed. I thought it was poorly written and the acting was pretty dismal. It could have been so much better. It was not remotely funny, even for dark humor. I would describe this movie as \\"DULL\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie sucks","review":"This film was horrible. It had nothing cool from the original series. A bland attempt to revive the series. What was up with the comic book narration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does the show absolutely no justice","review":"This movie did the original series no justice. It was almost depressing at how badly the movie butchered the original characters as well as the dark humor and depth of the show. The new Daisy was portrayed in almost a laughably bad way and I felt that the plot was stretched thin at best. It almost felt like a Lifetime movie of the week, cue: overly dramatic music and heavy handed direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless.","review":"I was in Barnes and Noble about a few weeks ago and, browsing in the DVD section, came across \\"Dead Like Me\\". I'd never watched the show, but was intrigued. I had the option of buying both seasons, the new movie \\"revival\\" of the series or both seasons PLUS the new movie in one package. I went with the last choice, thinking it was the best deal.Big mistake.I should have just bought the two seasons and enjoyed the heck out of a quirky, affecting, well-written and acted show which just got better with each episode. Instead, I watched those two great seasons and then had to suffer through an abysmal piece of crap movie. Other reviewers here have already described how bad it is -- I can't really add anything to these negative reviews, except to say that even the harshest is probably not harsh enough.Really... save your money and your time. Don't bother with this worthless junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Wanted to Love It. :(","review":"I really did want to love it as i was a huge fan of the show, but it just didn't have the same feel to it. No Rube was a huge letdown and the new daisy was just terrible. Terrible! Delores was great and was probably the highlight of the movie. None of the other characters had the same feel or feeling. It's like they just walked through the motions. Sad to say i just didn't like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is a constipator, Peanut","review":"Bad, bad, BAD!!! As other reviewers have written, I am a HUGE fan of the show, I have watched the series repeatedly on DVD, bought the sets for friends, purchased memorabilia, can quote lines, etc. I have been tracking the progress of the movie on imdb and was so excited to see that the movie was actually coming out. I received it in the mail today and couldn't wait to get home to watch it.I should have watched Two and a Half Men reruns.This is a terrible movie! No Rube, a poor Daisy replacement (should have just killed her off if this was the best that was available), Treo's instead of Post-its, Mason and Roxy called it in, Delores was a delight with the oldest living cat, Murray, no Der Waffle Haus, and many other things that just should NOT have occurred. I would rather have fond memories of the series than the stink that this movie has left.Rube Sofer: \\"You're a constipator, Peanut. You disturb my sh** and that's annoying.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A miss, or more of a farewell...","review":"Very disappointing, the writers and director should be ashamed of taking this witty and poignant series and putting it to its demise. The absence of the \\"real\\" Daisy was a horrible mistake. The whole movie seemed pushed; a let's get it over with feeling. The only good vibe or surprise from the movie was the intro of Murray, the cat and seeing Reggie grown up to be a beautiful young woman. It was good to see all the old faces, minus that of Daisy, but was disheartening overall that it was not what the series was and should still be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fear the Reaper.","review":"When the series died, I was sad. I successfully saw the five stages of grief through to acceptance. And this movie brought me right back around to anger. Somehow, somebody thought it would be a good idea to resurrect it. But this \\"movie\\" isn't the good kind of resurrection. We're talking about a Pet Cemetery, don't mess with the natural order, kind of resurrection. It was a horrible, smelly zombie of it's former self. All of those positive reviews are by people who haven't seen an episode in the three years since the series shuffled off it's mortal coil and have just a vague remembrance of what it once was. If you loved the series as much as I did, you'll do well to avoid this movie like, well, the Grim Reaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"My dad and I are huge Dead Like Me fans and were so excited when we found out this was coming to DVD. What a disappointment.First off the new Daisy was a waste they should have just left her out and maybe brought a new character.Second it wasn't the same without Rube. He really made the show. Mason was funny as always and I liked Roxy, but George was not the same George from the show. This was very boring you couldn't get into it and I kinda just wanted it to end. Anyone who is a true Dead Like Me fan will be upset at this horrible movie.Dolores was not her usual self which sucked cause she was funny. I also wish that they didn't get rid of Der Waffle Haus cause that was just the center of the whole show. The should have just left the show how it ended....sometimes (like in this case) things just should have been left unsaid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Super fan super disappointed.","review":"After just watching the film for the first time with some friends who also really enjoy the show we're disappointed.

There is nothing to redeem this movie. You'll never get those 90 minutes back."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Tragic Mistake","review":"The paramount phrase here is DIRECT TO DVD. It sucked. Really sucked. Did I mention it sucked? Ellen, Jasmine, et al tried to pull it off but the script and directing were so amateurish & substandard that the film failed from frame one. Very few laughs and at times it was boring! The negative should be destroyed in fear of deterring anyone who hasn't watched the clever, well written, and hilarious series."},{"rating":"1","title":"So very disappointing","review":"This movie was just plain bad. I wanted to like it SO much! There was none of the original series \\"feel\\" to it...the story was dumb...the characters didn't seem like themselves and it was all around lame. (let's not even go there with Daisy's replacement...BLAH!) I was very dissapointed in something I was very anxious to see. I almost wish I hadn't bought it...that way I could just pretend the series was done with season two and I could remember everyone as they were. Don't listen to the positive reviews...they are obviously written by people who weren't real fans of good writing and the original series. Seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"okay, but it is lacking","review":"I watched this and I have to say i'm pretty disappointed in what they put out. Everything that made the show great is gone. Daisy is played by someone different that does a horrible job. They should have just left the character out. Rube is also missing which was my favorite character. This greatly hurt the movie for me. Roxie is not mean or tough in this movie. Everyone else did a so so job. The mom was not pissed all the time and seemed happy with her life. This also changed the feeling of the movie. Basically everything is different. I don't know why they decided to make this if they were not going to keep the formula that was great. I read in another review that the only returning character that was good was the herbigs. He is right, they were good, but unfortunatly this does not save the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"the ending should have been the beginning.","review":"The last twenty minutes of this film should have been the first twenty minutes and then gone on from there. I didn't understand why they had to destroy everything from the series and replace it with 'nothing'. George, Roxie and Mason were there and they were the most interesting of the characters. Why did they feel the need to have the Daisey character with a different actress. She could have been explained away with a few word and knowing looks (they all expect to move on unexpectedly) and some new and interesting reapers could have been added. The scenes with george and her sister and then the moment when george was chosen as the head reaper were the only parts that kept the same feeling as the series. It is sad that they felt the need to take a superior idea and story line and turn it into as mediocre TV sitcom to be shown in movie theaters."},{"rating":"1","title":"CRAP!!!! IF YOU ARE A TRUE DEAD LIKE ME FAN STAYWAY!!!!!!","review":"This was in NO (when I say no I mean \\"NO!\\") way the same as the SHOtime TV Series. It is horrible! I can't believe this even got the name \\"dead like me\\". Daisy isn't even daisy anymore. She is now played by an actress that CAN NOT ACT! Half of the crew is not the same. I don't even think George is the same. It's bad, I wish I never seen it. It ruined the show. I have no words on how bad this was. All I want to say is that I want a refund!!!!!Angel a TRUE dead like me fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just about perfect","review":"I will be buying this on release.It stays true to the original show and brings back 95% of the original actors in their original roles.There were touching moments, wonderful moments, wicked moments, and lots of nods to continuity.This is truly the next episode in the series.I hope they don't get cast-type and have good careers in other things but I would love to see a new episode every few years until they finally give the series a good ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME","review":"This is nothing like the TV show. A very poor imitation. The characters had no depth. Just an awful movie. What a waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very odd attempt.","review":"I got the feeling that the writers didn't like the characters of Mason, Daisy, and Roxy. Why else would they write for them these lines and actions? The whole movie for these three characters seems pretty much only a set up for the finishing joke. I think it showed great lack of skill and care to toss the potential of these characters to write them that way. The tightness of the series is wholly lacking in this movie. No momentum, atmosphere, and style we came to love in the series can be found here. Overall, I feel this was a huge missed opportunity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad Follow Up To A Great Show","review":"The actors in this flick would have been well advised not to be part of this poorly written and weak attempt to cash in on what was a great and well written TV series. Mandy Patinkin got it right. He chose not to associate his name with this mess. It was honestly hard to watch actors that I like struggling to make something out of nothing. If you're a fan of the series, do yourself a favor and skip this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vomitously Bad","review":"As I fan of the series I was very excited to see it continued. I haven't been this disappointed by anything in a while (which would indicate my life is going ok, I suppose.).The plot made no sense and all the rules so carefully laid out in the TV series get broken with no consequences, hardly any comment, and no serious consideration. Daisy's character is turned from a nuanced and layered gem to a cheap, idiotic harlequin buffoon. No one should ever be forced to sit through this atrocity. Even trying NOT to hold this sh*t-stain of a film up to the high standards set by the series, I found no redeeming value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money","review":"I loved the original series, it was well written and acted. This movie, however, is HORRIBLE! The characters do things that are completely out of...character. I wanted to ask the writers if they had EVER watched the series. Don't waste your time or money on this utter disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A SHAME!!","review":"First off the new Daisy STINKS!!!! Worst acting EVER!!!!I just recently saw this show on amazon instant video and fell in love with it!! I was sad that there were only 2 seasons!! I got to watch both seasons for free and had to pay 9.99 to rent this online. Well what a waste of money it was!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all there...","review":"This movie was pretty weak over all.The big problem for me was (aside from the absence of Rube and the real Daisy) that there were two competing story lines, but there wasn't enough run time in the movie to really flesh either one out fully.It felt like watching a \\"Cliff Notes\\" version of what a DLM movie should be.It was nice to see the remaining cast again, but if this was intended as a series farewell, they failed completely. And if it was intended as a hook to bring the series back I'm afraid it's far too weak a movie to do that either.If you buy it do so as a completion of the series. Don't do it if you expect huge entertainment value from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"This movie is an insult to the show. The actress that played Daisy destroyed her character and the storyline was average at best. I would have stopped watching this movie after the first 15 minutes if it had been any other movie. Don't waste your money on this movie. If you are a die hard fan and need to see I suggest renting it instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"It was good to see most of the characters back, but it soon becomes obvious that the writing is not the same. The \\"spirit\\" of the original series is forgotten as this new movie explores similar territory George has already challenged. The players behave and react in decidedly uncharacteristic ways to the new challenge put before them and the obscenity-laden language becomes distracting.Fans of the series may be compelled to see it for completeness, but will not be happy. Please rent.Not recommended for anyone new to the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth watching","review":"First off, I have to state the obvious that true fans of the show will likely find this more irritating than closure to the magnificent series.The change in Daisy's character, as previously stated, is disappointing as she did not do a sufficient job and bringing out the true arrogance that is Daisy Adare.Aside from that, the entire premise of the movie is that George reveals her identity to her sister, which was clearly stated (and attempted) in the series previously. In addition, the idea of 'not taking the soul' was used already as well. This movie simply does not coincide with the show that I grew to love.I find it almost shameful that they attempted to make this, bringing almost no new content into it at all. If you liked the series, avoid the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"So glad I rented instead of purchased...","review":"I'm a huge fan of Bryan Fuller and loved the DLM series, watched it over and over and over. So, I was excited to see this film despite the fact that the Daisy character had been recast and Rube was gone. I did NOT realize that Bryan Fuller (the creative force behind the show) was not involved in this project.Because of that, the movie completely lacked the charm, dark wit, and poignancy that made the show so wonderful. It was a straight-up BUMMER.Rent it before you make the plunge - it may not be what you are hoping for! I'm really glad I didn't spend any money on it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You can't go home","review":"OK, I was a huge fan of the Showtime series and I was super excited when I read there was going to be a full length movie. Movie versions of TV shows are rarely as good as you remember, but I had high hopes for this project, since most of the original cast was reprising their roles, however this film is another example of should have let the show live in our memories and on DVD. Callum Blue as Mason was as deviantlly charming as ever and Jasmine Guy, as Roxie was perfect, but the rest of the cast seemed like they were sleep walking through a painful script, made even more painful by the absence of Mandy Patinkin. Of course I had to see it, and I guess half-hearted Dead Like Me is better than none at, but I secretly wish they would have left well enough alone. I say see it if you were a fan of the show, skip it and just get the series on DVD if you just want some great TV."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved The Series ..... The Movie, Not So Much","review":"The series Dead Like Me, had a genuine charm to it, it was funny and it was sad and it left me caring about the characters in it. I loved the series, the movie left me feeling like I'd been ripped off. Aside from the fact that it didn't have Rube in it and they changed the actress that played Daisy, the movie felt like something they just threw together to make some money off of people who missed the series. I wouldn't be in a rush to see another sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible disappointment","review":"A friend and I are big fans of the show and were excited about getting the movie. We invited another friend of ours who had never seen the show to come watch the movie with us. We sat there stunned at how awful this movie was, not just in general but also compared to the series. Why would they do this to such a great brand? The plot was awful, the actors were phoning in their roles, there was little or no character development - I mean it was awful.If you're a fan of the series, don't bother with this movie because you'll just be disappointed. If you're not a fan of the series, go rent the series instead of getting this movie. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as the series, but a good continuation","review":"If you are going to watch this movie, it is probably because you are a big fan of the short-lived television series. The movie, unfortunately, does not fully live up to the level of the tv show, most likely because they waited so long afterward to make it. Plus, not having Rube in the movie is definitely a hard pill to swallow, as well as having a different actress playing Daisy.Nevertheless, it does have the same base as the show, and it is nice to have something to continue a bit of what the show left out in the open. It is definitely worth watching if you are a DLM fan, but don't expect to be blown away by it, just take it for what it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really disappointing","review":"I loved the TV series (especially the 2nd season). If you are a fan, please don't even bother seeing the movie. Bryan Fuller had nothing to do with it (and it shows). The story doesn't really go anywhere and revolves around a new character (no Mandy Patinkin, so no Rube). I don't really fault the actors, the story was horrible and horribly written. It did not feel like \\"Dead Like Me\\" at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth watching, but not perfect","review":"I thought this was more like an extended episode than a movie, but that's ok as I loved the show and really was looking more for a similar feel.What's good? The story is great as is the return of George, Mason, Roxxie, Delores, Reggie and Georgie's Mom. They seemed to slip right back into their characters without much problem and I liked the ride.What's bad? Daisy. The new actress playing Daisy just doesn't feel like Daisy. At least there weren't many scenes with her. Also the new boss is just annoying. Not enough information about him really.Good and Bad? Missing Rube, but it's necessary for the storyline so I didn't mind it so much.All in all, it was a good trip and worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you liked S1 and S2 stay away from the movie.","review":"Pass on the movie it is nothing like the TV series. Poorly written, if this was their hope of returning the series to TV they missed the mark completely. Characters were completely out of character from S1 and S2. If you liked the TV series don't buy this and think you are getting a movie of the same caliber."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS SUCKS","review":"loved the series but HATE this movie....i can deal with it not having the pizzazz as the series but OMG..who in the world cast that chick as Daisy....she SUCKS!!!! royally....she brings down the whole show...it almost as painful as watching Maria Bello play Evy on the mummy 3......if you have a star that just killed a role and just cant be replaced then just don't bother....remove the character and replace it with a new one instead of casting these actresses that just ruin the show for everybody"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a sad ending for a good series","review":"Often a movie is a good place to find closure for a series canceled by the networks.

Mason was flat out dumb as a stick, not in the playful way he was throughout the first two seasons. The new Daisy was just awful, I don't get why she was walking and talking like a weirdo, she was obviously uncomfortable playing that role. The new boss, no character development for him, can't even remember his name. I actually got angry after watching this because it was a terrible way to close the series and I just felt like I wasted my time. The only parts I really liked were with Reggie and George but even that wasn't really developed and played out as it should've been.

Clever, smart, with well-developed, deep characters. Fans hoping for more closure (the last episode of season 2 actually did an OK job of giving some closure) will leave this feeling sadly disappointed. The characters in this movie have extremely little in common with their counterparts in seasons 1 and 2. They're like poor caricatures of their former selves. It really went against everything that was built up in the previous two seasons of the series. Actions and decisions just were totally inconsistent with the characters. I actually can't believe that the original writers came up with this. If I wasn't such a fan of the series, there's no way I would have watched this entire movie. And I should add that the whole time I was wishing that I'd never started watching it, and did not know of its existence. It is THAT bad.

Absolute rubbish and an insult to a viewer's intelligence. Where do the maker's get off in substituting characters with other actresses (Daisy) and totally replacing Rube. I'd rather the show ended at season 2 than be left with this movie drivel. Wouldn't recommend that anyone waste their money buying this stupid movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something good completely ruined","review":"I just finished watching the first two seasons of Dead Like Me and I enjoyed the series very much; however, don't expect this 'movie' to be the next installment of the series. I'll be honest - I didn't watch the entire thing...mainly because I couldn't since it was butchered. For starters, you can't replace a main character...Daisy Adair..and throw in somebody else who looks and acts very slightly like her. ...Then you can't just say that Rube is just gone (saw his lights) and throw in some new cheesy Europen-looking guy as the head honcho.... and even first thing say the waffle house burned down. These points alone destroyed the show a decent amount...2/5 main characters gone just like that.

Very disappointing... just shouldn't have made it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I loved the show, this movie, not so much.......","review":"I really enjoyed the show, and I have both seasons on DVD. The dynamic found in the original cast was so strong and enjoyable to watch. However, this movie simply showed the gap left when key actors decided to chase other projects, and not participate in this movie. Oh yeah, I found, the substitution of a new actress to play \\"Daisy\\" was a VERY bad move, as the original actress brought subtle nuances to the role that could not be replaced by simply inserting another actress into the role.Heck, I could moan about how disappointed this movie left me all day, but that won't help anyone who is thinking of wasting their money on this dead dog (as I did). So, I'll just say this; \\"Life after Death\\" is a perfect candidate for a \\"Netflix\\" rental however, I found it a dismal, and disappointing purchase. My advice is rent this flick, if you disagree with me, go ahead and buy it.

Well, shame on me for not taking the time to actually read the reviews. And shame on MGM for producing such third-rate drivel.I will not comment on the actors, actress and technical staff who made the movie. That the movie was a flop was, to give them the benefit of the doubt, probably because of the junk they were given to work with.

All of the characters are developed, evolved and interesting. The film presents a mix of the original series comically dark edge with a new underlaying sadness and acceptance of being a reaper. The latest DLM deserves a film on DVD each month or a re-birth of the series on television. The DVD includes Ellen Muth (George) and the director doing commentary, which is well worth hearing. I watched the film 3 times (once with the commentary) and can confidently state that fans will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dead Like Me: Life beyond the network.","review":"I doubt that the boys (& girls) in the back or boardrooms of the networks will ever be able to see past their short sighted ratings goals, where mammon means everything, & truly original televison at the bleeding edge of dark humour can so easily fall victim to the whims of those blinkered exec's in the bowels of TVLand, who are truly lacking in vision.Just as 'Firefly' had to be rounded off by the making of 'Serenity,' maybe 'DLM: Life After Death' is just some more unfinished business which was needed in order to put the show to rest, before the viewing public can move on again?I only hope that there is still room left at the end of the film to allow for a series 3, 4, 5, & 6 maybe?Wishful thinking, but then some wishes do come true."},{"rating":"2","title":"St. Brigid Cross","review":"Abstracted design captures the feeling of the original rushes, better than those that try and duplicate the real thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't find St Brigid's Cross in Silver in Ireland","review":"I heard the story of St Brigid years ago, my first visit to Ireland. My last trip I looked for it in sterling silver and couldn't find it. I can't believe I found this on Amazon. The cut is precise and just a perfect size. I bought a 20\\" chain as well and they are perfect together. A great buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely, great buy","review":"This is an example of an item that can be nearly impossible to find in a \\"brick and mortar\\" shop but is available in many colors and sizes on Amazon! I recommend this specific piece because it is the perfect size and weight for regular or everyday wear, and is very nicely crafted and durable, especially considering the relatively low price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mike Oldfield - Tres Lunas","review":"Well, you have to be an Oldfield fan to appreciate his music, and I am one. From that point of view, I believe this is a good piece. I enjoyed it. His music is not \\"ordinary\\" New Age material. He's progressive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but Pedantic","review":"Bowman's book is important for the careful detail it provides on past philosophical theories of music. But his book has three major weaknesses. Bowman's exhaustive detail is second only to his heavy, exhausting, pedantic style. (There is no life in Bowman's writing; no joy; no expression. How ironic in a book about music!). Next, his book omits to discuss most contemporary philosophers of music. Why? This is a curious and disappointing omission which makes his book far less valuable than it could have been. Good for him (and bad for us, I think) because Bowman's omissions allow him to sidestep all the difficult (but interesting and valuable) challenges that come from thinking critically about philosophical discourse in the present day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice new dog owner book","review":"This book is a great all-around new dog owner book. For those who have had a dog before, it might be a bit basic. I thought the information specific to Weimaraners was lacking. It was an easy read, though. A great bathroom book. :) I really enjoyed learning about the history of the breed and more details from The Essential Weimaraner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great recorder, If I could get it to work.","review":"I purchased this voice recorder to use to record school lectures and spend a considerable amount of time researching which recorder that I wanted. This recorder is compact, sleek, is MP3 compatible and has ample memory for my needs. However, I was unable to download my recordings onto my computer either through the Diasonic software or XP's device manager. Eventually the whole unit stopped working. Also, I had to take the batteries out even when it was off or they would be drained when I went to use them. The recording and microphone quality was excellent, but I could not queue forward or backward during playback. When I tried to contact customer service, I found that it is made from a company in Korea and I was unable to contact anyone to help me. It does come with a 1 year warranty, but it sure would be nice if you didn't have to use it. I definitely would never buy from this company again. I'm going with an Olympus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does this company still exist?","review":"I do not know if the company still exists, but good luck trying to find out.

Kelly writes with honesty and intelligence, allowing readers to accompany him on his journeys into combat with his fellow Marines. Kelly recalls stories of heroism and horror from Vietnam that will move the most jaded military historian. His stories of life away from combat provide humour and relief from the ever-present tension of the war. In DMZ Diary the author reveals his transformation from a gung-ho new guy to a seasoned veteran. The story of this transformation is an important addition to the history of the American experience in Vietnam."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOP NOTCH. GREAT BOOK FOR A GIFT.","review":"LOTS OF USEABLE INFO HERE. THE CHAPTERS ARE SHORT, PUNCHY AND INFORMATIVE AND THE TEXT NEVER BECOMES TEDIOUS.

I could not put the book down in some instances. Gene Wilder has some great stories to tell about Hollywood. Hopefully, one day he will write about all his stories dealing with Hollywood in more detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the better autobiographies I have read","review":"I really enjoy biographies and I really enjoy comedians- so this book seemed like a no-brainer for me. I was pleasantly surprised at how well Wilder writes. Obviously he is a creative guy based on his profession, but that does not always translate to being a good writer and story teller. Some biographies are ghost written and you hear only the echo of the author's voice and life through the intermediary, but that is not the case here. I read this book and I could hear Gene Wilder narrating the whole story to me and the stories all seemed real and genuine. This was a fun book that was well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Look at Gene Wilder the Person","review":"Anybody can get get a hint of who Gene Wilder is by examining his work and the roles that he has assumed. However, writing a memoir has allowed Wilder to be himself. He speaks to the experiences which have shaped him, and their formative impact on his life and work.My favorite parts were the moments when Wilder was affectionate with Gilda Radner. You can also expect the occasional chuckle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It","review":"I am a big fan and love all his movies.The book is great,I would recommend it to any true fan.Loved It !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book really made me just feel, ya know?!","review":"I grew up lovin this mofo and now I do even more as a grown man. This book is beautiful and I don't ever say dumb stuff like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst autobiography I've ever read","review":"I suppose I should've known by the book's title that Wilder was playing his cards close to the chest when he wrote the book. It's mostly about his career. His disclosure about his life comes out in tidbits and, at times, feel inconsequential. There's a part where he mentions his dad died then goes on about his career like it was no more than a cold day. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because there were some interesting insights into working with Richard Pryor and Gilda Radner, but the book could've been much deeper. The guy has been a brilliant actor. But there are parts of his life he doesn't want to show the public, I get that, and if you're okay with that then read it. Otherwise, put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkable.","review":"I think this is a beautiful book. I have only ever seen Gene Wilder in one movie (Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory) so I definitely did not know anything about him when I picked up \\"Kiss Me Like A Stranger.' Straight away I was transfixed. I felt his warmth and his heart bouncing off the pages, he made me feel for him and I kept reading hoping and praying for a 'happy ending'. I admire the way he is so candid and so honest...and perhaps he leaves things out that others believe should be in there (I wouldn't know as I know nothing about him other that what I have read in his book) but I believe what he does share tells a lot and that we cannot ask for more. He seems like a witty, gentle, soft man and I thoroughly enjoyed his book. I would recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I'd hoped","review":"I had high hopes for this book. I really like Gene Wilder, and was hoping for a more in-depth reflection on his life. Instead, I read a lot of prattle about acting techniques, his insecurities about women, and very brief chapters that stop just when I felt like it was about to get really interesting, particularly his younger years. It's a fact that people tend to lessen their own responsibility for unpleasant situations, but it really felt like a much younger person who hasn't gained the kind of wisdom we look for in a man Wilder's age. It was self-aggrandizing and overall not worth the short amount of time it took to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"gene is mean to gilda","review":"i read this book because i wanted to learn more about gildas cancer and how gene supported her. i learned he was horrid and it broke my heart. she was dying and loved him yet he could only think of himself. egotistic little man. made me cry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good text but there is not pictures enough","review":"It is a very good text book for bachelor degree level, but, the book could be better if the pictures were designed again with powered tools.

A few of the songs would be good had they been recorded by the current band or an earlier addition, but 90% of these are embarrasingly bad. I do however like the song Brothers of the Road even though it isn't very much like the ABB (atleast it doesn't have the dreaded synth that actually appear on this album). But overall this is a real dud. If you are interested in something from their 1st reunion try the excellent Enlightened Rouges (1979). Or you can get something from their 1990s reunion years, all of which are top notch (4 or 5 stars each)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Allman Brothers become Doobie Brothers -- yech!","review":"With this album, Arista had what it wanted -- it's own version of the Doobie Brothers. But to this day, the band HATES this album, and so do most of its fans. The songs are bland, there are no guitar workouts (and what's an Allman album without long solos?) and you'll have to block your ears every time a dreaded synthesizer is heard. The Brothers broke up after this, and that's no surprise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lional trains","review":"The DVD did not work I e mail you. About this problem could you please send me a new on our credit my accountRod baldus"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a book about Corpsmen.","review":"This book is a find for any Corpsman, or anyone who served as a Corpsman, with the Marines. There's little written about the unsung heroes that have given lives while saving them - and this book is a tribute to their memory, as well as the Marines that they stood with.The book itself was riveting - I couldn't put it down - and as a former FMF Corpsman, I found it very realistic. Many people don't realize the intensity of what a Corpsman trains for when they work with the Marine Corps - it's a different world. I recently re-read the book, and found it even more compelling the second time around.The author manages to bring the camraderie into the book without stifling the story. This is a modern anwer to Stephen Crane's 'The Red Badge of Courage'.This is a book about heroes, and the men that they really are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as it appears","review":"I purchased this product on March 17th. I didn't receive it until the end of the first week of April. When it arrived the balls were either blue or orange. NOT the \\"traditional billiard ball colors\\" as the description reads.

Other than that, excellent product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product, a bit small","review":"I ordered this for my boyfriend, a student in school who needed a quality, professional looking briefcase type backpack. He loves it. The quality is well done, but you can't really fit a lot of books in there. I would say one laptop and maybe 3 text books (Small to Med size) fit nicely in there.

I bought the EXACT same unit from Sam's Club for $149.99.I brought it home and it does do exactly what it says, but the motor is really noisey (in the room and through the speaker on the handset).The camera piece is also huge. I mean there is no hiding this thing.The handset feels cheap and is all plastic. The screen is ok, but I really didn't see much color in it, even in fully lit room.Summary: Don't do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"I bought this monitor because I like the features it had. I does not work with batteries. I installed brand new batteries twice and the thing didnt work for more than a day. I don't know if its just a defect or it sucks up too much evergy. I have to plug it in, which defeats the purpose because I wanted to take it around with me, especially outside. It also make to much noise, too much interference and the sound quality is not good. I can barely hear my son cry over the interfernce. I can only use it pugged in, and only to see of he is standing up in his crib. Every other feature does not work. Not worth the money at all!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the postage","review":"What a joke. I have never seen a book this badly written, with such outdated information. It is obvious the the author believes all marital problems are the fault of the husband / man. Their contention that men can't be victims of domestic violence is obtuse. The idea that if the woman withholds sex, cooking or the children, or talking bad to the children about her husband it is usually the fault of the man is unfounded and prejudicial against men. Don't waste your money on this book unless you have an outhouse (the one place the pages from this book may be useful.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Seeing","review":"This movie starts out a little self-consciously with some gratuitous violence and T&A.; But it soon hits its campy stride. With Matt Frewer (LawnmowerMan 2) thoroughly enjoying his campy-evil bad guy role as Max Durbin,\\"Durbin, you're not God.\\"\\"Yes, I know I'm not God...(sly smile)...not yet.\\"C. Thomas Howell is hilarious as the billard cue wielding particle physicist, \\"Go ahead, ask me about any particle!\\"All these characters are aboard a Cryogenic Transport in orbit above an ecologically devastated earth. There is a plan involving the Hubble and a solar flare to fix the Earth (don't ask).This movie was fun to watch, I recommend it to open-minded Sci-Fi fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great, if you are unschooling","review":"While the book does have lots of information and answers many questions, it is told pretty much entirely from a secular point of view. It is heavily supportive of the \\"unschooling\\" method of homeschooling, and beyond giving brief definitions of each, it barely mentions other methods. It is highly critical of using pre-packaged, or even structured, curricula. While not outright saying it, \\"school-at-home\\" homeschooling is painted as inferior, burdensome, overly restrictive, unnatural, and barely preferable over public school. I did, however, find the chapter concerning socialization to include helpful information and arguments to ease a parent's anxiety about how a homeschooled child can and does learn socialization."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous French songs about life, death and love","review":"I love this CD. I bought it when I was in France during the week that we went to war with Iraq, and the songs now seem like a soundtrack to the many protests and marches that I saw and occasionally became swept up in. No singer/songwriter in the U.S. has written a song about 9-11 like \\"Manhattan-Kaboul,\\" which describes the similarities between a Puerto-Rican man who died in the Twin Towers, and an Afghani girl who died in her bombed-out village in Afghanistan. Other songs focus on Renaud's battle with his dark side (Doctor Renaud, Mr. Renard), his daughter's coming of age (Elle a vu le loup), and even his dog (Baltique). This CD is especially valuable for students of French who want to pick up some expressions in Parisian street slang. I'm not familiar with Renaud's earlier work, but this CD holds its own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Renaud' s best work","review":"It is true that Renaud has changed since his career reached its apogy during the early to mid 1980s, nevertheless the album 'Boucan d'enfer' offers an in dept exploration of the enigmatic soul and lifestyle of an artist for whom I have always had a great level of admiration. The songs in this album (mostly balads)revolve around his battle with alcoholism, his decision to withdraw from the world and hide-out in seedy Parisian cafés and the departure of his wife of over twenty years.It is a rather stark and sinistre album that fans who have come to know Renaud's life and ideologies throught his music will definitely enjoy. The only up-tempo song featured on this album is the radio-friendly 'Manhattan-Kabul' duet with french singer Axelle Red. The song reminds us of a not so distant period (Fall 2001-winter 2002) where the entire world (oh yes... even the French!) expressed their compassion and sympathy towards the United States of America.Definitely worth listening to ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rebel without a cause","review":"I have a lot of sympathy for RENAUD who used to be one the greatest french songwritter of the 80's.And I hate the word that I'm gonna use to describe him but he really is an \\"has been\\".This album is a caricature of what he used to be, he when through very hard times in his personnal life, and some people come back stronger from those times, but unfortunetaly, Renaud doesn't.So, if you are not familiar with RENAUD and are willing to discover him, listen to his early recordings-Marche a l'ombre, amoureux de paname,...and you will discover a real rebel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Mom","review":"Debra Borden writes charmingly of life in Jersey suburbia. A 45-year-old woman with two teenagers who are growing up fast, this mom comes to terms with herself and her family by the end of the book. My favorite scenario occurs over Passover dinner when Julie, the protagonist, gives Viv the Heimlich maneuver. She is not satisfied there however and tries to do the same to others, leading her loving husband and son to give her a shirt emblazoned with the letters, \\"HM\\" for Heimlich Mom. This book is endearing and a fun read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lucky Me","review":"A fast, very predictable read. It was enjoyable but did not have any punch. The characters were, for me, without merit. The excerpt I read in a magazine, prior to buying the book was much more promising than the full read. Typical Jewish humor I guess, self absorbed and simple."},{"rating":"2","title":"LUCKY ME","review":"It was nice to finally read a piece of fiction where the heroine didn't have to battle kidnappers, drug addictions, or mad serial rapists. It's a heartwarming tale about one woman, used to living the routine life, finding herself wrestling with a series of unexpected and sometimes outright-funny events. It's life in the real world, situations that could -- and do -- happen to all of us. It's the real world, cover to cover. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lucky Me...I checked this book out from the library","review":"I did not enjoy this book at all and I generally like the \\"stressed out mom dealing with changes\\" theme in books. I couldn't develop sympathy for the mom over any of the things she was worked up about...panic attacks, daughter with a professor, teenage son having sex. It was sad her mother had cancer, but any part of the storyline related to that issue came part & parcel with very boring and tedious to read backstory.I noticed this book is featured in this month's Redbook magazine. This can only be the result of some excellent PR person."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Writing","review":"The book is well written and will grab you in from the beginning.

Dry Water is the home of two of the planets most dangerous practitioners of the psychic arts, and both are convinced for differing reasons, that Larry will destroy the world if they don't destroy him - and Larry's only hope is to find the water that can't be drunk before they do.I enjoyed this novel. Larry is a likeable character, and his rivals in magic are both crazy and dangerous. This is not a thick novel, with really deep characterisations, but it has a good flow and and interesting story line with the concept of a place like Dry Water quite appealing in its way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry Water","review":"An initially promising plot and use of magic faded into unreadability with the use of plodding, mundane language and a lack of deep characterization."},{"rating":"2","title":"The biggest little book I've ever read","review":"There is more compressed into this novel than in any other fantasy I've ever read, and I've been a fan for forty years. Poul Anderson's sf novel The Boat of a Million Years covers as broad a span of history, but in three times the pages and half the complexity. Charles de Lint and Terri Windling have defined contemporary mythic fiction for me, but I was even more bowled over by this book than I was by The Little Country. For creatively dramatizing the complexities in the mythic war of good and evil, Nylund rivals Clive Barker.From the strength of his writing skill, imagery, and characterization, I believe I'll like Eric Nylund's other books too, although I don't expect the rest of them to be like this one; he does say that this is inspired by Roger Zelazny.I don't have space in my small room for keeping many books, but this is a keeper. It's worth hunting down a used copy. Hope that the publishers wise up and reprint it."},{"rating":"2","title":"a compex fantasy about good intensions and their results","review":"This is a very good novel. Basically, it could be called urban fantasy, allthough, it shouldn't be, considering that the action takes place in a small town in New Mexico.So, it should be rural fantasy, I think.This is not unlike the works of Tim Powers and James P. Blaylock.So, if you like them - give \\"Dry water\\" a shot.I found the main character sympathetic, allthough the romantic storyline was rather perfunctory. But the magic IS there in this novel, as are some interesting persons (not all of them alive), and the story of the antagonist, when told, rises interesting points.This book has intelligence, controlled lightnings and one annoying, though good-natured ghost - what more do you need?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Lamb's best... but good nonetheless.","review":"Lamb is a wonderful, unique sounding group. Deep drum & bass beats lie underneath beautiful melodies... and Louise has an incredibly raw-sounding voice.Their third album, \\"What Sound\\", while a good album, pales in comparison to their first two. If you are already a fan, than i do reccommend it... but if this is to be your first Lamb purchase, i recommend their first, self-titled album.The second disc in one of the versions of the Australian double disc import contains 5 remixes of songs from their earlier albums... they're pretty good, and well worth the extra cost of the import.(And if you can find it, the single CD for \\"Gabriel,\\" the first single off of the new album \\"What Sound,\\" has a really fun dance remix of the song... well worth it!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"This CD is a tasteful blend of electronica, trip-hop and sometimes drum & bass. Lou Rhodes's vocals and lyrics accompanying Andy Barlow's ingenious compositions result in a beautiful musical journey.Buy this album, not the UK version or others. This contains extra tracks such as \\"Written\\", a similarly exquisite track as \\"What Sound\\", the magnificient \\"Neelie Hooper Remix\\" of \\"Gabriel\\", the jazzy \\"The Night Has A Thousand Eyes\\", and the ethereal piano instrumental \\"Blessing In Disguise\\". I personally love them because they compensate for the songs in the original record that I skip, like \\"Scratch Bass\\" and \\"Sweetheart\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very emotional Trip Hop Cd","review":"This is an extreme work of art I love this cd. It took me a while to get to it, but it has become a cult favorite. After \\"Fear of Fours\\" I began to doubt there abilities because it sounded like Demon Music. But this cd is a beautiful work of art. With producer like Guy Sigsworth (Bjorks Producer.) how can you go wrong. If you are looking for other quality trip hop artist with emotion look for Mandalay,Santessa and Airlock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah but...SHE CAN'T SING!","review":"Look, I'm the first one in line to jump around extolling the virtues of not-so-well-known artists and bands, because there is so much great music to be found, but this is one that suffers from something that should have been nipped in the bud way back in the recording phase.The singer is OUT OF TUNE people!The music production and inventiveness here is quite good, but that's it.Someone like Madonna might barely squeak by with her little voice, but this is worse; even the vocal HARMONIES are out of tune! What does that tell you?Lose the singer, because no amount of electrnic wizardry can cover up this laughably weak voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"I discovered LAMB when I first heard 'Gabriel', a great song. So I decided to buy the album. I was hardly impressed. Its very depressing, and all the tracks are pale compared to Gabriel, my favourite track. Its frustrating to listen to, as there is some garbage Electronica in between the emotional moody songs. So you do need to skip often if you're not into that. Also, it sounds so much like the groups of that genre (Bjork,Potrishead,etc.) you hardly get the feeling you're listening to an original artist. If you have Gabriel through a comp CD, dont buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Version of Rumi","review":"For quite a few years, this was the most accessible version of Rumi's Masnavi available on the market. The language is dated, almost Victorian, which may put off some readers who are burned out on works in the style of Fitzgerald's \\"Omar Khayyam.\\" Also, it is an abridgement, and Whinfield will at times collapse large portions of the work into a half page.On the whole, though, for the general reader the work doesn't suffer much from these two possible shortcomings. Rumi's unique, teasing genius comes through on almost every page, challenging the reader to look at everyday things from a different viewpoint. Whinfield's notes are sufficient without being intrusive.I read this version several years ago, and as I find that Rumi is best appreciated in small portions, I still like to keep the book handy as bedside reading. Whatever your opinion on Rumi, whether skeptical or reverent, you will enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Training Material for MSP","review":"I have several other MSP training products (video and printed) and Getting Results is by far the best of the lot. Charlie goes beyond just explaining the features of MSP, giving real world and useful examples on how to get the most out of the product. He not only covers the basics, but gets into more complex areas too. His writing style is easy to follow, as well as entertaining. Getting Results is great for both learning MSP when starting out and as a reference manual as you become more experienced.I purchased Getting Results back for MSP 5.0 and Charlie has always updated his book along with every new major revision (and the cost is very minimal to upgrade to the latest version of his book). A highly recommended book (plus the companion CD is worth the price only)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Pro tips for everyone","review":"I bought this CD Rom on a chance but am really pleased with the contents.Many really good tips I would never of thought of in a easy not to technical explanation, although that doesn't mean its all for beginners.The only thing would be if this was produced as a real paper book I would be willing to pay the extra."},{"rating":"1","title":"does not work at all","review":"my boat is a 18 ft open bow with a 4cyl. i purchased this anchor for a \\"20 foot and up in 15 mph winds\\". well it wont hold my boat still with no wind and a 3mph current! waste of steel. waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Giovanni","review":"The cast is excellent!

ANOTHER Tomb Raider....","review":"This game was just.... how can I say... TERRIBLE! The onlydecent TR was TR2! The series just got old after that. This gamedoesn't even deserve 1 star!

The only reason I left one star out was because, the enemies are to evil and violent and scary sort of but the overall game is very good! The controls may not be easy to some people but it is easy to me and those who think they aren't easy they need to get used to it a little more and they will think it is easy. The levels are exotic. The levels are beautiful and great to explore. One Perfect level that is beautiful to me is \\"Temple Of Posiedon\\" Nice, waterfalls, nice graphics overall it is great. This game is perfect to add to your collection, if you are not worried about the \\"terrifying evil from beyond the grave.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"One of the most popular playstation game character's has arrived again with another great tomb raider game. This is one of my favourite games and is definitely one of the hardest games on playstation. This is the last and hardest tomb raider game on playstation. It has excellent 3d graphics and realistic backgrounds.There are many fun levels in this game including the train level, car level, and many other levels. Me and my friends love this game!

Graphically superior, audio about the same but fun wise the original Tomb Raider still gets my vote. It seems as though the Tomb Raider series has been in decline since the first game. TR2 was o.k., TR3 was atrocious and quite boring. Last Revelation is a slight improvement but I'm really tired of pushing blocks and throwing levers. The first couple of levels are interesting because the training is no longer performed on the castle grounds. Do yourself a favor, rent the Last Revelation or play the original title. Hopefully this is the last edition in a series that is really begining to show its age."},{"rating":"1","title":"TLR - Beating a dead horse.","review":"If you've already played Tomb Raider II and/or III, don't bother with this game.

Earlier in the game, there are some really innovative ideas, such as a level that takes place on a moving train, creatures that can only be killed by water, etc., but there is zero imagination once you get to the pyramids levels. The ending is not in the slightest bit challenging and is completely anticlimactic--there isn't even a final boss! Wait until TLR goes into the bargain bin along with the rest of series if you really need to play it. Otherwise, just buy Tony Hawk's Pro Skater...tons more fun for your money..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run -- don't walk -- FROM Tomb Raider","review":"As the Microsoft logo on the opening screen would leat you to guess, this game was clearly a simple PORT of a computer version to Dreamcast. True to all previous Tomb Raider games, the controls seem to be deliberately botched. It shouldn't take ten minutes of backing up and approaching a lever in order to find the one-pixel hotspot that allows you to interact with it. Furthermore, the graphics are dreadful. The Resident Evil and House of the Dead teams did a great job making use of the DC's awesome rendering capabilities. But not CODE, who couldn't even do as good a job as Quake 1 for the PC.

It seems to work very well. My complaint is that the company (and Amazon) will not ship it to Puerto Rico, a part of the United States. To be fair, it is not alone in Amazon in treating the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico as if it were a foreign country. Many do. But I have complained many times and get no response. If any product can be shipped to Hawaii or Alaska, it should be able to be shipped to Puerto Rico. It is the same US Postal Service or the same UPS company.

It also explores the theme of the intimate relationships gay men often have with their straight women friends. It introduces three different gay adolescents who confront their sexuality very differently, thus avoiding obvious gay cliches and presenting a range of experiences each very interesting it its own way.

I just thought he was getting too old or his condition deteriorated beyond the help of supplements. I researched the issue and found an article about a ConsumerLab study on joint supplements for humans and dogs. The article stated that ConsumerLab's analysis of Nutri-Vet's Hip & Joint supplements hadn less than half the amount of glycosamine as stated on the lable, and less than one percent of the amount of chondroitin.

This book tells a fictional story centered around Ali, Nino, and their families and friends during a period of war.

This reads like a book dutifully churned out because another 'Brunetti' was due. It never gets beneath the surface. There are plenty of excellent elements -- the central idea, tracing through 'blood diamonds' & what happens to them -- is really good. But it is never used properly. We get a lot of Venetian atmosphere, true -- but not much else. Even if it meant leaving Venice for a bit, surely the central point could've been followed through.And why do Paola & Brunetti react to the Italian situation as an American left-winger would? They are supposed to be Italians. Would they really worship & revere the State as American left-wingers do?Disappointing. Please just work out a proper plot, Ms Leon, next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected More","review":"I was looking forward to blissfully soaking myself in a good old-fashioned cloak and dagger novel, but initially found this one a little tepid. More used to the rat-a-tat pace of the American crime caper, or the sinister undercurrents of the English countryside, it took me a while to get used to the well-read, genial hero of this Venetian mystery.Guido Brunnetti, devoted family man and lover of good food, is a far cry from the stereotypical hard-boiled, macho cop hero. The story is well written, with a thought-provoking plot that takes time to unravel.My main quibble is that our hero is reduced to being a frustrated witness when the final pieces of the puzzle fall into place. Neither he, nor the reader, has the satisfaction of declaring whole-heartedly, \\"Case closed!\\" Still, I think the series holds promise. Next time, I might try one of the better-reviewed books of Ms. Leon's like, \\"Doctored Evidence\\" or \\"Uniform Justice\\".

For christmas 3-4 years ago my mom (who got sick of listening to me) bought me this timer. I was so happy that it was attractive as well as useful. But it is not as useful as it is attractive.It takes forever to set, you have to let it blink for 8 seconds through the hours then 8 second in the minutes and if you get distracted adding an ingredient while your waiting then you have to wait all over again, and DON't touch the dial or bump the timer while you wait because it will sometimes add 9 to the hours spot and I don't always notice and then you will wonder why the timer hasn't gone off yet.Mind you have put up with it for 3-4 years bacause it does work, but I just hate using it. So irritating. II am finally fed-up and buying a new timer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst. Timer. Ever.","review":"The engineering on this timer (or lack thereof), is ridiculous. There is no way to just pick the thing up and set the time you want. You have to first activate the dial, then ......wait. If you don't want to set the hours (just minutes) this involves waiting until it cycles to the minutes. If you make one false move you have to start over, there is no correcting it. If you pick the timer up once it is set, often the screen will go blank. Other times, when you pick it up to set it, you have to clear it first because it will show a random hour.No one wants to stand there and wait while they're working around in the kitchen and busy multi-tasking. Even if you're not busy, the timer is flat out annoying to use. I would never buy this timer again and will be tossing it in the trash as soon as I find another one that was engineered with some common sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"ehhh, not so user friendly","review":"I hate to say that this timer is difficult to use, maybe just not user friendly is a better term.

When I'm cooking, I usually have a few things going, and this just seems to waste my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"Not the quality I expected from KitchenAid. This timer has several problems.1) It's difficult to set the time. There is only one minutes button which increases the minutes but not decreases. Miss your time and you have to start again or go around the clock.2) You have to hold the buttons down for FOUR seconds before they auto-repeat. Too long!3) It's not very loud, and the crappy non-alkaline battery that comes with it doesn't help matters. Dump it and put a better one in.4) The display occasionally gets corrupted and the unit hangs. At this point I have to remove/insert the battery.C'mon KitchenAid! You can do better than this... or can you?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kitchenaid can do better","review":"My kitchen is all Kitchenaid so of course I had to have this, but as other commenters said - they can do better. It's a pain to set, it's angle is awkward and you have to be right in front of it to see the display and at the right angle (I'm short). And the beep isn't that loud. There's no clock in it either. The metal band around the outer rim corroded too so it doesn't look nice anymore.I have a non-Kitchenaid timer that's got the clock, 2 timers, a button to set H/M/S seperately, and shows you how long it's been since you missed the beep that beeps for over a minute. I use this one more. (I think it's an older West Bend model)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very \\"quiet\\" timer.....","review":"A nice heavy timer, but even when I put it in the same room that I'm in, I usually do not hear the timer if there is any other sound going on - voices, TV, radio, etc. I've had two other timers - that eventually wore out from use - I rate this below average."},{"rating":"1","title":"STUPID user interface","review":"The timer looks nice, and the setting ring is indeed made of nice heavy cast metal. But the way that you set it is STUPID: you start by twisting the ring. This wakes it up, and makes the HOUR numbers start flashing. Now you can set the HOURS. But how many times do you want to set a kitchen timer for more than an hour? To get to the minutes, you have wait five seconds for the SECONDS numbers to start flashing. NOW you can set it.Just as stupid: when you hit the RESET button, instead of resetting the timer back to whatever you originally set it to, it sets it to ZERO. So now you get the pleasure of going through the whole setting process again.You'd think it would be hard to goof up the user interface to something as simple as a kitchen timer. But they've succeeded, to the point where they need to print two paragraphs of instructions on the bottom.Get something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the most efficient gadget","review":"Positives are that it is a sturdy, heavy, good-looking, loud and easy to read timer. However, while it's easy enough to set, it takes sooo long to set it compared to cheaper, lower quality timers. You have to turn the dial or press either button, wait for the numbers to show, wait for the hours to blink, turn the wheel to the desired hours, wait for the minutes to blink and then turn the wheel to the desired minutes. Doesn't sound so bad but it takes a couple of seconds between each step before the numbers start blinking. As others reviewers stated, Kitchen Aid can do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"wasted weekend","review":"Keep with Don Casey. This book was useless.

If you do decide to read this book (I highly recomend it) be ready for an interesting page-turner with a surprising ending. This book, Ice Cold, is about Jeanine finding out about Amy's secret. You get to see the even meaner side of Jeanine. Every evidence (about Jeanine's coma) points back to Amy which makes the book an even better story. I can wait to read the next books ( #11 Lucky Thirteen #12 In search of Andy or #13 The Substitute)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Replica's most intense book yet.","review":"Amy Candler is in deep trouble. Her worst enemy, Jeanine, knows her big secret about being a clone. Now, Jeanine threatens to sell the story to a tabloid unless she becomes her slave. Amy fears that her life is ruined forever--until a terrible accident causes Jeanine to land in a coma. Amy can't help feeling sorry for Jeanine, but she's also curious to who really caused the incident. Amy better solve the mystery fast--because everyone knows that she hates Jeanine, so everyone thinks that she tried to kill her.Like I said in the title, this is Replica's most intense book. The topics go from gay parents to the death of a loved one. I really enjoy Marilyn Kaye's Replica books, and since the recent novels in the series haven't been the best, I really enjoyed reading this one. It was VERY close to getting five stars, but it just didn't have enough action and suspense as I would prefer."},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG!","review":"In the tenth book in the Replica series Janine, Amys worst enemy, finds out that she is a clone and then after Janine mysteriously falls down the steps, everyone thinks Amy pushed her!

I wish I had read these reviews before purchasing this. Literally less than 3 min of having this toy my 40 lb boxer puppy was breaking off little tiny peices of rubber and swallowing them. As soon as we saw the toy simply crumbling we grabbed it but it was too late. That night my pup was throwing up ALL NIGHT long little tiny pieces of rubber. This thing does not hold up under normal chewing so why its being advertised as a Strong, extra tough chew level is ridiculous and just dangerous, do NOT buy this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"I wish we could rate this lower. We have a 1.5 year old basset hound, who is a destructive chewer. We bought this Tire Bone at Petco after searching for a durable chew toy for him, having spent way too much on toys that didn't last. I wish I could have read these reviews before taking this one home. Within 5 minutes, Gus had the the end of this shredded and there were tiny black rubber pieces all over the carpet - took forever to clean up!

Our poor pup was unable to keep down his breakfast and has been throwing up all day.I plan to contact the company as soon as I finish typing this review. Unless you have a nibbler, stay away from this toy - for your dog's sake.Update: I called the company and they were very kind, offered their apologies and a refund.

Our 90lb, 9 month old chocolate lab is an extreme chewer and can tear Kongs apart, so believing the packaging I thought this might be the answer. Within minutes the toy was in pieces. About 3 hours later the pup vomited, and continued to do so for an hour. I will never buy another TireBiter toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, Dangerous Toy","review":"Bought this toy yesterday (at a local store). Gave it to my two dogs (50+ lb and 25 lb) today, who took turns chasing after it. Not five minutes later, saw that they had chewed pieces of it off already and took it away. My dogs are extremely hard on toys and I've never gotten mad at a dog toy manufacturer for not making toys sturdy enough, but this thing is dangerous. It sort of \\"crumbles.\\" There were little chunks missing from all over the surface, and they weren't jagged edges where my dogs had bit down and torn it off. Obviously I took it away immediately.Three hours later, the little dog started vomiting little black pieces of rubber. Since this is the only black toy they have, I know it's from this toy -- not to mention that his vomit even had that tire rubber smell. After his stomach emptied (3 vomits later), his stomach is still rumbling loudly, and he's laying in his crate ignoring 2 different treats that he usually gobbles up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Toy Ever--Dangerous, Irresponsible Company","review":"Let the noxious smell be your warning. My cocker spaniel ripped this apart in an hour's time and is now dreadfully ill. He vomited repeatedly and is afraid to drink water.

I'm dumbfounded this company hasn't been sued into bankruptcy. 98 percent of reviews show dogs suffering the same exact symptoms after playing with it.

Yes, they nibble off little bits, but they haven't had any trouble over it. You can make up your own mind but, whatever you do, don't think that this product is universally lousy. For me, it's been terrific. And--no--I'm not getting paid to write this review.

This CD takes some of Don's greatest hits and gives them CD sound quality but retaining the \\"old\\" style as on the LPs. Besides the well-known \\"He's Alive,\\" this CD contains favorites like \\"Love is Not a Feeling,\\" \\"Morning Prayer,\\" \\"Jehoshaphat,\\" and \\"There is No Condemnation.\\" Of Don's collections, \\"Early Works\\" and \\"Signature Songs\\" are my favorites. The \\"Live\\" CD and the 2 recent re-recordings (\\"Beautiful to Me\\" and \\"He's Alive\\") are fine in their own way, but nothing can top the traditional style as done on \\"Early Works.\\" I highly recommend this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Grace","review":"Don Francisco's music is very important in my life.

His music tugged at my heart strings so much that I became a Christian a few years ago.

The characters are flat, unnatural (especially the teenagers), and there are far too many of them. Most of the characters are seniors, yet the reading level is about 3rd grade (according to my computer readability scale). There is no plot and nothing interesting has happened yet. It has an outdated writing style and feel to it, although it was published in 2001 and, I think, is supposed to take place at the same time.My understanding is that this series uses various authors, so maybe some of the books in the series are better, but I would not recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good service bad quality","review":"Service was swift, however, when I received the oil lamp it looked used, the ceramic was chipped, the handle broke off when I touched it, and part of the one side was rusted.Also, it says it's an oil burner and you are supposed to put oil in the ceramic bowl. Well, that's fine, except there was no way to get the top off to the bowl. But there were two little holes near the top of the bowl.

And no matter what it is a great addition to a Christmas collection. There's no other guitarist like Chet Atkins. He was a master of the six-string and this release provides great reditions of Yultide faves, only the way Chet can do it.Maybe this sounded better on vinyl and we got cheated when it was remastered to CD.

Yes, Chet's technique intentionally created the interesting effects you hear and read about in other fans reviews here, but don't let their lousy ears fool you into buying this. I have the lp and the cd and I always go back to the lp because the cd was mastered so poorly. Whoever was responsible at Razor and Tie for the crummy sound should be ashamed of himself.

It is not the 1970's(?) rerelease on which Chet played his Del Vecchio on several songs.

Another favorite character actor Charles Butterworth is the perfect deadpan balance to Mclaglen's hysteria. We could have used a less tepid heroine. This one is pretty ordinary. A bit spikey would have been nice. I wonder if the \\"Dusty Road\\" song became a hit?? Very stirring!! Edward Arnold makes an elegant crafty villian.

It's solid and sharp. Super easy with pears and small or medium sized apples. Gets the core out and the seeds in one motion. But if you use the jumbo sized apples, you'll probably also need a knife to get all the seeds out of each piece. Still probably easier than slicing the apple yourself, but more cleanup with two utensils.Highly recommend this product.

Wilbur is a very big bunny, and that is why he's chosen as the Easter bunny. The story involved some suspense at parts. I like how his friends distracted everyone from seeing Wilbur.

At the end (after he succeeds in delivering all the Easter eggs and baskets in spite of being so sick) there is no rewarding moment for poor Wilbur...the final picture is of him crashed out on a large chair, looking as sick and miserable as ever with no further written explanation on his condition.

Sure, I hear the retro-ish, upbeat feel of the Shins when I put on Rogue Wave, I hear other influences too. But I can't not appreciate the cleverness, and togetherness of Out of the Shadow. Rogue has pretty smart lyrics, great acoustics, an all-together great sound. If you're looking for something, light and semi-sweet/sad, it is a great album.Rogue Wave has done an excellent job of taking the newer retro on the edge sound and turning into their own great music. I'd buy the album if I was looking for something new, something hip, something good."},{"rating":"1","title":"zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz!","review":"Seriously, this has to be one of the most boring records I've ever heard.

Trust me, listen to the record twice and then put it on shuffle, you won't be able to tell the difference between any of the songs. It's all so unoriginal and needs help with the arrangements. To compare this to the Shins is beyond wrong. They are not comparable.

On this album, about half of the songs are eerily familiar, as they sound like they were made by James Mercer and company. That's not a bad thing, as the songs on this album are, on the whole, lovely pop songs. However, the songs don't remain too memorable as the ones on Chutes Too Narrow or even Oh, Inverted World, which is why this album gets 4 stars (that, and the lack of originality).The best song on the album is \\"Endless Shovel,\\" which features some great guitar work and is also the least Shinslike song on the album. I hope that this is a sign that this good band can build on this promise and not only make other great pop records, but also ones that have more of a defining character to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Cage","review":"I'm using this cage to house 4 rats.

It is great! The large 37 inch one is very spacious and gives our bunny room to hop around. It is tall, too, so there is plenty of space for him to jump up on top of his igloo castle thing. It was very easy to put together and the tray slides out easily for clean up. The door latches are secure. My only complaints are that I wish it had urine guards on the sides and the drop down door on the side needs some kind of cover to give the rabbit something to step on when getting in or out rather than trying to step on the wider wires. Our bunny jumps over it anyway so that isn't an issue and I was able to buy urine guards to put on myself. But still, those things would have been nice.

First of all I am a real big Sex Pistols fan and a huge Sid Vicious fan. Vicious was a punk image of rebellion, nihilism, and violence. Sid Sings is a classic album, but I do have my complaints. The sound quality on this album is horrible and some of the songs aren't that good. Mostly because Sid does cover songs on 10 of the 11 tracks on the CD. It proves that Sid was a follower, not an innovator. The upside of the album is Sid himself, you here Sid argue and cuss at the audience during the gig, and tracks like \\"My Way and Belsen Was A Gas,\\" are actually quite entertaining.

There's some strong drum-n-bass (butnothing you've not heard before) with vocals lopped onto them that, for the most part, get in the way...and on WAY too many tracks. Then there's the errant down-tempo ditty and the occassional symphonic strain, which, frankly, I would have liked on a CD I MEANT to hear classical refrains on. The title track, however, completely rocks and Saul Williams' spoken word really sticks out on this track wonderfully.But just the beats and quickly, please."},{"rating":"1","title":"Listen to it before buying!","review":"As an avid electronic music fan I was anxiously awaiting this album.

They should be ashamed of themselves.I bought Season 6 used, at a great price, and I now would feel ripped off if they had given it to me for free.If you liked the previous 5 seasons, and the characters, do not -- I repeat -- do not watch season 6.

It is obviously an intelligent series, and the stories are complex and quite interesting, even though they show the dark side of corrupt cops quite crudely. This season continues story arcs from before, but it is perfectly possible to understand them throughout these episodes. The character of Kevin Hiatt stands out as quite different from the other seasoned cops in it.

I thought back to Disney's too when the prince came to wake her.

My husband ended up glueing the pegs in with wood glue. The other complaint is that the round pegs on the side also just slide into the actual cradle. So, you have to sort of hold the pegs when you move the cradle or the cradle will fall out. So, although, I love the look and simplicity of the cradle, I think it could have been designed better (like actually screwing the bottom on!!!).

It is more of a cookbook for Sundays.

It's just a jumble of ideas that should have been re-written more coherently. If you're a die-hard Heinlein fan, and I am, I'd still reccomend reading it, but if you're not, don't judge the rest of Heinlein's work based solely on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Early Heinlein with all his faults","review":"Genetic engineering, Second Amendment implications, the war between the sexes, life after death, telepathy -- just what is this book about?It meanders through numerous half-baked subplots (and the pointless intrusion of a twentieth century time traveler), only really dealing with genetics in detail, until it finally just peters out (presumably when the word count was sufficient for Astounding serialization in 1942).Not only is it stuffed with Heinlein's usual lectures and pontificating, but it uses the annoying device of addressing the reader directly in first and second person asides outside of its characters, and uses 1930's slang that was already obsolete by WWII.Really a mess, nevertheless, Heinlein could come up with more thought provoking ideas at his worst than today's authors can come up with at their best, so I'm giving the book an extra star, but only recommending it for Heinlein fanatics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Happy","review":"We recently purchased this light to put over the double sink in our master bathroom.

The title was intriguing enough that I picked it up and hoped for the best. We've all probably read a number of \\"roommate\\" books - some better than others and some downright bad - this one was a departure from the norm - really good and enjoyable.The characters are a rather refreshingly odd combination of personalities and backgrounds. Each is different enough that it provides a nice variety of storylines, situations and perspectives.Overall, I thought the book was charmingly different and a totally enjoyable read. I was rather sorry to see the end of the book, as I felt as if I knew the characters and wanted to see what happened next in their lives.

She likes it and pays to rent the room. She notices a space in the apartment and tells Edie that she could rent that space out as a room.

I couldn't get past the lack of paragraphs. The scene changes were lost because of a lack of clear chapter and paragraph delineation and it was difficult to read.

The biggest hassle is with passwords when you can't see what you've typed and then you don't know for sure if the caps lock is stuck on since there isn't an indicator light.I spent some change on this beast so I had to try to work with it and do my best.

They spent too much time dwelling on apple products and talking with people who just seemed unintelligent.

I've read books by Bruno Munari and George Nelson, seen exhibits on streamline design and studied the tenets of Dieter Rams...and this film didn't come close to any of those experiences. It didn't go over manufacturing, the challenges, the history- anything of interest. It was 75 minutes of mostly younger designers talking about themselves and their own importance. Dieter Rams got maybe 5 minutes of screen time and the Eames got mentioned once. No discussion of Danish design or Mid Century Italian work.

It is obvious to me why she has won so many awards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hopkinson avoids gimicks","review":"Perhaps the best aspect of this book, for me at least, was that Hopkinson integrates the loa into her book without making them seem hokey. In other urban fantasy books I have read, it sometimes seems as if the author almost puts the notice \\"OK, I'm putting in the magic now.\\" before any supernatural elements enter. Hopkinson, on the other hand, describes the supernatural, the spirits that Ti-Jeanne sees and interacts with, as an insider, as if they were as accepted a fact to the readers as microwave ovens or computers. It was very refreshing to see voudoun presented in this light. I'd highly recommend this book to any who are interested in Afro-Carribean culture and mythology.

Nalo Hopkinson is one of those people - her voice is great.The story, Brown Girl in the Ring, is a good story about a young woman living in dystopia Toronto, an inner city burn where civilization is all about 'the strongest survive.' She's in touch with the African Gods because the gift of voudoun runs in the family - and the Gods, called in rituals, have personalities as strong and wild as the rest of the cast of characters: drug dealers, addicts, crime lords, healers, street children, and even the prime minister.With a strong story and great characters, Nalo adds the element of voice to the mix and out comes pure entertainment - edge of your chair fun reading with a big, \\"oh, that's it?\\" sigh at the end and a wish for more.And more I will read.- CV Rick"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exquisitely Decorous","review":"I just recently hear this ensemble the New Budapest Quartet, and I have to say their style could not be more different than the old one.

I would recommend this book for anybody who is inquiring seriously into American Indians and Euro-American relations."},{"rating":"2","title":"A valuable book","review":"The \\" modernism \\" Picasso launched was basically the conception of the artist's oeuvre as a diary, albeit he probably, along with most qf the art establishment, would be outraged by this point of view. That was his most significant first; his development of form, merely a bi - product of his auto - biographical method. This book enables us to see clearly the connection between the man and the works, instead of the usual european way of clouding the timid author's confusion about a complex artist with politically correct aestheticism. Whether Picasso's works are all, they're hyped up to be, when considered as individual paintings, is for the individual to decide; this book is about the man Picasso, his life, and as such most refreshing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Destroyer.

The rest was pretty unrewarding, as it was almost entirely focused on convicting Picasso of having an acutely dysfunctional social life. The evidence was both overwhelming and tedious. I kept going only because I'd been teased in the first hours with a little insight into the artist's amazing mind, and I was hoping for more of it (especially some discussion of Picasso's treatment of hyperspacial dimensions).

I wanted to understand why he is considered one of the most influential artists of the 20th Century, so I read several books, including this biography by Arianna Stassinopoulos Huffington. I learned that Picasso was an unhappy, manipulative, cruel, lying, unfaithful, cheap man who lead a circus of a life. His life was his work of art.

However that may not be a big deal since David Parvin (the instructor) is not very good at conveying much necessary informative details that might be important to the viewers.

Poorly constructed--it's as if the author made a list of every trite gimmick and off-the-wall idea that ever was mentioned in her lady writers support group, and threw them into one novel. A voodoo queen on a college campus, and a cast of Vermont college characters who have all been to Haiti? Missing potions and antidotes? Get real! This kind of shallow frivolity gives a bad name to the genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with dulcie.","review":"The previous reviewer said it all. Wendi Lee thinks that zombies can be created and sent out to work in sweatshops and behind the counter at McDonalds. Oh??? The book is badly written as well. Dull and unbelievable -- a deadly combination."},{"rating":"1","title":"running around with voodoo","review":"When a professor finds voodoo warnings in his office, he calls in private detective Angela Matelli to pose as a student and find the truth. Are the warnings really a gag, or are there real zombies within the ivy walls of his Vermont college? Once at Hartmore College, Angela finds that almost everyone she comes in contact with has been in Haiti and had some contact with the voodoo religion. And tensions are high among them. Somehow, Angela has to cut through the clutter and find the truth--and manage to avoid becoming a zombie herself.Author Wendi Lee writes with an engagingly light style. Angela, with her overprotective mother and marine background makes for an attractive protagonist. The story itself, however, may be a little too light for real mystery fans. Although everyone has been to Haiti, sorting through the suspects shouldn't be so easy.HABEAS CAMPUS is enjoyable light reading but is unlikely to stick with you for long."},{"rating":"1","title":"The WORST Book I've Ever Read","review":"I agree with Judith Lindenau's review completely. I have seldom seen so many cliches and illogical metaphors and similies even in my years of teaching high-school English. I don't see that any of the characters she introduced (barely) in the first few pages were relevant to the so-called story line or plot. I wonder if Wendi Lee has ever been to Massachusetts or Vermont? She seems not to be aware of the driving time between Boston and the Northeast Kingdom and says nothing about the effect of the Big Dig on Angie's trip from Boston. The most she seems to know is that leaves fall from the trees in autum in New England. Worst of all, at the end she drives off leaving us wondering what eventually happens to the two burn victims and the two zombies, physically or legally. She doesn't seem much interested in the fate of her characters. I fear that the zombie paste has been wasted on the wrong person."},{"rating":"1","title":"could have been much better","review":"Like many of these reviewers, I had such high hopes for this book. The premise is very intriguing and I really wanted to find out what a family would be like in these circumstances. Unfortunately, the author throws in a pointless romance with the lawyer which is very distracting to the main storyline. Switching back and forth between perspectives with the flashbacks being tossed in randomly made it even harder to follow. The characters were absolutely two-dimensional and uninspired. The ending was a complete copout and could have been predicted from page 1. The only unique thing that I liked was the differing typefaces for each character's viewpoint. (It was also the only way I could keep everyone straight.)Horrible book. I won't read anything from Jodi Picoult again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Was 90% sure I had wasted my money..","review":"Well I was 90% sure I had wasted my money buying this book, but then the book finally started to become interesting. It's a good book, but quite often full of unnecessary rambling. Sure I guess the 'rambling' was there to add depth and personality to each character, but IMO it was a little over the top.The character transformation is quite interesting, especially with Campbell and Jesse. Its a great book, but only if you have time and patience."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting idea, poor writing","review":"I picked this up for the intriguing premise. But the book hardly lived up to its potential. The writing was rambling, full of philosophic cliches and preachy moments that made it hard to get into. The author also seemed to be throwing in far too many subplots; for instance, the brother's arsonist escapades distracted from the real story. Many characters were quite one-dimensional - the mother's single-minded devotion to Kate might have made her a good villain, but surely not a very realistic character. I was especially disappointed by the girls' characters. After reading the book description, I expected Anna to be a strong teenage girl character (always fascinating to read about.) But in this story she's nothing more than a pawn in this philosophical exercise. All in all, a less-than-worthwhile read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous ending!","review":"This book had an intriguing plot - that a 13-year-old would seek medical empanciation from her family so she could make her own decision about donating an organ to her sister. It held my interest. The ending, however, was out of left field and a complete betrayal of everything that had gone before. Scratch Jodi Picoult off my list of authors!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting premise but shallow writing","review":"I agree with some previous reviewers that the character development is thin, the format is annoying, and the ending is manipulative. The author's hand is so visible in this book that I could never lose sight of it. In spite of a good premise, the story never reaches its potential. Someone told me that it was a well-done view into the teenage mind. For that purpose I would suggest the book \\"Miss American Pie\\" by Margaret Sartor instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliches and melodrama","review":"I read this book just over three years ago and one quote still sticks out: \\"Darkness is relative.\\" This is coming from the misunderstood arsonist son. Every page had a fortune cookie of wisdom, along with tired metaphors and characters that evoke no empathy. The popularity of this book makes me a little ashamed to be a woman, in that they seem to LOVE it. The ending was a cop-out, not that it mattered much; an interesting ending wouldn't have been enough to save it. I also would like to point out that I was excited to read this and the idea seemed it had a lot of potential. A waste really."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great until the ending.....","review":"I enjoyed this thought provoking book until I saw where the ending was going. I hadn't expected this author to wrap the book up with this type of ending. Like someone said, it turned it into a Lifetime Movie book. I don't know if I will read more of her books, since people keep telling me this is her best."},{"rating":"2","title":"What would you do?","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book and appreciated the fact that it was told from several points of view. It is an interesting topic (designer babies) and I was surprised at how I felt about it at different times during the book. It brought up several issues that I had never considered, and nicely portrayed what a strain cancer can put on an entire family. I often found myself thinking \\"what would you do in a situation like this?\\" It got a bit dramatic at the end, but it also made for a nice twist. Make sure as you get close to the end to have a box of tissues handy. This book is the first I have read from Picoult, but I am very interested to read more now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow - fantastic book!","review":"Unbelievably good book.

Have loaned this to other friends as well our book club chose this, all reveiws were great. A must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting story.","review":"The story opens with a flood of medical speak, and you know at once that this author has done her research. Overall, it's an interesting and engaging read, however the mother \\"Sara\\" is written as an absolutely unsympathetic character, and several of the other character's actions and motivations are not easily understood. In particular the opaque relationship between Campbell and Julia relies heavily on confusing flashbacks and encounters that make little sense.Like other readers, I did not like the ending. I did not think that she needed a \\"deus ex machina\\" to end her tale, and the epilogue was unsatisfying. Perhaps Picoult felt the need to tie up all the loose ends, but it was just plain implausible.It's worth a read, though, certainly plenty of food for thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining Read","review":"This book was a required read for school and I ended up loving it. It was very well thought out and informative regarding the medical terms. The time that Jodi Picoult spent doing research showed. It was a very emotional book that kept me up at night."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a rip-off!","review":"I felt like I was watching a \\"disease of the week\\" television movie. Picoult takes what is a pretty compelling question and turns it into nothing. The characters are flat, contrived and not believable; the ending is stunningly cheap. Picoult spent the whole book setting up this conflict and then ran away from it. What a joke. This is the first book of Picoult's that I have read and it will be the last. If I could give it zero stars, I would.This is the only book my book group has read that every one of us hated."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first Jodi Picoult book but def. not my last!","review":"I'm not going to include a summary of this book, just simply my impressions. I'll start off by saying this is by no means a feel good book. But it is an honest look at human emotions, and relationships. I appreciate that Ms. Picoult doesn't try to sugar coat complex, emotionally charged issues. I enjoy that this book is written from multiple viewpoints to really get to the heart of the issue. My one beef with this book is the ending...which is kind of a cop out to me. In spite of that I feel that this is a well-written, worthwhile novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deeply Moving","review":"Fascinating, multilayered story about a family's fight for survival as individuals and as a unit. Thought provoking and deeply moving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Melodrama & Cliches","review":"The book is long, but I'll be brief...Interesting topic. Middle falls flat. Written in fits and starts with flashes of artsy philosophy and continuous medical procedure that eventually loses its relevance. Characters lose credibility half way through. The side plots devolve into cliches with no climax---Jesse, Campbell and Julia, the cold-hearted mother, Judge De Salvo...blahblahblah. FILLED with melodrama, no surprises. Not only could I see the ending coming a mile away, I could see the entire book unfold half way through and thought it was intentionally written that way to build to something less trite. Chicken Soup for the Soul, but with the occasional F-bomb (which really is not a problem.)Critics say that this book was not as well written as her earlier work, and I might give another book a try---it just seems like she got tired around page 250. Disappointing, considering a strong beginning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mawkish mucky muck","review":"Welcome to my first and last Jodi PicoultJust not my kind of a read ... if it is going to be melodrama then I will take it in period costume. This was trying to be philosophical but fell on its arty arse. The multiple narrative was woeful ... the \\"voice\\" used was the same, usually impossible to tell (without names) who was narrating the chapter. (Maybe the problem is that I have recently read some great change of voice/point -of-view multiple narratives that work in spades!!)I found the characterisations a bit on the clunky side, lacking credibility. In fact there were too many characters who were not relevant to the plot ... what was the point of the lawyer's old love affair?Maybe the only problem with the surprise ending is that they weren't all treated to the same fate!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Sister's Keeper: A Novel","review":"A story of a complex family dynamic. Where love and rebellion go hand-in-hand. A story of a family who struggles to live, not just survive.Jesse, an older brother who enjoys fire. Kate, a teenager with a rare form of leukemia. Anna, the sister who was brought into the world, by genetic design, to be an stem cell/organ donor for Kate. Sara and Brian, the parents who live to make sure Kate lives.This book was written in the comforting style that Mrs. Picoult does so well; each chapters narrates a characters view of what is happening. You hear everyone's thoughts, their voices, bringing a silent comfort that you actually know the characters. I enjoyed this book immensely. It is filled with joy, sadness. It's topic is controversial (stem cell) and the ending shocked me to tears! -- Tears that envelope the message that ultimately, no matter what happens in life, life is so ultimately precious, to everyone.4.5 stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the faint of heart","review":"This book was recommended to me by a friend. I began reading it on an airplane and feel I should have stopped after about 30 minutes when I sensed this wasn't going to be anything very uplifting. Because it was a long flight I kept reading. The flight was just as long on the way home, so I read.Whereas the author writes with an easy -to -read type of style, I did not appreciate the constant back and forth between past and present. And I'm sure she was trying to be accurate with the correct names of treatments, meds, disease terminology, etc., but it got to be too much.I lost a brother to leukemia just under 3 years ago. My other brother's wife died of metastatic melamona nearly 1 year to the day after his death. If you have had recent illness or death in the family, I would stay away from this book. The ending is not only heart wrenching, but depressing. Yes, sometimes life sucks, and this is not what you should read if you've gone through tough times recently."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Stinker Among Exotic Treasures","review":"My basic feeling about this book is that it is about 150 pages too long. My second reaction was that the ending was far-fetched and unbelievable. I got tired of the lingering \\"mysteries\\" (why did Campbell have a \\"service\\" dog? why did Campbell leave Julia, the love of his life without an explanation? Why did Julia take him back so easily after 15 years, and with so many unanswered question?)The ad nauseum rhetoric also got on my nerves. How many times and in how many different ways and to how many different people can you can you ask the same question?Jody Picoult is one of my favorite authors. I never expected to write a poor review on one of her books. I have read many of her other books and they are wonderful, so I won't give up. I just hope that's the only stinker in the bunch."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't know how this book has over 1000 reviews and is still rated three stars.","review":"I found this book's plot to be manipulative and contrived, the characters were weak and the ending atrocious. There is nothing to be gained by reading this book. Read \\"The Art of Racing\\" instead. You'll thank me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very disappointed reader","review":"I have read books before that I would term \\"bad\\", but I have never read a book that I honestly regreted reading, until this book. The first 400 pages were amazing- wonderfully writen and so adictive I didn't want to stop reading. Then I got to the end. To say it was a let down would be far too mild a description. It wasn't that the ending was upsetting, it was that it made the rest of the book pointless. I won't go into details, (to avoid ruining it for anyone still compelled to read it) but the ending was just so horrible that it is difficult to even fathom. Tragic endings are fine, but this ending really made me wonder how the author could waste her time with the first 400 pages if she was planning to end it how she did. I simply cannot express how much I dislike this book because of how it ended. I have never read one of Jodi Picoult's books before, and my Sister's Keeper has convinced me that I never should have picked up one of her books in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat characters, heavy melodrama","review":"I put this book down after I was introduced to my SEVENTH first person character in 70 pages. Not to mention at least 3 or 4 chronology jumps.Its as if Piccoult doesn't trust her writing to stand on its own. And rightfully so... If the writing supported the book, I might tolerate it. But her writing is horrible: stilted, and filled with corny metaphors, textbook emotion, its just...insufferable , at least to me.Don't get pulled in by the subject matter.Its a great concept but the execution is abysmal.Lifetime movie indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed by stereotypical characters","review":"While story was engrossing, the characters were stereotypes. A lot of the plot was therefore not terribly believable. I actually felt so outraged by the ending, I am writing my first review on Amazon.com. I will never read another book by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"this book will tear your guts out","review":"If you like an emotional roller coaster of a book, read this one, but give yourself lots of time, you won't want to put it down. Of all the books I have read so far by this author, this one is my favorite. If you are reading this review trying to decide whether or not you should spend your hard earned cash to buy this book I have 2 words for you. DO IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many convenient coincidences","review":"I threw this book down at the end and couldn't believe it was published. There are so many unbelieveable coincidences in the plot that it was like watching a bad movie or sitcom. Kate and Anna's mother just happens to be a lawyer and comes out of retirement just for this case to represent herself! Anna's lawyer just happened to have a prior romantic relationship with Anna's court-assigned guardian! Not to mention the terrible ending. In addition, there are obvious questions that aren't asked or answered until the end -- only because it would ruin the big finale of the book. But in reality, someone WOULD ask them. If you don't mind ridiculous plot structure, then you may like this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"MY SISTER'S KEEPER","review":"this was my first jodi picoult book and i picked it up on one friend's strong recommendation. i really didn't know what to expect. i chuckle now when i read the angry reviews. personally, i thought the ending was wonderful because it was so unexpected. and as tough as it is to take, it goes to show that never ending lesson that comes around in life: be careful what you wish for."},{"rating":"1","title":"I know I'm the minority but...I just seemed so forced","review":"Okay let me say this was an easy and emotional read. How awful for these poor people... But the little sister was genetically engineered to save the older sister and we never hear anything more about it? That seemed weird to me. And the surprise ending didn't surprise me. What did surprise me was how Picoult tied everything up so neatly and unrealistically at the very end. I felt insulted by that ending and it turned me off to Jodi Picoult. I'm not sure I'll read another one of her books. I did like the little side story with the lawyer. I found that story line to be more enjoyable than the rest of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made me Cry","review":"This was a great book. I wasn't sure what to expect or if I would would stay interested since I am a big Dan Brown fan and this is a very different type of novel, but this was just as suspenseful in a very dramatic way. I had to know what was going to happen and how it would turn out. The author really gets you involved with this family and each character tugs you with their perspective, almost trying to sway the reader to their side. This book, which I just picked up out the the grocery store to have something to read on a plane trip, has made me a Jodi Picoult fan too. I have also read \\"The Pact\\", and am reading \\"Vanishing Acts\\". They are all good reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Healing","review":"I loved this book from the first time I read it. It's one of the most emotionally sincere works I've seen in a long time. To see daily life through the eyes of the different characters is as true to \\"real life\\" as it gets. Wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FABULOUS!","review":"This was a selection for our neighborhood book club and we all loved it. The characters are so well-developed and by the end of the story you really begin to understand and relate to each one. This novel is GREAT to discuss; there are many issues and topics that are introduced. I am a voracious reader and it takes something pretty special for me to take notice - this book did it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"May I have my money back???","review":"I hated this book.Yes, I meant hate.Poor, poor ending. The writing and concept towards the end of the book & especially the last chapter is unbelievable. No, really...it is not to be believed. It is not well thought out, there are so many errors in the thought process that you can not make the leap to the ending.I feel like the author did not know how to end the book and grasped at staws and came up with this lame, unbelievable ending. The facts don't jive. If it is a stretch at a metaphor, it is poorly executed."},{"rating":"1","title":"My first and last Jodi P book","review":"Read this book for Book Club. As I was reading it, I thought the book was fairly well written and was emotionally invested in the characters.Then I got to the end. What a complete cop out.I threw the book across the room.Never again. The writer immediately plunged to the bottom of my list of writers. I am a reading junkie and if I were on a desert island surrounded only by books by this author, I would simply stop reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kinda Long. Interesting. Odd, but twisted ending.","review":"I will not give away any spoilers in this review.I read this book over the summer. It was very well written and I liked how Picoult developed the characters. I kept thinking how I would have responded if this were my family. I know I wouldn't have taken the same route as the mother did and some of the things she did made me a little angry.At a birthday party, I was talking to my mother-in-law, and she also read this book. She started crying b/c her son had survived cancer and this book brought back a lot of painful memories for her...like the problems with insurance...his battles...etc.I read this book by the pool and remember crying at a few pages...it was a real tear jerker.We both had the same reactions to the ending and found it rather odd. I did see it coming where she did not.We both loved this book, even though some of it was rather \\"strange\\" and I look forward to reading another of Picoult's novels soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will touch your heart and make you think","review":"This may be one of the best books I have ever read. I found myself laughing and crying, but mostly thinking. Jodi Picoult is such an amazing writer! Don't miss this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good story","review":"Before I bought this book, it'd been weeks since I read anything new. Nothing interested me. I saw this at Borders, and from the moment I started reading, I was hooked. A great, moving story. Well written. Sad ending. It actually made me cry, and a book that does that... I can't forget. I'm going to read some of the author's other books, I think."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap writer trick","review":"This book starts out superbly. The characters are believable and real. Unfortunately Ms. Picoult writes herself into a corner and resorts to a cheap too pat and too neat ending. She does throw in heart wrenching emotion but I would have preferred a more honest attempt to deal with the unfolding drama. Cheap trick."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"This book is one of my favorite books I've ever read. This book circulated through my family, and I can't bring myself to sell it. Jodi Picoult has this fantastic ability to withold critical information from chapter to chapter, keeping you guessing. At times, however she does seem to give too much seemingly needless in-depth information when developing characters. Fantastic story, with great twists. A real tear-jerker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very good until,,,","review":"The last 25 pages or so. This was my first Picoult reading experience and I hesitate to take on another after finishing this. The subject matter was interesting and the writing was above average, if not needlessly wordy.The ending, however, was ridiculous, medically unbelievable, and probably an attempt to shock the reader. Way too much irony for me.I disliked every character except Anna. I rarely say this but,,,,the movie was far better."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of Jodi Picoult","review":"I have not yet read all of Picoult's novels. I only just discovered this amazing writer in 2007! As an avid reader I can't believe I did not know of her novels before. I am currently starting on reading my 5th Picoult novel and have so far loved all of them. However,\\" My Sister's Keeper\\" is my favorite and has made my personal top 20 list of all time fav novels. Picoult created characters you truly care about. The ending is like nothing I have ever experienced before in a novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought Provoking","review":"This is a book that I could not put down until the very end. Jodi has surprises for the reader which are current issues. Many of my friends found the book a good discussion book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complex and Arresting","review":"I'm not sure if there is anything new that I can say about this book that has not already been written. However, I will say that a friend lent me this book and I could not put it down. Although the quality of the writing was not what I expected (not lyrical or nuanced in its realism), the story and the author's use of multiple narrators absolutely draws you in. Complex in its moral questioning, this book forces you to look at the question of a girl's existence and her personal rights in a multitude of lights. As you get to know each member of the family, along with other supporting characters, the authors succeeds in drawing out emotions in her reader of anger, sympathy, sadness and, most importantly, thought. It is almost impossible to leave this book unaffected, especially given the novel's ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely fantastic!","review":"This novel was an absolute treat. I could not put it down. Picoult's treatment of such a controversial subject, and her portrayal of the deeply conflicting emotions are definitely part of what makes this novel so wonderful. She makes you see both sides of the issue and understand, to the point where you can't side, both the sister's and the mother's situation. Absolutely fantastic. I recommend this to everyone who enjoys a good, hearty read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome - not predictable!","review":"Savored every chapter - well written - couldn't put it down, but didn't want it to end either:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful reading","review":"This book presented the characters as people you could relate to.It was one of those novels you could not put down.Feelings ranged from happy to sad for the reader.The real emotions of the characters came though.When I finishedI felt apart of this family.I recommend this book and think it is the best novel I have read in a long time.SincerelyLeah"},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down.......","review":"This is Jodi Picoult's best yet!! The family dynamics were fascinating. A very thoughtful read. The ending blew me away. I thought \\"The Pact\\" was godd, this one tops them all."},{"rating":"1","title":"The biggest downer I have every read!","review":"This author takes an interesting subject,appears to create believablecharacters, then ruins the whole effort with an obvious attempt to createtabloid type,lurid sensationalism. What a cop-out. What a waste of timeto explore and cheapen a serious issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too contrived","review":"I was not blown away. It was like reading a soap opera script. The ending was so contrived."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Most Disgusting Book I've Ever Read","review":"Are you guys (who think this book is just great) serious? The fact that a person would create another person solely for the purpose of saving a prior child's life is farfetched and selfish enough; the characters are all completely unsympathetic as well. The mother is hideous. The older daughter, Kate, is a ghost who is always portrayed as the ultimate victim. The father is a ghost. The brother is a crazy psycopath, and the parents don't even take the time to notice. By the time I finished the book, I wanted all of them to just shut up. The fact that it basically all \\"works out\\" in the end (meaning the mother and father got exactly what they asked for to begin with) makes me sick. This book and it's author are boring at best, and disgusting at worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such promise! Such a BAD ending","review":"This is the second book by Picoult that I have read--both because my book discussion group made the choice. Both books grabbed me at the beginning and I liked it and then the ENDING. I know she is popular with many (including my book group) but I am like so many others that think the author takes the reader so far with exiting and grabbing stories and then! OPPS! We need an ending. I know that life isn't fair, but this ending! I loved the lawyer and his dog. I would ask the author to write about him but I wouldn't like the ending! The concept of concieving a child to help another child is current and worth while reading about. So read the book ---but skip the ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"This was my first book of Jodi Picoult's long history of novels. I read it in one day because I was inthralled. The writing is not fantastic, in fact, it is somewhat mediocre, but I was not reading because of her style. I was reading because I was fascinated with her characters. I related to her dysfunctional family and felt as if I were one of the struggling family members. This is a captivating read because Ms. Picoult is able to weave the reader into the story so that she experiences the pain along with the joy of the family members."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost me at the end","review":"This novel addresses many ethical, moral, personal, family issues for more than 200 pages in what seem to be interesting (and medically accurate) ways. The ending is not accurate.Warning: If you haven't read the novel, the next sentences will wreck the \\"surprise\\" at the end.Because I am a medical writer/editor and have friends who have been (a)a living donor of a kidney to a sibling and (b) a spouse who approved donation of all possible organs (tragic drowning; spouse could not be revived), I know that the medical information is just not right....a lawyer can't make the decision...not even a legal guardian of a minor. Also, relatives would NOT say goodbye to someone still on life support AFTER the organ donation. Life support is removed before the organs are \\"harvested.\\" I felt that the writer got to the end of her \\"schedule\\" of a book a year and just wrapped it up fast to meet a publisher's deadline. Picoult's novels are getting more and more formulaic. Not a fan any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting premise...but predictable and unrealistic","review":"The novel had an intriguing premise- one sister being created solely to keep another sister alive. It was also written in a clever style- each chapter through a different character's perspective. However- both the completely predictable romance and the completely unrealistic/ridiculous ending had me frustrated that I spent time reading this novel. I had high hopes for the interesting subject, and was very disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"worst book I've ever read!","review":"I can't believe this book got the reviews it did. Book was loaned to me and I'm grateful as I would of been sick had I actually paid to read it. Everything in book was to the extreme and an insult to people everywhere who actually have to deal with illness like this. Only book I've read by author and will remain so. With all the other books out there do yourself a favor and bybass this one and find one you can enjoy. If you like the tear jerkers look for one that doesn't insult your intelligence like this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read.","review":"Just to forewarn you, the ending of the book is different than the ending of the movie. I saw the movie first and didn't realize the ending was different from the book. But I still liked both the movie and the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad story worth reading.","review":"I think that I waited too long to read this book after all the hype. It didn't hold me the way I expected it to. However, still an excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Sisters Keeper","review":"This story goes deep into your feelings for your Brother's and Sister's. Makes you think about what you would do for them in certain situation's. How honest you could be with them and yourself about giving personal need's too them and not feeling pressured about doing them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep Ethical Issues","review":"A fascinating book dealing with deep ethical issues. Is it ok for parents to conceive a genetically engineered embryo, because it is a good match for a previous child with leukemia? At Anna's delivery the stem cells of the cord blood is donated to Kate and subsequently she donates lymphocytes, granulocytes, bone marrow and now with Kate's kidneys failing she is expected to donate one of her kidneys. A major decision is being made about her \\"and no one's bothered to ask the one person who most deserves it to speak her opinion.\\"The reader is to some extent educated about haematology and oncology as well as the work done by firefighters/paramedics and also the legal system. There are many sub-plots intertwining well with the main plot until the story comes to an unexpected end."},{"rating":"2","title":"It will tug at every string in your heart...","review":"This is, by far, one of the best books I have ever read.It's one of those stories you are worried will tear your apart, but you just have to read on, and have to see what happens. The messages in this book are strong, impacting, and important. It's a story that touches so many important moral topics, and revolves around a disease many today are unfortunately too familiar with - Cancer.I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to feel what family love and sacrifice is all about. And you have ever underestimated the strength of a child, this book with surely put things in perspective for you.It will tug at every single last string in your heart..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad But Unexpected Ending","review":"This story was written very well, & didn't take long to read because it was hard to put down. The ending took me by surprise. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived, Manufactured emotions, empty","review":"It was as if I was tossed into a Lifetime Movie except it took longer. The very interesting concept was bogged down with contrived plots, overwrought emotions (manufactured), and poor characterizations. This is all before the lame cop-out easy-for the-writer ending. Sorry I wasted my time and no more Jodi for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read!","review":"This quickly turned into my favorite book. After seeing pieces from the movie in an ethics course, I decided to pick up the book and read it. Well, once I started it I couldn't put it down! The characters are so well developed and the story line is extremely detailed, Picoult didn't leave anything out. I highly recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid concepts","review":"An interesting concept where a child conceived to provide bone marrow for her sister with leukemia, employs a lawyer to protect her rights and prevent her parents from further exploiting her. In the mix are unintentionally abusive and neglectful parents and a ridiculous story line with a lawyer. The end of the story is pure daytime soap opera and not worthy of discussion,but I must take issue with Ms. Picoult's creation of a lawyer with epilepsy which is so poorly controlled he needs a support dog, yet continues to drive a car. Ridiculous, the man's a lawyer, for heaven's sakes, he may be stupid but he is bound by a code of behavior. Also, he is ashamed and secretive about his condition. Why? This is not explained and in 2010 this is ridiculous.These things spoiled the book for me. Picoult does this sort of thing in many of her books, it's like she can only do so much research and then lets things slip for the sake of the plot. shabby."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"This was such an enjoyable read!!!It took a little getting used to at first because each chapter was written from the viewpoint of a different character.I knew exactly how I felt and what I would do about this type of situation before I even picked up the book...so I thought. The author did such a wonderful job expressing the emotions of the characters that I found myself able to understand each and every one of them.The ending is so amazing it will blow you away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't read another by Picoult","review":"I picked this up on the recommendation of a friend. The premise was interesting and timely. However, I was irritated throughout the novel by the authors use of analogies and similes. Everything was described in this manner: When this happens, it's like this. I understand that many times it is necessary to describe an event or emotion in terms of something else so that other people can relate - but, the analogy must make sense for this to be effective.As I said, the premise was interesting, but it didn't seem to go anywhere. At the end, when characters are faced with difficult choices, and you begin to feel that there will be some resolution, the author throws in a \\"surprise ending\\". Even though the ending is tragic, it felt like the easy way out to me, at least for the author. She never has to make a statement or take a stand on the issue.All in all, I was disappointed, and I don't think I would read another by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only interesting thing about the book is dissolved by the end","review":"It is a mediocre book, at best. The plot lines are not credible. The characters one dimensional. The only thing this book has going for it is an interesting ethical dilemma. And then at the end, there is a plot twist that completely takes the dilemma away. I feel like I was tricked into wasting part of my life on this stupid book. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mission NOT Accomplished","review":"The author starts out with an excellent premise. She makes the reader take a closer look at decisions and the ethical problems they raise based on advancements in technology. Unfortunately, she reverts to a convoluted plot to show the reader that \\"Mother Knows Best,\\" and that life sucks, and then you die. The ending comes so forcefully, the reader cannot believe what happened. It is true that we lose people suddenly in our lives, and the shock value is much the same as how it happens in the book, but the whole story is lost in the ending. What starts out as a quest for pursuit of personal rights, ends up as a very sad commentary on life. Perhaps that's what the author wanted to do..... This was the first book I read by Jodi Picoult, and it will be the last book of hers that I will ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising ending","review":"I really enjoyed this book--the ending was not what I expected, but overall it was a good book. I love the writer's style and the story. The ending was good, just a surprise (and not what I hoped would happen!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Once Again!","review":"Jodi Picoult has been my favorite author since I read The Pact three years ago. I love how she draws you into the hearts and minds of all the characters. She always chooses complex and ethical topics for her stories, but she writes them beautifully. I could not put down My Sister's Keeper; It is a heartwrenching story of a girl with leukemia and her family's endless struggle to ease her affliction. If I am not mistaken, I believe Picoult based this plot along the lines of a true life story. I was genuinely touched by this novel, along with all the others. I was a little dismayed by the ending, as she throws a totally unexpected trauma to you, but still enjoyed it very much and recommended it to all of my friends. If you want a real, well-written, ethical and moral drama, this is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Sister's Keeper","review":"This is an extremely realistic book and that is coming from someone who has gone through the loss of a child and the trematic experiences prior to that. I don't know how Jodie Picoult got things so right, but she touched ever nerve in my soul. I cried throughout the book but it was a true catharsis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book ruined with a bad ending","review":"I am glad to hear that the movie has the opposite ending as the book. Admittedly, the book is captivating and brings up some issues worth thinking about. However, when I got to the end of the book I felt as if the author just gave up and took the easy way out. I even woke up in the middle of the night after reading the book, furious at the ending. Of course, in life there are tragic and unexpected events, but I really felt that the ending was a stretch - very unrealistic. It was kind of like watching a bad soap opera. The author spent a lot of time describing the feelings of each character leading up to this ending but then wrote an abrupt and catastrophic ending without really allowing time to explore the consequences of it. So thumbs up for the great writing style and ability to keep the reader interested and thinking. But overall I was totally in shock and disappointed in the end result of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst deus ex machina ever","review":"Ugh. I spent a gazillion hours reading this book. And those are hours that I am never going to get back,unfortunately.First of all, any good hospital would have put a stop to the sort of treatments that the younger daughter Anna, had to go through to save the life of her sister Kate who has leukemia. She is a child concieved to give her sister a match for bone marrow that she needs. People were horrified when her parents concieved her for that purpose. And then after suing her parents to be emancipated so she does not have to donate bone marrow ,in the end.....she's killed in a car accident and Kate gets Anna's kidney.Oh and can we talk about the cornball dialogue?Especially Campell's responses every time someone asks him why he has a guide dog(he's an epileptic-and he drives,he became a epileptic because of-oh irony- a car accident. Ane yet he still har a drivers licence? whut?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap cheap story","review":"Seriously one the worst books I've read. I feel like the author didn't have the courage to follow the through with the story. I know she has said she had it planned out from the beginning but seriously, you are going to boil the whole story down to a random accident? Then in future everything is okay so don't get to glum... Cheap, why don't I just listen to a Brittney Spears song and eat some pop tarts while laying on some 50 thread count sheets to finish the experience.Honestly it would be like if at the end of the Joy Luck Club a meteor hit the town and vaporized the mothers, and sisters in China, then flashing forward and showing how that ironed everything out and made the daughters overcome their issues with their mothers. Seriously a cowardly writer, I don't think I will explore anymore of her work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leaves a lot of though behind","review":"I realy enjoyed the book a lot. It is the first book I read from Jodi Picoult and will for sure not be the last one. I read it with the speed of the light and left a lot of thinking behind. Wonderfull story with a lot of pertinent questions. What would I do as a parent, if i was in the same situation as the one apearing in the book. What is the right thing to do..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting","review":"I read this book over a year ago and still it is my number one best book!Jodi Picoult keeps you on the edge until you have the whole thing figured out and then hits you with an amazing ending. Actually took my breath away- this book!It is a must read!!!!!!!!!! You will not regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I reach for a tissue and there are nomore left......","review":"... this book is trully amazing! I have read all of Picoults books, and although this one follows the same plot basis, it is exceptionally wonderful to the others. From the beginning all the way to the twists at the end. I could not stop turning the pages. It flows beautifully through everyones perspectives. I recommend this book to anyone. It will open your heart. Just keep a fresh tissue box at your side. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"At first compelling, but soon appalling","review":"When I first started reading My Sister's Keeper, I was intrigued. I enjoyed the use of multiple voices. I thought Anna was sweet and Campbell the attorney was a cool guy. The family dynamics seemed realistic even. It was somewhere around page 150 that I started cringing and the bad metaphors. Around page 250 I was wondering what Campbell's romantic relationship possibly had to do with the story. At the 350 page mark I was reading because my book group wanted me to (luckily, it is an easy read, probably about 10th grade reading level). At the conclusion of 450 pages I hurled the book into the trash bin. The ending will appall you. The book is not well written, but worse it is inaccurate and irresponsible, especially the authors treatment of people with epilepsy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I DON'T RECCOMEND THIS BOOK","review":"Characters are one-dimensional predictable. The legal scenes are improbable: no judge would have permitted Sara to represent herself. Honestly, Brian...could you please be any sappier? The ending ruined the entire story for me and I felt it was completely not necessary. Why the author decided to take the easy way out and wrap up the book is a question we should ponder. And what became of Jessie, I mean after the rain storm. I am sorry I wasted my time on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"My sister's keeper","review":"The movie had just came out and I wanted to read the book first. This is a very good book and so is the movie. I would recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointing","review":"If i could give it no stars at all i would. Why? Most of the characters were irritating, especially the mother, Sara. The author threw in a soap opera romance that just seemed like its only purpose was to fill more pages. Don't get me started on the wordy astrological references that made you skim past half a page. The biggest issue I have with this book - WORST ENDING EVER!"},{"rating":"2","title":"i couldn't put it down","review":"the book was amazing, i found myself wanting to hurry home so i could read it. a book hasn't done that for me in a long time. i'm going to read more, next on the list is second glance.i have a degree in molecular and cellular biology so this topic was very familiar to me and it was interesting to see it in a story. when you go to school for 4 years and learn just the science of it, it's hard to realize the ethics of the situation since it was never really discussedloved the book! i hope everyone finds as much enjoyment in it as i did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning, Shocking, Beautiful","review":"I absolutely loved this book. First of all, Jodi Picoult has the amazing ability to capture this intricate story from all sides of the family, which is great. Also, the twists and turns made me want to never set the book down. Although tragic, the story is very realistic and Picoult stays true to the characters. Surprising, but worth a good cry. You won't forget it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Stunning","review":"I loved this book from cover to cover. I'm a student which not much time for free book reading but by the second this was handed to me, all schoolwork was pushed from my head (ok, so not the best thing to happen but it shows my love of this book). Passing it on to my girlfriends and I loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disjointed writing","review":"Reading through the reviews here I see nothing about Ms. Picoult's method of writing. I found it to be choppy, disjointed, and confusing at times. For example, each chapter's title is a character's name which we're supposed to know that he/she is talking (1st person)to us. I constantly had to refer to the chapter beginning to remind myself who was talking. Going back and forth from the past to present also was a bit confusing. Naming a dog \\"Judge\\" while dealing with a judge in the book was a bit much. This book did not have a nice flow to it which spoiled the enjoyment of reading. The subject matter was interesting but the ending was like it was written by a novice beginner writer. I've heard Picoult is a great writer but obviously not my type or style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived & Annoying Ending --Said it Best","review":"I think the author totally sold out to a fairy tale ending which does not make for good fiction. Some very important ethical questions were set up then they were trivialized by the \\"made of TV movie\\" ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ready for some heavy reading?","review":"A good thought-provoking book but one with some serious flaws: the girl's attorney and her court-appointed rep were long-time lovers and now decide to resume their relationship? the mom hasn't practiced law in 20 years but decides to dust off the diploma and represent herself in such a difficult case with a daughter lying ill in the hospital? and worst of all the author cops out with a ridiculous ending. Still, it was a page-turner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unrealistic Ending","review":"I enjoyed most of this book. In the study questions at theend, Jodi Picoult says that there was no other way to end thisbook. I completely disagree. She simply went forsensationalism and a Hollywood script ending rather thanhow things work in real life. The true ending that normally occurs with families with sick or terminally ill children:The parents divorce with Mom keeping the sick child. Dad takesthe son and the organ donor who are alienated from their sisteruntil their Mother dies."},{"rating":"2","title":"unforgettable","review":"This was the first Jodi Picoult book I read, and it was wonderful. Every character (except perhaps the son/brother) perfectly portrayed and developed. A plot that raises questions in a series of layers that keep you thinking and considering the rightness of the parents' decisions and actions. And, in the end, a tying together of all the threads in a way that is as simple and satisfying as a good dessert. If you read this book you won't soon forget it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I thought it would be,","review":"but that's not saying much.I knew there would be a \\"twist\\" to the end of this book because of a bonehead reviewer who mentioned that something would happen at the end, but I didn't know exactly what it would be. Unlike another reviewer, the very last part of the book earned my review another star.This is the fourth or fifth Picoult book I have read so I knew that there would be different point of views (and fonts), emotional crises, and an After-School Special Disease-of-the-Week. There would be a big trial towards the end, and many characters would be lawyers.Campbell's service dog's function was teased through the book, as I knew it would be. I enjoyed the \\"reveal\\" when it finally happened.What brought this all together is the skill with which Picoult fleshes out her outline. I will be reading more of her books soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Sister's Keeper is a keeper","review":"This book is definitely a must read!It is about genetically creating another child to be genetically close to another critically ill child for the purpose of 'parts' while speaking to moral and ethical issues. What makes this book great is the author's ability to view the topics from a legal, personal and family perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still my favorite Picoult book!","review":"I've read almost all of Picoult's book, and this one - which was my first - remains my favorite! I didn't even see the recent motion picture, as I heard they changed one of the major events in the book. Stick with the book!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My Sisters Keeper","review":"This is my first of her books, also my last. Way too much sorrow just added for the fun of it. The ending was terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Controversy mistaken for depth","review":"The only thing that makes this book even appear to be worthwhile is it's \\"controversial topic\\" (which is advertised right on the cover). I was so irritated with how awful this book was it took me over an hour to chill my brain enough to start a new one. So often controversy is mistaken for depth. This book had none. I thought it was going to be great but the more I read the more I was proved wrong. The characters are absurdly one-dimensional while constantly try to claim otherwise through out the book but ultimately don't. This book is not even worth the paper it is printed on. Normally if I don't like a book I donate to the thrift store or give it BCID on bookcrossing. This one I tossed directly into the recycling."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true page turner","review":"This is an incredible book. I picked it up and flew right through it. It is a great book for anyone to read, but especially for people looking for book club selections. As I got to the end, I really wanted to talk about it with someone, but at that point, no one else I knew had read it. I did get my own sister to read it though, and she also loved it and I finally had someone to discuss it with. The mix of perspectives really adds to the depth of the novel. Overall, I thought the writing style was similar to The Lovely Bones, which is another incredible novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Symbolic Ending","review":"I noticed that a great many reviewers did not like the ending, yet I feel that the ending does not detract from this touching novel. In fact, the ending symbolizes lost chances (for all characters), the unlived life, and the pain that comes from not being able to show someone how you feel before it is too late. With all of the focus on one child, the other is only considered too late."},{"rating":"2","title":"Imagine your purpose in life","review":"That's what this book showed me. Imagine that the only reason you exist is for a harvest, a collection vehicle if you will... sort of like I imagine chickens and cows being. Your only purpose (so you think) is not for yourself but for someone else. The story was told from views of other characters in the story and was well written, except I still have problems with the Mother in it. I cried at the end and was 'in' the main characters eyes when she explained how 'invisible' she was in the family... except for her purpose, yet, she had no idea how valuable she really was. It's about choices and accepting those choices. The last few chapters had me in tears, yet enlightened me."},{"rating":"1","title":"capitalizing on important human social dilemma","review":"This book capitalizes on a socially important subject without contributing any intrinsic value. Witness: the product placements, ineffective use of \\"in their voice\\" due to inadequate character development, and the cheap-shot ending. The intention appears to me as simple mental manipulation of the masses to equate the importance of this book with the importance of the singular question on which the story is based. Tabloid-style sensationalism always finds a popular audience; selfish capitalism prevails over social responsibility in the short term. However, if a genuine, constructive exchange of ideas regarding this human social dilemma is generated as a result of this book then perhaps it is worth the paper on which it is printed after all."},{"rating":"1","title":"alright..","review":"The book was not in the best condition, the spine was bent many times and the cover and inside was worn."},{"rating":"1","title":"SPOILER - Weak ending!!!","review":"I was entangled in Ms. Picoult's writing from page one. I truly loved her style and thought I had found a new favorite, but the ending was a stretch to say the least. SOOOOOOOO disappointing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Page turner...","review":"Jodi Picoult is a very good author. This is my second Picoult novel that I have read.This is a very good novel. The author writes from the sister's point of view, the mother, the brother, the father, the court appointed advocate, and the lawyer. I enjoy this style of writing. A very enjoyable read and I could barely put it down. Interesting ending. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Five Star book until the end!","review":"I agree with the other readers. The book is GREAT until the last few chapters as we watch Anna struggle to find her purpose in the world. Her purpose other than just saving her sister Kate. But then....the author gives us an unsatisfying ending that's a total disappointment. It's a copout and outrageous. And the end totally erases every step every single character took on their journey to the end of the book. Boo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't wait for it to end!","review":"The only reason I give it more than one star is that the premise upon which the story was based was an interesting one. But that's where my appreciation ends. Aside from being about 200 pages too long, the most disturbing fact was that all of the character's voices sounded exactly the same. I continually had to go back to the start of the chapter to figure out who was talking b/c the mother sounded like Anna who sounded like the Dad who...you get the point. I also found myself getting annoyed because no matter how bright they may be, 13 year olds aren't nearly as insightful and philosphical as Anna was. And to be quite honest, neither are most adults! And that lack of authenticity made the entire story implausible. I was more irritated than moved by the subplot about the brother that ended up going nowhere and the ending.... come ON!If My Sister's Keeper is an accurate representation of Picoult's work, I think I've had my fill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Believe The Hype!","review":"This book was a huge let down. As a mother of a special needs child with a rare disorder and a multitude of hospital procedures...I expected it to have a little more depth of emotion. I had plenty of woulda, coulda, shouldas...but what parent hasn't struggled? It felt inauthentic and flat for me, but perhaps a lay-parent would find it emotional, never reached for the tissue like most reviewers said I would do.The ending was lame...that is all I can say. I would never ever describe it as a \\"twist\\" by any stretch of the imagination.Although the charaters were endearing at thier basic level,the book didn't deliver in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!","review":"This book is perfect for teenagers! It challenges the morality of \\"designer babys\\". Such a beautiful story and it is the perfect length. It is a book that both a daughter and a mother can read and still get great message out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait, what? Kindle $2.11 *more* than paperback?","review":"You have got to be kidding me. I don't think so; not going to happen. Publishers need to get in touch with reality and price accordingly."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is a pretty interesting read","review":"The book is generally pretty good. It contains mostly likeable, interesting characters that you learn more about as time passes on. Though many people rant on about the ending I like books with those type of abrupt/messed up endings so yeah. I'm making this a vague review because should just read it and judge it by themselves and stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unresolved Issues","review":"I read My Sister's Keeper for the first time as a part of the 2012 World Book Night. Picoult is a captivating and suspenseful writer. She creates unpredictable drama filled with momentum and insight. The entire book switches first person voices between each of the characters. This is somewhat unsettling as she develops them to an interesting point and then switches to another character. After a while, the reader acclimates to this style. Throughout the book the writer builds complexity and emotion, but then lets readers down with a convenient ending which mechanically resolves the issues and at the same time leaves them entirely unresolved. The ending does not match the complexity of the rest of the book. Apart from this, the book is well-written and an excellent read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This book is amazing.... The author captivates the readers attention in so many ways.... With this book expect the unexpected...its so thrilling that you can't put the book down... with this book you get it all drama, romance, mystery, ect... As a mother I was able to brainstorm and put myself in an uncomfortable position but that is what real life is all about...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written, thought provoking read","review":"This book tells the story of a family with a terminally ill child through multiple points of view. The book really held my interest and was fast-moving. The author conveys the frustrations the other characters feel about the 13-year-old daughter's wish to sue her family. Her motivations are unclear and her moods change constantly. While the daughter's actions are realistic for a teen, I felt that her language was not. This was one weak spot in the book, as she often spouted comebacks or phrases that seemed too glib and adult. (Saying this as parent of a pretty sharp-tongued 13 year old). Overall, this was an engrossing read with a couple of surprising twists at the end, which I won't reveal. I could easily see this becoming a movie. The book brings up difficult issues which would make it an excellent book club read, and I think any parent will find it fascinating."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Sisters Keeper","review":"Very interesting book. Plays on your emotions. I wanted to know more of what was happening, but I would have to set aside until my emotions were under control. Keeps your interest from start to finish!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a must read","review":"I give it 4 stars because it dragged a little bit but for the most part it's a really interesting story, a tear jerker and there's a twist no one would expect. Get it and enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally heartwrenching","review":"I am not sure what made me pick up this book. I am typically not into authors who mass produce books, but for some reason I picked it up and couldn't put it down. The story was rather typical, one daughter has life threatening cancer, the other was conceived just so she could help her sister, but that is where the story stopped being typical. Once the healthy sister reached a certain age, she go tired of being a human pin cushion and the events that follow are tragic. The story explores family dynamics and the effects of that sort of stress on the family as a whole. I really like that the story was told from various perspectives because it allowed the novel to be less two-dimensional. I only gave the book 4 stars because I believe the ending was flawed. While it left me touched and I cried, I felt it could have been done better, it seemed to have too much of a Lifetime Movie of the week ending. All in all it is a beautiful novel, and worth the time spent reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of my time!","review":"I suffered through this book because I liked the character of Anna. The author spends far too much time evaluating the personal lives and back-stories of marginal characters. It was the ending of the book, however, that destroyed the novel. It was surreal. It was cliche. It was a cheap shot. The author claims there was no other way to realistically end this novel. Really? What are the chances in real life of such a false turn of events. Shaking my head and wishing I hadn't wasted my time on this book. Sorry, Anna. The author went for melodrama instead of giving you the choices you fought for."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've been had!","review":"Jodi, Jodi, Jodi. Why'd you have to play me that way? I fell in love with you characters, warts and all, because they felt so real. And then you ripped the rug out from under me with such a far-fetched, sensationalistic ending. I just wanted to scream. You don't need to do that. You're such a fantastic writer. What felt so real turned suddenly false. I wished you'd given this book the ending it deserved, then I would have added two more stars to this review."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to throw this book across the floor (or put it in my garbage disposal","review":"I will indulge in brain-candy from time to time and wasn't expecting great literature when I read this book. I found the plot cheesy and contrived throughout, but I didn't get really pissed off until the end. What the hell? The author spends all this time trying make us think about this difficult question, and then \\"poof,\\" never mind, she can get that kidney anyway. This was the first, and I can promise you last, book of Jodi Picoult's that I will ever read. I resent an author copping out so spectacularly. Perhaps leprechauns could have come down and taken everyone off to a magical little world and they'd all live happily ever after."},{"rating":"1","title":"So let down","review":"I really enjoyed the start of this book, the characters seemed complex, parents struggling with the heartbreak of a child slowly dying complicated by the moral dilemmas that genetic selection bring to medicine, but long before the end I felt like Jodi Picoult had stolen valuable hours of my life. The end is so ridiculous, i felt I was watching a cheap one hour TV show where all the loose ends have to be wrapped up in the last 10 minutes. The fact that someone would still be devastated about being dumped by their High School boyfriend 15 years after it happened began to seem normal compared to the drivel that followed - if only I could get a time refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT Page Turner!!","review":"This book kept me glued from the beginning to the end. The end was quite a surprise. All characters were likeable. Very good read. I plan to read the rest of the books by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"drawn out, dull and predictable","review":"This author had high recommedations, now I am not sure if I will try any of her other books"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow.","review":"A fantastic read and a great book. I definitely recommend this book to anybody. It has a very surprising ending. Great, great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking something...","review":"This book was recommended to me by a number of people. It was a well-written and very compelling read. However, I thought the ending was completely false and was created with shock value in mind. I didn't expect a happy ending, but a realistic one. I was disappointed with this book. I just finished The True and Outstanding Adventures of the Hunt Sisters by Elisabeth Robinson. It deals with similar themes and it just felt so much more true to me. Buy that one instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Sister's Keeper: A Novel","review":"What a very touching story...that with stem cell research, could be true!

Thanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Book will be an awesome movie!","review":"This book wil be an awesome movie!It is always a pleasure to order books from Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting and Timely Premise Flattened by Metaphor, Coincidence and Irony","review":"I was willing to finish this book, but I hurried through the second half because I wanted it to be over, not because I couldn't wait to see how it ended. The book is a lot longer than it should be because the author is constantly kicking the reader in the face with metaphors. And the ironical ending was really too much. The characters are flat in spite of all their introspection, and things work out so patly at the end that it's ridiculous (one character, a felonious arsonist with a drug and alcohol problem who steals construction equipment in his spare time, becomes a police officer!). The mother is incredibly difficult to like considering her very legitimate grief. And a romance subplot between attorneys works out in spite of the guy being a huge jerk because his lady-love finds out that he, of all things, suffers from a disability. Though well-written to some degree, I simply can't recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful read","review":"This is a wonderful book on a very difficult subject matter. I almost cried when I read it and thinking about it there's no better ending for the story than the one it has, albeit a sad and maybe shocking one.The side story is a little bit blah, but with a strong main story with a wonderful protagonist that you'll absolutely love, you won't mind about it's minor plot defects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing story about where loyalties lie","review":"This is an amazing story about a young girl wanting to no longer be invisible and redefining her loyalties to her sister and family. About how a family is broken and disjointed by one parents devotion to heal her sick child. Very touching, the story brought me to tears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good read","review":"I normally read nonfiction buy this was a gift so I gave it a read. I couldn't put the book down. The story was well written. I could see this happening (in fact have seen the basic part of the story just not the lawsuit). It pulls at the heartstrings and makes you think what you would do if EVER in such a situation. It did jump around a bit but that didn't matter to the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"if you want a good Piccoult book choose Salem Falls or Vanishing Acts","review":"My Sister's Keeper was a let down for me. I am typically a fan of Piccoult's work which has the tendency to push the bar on plausibility and does often lean to the over dramatic side but usually the plot and her writing strengths such as settings and characterization keep a balance in her work, this novel just got ridiculous. The ending was silly. This book attempted to take on too many issues at once had this merely involved the two sisters it would have been enough but throwing in the issues of the lawyers, the mother, the father and practically the son's problems gave this book the feeling of everything but the kitchen sink, if you want a good Piccoult book choose Salem Falls or Vanishing Acts both of which are well done and are real page turners."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST READ","review":"I purchased this book based on a recommendation from a friend, who is a cancer survivor.

Keep a box of tissues close."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't read the last ten pages","review":"This was a well written and thoughtful book dealing with a serious and real issue in today's world of scientific manipulation of human lives. However the last ten pages made me really angry. Seriously I was yelling at this book after reading the last ten pages. She Really needed a better editor."},{"rating":"1","title":"She Lost Me","review":"I enjoyed nearly the entire book. Until I got to the end. (This next part contains spoilers..) Okay, this was where she lost me. It turns out the lawyer has epilepsy and has a seizure in the courtroom. Then, he drives Anna home and they get in a car accident because he gets hit by a drunk driver and she gets killed. All right, that would never happen. Why? BECAUSE IT'S AGAINST THE LAW FOR AN EPILEPTIC TO DRIVE AFTER HE HAD A SEIZURE!!!!Anna's father was the Fire Chief. He would certainly have known that. The lawyer would have known that-a seizure equals an automatic revoking of your driver's license. The judge would have known that-and anyway, even if that wasn't the case (which it is) whose parents are stupid enough to let them get in the car with an epileptic who just seized driving? Sorry, but Picoult and her editor dropped the ball on this one. A little more research, please."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want 45 minutes of my life back!","review":"Disclaimer: I read the first 100 pages, unstuck my eyes from the back of my head, then read the last 30.Good God, is this book ever terrible. And manipulative. And borderline unrealistic. And downright predictable. I had the entire plot figured out around page 30, but I didn't think I was actually going to be THAT right.Don't get me wrong, I'm touched at the thought that a middle class, two parent, suburban WASP-y family has enough money, time and resources (did I mention money?) to genetically design a baby to be born just to save the life of another. But that's only what...15% of the American population? 1% of the world? If you don't fall into that perfect little category, your child is probably screwed.Oh, and just to add to the STAGGERING errors Ms. Picoult made: minors cannot pawn property. It's a felony. So sayeth this former pawnbroker. (I'm also a former paralegal, but I won't go there.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I've read in years!","review":"My Sister's Keeper has to be the best book I've read in years. Written in journal format, you see the story from all character's points of view. An amazing novel. I recommend it to everyone, young and old."},{"rating":"1","title":"After hearing so much about this author...ugh","review":"I have heard so much about this author from friends, fellow teachers, my mother, etc. This is the first one of her novels I have read. I was hooked by page 2. Thought this is amazing. What a crazy idea, different format, can't wait to read more. Then things went goofy. Mom was talking in the past, now she's present tense, weird sub-plot of the attorney and his dog, does the brother have to be a pyro?! It was all too much and became cliche and predictable down to the ridiculous ending. A book made for Lifetime. It was just plain stupid. I hesitate to read any others by her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Reading, Very Touching","review":"This is a great story...really grabs your heart...be prepared to cry with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of her best!","review":"If you have never read a Picoult novel this is a good one to start with. Her story of a family dealing with the illness of one child is moving, and a testament to holding on the what you have right in front of you. If you are just looking for a good book to read or a fabulous new author to start this is the book and this is the author. But be warned... reading a Picoult book is addictive and I have given this book to my mom and both my sisters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twenty Four Hankie Book","review":"I rented this book on CD from my local library so I could listen to it in the car. BIG mistake. It's really hard to see where you're going when you're sobbing. I can't tell you how many times I gasped at the twists and turns. Overall, it was a good book, but the ending was horrible. I'm more of the happy ending type of gal."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read!","review":"I loved this book! The ending is totally different then you would think.I recommend this book to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"In the end...not worth the read.","review":"I am someone who rarely has the time to just sit down and read. I really wanted to read this book before seeing the movie. I wish I had just seen the movie and didn't bother with the book. I agree with some of the reviewers that it was overly contrived and melodramic. Each chapter was told from a different characters point of view. I would find myself putting the book down when certain characters were telling the story. I really didn't care what they were thinking. I too hated the ending. It was such a cop out by the author.As I read this, I kept thinking of the story The Sound and the Fury which I read in highschool. It was told in a similar fashion but features realistic tragic characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Sister's Keeper","review":"Great condition, great book!

So, out of curiosity, I purchased it and anticipated tears streaming down my cheeks.Here I am, 350 pages, I have not got one single tear, nor have I felt the emotion to cry. ALL I got is anger.The author tried wayyyyyy too hard to write those cheesy, sappy lines. The 13 year old Anna thinks like a 53, who has been through everything in life. Brian and Sara are the same. Almost everyone in this book thinks so philosophically that I can not stop rolling my eyes.There is really nothing good about this book. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE this book!!!!","review":"I loved this book. It usually takes me a couple of weeks to get through a book but I couldn't put this down, I must have finished it in 3 days. At times, my eyes watered up with tears because I thought of my own daughters but it wasn't so sad that I put the book down, even for a second to grab a tissue. 2 thumbs up!! I'll definitely be reading Jodi Picoult's other books after reading this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad but Fascinating","review":"This book and movie definately makes you question morality and life. It's a very sad story but worth the read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, but maybe not great to read pre-movie watching","review":"I got this book so I could read it before seeing the movie. I still haven't seen the movie since I'm waiting for it to come out on dvd, but the book was great. The whole scenario gets you thinking about how you would handle the situation if you were in each of the characters' shoes. It was also definitely a tear-jerker. A few negative comments, the book seemed to repeat itself. It felt like there were some points the author kept repeating just to get herself across. Also, I'm not sure the movie is going to be as good now that I know how it ends..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grab a box of tissues before you read!","review":"This is one of those books that pulls you in from the beginning. I read this book in 2 days, I just couldn't put it down. It is very sad at the end and tissues are highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good until the end","review":"I enjoyed this book for its hard look at the moral consequences of modern medicine, and the ethical dilemmas faced by families coping with grave illness.But the \\"surprise ending\\" was a dud. It avoided having to face, and live with, the consequences of the issues confronted in the rest of the book. It is as if the author couldn't face the difficult, and true, issues that were meant to be the focus of the story.A coward's ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"such a disappointing ending","review":"I could not put this book down. There were so many thought-provoking moral questions posed that I really wanted to discuss it with someone. And then the ending; what a letdown to see things tied up so neatly.

Missing 30 pages from the middle!","review":"My copy of this book ordered from amazon is missing 30 pages from the middle, starting on page 310. Talk about a disappointment! I will change my review if amazon agrees to my request for a refund. I was leaning towards 4 stars until the missing page fiasco completely ruined the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written with a bias...Pre-implantation genetic screening is not baby engineering!","review":"1 Star only because this book is well written. The plot is manipulated (to the point of being completely unrealistic) to make a case against pre-implantation genetic screening. If you know the story of the Denver-based family this book was inspired by, this book will upset you. Facts are twisted. This results in the spread of misinformation and is hurtful to those unfortunate enough to be in a similar situation. Genetic screening is not baby engineering. Why would someone want to turn something that was so helpful to a family into something so awful?"},{"rating":"1","title":"willful use of urban legends","review":"Ever hear the urban legend about the guy who insures a box of expensive cigars, then smokes 'em and tries to claim the insurance money because the cigars were destroyed by fire? Ms. Picault has the girls' father, a firefighter, tell his wife this story as if it were original. Later Ms. Picoult has the judge in the story's case state that he knows - because a relative who's a dentist told him - that a tooth left in a glass of coke will rot.What? Does Ms. Picoult think her readers are so stupid that they don't recognize an urban legend when they read one? If she doesn't bother to do even the most simple fact-checking, why should we accept any medical, social, or ethical premise of hers?While her subject matter is interesting, if you fall for her story line, I've got ocean front property in Arizona that might be of interest to you. Good grief."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"I bought the book because of this sudden hype about Picoult. Well, folks, I hate to tell you, it's another one of those incidents where the publisher decides to sell more books by a certain author and Picoult happens to be the flavor of the month. The book has an intriguing premise, and certainly deserves a more engaging way to tell the story - something which Picoult doesn't have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suitable for afternoon soap opera","review":"I found so many things about this book that made it totally unbelievable beginning with the character of Anna whose mind works more like a 30 year old than a teenager such as commenting on the name and price of cocktails. Not many lawyers are going to take a case without pay and spend this much time and become this emotionally involved. A mother who is also a lawyer isn't going to put herself in such a compromising position as Sara (and when did she find time to do all this -- legal work and mother of sick child). The coincidences just keep occurring: child advocate exlover of lawyer, son an arsonist with father a fireman, then father an EMT who rescues his daughter. And that ending was just too pat. In short, this is a good \\"beach read\\" but nothing of real substance here, and too bad because the subject is worth exploring"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a Lifetime Original Movie","review":"I read this book for my book club and was excited to try a new author. I plowed through it in a few sittings, but overall I was disappointed. The author uses different fonts for each character's narration, which comes across as gimmicky. Her writing style lacks fluidity, with recurring flashbacks that do not add much to the character development or plot. The story is predictable and the ending is a complete cop-out. This is not good literature, but more like a Lifetime Original Movie. (And over 400 pages of it!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting plot, terrible writing","review":"Just read the first half, then skip to the epilogue. I actually kind of liked the ending, although I have to admit it was a bit contrived. The writing was filled with too many modern cultural references (infomercials, Spiderman movies), cliches, bad metaphors--and what was up with the different font for each voice? These writing techniques were just too gimmicky--they detracted from an otherwise fascinating subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a disappointment.","review":"I cannot remember ever being so angry at an author for jerking me around as I was with Jodi Picoult when I got to the end of this book. I was willing to ignore the ridiculous coincidences (such as Julia and Campbell both working on this case--are there only a dozen people in this town?--and Jesse's crimes affecting both Brian and the judge) and overly affected writing because the plot was so engaging. But Picoult's idiotic and gratuitous surprise ending is unforgivable. I can't believe I wasted a day reading this book only to be jerked around at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did I bother?","review":"About 100 pages into this really terrible, incredibly predictable, poorly written garbage I argued with myself about continuing. But I was on a plane and the flight had 3 more hours to go. From my seat, I couldn't see the movie screen, so I plodded on.I should have taken a long nap....you should too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thin Thin Thin","review":"I had high hopes for this book. I thought it would be very interesting but the author dropped the ball completely. I was surprised to find out later how well informed she was about this issue but shared nothing of this with her readers. My overall opinion is that she was making stuff up as she went along. When she referred twice to a \\"plea bargain\\" in an emancipation case, I had to wonder if she had even the barest knowledge of family court. The fact that she rendered the entire law suit, the major conflict in the plot, pointless when she established early on that no organ transplant would or could ever take place from an unwilling donor made the whole book pointless as well. Then she feeds us a bunch of tripe about two angry, would-be lovers who snipe at each other the whole way through this boring book, I felt like I was reading a bodice ripper from my grandmother's book shelf. The characters were under-developed, the plot underfed, the ending embarrassing. Skip this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful to Read","review":"This was the worst book I have read in a long time. Between the changing of narrative voice to make up for its weak character development, the incredibly over-dramatized plot, the unbelievable plot twists, and above all, the idiotic (I'm sorry, there's no other word for it) ending, this book's greatest contribution to my life experience was to make me appreciate the beauty, complexity, and value of real literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"We all know life is not fair","review":"This book is one of the sadest ones out there. It is about humanity, and selflesness. Usually selflesness is a good thing, but where do we draw the line? Is there a time when it is OK to be selfish, and give up selflessness? The book strongly and unbiasly relays the burden selfless decisions incurr on it's loyals. The little girl with the ability to save her sister, is suffering from her constant giving; and to live a normal life, she must quit giving, and may result in her sister's death.Then fate brings a twist to the story, and the book ends unexpectedly, leaving the above questions left un-answered. The ending higlights how unfair and sneaky life is. It's a good book to read if you are feeling sorry for yourself, and you think your life is miserable, and are looking for a story worse than yours, so you can feel better... Therapy for those who need help to appreciate their blessings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great writer","review":"I ordered it for someone else who likes this kind of fiction writing and that person has loved reading it,"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Sister's Keeper is a fantastic read.","review":"I would have like for this book to have never ended. Picoult does a wonderul job of bringing each character to life. I felt as though I knew each character personally & could empaathize with their feelings. This book centers on a disease but that becomes just a small part of the focus of the story. The characters each have a pivotal role & I like the way several storylines are occuring at once & how the lives of all the characters begin to intersect. I highly reccomend this book to anyone who has a sibling or is part of a family. It is also a good read for anyone delaing with a serious family illness. Great read that I will definately enjoy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Page Turner","review":"If you need to get lost in a page turner- this is it! A bit unrealistic in coincidence at the end- but I couldn't put this book down for two days. Twist and turns and I had tears running down my face. I am looking forward to reading Nineteen Minutes, my second novel by this author. I confess I read ahead- but it was wonderful even knowing the ending (though, I DON'T recommend spoiling the book as I did). I still think of this book weeks later- the message I walked away with was a reminder - Live life in every moment like it matters- and everyone matters in each moment I'm in; there are always distractions."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fresh, Thoughtful Pageturner!","review":"How far do you go to save the life of your dying child? And is it possible for a parent distinquish between the love they feel for their children? I put the premise of this book to my mother, and she had no answers for me. As a mother of two, all she said was, \\"send me the book, then I'll tell you.\\" But I don't think she'll have an answer either. I can imagine that a book club could hold some GREAT discussions about the plot of this book, and the ethics of giving birth to one child for the specific purpose of saving another.On one hand, I have never read anything by Jodi Picoult, so I was very pleased to \\"discover\\" someone new. But I will admit that can't say that the voice of this novel is very different or any fresher than her other novels, and clearly she is very prolific.But this was clear -- this is a great, compelling tale. I am recommending it to all my sister-friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotional Stir","review":"One regular family can have such deep troubles with all the aspects of their \\"Everyday\\" life. Learned, or should I say, I was reminded how a family's health is the most important thing in the world and how precious moment each moment with your whole family is. A great, entertaining story as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tremendous Classic, A Generous Author","review":"My Sister's Keeper is a story of love, hate and revenge. Jodi decsribes the characters lives in a compelling, pure author's craft. The story starts off with getting to know the different lives of the various characters and the obstacles they face with a contreversial trial of a girl suing her family for letting them \\"use\\" her body for her lukeimic sister. The book tangles in well like hands closing together. I had the chance to meet Jodi personally and I absolutely loved her. She was funny, something you seee throughout her book, and generous.Please take time to read the excellent book that will go down in the books as a classic for many, many lifetimes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This was the first book by Jodi Picoult that I ever read. I found that the flashbacks from Sara were helpful in showing where her loyalties were, on Kate or Anna. While I find that a character like Jesse is stereotypical in this type of novel, he provides an interesting viewpoint and is a chance to escape the drama of the novel for a while. One problem that I had with the book was in the way it was designed. I did not like how different fonts were used for different characters. I understand why Picoult would do this, but to me it seems unneccessary. The book brings up some great issues on what promises to be more and more in the spotlight as science and biology progress. A book that I definitely recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sister's Keeper is a keeper :)","review":"This is the saddest book I've ever read. However, I think everyone should read it. It really explores family relationships (not just sisters)during difficult times. It's easy to empathize with the characters in the storyline because you are given all of their perspectives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep your tissues handy!","review":"When my book club met to discuss this book last month, the first question asked was \\"How hard did you cry?\\". I personally feel that any story in which I can come to care about the characters so much that I am deeply moved by the events in their lives is an excellent and worthy read.Jodi Picoult does just that -- she draws you in to care about all the characters so that you feel just as conflicted as each individual in the story does about the difficult subject they are facing. The issues that Picoult tackled were large, weighty ones, and often I am skeptical of such ambitions, typically judging authors on their use of the subject as a cheap, cliched device. I did not feel that way with this novel. I thought the issue was explored sensitively and moreover, that the characterization was at the forefront of the novel, which is what kept it from being a cheap storyline. It made for an interesting discussion about such a difficult and interesting issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reader in New Zealand","review":"Awesome, riveting... but yes, I too didn't like the ending. But don't let that stop you as the story along the way is well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gripping story","review":"My Sister's Keeper is full of suspense: a young girl named Anna fights to save her sister Kate her entire life as if it was her job. In Fact it is her job, she was born to save Kate.It is definate that you will connect with one of the characters, as you gain many views of how it is for one person in your family to have a disease and to see how it effects the others in your family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emily - PR","review":"In My Sister's Keeper, Anna Fitzgerald was conceived and born so that she could provide blood, tissue, and marrow for her older sister, Kate, who suffers from leukemia. When Kate is 16 and Anna is 13, Kate needs a kidney transplant and Anna balks at giving up one of hers. She hires a lawyer to petition for medical emancipation from her parents, so that she alone can make decisions about her body. It's a decision that threatens to tear the family apart, from her mother who gave up a law practice to be a stay-at-home mom, an older brother who feels left out, and her father who wavers between choosing sides. Jodi Picoult's novel examines the inner workings of a family struggling to find love, and life, within all their relationships. Anna's moral struggle and being able to examine the situation from the standpoint of everyone involved made this novel a very emotional experience for me. It was one of those books that makes you cry, but in a cleansing way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great story, bad ending","review":"I agree with the previous posters about the ending... which is a damned shame because I was looking forward to watching how this author would deal with the endgame of an interesting story. She really took the cowardly way out. I wish she had trusted her characters to finish up what they had started, but she didn't, and it's a shame. My disappointment will certainly prevent me from investing further time or money on any other of her books, at least for a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"The ultimate letdown","review":"I almost quit reading-- I wish I had--when Dr Chance is on the stand and testifies that no hospital would force a child to donate an organ against her will, no matter what her parents want.

I loved how I got to know every character from their own point of view and from everyone else's point of view as well. By the end, I understood where all of them were coming from, even the ones that weren't necessarily \\"sympathetic\\" characters.The thing that I keep coming back to, though, is that the book needed to end a few chapters earlier than it did. I can't really say why here without giving everything away, but I'll say I thought the last few chapters were a real copout and I would have been happier with the book if it had been left more open-ended. This is not a happy ending kind of issue, I know, but it's also not one you can tie up in a neat bundle at the end, and I think that's what the last few chapters tried to do. The result seemed contrived."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: not for men","review":"This novel purports to explore an issue of reliance on sibling donation to rescue a sibling from medical danger. In this case, it's a daughter conceived to be a donor to her older sister, suffering from leukemia. However, since the cast of characters never seems to have a conversation that lasts more than three exchanges before blowing up, nothing ever really gets explored. What we have is 400 pages of endless feelings - guilt, jealousy, anger, resentment, bitterness, anxiety, blah, blah, blah - capped by a prepostrously tacked-on twist at the end. If you want to read for empathy alone, this one's for you. If you're looking for a well-written, thoughtful, provocative novel, don't go here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puh-lease!!! Give me a break with the drama!","review":"I could not put this one down- I finished it in one evening, I just couldn't wait to find out what happened next, with the family and the court case. However, I was deeply disappointed by the ending. It was lame, it was soap opera-esque, it was so unworthy of this great story. Tacked-on and totally unneeded- it should have ended ten pages sooner, that would have be a fine conclusion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes you aware","review":"Makes you aware of some of the medical miracles happening in this country.I passed this on to my daughter as she is a special teacher."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"this is a wonderfully written engaging read and overall great book! i think everyone can relate to this story in some way, and it's wonderful how the narration changes from the first person of the main characters. really enjoyed this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well done!","review":"This was a tricky book to write - it is difficult to fully create sympathy for many of the characters in this book, based on its almost sci-fi plotline. However, Picoult is able to do it credibly and the rest of the book is carried along by the amazing storyline (which has been well document in these reviews).I highly recommend this book if you are looking for a thoughtful look at the nature of family and sacrifice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting book","review":"The book tackles a topic which could be true in todays society. the story is told by different characters, each giving you their version of the story. It's a clever technique to keep the reader from choosing sides, and by giving almost all the characters a voice. The book has an unexpected ending, which will leave you surprised!!I highly recommend this book, because it will leave you thinking at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book","review":"I absolutely loved this book. I've also read \\"Picture Perfect,\\" which I also enjoyed and \\"Vanishing Acts,\\" which was worth the read, but nothing to rave about. \\"My Sister's Keeper\\" kept me up nights worried about Anna and her family. The characters were so developed that I became attached the ending devastated me. I didn't see it coming that way."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing novel","review":"this book is amazing. You cant stop reading it and after yor are finished, you cant stop thinking about tthe characters. I loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheesy, made-for-TV movie","review":"First I'll say this is the first (and probably only) Jodi Picoult novel I've ever read. I'm not usually a fiction reader but this book was recommended to me after my daughter was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis.While I think the storyline is a good one (and I don't even mind the ending) the writing is HORRIBLE. I can't even count the number of cheesy, obvious \\"ironies\\" and \\"foreshadowing\\". I'd say this book is about the level of reading for an 8th grader, if you took out the few \\"f words\\" and sexually suggestive \\"scenes\\".As for \\"scenes\\", that's my next point - this book was so OBVIOUSLY written to be turned into a Lifetime movie it isn't funny. Each chapter is from a different characters' first person point-of-view, and there is not much besides dialog and flashbacks.I feel like the time I spent reading this book was a waste - if someone had simply taken 5 to 10 minutes to tell me a detailed synopsis, I'd feel just as satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"GRRRRR","review":"To have read 99% of the book and become involved in the characters, to appreciate what great story this has been...and then, BAM, a cheap and mean ending that will inspire you to throw the book across the room.....imagine if at the end of Gone With the Wind...after Scarlet raises her fist and declares she will never be hungry again...she walks off and steps on a land mine (or something appropriate to the era) and blows to pieces.....that is the type of ending you are given here."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasing mixture of heartbreak and humor","review":"Despite the warning of many fellow readers that this novel is too \\"depressing,\\" or not worth reading, I was intrigued by the subject matter and finally decided to give it a try. To tell the truth, I found it to be, for the most part, both engrossing and entertaining. The \\"comic relief\\" provided by Campbell the lawyer's perspective gives a welcome balance to the heart-wrenching agony the various members of the Fitzgerald family must endure.There are a couple of concerns other reviewers have expressed, however, that I tend to agree with. It bothered me also that the crushing financial burden Kate's constant care must surely have placed on the family never seemed to be an issue, despite the fact that they were obviously not well-to-do. My other concern is with the ending, which I felt came too abruptly, and which struck me as unrealistic. Overall, I would still recommend the book for its brutally honest treatment of an extremely difficult subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dear Jodi Picoult, (spoiler included)","review":"This is the first and the last of your books that I will read. I was enjoying the book in spite of the cliched characters and the often unrealistic dialogue. Then the entire book was destroyed by a totally manipulative ending. I agree completely with the Most Helpful negative review by Susan Jones and the other one star reviews. You should have listened to your son and not the oncology nurse (re: interview with author at the back of the book). An oncology nurse would surely be biased toward saving the cancer patient. And wasn't Kate's doctor saying before the trial that Kate was too sick to survive a kidney transplant?I am reminded of the author's dilemma in the movie \\"Stranger than Fiction\\". Killing off her main character might have made her book great (it did not yours), but she did the right thing and let him live. Anna's mother claimed she did the right thing. She didn't and neither did you."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Sister's Keeper","review":"I was looking for a book to read while on vacation, and my daughter recommended this one. It was a bit confusing at the beginning because of the flashbacking and multiple characters, but then I really got into it. I had a hard time putting it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insulting to the reader","review":"When we readers begin a book, we expect the author to put the main character in at least one difficult situation and work her way out. The ending of this book is a cop-out. Picoult took the easy way out and lost some readers' respect and readership. That was the last book of hers I ever read. The term for this not-respected plot device Is \\"deus ex machina,\\" which implies a lack of imagination on the author's part. Ms. Picoult apparently couldn't figure out a way for her protagonist to work her way through the plot's challenges via the protaganist's brains or sheer guts. Ms. Picoult could have and should have done better.This book reads like she had a deadline to meet, so she went for a quick, coincidental ending to the disservice and annoyance of some of her readers. Too bad. She seems to get her story ideas from the newspaper and then sensationalizes them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too good to be true.","review":"This book starts off amazing.

It's real."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book from a great author","review":"I picked up this book after hearing Jodi Picoult speak at a local library event. If you think that her books are good, then go and hear her speak; she is fantastic. This book is so moving. What makes it especially poignant is that each of the characters has a chance to speak to the reader in the book and tell the story from his/her perspective. This just adds to the books complexity; really making it multi-dimensional. I would not hesitate to recommend this book to any reader or book club....just bring along the tissues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell way short","review":"This was an EXCELLENT idea for a book but the writing was not the greatest and the ending was a total cop out. What a shame to let such a great idea fall short like this. I mean one son is an arsonist and by the end of the book he is a total hero and with no explanation??? Author needs to work on her inability to flesh out a story so it is at the very least vaguely believable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely upsetting","review":"I was all set to give this novel 4 stars up until the very end.

I was extremely annoyed and generally upset by lack of disregard for readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, trite and contrived","review":"This is not my usual fare- so perhaps I'm disqualified- but this was an awful book. Banal language. Cliché sentiments. Metaphors and similes stretched so thin they were almost breaking. I thought if I had to read ONE MORE thing about stars and fire and how brave and strong the father is I was going to lose it. And the son, Jesse, is every mild-mannered woman's image of the \\"rebel\\" kid. Give me a break. There are so many coincidences in this book it makes Jane Eyre look realistic. Unless you are accustomed to reading trashy novels, don't bother with this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first chapter pulled me in.","review":"I was given this book as a gift and may not have read it had it not been. After the first chapter, maybe even the first page, I was captivated. The story is heart-wrenching and should not be overlooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book gives literary fiction a good name","review":"The idea of \\"literary fiction\\" generally makes me ill. It's a pretentious and self-righteous term that seems to say \\"this is much more important than anything you're reading.\\"Jodi Picoult's \\"My Sister's Keeper\\" is literary in the very best sense. Every word is art. Every sentence is crafted like a Ming vase.This book is beauty and emotion and tears wrapped up in pages and ink. I sat in Barnes and Noble for seven hours, unable to put it down. I finished it before I left, but I still bought it, and started again on page 1 when I got home.If you never read another piece of literary fiction, read this one. Twice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart-wrenching and thought-provoking","review":"What a thought-provoking experience this book has been. There are no easy answers for any of the characters and the story line is beautifully developed, with all the unexpected twists.

That, along with the let down in character development, especially towards the end, the use of highly stereotyped characters, made this book a let down in the end. The author used a nice narrative form, and then got lazy with it. Gripping subject matter, but in the end, a result that mooted the entire point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jodi Picoult to the core","review":"Jodi is an incredible writer but she drives me insane with her tragic endings!! I can't give her anything less than 4 stars because of her tremendous talent but I'm a heaping mess when I've finished her books, an emotional wreck!! So that doesn't happen unless she grabs you and takes you into her stories with her and the characters that you grow to love!Can't wait for the movie this summer!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Foul Language Warning","review":"I absolutley loved the storyline of this book. It really made you think about what you would do in this situation. Unfortunately, I was unable to finish the book due to the intensity of the foul language. I tried several times to just get through hoping that would be the last of it, but it just continues so much that I finally had to put the book away. It saddens me that this kind of language has to be present in books. I wish there were warning labels like there are on music that contains explicit language."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall, a great read . . . except for the ending","review":"I am usually a suspense/mystery novel reader, but decided to take a chance on reading a Jodi Picoult novel after high recommendations from friends. I really enjoyed reading this book for the most part. The plot and character development were great. I felt a connection with each of the characters. I could hardly put the book down. I was in great anticipation as to how this would end and, unfortunately, was ultimately disappointed in this regard. I cried, of course, but I felt like the author took the easy way out. When I think of alternative ways this could have ended, I see there would have been room for criticism either way, so maybe there weren't any good options. But, I guess I just hoped the ending would add something more than it did. I'm going to try one more of her books, but if the ending is this disappointing again, I may be done with this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"a depressing, contrived book","review":"I am probably not the right audience for this--this was totally off Lifetime TV. I didn't think any of the characters had his or her own voice except for the son. Nearly every chapter was depressing, and the ending was completely ridiculous.Only the medical scenes were believeable in this book, but that's faint praise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Angry","review":"I could not put this book down. I thought the premise was intriguing and the way that the author switched narrators very clever.I was so upset at the ending that I felt like throwing the book against the wall. What a cop-out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book Ever","review":"I was actually angry when I finished reading the book - it was a HUGE waste of time. The ending is a major cop-out, and the characters are painful clichés. I have no idea how anyone could enjoy this book - it is terrible. It doesn't even deserve a whole star."},{"rating":"1","title":"False and manipulative","review":"To the readers who've commented on the errors in her depiction of epilepsy, add also: 1. You can't tip cows (as Jesse claims to have done). 2. Orange zest doesn't come in a jar (note Julia's reciipe for eggs). 3. If you're going to have multiple points of view, they should all have different voices (all her characters are wisecracking, sensitive souls with bad metaphor habits 4. If one tragic situation is good for the story, that doesn't mean two or three (if you add all the peripheral traumas) will make it even better.Even in fiction, authors need to be honest and credible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I really am disappointed in this book","review":"SPOILER.I have decided that Jodi hates mothers, especially those who parent in difficult situations. She demonizes them, and makes them to be pretty much evil. The other characters are little martyrs to their mothers demands and become self destructive. This is not in just this book but in several of her books. They follow a theme 1.sick kid 2.awful mother 3.passive all along but suddenly stands up for himself father 4.siblings of sick kid who want to self destruct/hurt themselves. 5.lawsuit 6.win lawsuit 7.kill a main character. I just seriously roll my eyes in disgust at her deciding that she really dislikes people who fight for their rights, and especially dislikes women."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Sister's Keeper","review":"Absolutely one of Jodi Picoult's best. It is a beautiful masterpeace that will captivate you from start to finish. The characters and situations are astonishingly realistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Sister's Keeper","review":"Anna is a 13-year-old who was created specifically as a DNA match for her older sister Kate, who has leukemia. Anna has always had to undergo surgeries for her older sister, whether she wanted to or not. But one day, Anna hires a lawyer so she can have the rights to her own body, which means she would never have to undergo surgery for her older sister again. But if she doesn't, her sister may die.This is an excellent, emotional novel on a subject that deserves discussion. Each chapter is from the perspective of a different character, a feature the author uses to move the story along and add suspense. And, despite the sad ending, it is a very interesting story. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ending was ridiculous !","review":"I thought that each of the characters had alot of depth. I felt the struggle all the characters were going through. The drama just kept building ...I never expected a \\"happy\\" ending.I felt like this story had a great pace and urgency then....nothing but a void. I didn't even feel anything but the fact that maybe not having an ending would have been better.The book should have ended with the judge's descion."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great read!","review":"I loved this book. I cried my eyes out. It contains great characters, an important topic for our era, good storytelling. I could have lived without the Jesse storyline, it adds little to the book and it is resolved in a very cursory fashion. But that is the nature of minor characters and subplots. I thought the book was well-written and sympathetic to many different points of view. Brava, Ms. Picoult! I will probably look for more of your works. I have already recommended the book to friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"A page turner","review":"I am usually a slow reader, I pick a book up and read a small part here and there. This book was different, it captured my attention and I didn't want to put it down. Jodi Picoult is one of my new favorite authors and I am going to start reading her other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ending killed me","review":"This was my second Picoult book, so I didn't know about her \\"twists\\" yet. When I finished the book, I was so infuriated that I threw the book across the room. Oy!!!!!!!!! Why oh why did she do that?!I still love the book though :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard choices are never popular","review":"I have read a few reviews and decided I needed to write my own. I thoroughly enjoyed the different presentation of this book. It wasn't difficult at all for me to keep up with each character as it switched back and forth. The ending totally surprised me, but it wasn't what I expected. I've heard other readers criticize the ending. Why? That's the way the story was written. In real life, we moan and groan how things turn out, but there's nothing we can do to change them. This was the first time I read any of Jodi Picoult's work, and if her other books are as well written, I will read more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"I read this because someone in my book club recommended it. It was wonderful and controversial; I couldn't put it down. A surprise ending will leave you guessing and probably in tears (as I was). I would recommend it highly to anyone looking for a good fiction novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome Book","review":"The book was shipped very quickly and the book is a great read. Looking foward to seeing the movie to see how it compares."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Sister's Keeper- the movie version","review":"I loved the story, but frankly was a bit disappointed that they felt the need to stick the \\"f\\" word in so much, and some of the graphic sex. I don't think it makes it anymore believable, and don't believe that people like reading books with that in it. When I was done, I wished I had blackened out that word, and some of the graphic parts, as I'd recommend the book, but wouldn't want anyone else to have to read that stuff either. I'm not a prude, I just find that word and some of the graphics un-necessary and offensive. Other than that it was a very good book. I wonder if the original writing had that in there, or if it was just added in the movie version?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book I've Ever Read","review":"When I was done with this book, I wanted to take it over to my BBQ and ignite it. If you like to read, don't waste your time. This book is horrible. It felt like the author had to rush to get it to her agent. It had a ludicrous scooby-do ending. My wish is that someone reads this review and saves their money."},{"rating":"1","title":"life","review":"To me this book was boring the way it was written and a little bit confusing, until it got closer to the end. I actually began enjoying it about half way through the book. What I really enjoyed was the ending. It definetely had an ending in the book that you would not expect. Looking forward to seeing the movie. I would give it 3 stars instead of my orginal 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spoiler alert! Please skip this review if you have not FINNISHED THE BOOK!!!","review":"It took an entire book to describe one sister's dying process and a couple of pages to describe the other??? Even the author played favorites!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, But Could've Been Better","review":"**Spoilers**This book is unbelievably drawn out and long. I think she could have done with cutting quite a few scenes. There is a lot of symbolism, which is good, however, the ending was horrible. It seemed like a soap ending. The whole (SPOILER) Kate made her sue her parents thing really surprised me. I honestly didn't see it coming. That, I liked.I wish she gave Kate a bit more emotion, or gave more insight. I understand that she didn't want to give anything away, but she could have given SOME point of view to the whole story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpected ending, need a box of kleenex","review":"A friend gave me this book, and told me to read it soon as there is a movie coming out. I always like to read the books before the movie comes out, as the movie sometimes ruins the book.I loved this book. I have three children, all born healthy Thank goodness. However, I related to this book, putting myself in the mother's shoes, and wondering how I would handle the situation, if my child was sick.Not an uplifting book by any means, if you do not like sad tragic stories do not read this book. Have kleenex handy..."},{"rating":"2","title":"*Sniff Sniff*","review":"While helping my best friend move into her new apt. she ran across her tote of books. In the tote was the book, \\"My Sister's Keeper\\". I had never heard of the book let alone the movie. My friend told me I HAD to read it. I knew nothing about it, but trusting her judgment I read it. I found myself unable to put it down and in tears by the end. I was so sad and yet so happy for those two little girls. Since I have read it 2 weeks ago I have already told EVERYONE I know that they now HAVE to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, not great until the end. Then it crashed","review":"I initially enjoyed the book but the end fell so flat that I really cannot recommend it. What a disappointment. The book raises interesting ethical issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoking page turner","review":"I loved this book. I was hooked right away, and stayed up much too late several nights saying, \\"just one more chapter\\". The topic was so thought provoking. AS a parent I can't even imagine having to make the same choices for my children. I guess the ending was a little manipulative, not my favorite part of the book, but I still think it was one of the best reads of recent memory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great until the end","review":"I picked this to read in one of my classes this year and found it incredibly easy to get through. The story was good and I found myself looking foward to reading it. It places you in a situation with no easy answer. Everyone with a brother or sister will tell you that they always thought that so and so was the favoured child. Picoult explores what happens when parents have to act on using one child to save the life of their other.As I mentioned, the book was great until the end. I found it as a horrible cop out that came off like it was written in a late night crunch to meet a deadline."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book is Amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Wow, it has been years since i have read a book so powerful and moving that i cried for hours. This book tells the story of a young girl, Anna, trying to discover who she is but who is hampered by the fact she was created to provide parts for her sister. Her sister,Kate, has leukemia and is going to die (sonner rather than later) unless Anna gives Kate one of her kidneys. Anna refuses and decides to fight for medical emancipation from her parents. The bond of the two sisters is amazing. The alternating chapters with views from different characters gives this book a deeper look ito a family that wants both their daughters to live but in reality they know only one can live and the other must die to save her. The end is bitter sweet so don't read it unless you are at home with a giant box of tissues. This book is wonderfully written and i absolutely will loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad...It Made Me Cry","review":"This novel is really well written, and it is portrayed through six differant points of view. However, if you cry easily, this book will make you tear for a week. It is so sad...the ending will shock you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Ending","review":"Loved this book until the end, the ending was just awful and ruined the entire book for me. Jodi Picoult has done the same thing with her newest book, Handle with Care. I couldn't wait for that book to come out for my Kindle, I bought it the first day it was out and again I was so annoyed at the end of the book. I will not be reading any more of her books. Sorry I spent the money to buy that for the Kindle, wish I would have gotten it from the library for free. Why does the author do that??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, but...","review":"I became enthralled with this book until the last 20 pages. I feel like the author took the easy way out in concluding the story. I had no idea how she would be able to sum up the story in the remainder of the book (the book brings up such large, complex, and important issues...especially related to parenting) and I was let-down in the end.But, overall, the book got me thinking hard and reevaluating my relationship with my young daughter. I wondered what I'd do as a parent in different situations raised in the book. You think you feel one way, and then the author brings up a complication that makes you reexamine your views.My husband's co-workers did not like the book because they said it was too depressing to read. However, I think that instead of being depressing, it is a great study in the enormous complexity of being a parent.I would give it 5 stars, except for the ending. Very fast read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not Finish","review":"I read half of the book and could not finish it, it was just to sad and depressing. This was about 4 months ago, still have not picked it back up."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Sister's Keeper","review":"This book was recommended by a friend. It is a great book. I would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"I hated this book, worst ending ever. Every chapter is written from a different person's perspective.. I could never keep it straight... you never got into any one particular character. I kept reading thinking it would get better... uggg. I have never in my life returned a book after reading it... but after wasting 6+ hours of my life reading this I wanted my money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping","review":"The book has a quick start to it, and is kept relatively fresh throughout with the change of point of view with each chapter. It provides a personal attachment to the family and close characters in the book. Some may argue that the book might be over-read and overrated, but it comes with reason. Many will find them choosing a character, or pick sides, as the layout of the story allows to do so. Its a good book, and an easy read for anybody looking to be captured into a story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing and depressing","review":"It was extremely disturbing. It was also jarring because the author kept skipping around from past to present to distant past to only yesterday past and into the point of view of 6 or 7 main characters. It was hard to keep straight when everything happened and who it happened to. I liked that were no villains, just desperate people who made me both sympathize with and despise (especially the mother). There was a good twist sorta near the end, but the very ending was a total downer and it felt like a cheap contrived trick.Was the book interesting and controversial and does it make you question your own definition of right and wrong? Yes! Would I ever read it again or see the movie? No!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ending was very very bad","review":"Like most of the 1 star ratings...I hated the mother character....but I was horrified at the ending...how terrible....The subject of the book is interesting but the characters were horrible..at first I thought it was a memoir but was quite relieved when I read novel on the cover..."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Sister's Keeper","review":"I enjoyed reading this book. It was hard to put down once it grabbed my attention. If you have sisters, it is a must read. It spurs emotions but is well worth it. You must read the book...then go see the movie (although the ending to the movie is dramatically different than the book's ending)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read, can't put it down for hours","review":"This is a great book to read and it sure will make you tear through out the chapters. I like the struggle each character went through, author captured it well."},{"rating":"1","title":"So, so bad.","review":"The writer is trite, lazy, totally derivative and doesn't understand how a metaphor is supposed to work. I guess it's what's called a \\"beach book\\" or a plane book--because it's so entirely lacking in anything thought provoking it is best read someplace where your attention is going to be lacking. I think I sensed this would be the case when the cover's two rave reviews were from People and Entertainment Weekly.Anyway I finished it because I wanted to see how she'd end it. But, not caring anything about any of them, the ending couldn't affect me. Too bad, as the subject is certainly provocative.Funny thing is, because I read this long after the film came out (which I didn't see), my greatest enjoyment was picturing Alec Baldwin as the lawyer--and imagining him with the dog. That was fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"my sisters keeper","review":"Very good book i think everyone should read this book it really makes you think about things that people face."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way overboard on the melodrama","review":"I am very surprised that this book got so many good reviews. It literally is just one tear-jerking event after another, with several stupid harlequin-romance type subplots thrown in. The story is finished off with a totally unrealistic, very disappointing finale."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad review for Joe's Books","review":"I asked receive a response by e-mail about when the product would be delivered and no one responded. Now I'm waiting to hear about my refund. Very Dissatisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy lil' charger","review":"This is a great charger! The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is because it loosely fits into the outlet. I'd prefer it to be a tighter fit. Otherwise, it was very useful to have the car charging portion. I travelled around Europe and always had a charged camera! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything You Need In This Package! Highly Recommended","review":"I bought the VHS version but ... This package contained everything! I was extremely pleased with what I received. I didn't have to order one other video or music CD for my library. There were four video's on massage therapy - including one on Baby Massage (which was absoultely great) and three relaxing CD's. The music is so soothing, I keep them going all the time in the background whether I'm giving a massage or not. It just keeps everyone's nervers calmer. The video's are wonderful to refer back to and my friends are now asking to \\"borrow\\" them! <smile> I recommend this set highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets the series off to a bang","review":"Enjoyed this...not the first one I read of the series but was glad that they wrote these to keep the interest going from the show and develop characters more fully."},{"rating":"2","title":"The combination is.......","review":"Simply put- BUY THIS BOOK!!!!!If you own Windows XP Pro*, this manual is a must have, invaluable resource tool.Easy to read and filled with helpful tips on maximizing the efficiency of your system; Pogue and Zacker got it right!You'll save yourself so much time on completing your tasks that it'll pay for itself as soon as you get it.My only question is why didn't we get one of these when we purchaced Windows XP??*I use it on XP Pro and Home editions"},{"rating":"2","title":"PC program manual","review":"The book puts the terms of instruction in a simplified format with side notes that builds better understanding of the situation you are addressing.

Something as basic and important as \\"Chkdsk\\" should not be missing. I wonder how many other entries are non-existent? Having read both manuals, I prefer \\"Windows XP Annoyances\\". Pogue's content reads like a rehashed Microsoft Windows XP \\"Help\\" tutorial. There's more substance in the other manual."},{"rating":"2","title":"Average User","review":"After a few minutes of reading and in front of the PC, I was able to understand many of the new features in XP Pro. This book should have been included with the software.

Arguably, for Rihanna, she has been one of those who unfortunately recorded a sappy, bad song. Unfaithful, the second single from her spohmore record, A Girl Like Me, really misses out on being a heartfelt ballad within the lyrics. The lyrics, I see him die a little each time, and the end to the chorus, I don't want to be a murderer, make it seem more like pleading rather than something with real heart. Rihanna hasn't really captured her voice to everybody like she did with Pon De Replay. She really needs to find it all over again, and I really hope she doesn't make a bad song like this ever again.Song: F"},{"rating":"1","title":"A really bad ballad","review":"I really liked her Ponce de Replay song when I first heard it. It sounded so fresh and catchy, a song that begged for you to hit the dancefloor. It was such a fun summer song, vocally and delivery wise.That's why I was really taken aback when I heard \\"Unfaithful\\" on the radio. I was like, why would any producer let anyone record a single w/ a delivery performance like that? It was like she was just going through the motion. And ballads really reveal weaknesses in her voice and how her style is not quite mature just yet. She also just doesn't have the power to belt out a power ballad like that. She should have passed it on to Mariah or Christina or Clarkson.It's fair to say that it was a wrong song choice for her.Again, not sure why it was a hit."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Is, Like, Whateveeerrrrrrrr","review":"This song is just a bunch of whining. Waaaaa! Waaaaa! Waaaaaa! Oh, the screeching! You hear no emotion or maturity in this song. Just the typical emotional drama. I give props to the person who suggested to Rihanna to get bangs. She *really* needed those."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whatever...This song is cool!","review":"Rihanna is a very talented girl. When she is on the radio, you /know/ it's Rihanna. She has that voice that just.....is different. Like Sean Paul. I like people who are different.

Usually I don't like compilation books, but I had no expectations going into it. I had already read the author's \\"Last Summer\\" and \\"Looking for It\\", and enjoyed them immensely. So I picked this up for a ridiculously low price, and read it within a few days.The stories are entertaining, sometimes even downright hilarious, and always told with Ford's usual flair. I found myself reading between the lines in certain stories, as if he was speaking directly to ME (or about me) through each chapter. That gave it a personal warmth and connexion that I really liked. I could really relate to a lot of what he was saying.But I would place this book somewhere between the humour section and the gay literature section of the bookstore. It achieves the best of both worlds, and none of the worst. I will definitely continue to enjoy this author's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"MTF is a wonderful, entertaining, gifted writer.

Half (160 of 320 pages) is devoted to material on behavior and general characteristics, that is too simplified for a biologist (or veteran birder) and too detailed for some one seeking identification of new species. The identification sections show 7 birds per page, without size or habitat perspective. The illustrations are accurate to the extent of my observations, and range maps are shown on the ID pages.

Glass Eden is backed by intuitive talent and catchy tunes that carry their songs nicely. I don't mind the near-pop song structure and flow of the songs because they are saved by the cool grooves, originality and intelligent maneuvers in the music. The tracks vary from hard boot stompers to impressively rendered songs (some of which may be a little too rocky-rolly at times, but we can forgive them this time). This disc is addictive, and I doubt many could find fault with it. Notable tracks include \\"Human\\" and \\"Give Up\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Finish","review":"I guess you can include me in the list of unwashed heathens who didn't think this book was a work of literary genius.

'Mmmmmmmmm,' she hums along.\\" This a \\"manipulation of the English language\\" that should guarantee Carolyn Chute a position in the forefront of literary achievement? I think not. Her affected unpretentiousness in presenting her downbeat characters in economically wrecked western Maine is excruciatingly boring reading. The self-consciously folksy style brings the Letourneaus and the Babbidge's off as a crew of loutish oafs who, like the characters in \\"Tobacco Road,\\" sit around in their shacks, crowded with wives, husbands, ex-wives, step-children, half-sisters and -brothers, cousins, uncles, doing almost nothing except occasionally shooting each other's guard dogs and lamenting the depreciation of land value.

The remix sounds a little better than the original.I don't see this song as a growth for brit. This songs sounds like it came from the 1980s (janet jackson, prince and vanity in particular). So it's really hard for me to blast this from any stero system.Overall, this song is still pop. and she's very careful with not offending her pop audience (hence the reason why she got nerd).

I was hopeful. The TOC you can read online indicated that the book had grown with the industry. This edition includes more space dedicated to user scenarios, collaboration, topic-based authoring, content management, and localization. And yet the book has less to say than the previous edition. Gone are almost all of the concrete examples and practical advice. The \\"best practices\\" that are sprinkled throughout the book are rarely more than platitudes or admonishments that you should do something, but the tools to do it are missing.

Bartok's more lyrical and folk-inspired side turns up in versions by the Takacs and Vegh Quartets.The New Budapest Quartet attacks these legendary pieces more in the lyrical and painterly vein. Even thorny works like #3 & #4 seem much more easily approached. I listened to these on a long drive in the middle of the night in New England and they definitely brought out what is meant by Bartok's \\"Night Music\\".This set is getting hard to find.

But what is even better is the great story line. It's easy to get totally immersed in the plot of all three NWN's titles, and there is a great combination of hack & slash action and puzzle solving.One of the best innovations is the great character customization potential. I particularly like the look of the characters as well as the choice of a fatter body type. My fighters look like fighters and not as though they could be blown over but a breeze. And the ability to add and upgrade skills along multiple dimensions makes the game more then just collecting experience points.Artamas"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sophomore slump","review":"The SoU expansion pack was no where near as good as the core NWN campaign. The story line was uninspiring, the maps were rather boring, the whole adventure was just too linear. You really had very few options of any kind, it just kind of spoon fed each step to you. I also found the coding of the maps to be weak. There were parts of floors I couldn't walk on, extremely awkward paths my character would be forced to take to navigate obstacles. Plus, halfway thru the campaign, Tomi just flat out stopped trying to deactivate traps or unlock doors, despite me trying to modify his behavior repeatedly. That really s**ked because I didn't have nearly the deactivate trap or unlock skills I needed at that point. Treasure chest and barrels were a LOT more sparse than the base campaign. All in all, it looked like someone just threw it together too quickly, with little real play testing, and a ho-hum story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good game","review":"This series is quite good though I must admit I liked the Baldur's Gate series better.I find it irritating that you can't tell your henchmen what you want them to do.

Thus, the idea of not putting all one's eggs in one basket seems wise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated and a bore!","review":"Although I felt there was some value related to \\"earning centers\\", most of this book is one quote after another.

Wouldn't choose anything else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Upconverting Player","review":"I am very pleased with this Panasonic unit and the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I had nothing to compare it to. I am using the HDMI connection - that and the upconverting feature warranted my upgrade from an older Magnavox unit.

I doubt my tv has a decent built in up-convertating system since its about 3 years old now..I guess my expectations were higher based on the reviews.

Unfortunately, I have 2 left feet, and I did ok on parts of it until they incorporated the hand movements, and then I was lost. It was a lot of fun though, and I feel compelled to keep doing it just to learn the dance! The only thing I would want is a little more instruction on what to do with your feet on certain moves, and the camera angles at times makes it hard to see what they are doing. Very fun workout though, and I can see myself doing it a lot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Beautiful","review":"I just tried Tahitian cardio today and I had a blast. It's only about 40 min but I was definitely sweating. I'm in pretty good shape and I have some dance experience but I still found it to be challenging but easy enough to improve with practice.

I love dance workouts and this is wonderful for when you just don't feel like all of the bouncing that goes into street dance or hip hop. I would definitely recommend this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's A Blast","review":"This is now one of my favorite workouts. Kili starts off simple and slowly makes the dance moves more challenging. She has a way of demonstrating them without making me feel like she is \\"talking down\\" to me. The music, the scenery, the outfits, are all beautiful, and the workout is definitely intense. I now find myself practicing the \\"figure 8\\" and \\"ami\\" while walking around my house!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I actually enjoy working out!","review":"This is something that has never *ever* happened to me. But this video is truly fun and challenging. It takes a bit of work to get the moves right, but it has improved my overall dancing ability which is a great plus.I'm not in great shape but don't find this a particularly strenuous workout, which at times can be nice. It a good intensity level for me, tough enough where I don't get bored but not so tough that I feel dead afterwards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ejoyable low impact workout","review":"This dvd is amazing. Set in one of the most beautiful places on earth, it will definitely make you miss the islands. I know I do. Anyway, This is traditional hula mixed with cardio set to traditional hawaiian music which puts me in a good mood in general. The moves take a little getting used to but once you've done this enough you fell like your an island girl yourself. Kili is great at queing, is very graceful, and is also very beautiful as well as her two friends. If you go into the special features section, Kili does a bonus performance as well. You can only get that on the dvds. It's pretty amazing. I can't wait to get cardio hula and Tahitian Hip Hop. I also recommend the Hula abs and buns dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good beginner, not really cardio","review":"I enjoy this workout, it's relaxing, great for a beginner and I think you can get a good core workout and strong thighs, but it's really not cardio at all. The scenery is beautiful, but the moves don't always match the drum beats. I've lost inches in the waist pretty quickly with this dvd, but it's not something to be done daily, it would be a bit boring. I do this dvd when I am looking for relaxation and stress reduction. Something different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing something here!","review":"This can be a good workout, but again, Kili puts too much lap-dance style in her dancing. This is not a culture that adds that type of added movement. It is a \\"sensual\\" dance, not a \\"sexy\\" dance...there is a difference. Also, I am not sure if any of the others, who rated this so highly have actually made it through to the end, because nobody has mentioned the fact that there are 8 beats of music and dance steps left out of the last run through! Not only that, but the last time through doesn't keep time with the music! But, with that said, if you know Tahitian dance and can take out the added vugarity, memorize the dance, and ignore the dancers on the last run, you will have a fun work out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fun","review":"i got this dvd because of my love for dancing in general coupled with the fact that i had knee surgery in march, so i can't run. this dvd is really great for abs, but i use it with my brazilian dance workout in order to add more cardio. if you have knee problems, i would definitely recommend stretching a little before starting the workout. seriously though, it does good things for the abdominal region!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy and motivating workout","review":"I have to say I just tried it yesterday, this workout really motivates you to move, dance and tone your body. I think the dance moves particularly tones the tummy/hip/thigh area if you do it everyday. Dance moves looks very elegant and takes a little bit time to learn to do it gracefully, needs practice therefore motivates me to do it everyday.The workout flow is good, not too slow and can easily follow as a quick daily workout keep your heartbeat up!!

On this guided tour, he is accompanied by some of the finest Indian masterchefs of our time.He starts by introducing you to the actual ingredients, the herbs and spices. Then onto the different cooking processes, and finally onto the most delightful and genuine Indian recipes that I have ever come across. He also covers different regional specialities of India.The recipes and the coooking processes are well thought out and described in minute detail, so that you can achieve the best results.The book ends with recipes for different masalas (herb and spice mixtures) you will need - which not many books actually provide.A must have book for fans of Indian cooking anywhere in the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classical Indian cuisine","review":"I have been cooking with this book since it was published more than a dozen years ago. If there is 'classical Indian cuisine' - this book captures it. The recipes are authentic in the results they produce and are easy to follow. This book is a must for anyone who professes to know how to cook Indian food whether they are a novice or an expert. It should be noted that these are restaurant recipes coming from food professionals. You will not be asked to open a jar of this or that.

No other book compares."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD PORTRAYAL","review":"As an Indian, I strongly feel that Pearl Buck has not done a good job of portraying a real Indian character. Her descriptive writing is great, however the characters she has, such as Jagat, are not portrayed as a proper Indian. Pearl Buck might have tried to intertwine East and West together in this book, but in the attempt, she strechted the \\"trueness\\" of the character, resulting in the characters to sound fake. For a traveller who has never gone to India or travelled in it, it will reveal the beauty of this country. However, if this book is to be read to know about the Indian culture, this is clearly not the book to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indian setting is different, but...","review":"I had to work my way through a good many pages to get my bearings in India, after reading her Chinese novels, but once I did, I was captivated!

This is not necessarily a bad thing, though. The big choruses featured on \\"Sonic Wave Love\\" never go out of style, even as vocalist Berry gets a bit heavy handed in his lyrics as in \\"Freedom Runs\\".

The size is perfect for travel, as is the bendable plastic cover. I was torn between this book and the plain dictionary for a Central America trip. I have never taken any Spanish so I bought the phrasebook because it said it's a \\"Travel Dictionary and Grammer\\" book. Unfortunately, the format is clumsy to use. It is broken down into sections such as Food/Drinks; accommodations; travel; shopping etc. While it's a good idea, unforunately, it was not very practical. Also, the \\"dictionary\\" portion at the end of the book was not thought out well as some common words such as \\"seafood\\" and \\"shrimp\\" were missing. I did find it odd that other words that a traveler wouldn't really need seemed to be in there.I would not recommend this book as a stand alone source if you are traveling. Instead, grab the pocket dictionary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely extreme","review":"I came across this book at my local library and decided to check it out as my husband and I are whitewater canoeists and have travelled (some) in Peru.

Imagine yourself ahead to the years 2027, then 2028. Projected ideas about advances in technology and the results to world politics and organization in the aftermath of wars and unrest in the Middle East provide an interesting framework. A voice during a storm leads three children and their uncle to a mysterious book in the attic. Further mystery and adventure lead then to Israel (Book One), then Ethiopia (Book Two). The greatest strength of these books is the descriptions of Jewish historical background of our faith. The importance of Scripture memorization, of speaking it aloud, learning to trust God in all situations, and the very clear explanation of salvation and the Christian life make these books special and aid parents in \\"training up a child in the way he should go.\\" The volumes would make an exciting family read-aloud with many spiritual rewards.

I haven't shed this many tears over a book in ages! The writing is beyond compare and the subject matter was dramatic. The characters were written with depth that many authors miss in their writing.I've read many Linda Howard books and have enjoyed them all. So far: this is the best of an excellent lot. Thank you Linda. Keep writing and I'll keep reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pragmatic, Romantic Suspense","review":"I won't bore you with an overview since other reviewers have written great ones. CRY NO MORE got mostly 5 stars for the right reason. If Linda Howard's writing style and this book's story line appeal to you, then DON'T let the 1-2 star reviews keep you from reading/buying the book. Some of the 1-2 stars were incorrect with the story's ending which almost kept me from buying the book. No heroine/hero (H/H) is \\"perfectly\\" portrayed to a reader's ideal; but the H/H in this book really made me cheer them on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have been a HUGE howard fan for years and anxiously awaited the release of this novel. While the premise is compelling, the story just seems to amble along with predictability. There is little or no chemistry/romance between the two lead characters and the relationship never seems to gel. In fact, I never seemed to connect with James Diaz, the male lead.I was also very dissappointed with the ending - instead of building up to an explosive climax it just puttered out, giving the reader no satisfaction.Next to her other books, this one pales in comparison. I would recommend buying other classics such as Dream Man and Kill and Tell."},{"rating":"1","title":"cry forever what a let down","review":"I was rather disappointed in this book after waiting for so long for it to come out and my shear love of Linda Howard books. I am coming off an emotional high from books like mr perfect, mckenzie's mountain, now you see her now you don't, and dying to please (which was my favorite book). It pained me greatly to see that the mother's story begins and ends in pain. Don't read this book unless you like pain. Want a good romance novel? Read Dying to Please."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, You Will Have a Good Cry","review":"Ms. Howard does not fail to please her fans as well as those new to her books. In Milla, she has created a character who experiences love, happiness, tragedy, forgiveness, and redemption, on the way to finding love again. Even those who have never had children will feel the pains of any parent who has lost a child. I recommend this book, and if the suspense, passion, and ending don't sway you, then I don't know what will."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Rare Linda Howard Disappointment--No spoilers","review":"As a diehard fan of Linda Howard, I was disappointed with this hybrid of mainstream suspense and romance novel. It doesn't succeed on either level. There is no payoff for the suspense--we hear of the resolution second-hand--just an emotional bathos that far exceeds the excesses of most romance novels and therefore fails to satisfy in that area as well. Nothing kills a good romance like a long, drawn-out tragedy, and even Ms. Howard can't save this one. This is a Sufferin' Oprah book club selection minus the literary content. If you must read Linda Howard, as many of us must, wait for the paperback."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of Howards books make me laugh and some make me cry.","review":"Cry No More is probably the best book I've ever read. It's hard for me not to say that after I've read a Linda Howard book, because she's an amazing writer, but this one can't NOT touch you.Just do me a favor - if you haven't read it yet, please read it. It's worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I read the same book?","review":"I'm wondering if I read the same book as everyone else because as a \\"Mystery\\" book, this one was sadly lacking. Perhaps it's because I'm new to Linda Howard and therefore not as willing to just accept this as just another \\"brilliant\\" work.Firstly, it took forever to get into the story, then there's really no chemistry between the two main characters, THEN we finally get to the resolution of the \\"Mystery\\" part, and it all happens essentially \\"off camera.\\" The resolution to the \\"Mystery\\" is reduced to one short line of basically \\"they were caught.\\" Well, DUH! I want to know HOW they were caught! Where's the confrontation?! Where's the climax!?This anti-climax was a major miscalculation on Howard's part, in my opinion. It ruined the whole book for me. Not even the \\"feel good\\" ending was able to save it. I just felt cheated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get your hanky out.","review":"The title of this book was nonsensical because if you don't cry during this book you may be lacking a heart. I don't cry while reading books but this one had me leaking more than once. It was hard to read but really wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Linda Howard book","review":"I have read most of her books and I thought this book was by far one of the best. I haven't been too happy lately with her newest work so this was a great change!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of her best","review":"I read this after reading \\"Open Season\\" Did the same author write both books? Linda Howard writes such excellent books most of the time and \\"Cry No More\\" was definately one of her best.This book had a great story along with the sexy charactors. That sure helps, it was hard to put down till I finished."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Another Winner\\"","review":"Linda Howard has done it again! I almost didn't read this book because it involved a baby kidnapping ring and how the baby was taken from Milla, but once I got beyond the first couple of pages, I couldn't put it down. You just wanted to keep on turning the pages. This is one book you don't want to miss!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Non-stop roller coaster ride of emotion...","review":"I admit it - since reading SON OF THE MORNING I haven't been traipsing through the used bookstores looking for Ms. Howard's back list. I did, however, love MR. PERFECT, which came highly recommended, as did this book.This story is something that feasibly could happen in real life (and most assuredly has), although Milla is written as a much stronger mother than I think I could ever be. Diaz...well, what can be said about such a mysterious, unique hero, except I would certainly feel perfectly safe with him at my back!The subject matter of baby stealing and other horrific goings-on was disturbing, but not off-putting; I read this in about a day and a half. I'd give the emotions-wringing level about a 10, and although the narrative prose was a tad slow-paced in spots, I didn't find that it detracted from the story...much.All in all, CRY NO MORE is one heck of a book sure to win Linda Howard many awards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story!!","review":"I hesitated about buying this book. I had a feeling by the title it was going to be too mushy for me. Boy was I wrong. It was a great story and very well written. I know it is a good book when I cry and laugh while reading parts of it. I like so many of Linda Howard's books. I read a lot of authors and she has a true gift for story telling and romance. Great book! I never should have waited."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"Ms. Howard does it again, excellent plot, characters and a beautifully written story. Just enough of everything to keep me coming back for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Couldn't Stop Reading","review":"I really enjoy Linda Roberts, from her early novels, through her migddle growth period to this stunning book. Roberts gives us incredibly complex characters, finely drawn, whose lives and issues pull the reader in and keep them until the last page. The main characters, Mila, her husband- then ex-husband- David, and the mysterious Diaz are all fascinating. When we find Mila and David divorced after the theft of their infant son, we readers have no idea that we will go on a roller coaster ride with Mila as she works through this difficult emotional loss as well as becomes a different person, one capable of dealing with kidnappers and murderers.I bought this book and kkept it, read it twice and found some new things in the second reading. I found it to be one of Roberts' best, and a marvelous read. Hankies, yes for some. Not me. Just constantly cheering Mila on in her quest and holding my breath when things got sticky.Worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boring ending","review":"The story of Milla trying to find her baby is so excellent that you'll never put the book down. The way that Diaz has to solve things will make you flabbergast. The way Milla and Diaz found who were the bad guys will thrill you. The way Milla found that Diaz didn't want her to find her baby will stun you. The way the Finders work will cheer you. The last chapter of the book will make you cry. BUT the last fifty pages before the last chapter when Milla was in her very best distress because she gave her son away, could be written in seven pages at the most. How many times can you read that she woke up, ate breakfast, went to sleep, ate lunch, etc.?"},{"rating":"2","title":"the title should be Cry Buckets More....","review":"I have read every book published by Linda Howard. I got this one as soon as it was released and read it in one afternoon/evening. Since other reviewers have recapped the story I won't do that again but I wanted to share how this book touched me.If you like a book that makes you literally 'feel' the emotions of the heroine right to your core you will love this book. As another reviewer mentioned, I also cried my way through the last section of the book. Linda Howard with her amazing writing skill made me feel like I had suffered the loss right along with Milla. I could not put the book down even though I had trouble reading it through the tears. This book needs 10 stars in my opinions... Buy a large box of tissues when you get this book, you will need them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it is supposed to be...","review":"The book jacket made this book sound like a great thriller!!It had all the components- a terrible kidnapping, a mother bent on finding her son and avenging his kidnapping.I don't know how to start about how disappointed I was in this book!! There were grisly murders going on with harvesting of organs and black market babies and horrible one-eyed killers and dark and mysterious men but there was more attention paid to the sex expoits , especially with the solitary men. When the two people who ran the organ harvesting and baby snatching ring were caught it was dealt with in one sentence!!!The most poignant scene is Milla and the adoptive parents.Diaz is an unbelievable character - just way too over the top - this is not a thriller for readers who want a thrilling tale- if you like an unreal romance novel - GO FOR IT!! I can't recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not unabridged","review":"I read the book and then I got the unabridged audiobook.The last chapter is not there. The book is great, but itneeds the last chapter. I would not buy this audiobookagain."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read with great characters that leaves you emotionally drained","review":"A friend has recommended this book to me and a few weeks ago it was on sale (gotta love sales) on Audible.com so I picked it up. I'm glad I did. This was a great read! The story starts out with Milla's 6 week old son being stolen out of her arms and her almost fatally wounded. The story progresses with the search for her son for over 10 years. Along the way she finds/meets Diaz who she thinks may have had something to do with her son's kidnapping. Diaz, is a known as a lone wolf and assassin kind of guy, the ultimate kind of \\"bad boy' we all like to read about. His character reminds me a lot of Ranger from the Stephanie Plum series but is much better developed than Janet Evanovich has done with Ranger in years. This book can be emotionally draining but is worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotional","review":"The reader can't help but feel the characters turmoil in this book. Not much is revealed about Diaz, which is probably the author's intent since Diaz's character is secretive and elusive. Any mother can relate to Milla. I really liked that Ms Howard allowed the darker elements to come through considering the storyline. Unlike other authors that write safe material about perfect, beautiful, uncomplicated people, these characters aren't perfect or beautiful, but very touching and complicated - just like real people.

Totally not so with \\"Cry No More\\". It is up there with the best books I have ever read (a group of maybe 4 or 5 books) on a special place on my bookshelf.It is just one of those stories you can't put down, and you can't get it out of your mind. It's hard to pinpoint just what it is that is so compelling about this book. Somewhere along the way I realized it wasn't really your average mystery, or romance type novel, it was more like a character study of the main character, Milla. Her strength during some parts was unbelievable, and then you are also shown how human and real she is.Buy this book and have your Kleenex handy, this is definitely worth the hardback investment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of a kind","review":"I always recommend Linda Howard to readers unfamiliar with her work. However, this suggestion comes with a disclaimer. DO NOT READ THIS BOOK FIRST. Why? None of the rest of her books will measure up. Never. This book was the most frightening I have ever read, in the best possible way. As a single mom, this book made me sit up and realize that, although I live in a small town, this can happen to anyone. The journey of heartbreak, determination, and utter joy that Milla takes is one I gladly take with her again and again. Truly, the most amazing story I have ever had the pleasure of reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lonely Planet's version better","review":"I read this collection as well as 'Brief Encounters' (Lonely Planet Series)- the later was by far a better read; more honest, raw, and real experiences by a better collection of authors recounting their many indescretions with the restless natives found abroad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Budget ATV Trailer","review":"It's sturdy, relatively easy to assemble, but it's definately made in China.

I got this book looking for perspectives on spiritual warfare, which I've neglected until recently. Because Charles Kraft has been at Fuller Theological Seminary since 1969, he writes from a theologically sound, academic, and practical standpoint. In other words, there's no loosey-goosey, name-it-and-claim-it, wish-fulfillment, \\"Secret\\" theological trash here. I really appreciated Kraft's solid, non-judgemental explanation of how Christians can be demonized (not \\"possessed\\"), and that his ministry is primarily a LOVING one. It was mind opening, and spiritually revealing. I'm reading more of his books - Christianity With Power and I Give You Authority - to learn better how to pray and intercede. I do see the world with different eyes, which seems to come by closing them and praying more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Information","review":"The information is really good in this book, but it does seem to be just a little behind the curve of the most current inner healing methods avaiable.

Since installing this filter, I've noticed somewhat increased fuel economy using the stock intake/exhaust/etc, more noticeable in city driving than highway driving for some reason: about 5-6mpg in city (about 55 -> 60mpg) and about 1-2mpg highway (about 68 -> 70mpg). Of course, other variables could cause that relationship to be spurious (idle time, aggressiveness of driving, etc), but it seems to be pretty consistent between fillups. As an aside, make sure you're running AT LEAST 91 octane (or whatever the \\"super\\"/\\"supreme\\"/\\"premium\\" is at your local pumps) or your fuel/oxygen ratio will be WAY off causing all sorts of pinging, misfires, and inevitable engine damage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tape is Defective!

The original CMG model was modified by Gerber after buying out CMG, to open with the rear twist, which is like many other brands on the market. Nothing like the Original CMG Ultra.

The method relies heavily on muscle testing, a concededly inaccurate method. The \\"healing\\" method is never particuarly explained. While the reader is advised to have the patient think of or visualize a troubling situation and then perform a \\"balancing\\", these instructions are woefully insufficient.

She was against it from the very start and turned down the job, but the gas station scene was the straw that broke the camels back. She even cried when she called the massage parlor back saying she'd come in tomorrow. She clearly hated the job from the start, but when you cant afford gas, about to lose the house, go from 2 income family to 0 income and 3 kids to raise....wow you get desperate. I think JLH played the role great. Even when going through the affects of cocaine, she did a good job.

Only after I recieved the book did I realize that there is a deminsion area and that it will not hold any 8 1/2 X 11 papers.

However, when I turned to the recipe I discovered that it was a rolled cookie. Upon further investigation I discovered about 20 recipes in the wrong sections.

Back when Ms. Heatter's books were first issued I was doing all whole grains and foods and wouldn't have dreamed of using her recipes. Now, many years later, I am delighted to have them. One of the particular attractions to Ms. Heatter's books for me is the blend of experience and technical information. I don't agree with others that she is overly verbose in her recipes. In fact, her explanations of many of the processes in cooking and baking are very helpful to the novice and experienced baker alike. I find it much easier to sift out instructions than to dream them up from an overly terse recording. Having said that, the cookies are fantastic, every one I've tried, and I'd recommend this as a standard reference on the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Utterly reliable","review":"I usually prefer cookbooks with great photography, but this book is so reliable I almost forget there are none!

Today so often recipes are not tested and results predictably uneven. Daunting for beginners. With Maida's recipes one can understand clearly what needs to be done and also know the recipe will work.

I recommend you just push play and let it go. I have yet to skip to the next song.It's vintage Default all the way through. If your expecting a new direction, you'll be disappointed. If your expecting more of the same with improvement, then you'll love it.

What is the worst about this recording is the harsh strident quality of the violin -- probably more a factor of a bad recording rather than a faulty violin.

If you wish to actually buy the CD and review it, feel free, but to use this or any other area as a means to attack someone is not needed. As for the CD.... some will love it, some will hate it...I personally think it's a great example of Metal and a good audio \\"picture\\" of where thsi band is right now... And the growth between this CD and the last is astronomical....

This is one of the only recordings that I know of featuring the 4 songs of William Denis Browne... played very well by Stephen Varcoe - but sung terribly by Martin Hill. Much like the collection of Michael Tippett vocal music, Mr. Hill seems to scream his way through most everything he sings.Someone must like him, he's signed to Hyperion, and they usually choose such wonderful singers... but not this time. Let's just pray that Ian Bostridge or John Mark Ainsley will be asked to sing this wonderful repertoire... and we can use these discs as coasters!The baritone, Michael George, does a commentable job with the Gurney songs - sometimes a bit swallowed and throaty.I am not saying do not buy this recording...

Given that, I don't think it's worth the price. For a comparable price, you can get \\"classic\\" Farberware pots, which are still made of 18/10.

The parts just weren't fitting together properly. Finally, my husband just used one of our own screws and assembly continued fine. I strongly recommend using the Handy Hint that is provided about greasing the footstool glide pin as I didn't do that and, while the slide technically works fine, it has a tendency to get stuck a bit.... and yes, the chair is a good replica of my Nana's.

So, I disassembled and reassembled the chair; tried it again, and...same thing. I absolutely assembled it correctly. The problem is an engineering and design problem.Not only is this chair cheap and flimsy but it is DANGEROUS!!!For the record: I only weigh 180 lbs.

It took us about 2 hours to assemble, though now that we've done it once we could repeat the task in about 15 minutes. The last surprise came when we put the chair on the kitchen floor. It's feet slid on the linoleum like the floor was ice. We have to put a throw rug or something under the feet to prevent them from sliding or someone is going to break their neck!

I'm interested in the history of American music styles. I've experienced the Anonymous 4 in concert. And so I thought I might gain something from this cd. I did. I enjoy it, both academically and musically. It seems to me to be a modern rendition of old old tunes; if not authentic in sound, at least in spirit. The accompaniment by string musicians Mike Marshall and Darrol Anger is superb although for my tastes I would have liked even more from them. They just pop in and out occasionally throughout the cd. I give this a four star rating because the sound is excellent, and there just isn't enough of this type of music being produced; but I suspect that many folk, gospel and Americana enthusiasts may think it sterile, dry or boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"they do sound like angels","review":"This group Anonymous 4 sings the finest interpretations of early, middle and late English and European compositions.

So when I had the opportunity to read this book, I jumped at it. Maybe I'm to big a fan and had Mr Skelton on a pedistal and was a little shocked by the content of this book. It was often hard for me to read some chapters. He was human and had frailities like all men. The book gave a great deal of detail to his struggling years, both professionaly and personally. There are many quotes from coworkers that show a different, behind-the-scenes Red Skelton. This man among clowns had a life quite different for what the public saw through televison. I'm just glad he surrived and became a master comedian."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book","review":"If you were a Red Skelton fan you will enjoy this book. It provided an insight to Red that I was unaware. Red was a complex individual and had his bad points. He had three wifes. The first wife (Edna) was actually the best, but their relationship became platonic. She continued managing many of Red's business affairs for years. The second wife (Georgia) committed suicide on her second attempt on the anniversary of their son's death. That's right, Red's only son died when he was 12 or 13. Little is mentioned about Red's third wife other than how they met and that she was much younger than Red. Red disliked business managers and made some bad investments but overall had plenty of good investments to make him independently wealthy. Red had a problem with drinking, but was able to straighten himself out later in life at least of hard alcohol, while he still drank beer. His health was such that liquor would have eventually killed him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Special Delivery","review":"I also thought it was the movie with Andy Dick but it turned out to be an animated movie.

If you already know tahitian dance, you can do that, and this can be a good wook out...but if you don't, you are learning a style of tahitian dance that is offensive to the culture that it comes from. So, with that said, because I dance tahitian, I enjoy the workout! And as far as the dancers are concerned...they know how to dance, they just add a bit of \\"nasty\\" that isn't part of the culture.

I always break a sweat with this workout, and I always feel my abs are getting a workout as well as my legs and even my arms. I gave this DVD 4 stars simply because Kili's voice is a little annoying, but the \\"workout to music without narration\\" feature is great if you just want to hear the music. This is a great addition to your weekly routine.

Out of 6 CD's, all the songs sound almost identical and 'do not go anywhere'. A cool intro beat and groove starts.... and then nothing! *ALL* the songs on this disc, except for two songs (which are only OK and I already have) have this decent intro, then just keep playing the into section over and over... you keep waiting for some really interesting continuation of the intro music, but it never happens!

It opened the first one without a problem, but once the oyster juice got on the handle it was too slippery to use. I had to resort to using one of the club's knives that has a wooden handle with a somewhat bulbous shape. No problem with that tool.I have been able to use this knife but only after wrapping the handle in a thin sheet of rubber or plastic that's used to help get a better grip on jars."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Get What You Pay For !","review":"If your an oyster lover this knife is THE tool.

My baby is only 5 months old, but I can already see a difference in her appearance when I look back at the previous months' pictures. I like this idea alot better than baby journals that tell you when each milestone should occur.

The calendar is cute but the months are off. With my first son's calendar you could just place a one month, two month...sticker for each month he turned. This calendar does it for you however it doesn't work out that well. For example it starts with month one but my son doesn't actually turn a month old until the following month (obviously)- so where the calendar says month two he is actually only turning one month old. So... if you do buy this calendar be sure you write April/May, June/July and so forth to fill in your calendar. Even their picture on the back of the calendar has just a typical calendar month labeled, which means the marking of the dates was not clearly thought through by the company.

The Nuwave has 3 heating methods: conduction, convection, & infrared (radiant). Sunpentown only has two, conduction & convection, without the infrared radiant heat which makes tabletop ovens superb. I tossed my Sunpentown and bought a Nuwave, which works excellent! Nuwave makes the very best burgers, steaks, veggies etc. because the infrared heat browns the food like a bbq grill. Also it's quick, easy to clean, doesn't use too much power, and doesn't heat up your kitchen like a range oven. Doesn't smoke up your house like a George Foreman grill either.

In my opinion, you won't go wrong buying this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality book","review":"Ive only just dived into this book but I like it so far. I only have two issues with it. First it mentions positioning which is poorly implemented and adds confusion. Secondly, and this is more of a personal preference, I dislike quick introduction of sharps and flats.

Afterwards, I checked out a few volumes by the \\"names\\" in bass, but found them either overly complex, or overly exhaustive in information. Ed Friedland put together the \\"just right\\" package.First off, it does NOT depend on TAB. You start with notes. And even when TAB appears far into the book, it is not necessary as you can still play in notes. And as mentioned below, you get to play \\"tunes\\" early one, even if they are very simple. Thus, you get to build a base playing along with the band on the CD.Everything progresses cleanly. You get pictures of fingerings, diagrams of fingerings, and (early on) numbering of the fingering of notes under the notes themselves. In other words...This is the book you want if you don't have/can't have a teacher.

At this point it is fairly easy for me to pick up a rock song, from Cream to Judas Priest to Ozzy.

It was a great place to start for someone with a little bit of music background (20 years ago as a kid I took piano lessons) and a love for grooving. I highly recommend this book.

Largely due to the sex saturated media of the 20th Century, it seems that most view celibacy as a cold, archaic, and ignorant represion of natural tendencies.Not so. This book is not biblical companion, neither is it designed from the point of view of any particular religion. It is easy to read, informative, and applicable to the age we live in. 'Sex is not Compulsory' was for me, one of those books that deeply challenges existing beliefs, and then turn them on their head by the end of the text.For me personally, reading this book has resulted in me no longer wishing to ever have sex (and I'm a 23 year old male!).I thoroughly reccommend 'Sex is not Compulsory' to anyone who is concerned with living a healthy, stress free and productive life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"After seeing the disasterous \\"Brady's In The White House\\" I gave this a try because I also missed it on TV and it was released on DVD at the same time.

All the kids looked like the original actors, and that was definitely lacking \\"Brady's In the White House\\".

Someone only checked the first three pages of her nearly six hundred reviews. This book, as she says, endorses positive virtues but is badly written. The flowery anecdotes induced only boredom and rolling eyes with my twelve-year-old.

I am still satisfied, though, since it doesn't come off and I've found an adjustment combination that rubs the least.

The pack does not use a y-yolk over the shoulders and does NOT place the bulk of the weight over the dogs shoulders. I do like the accessories (waterbowl, food bowl, thermal mat, and leash). However, I have to say I'm taking my Mountainsmith bag to a seamstress to convert the chest harness to a y-yolk and bring the bag more forward to put more weight over the front shoulders.Dog owners with dogs who have long backs or a breed who have a tendency to get hip dysplasia later in life should NOT consider this backpack.Mountainsmith should be ashamed for selling a product like this that increases the likelihood of causing lasting harm to dogs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Clear Explanation of the Path","review":"It is apparent reading Huber's books that she is has truly traveled the path.

Two, the responses of many of her students are included. These are helpful because the issues they raise are often the same one that I experience. Huber shows us clearly how we produce our own suffering.

But the anthropology was hard to follow and more than I cared to follow about west african mojo. Jane's journal was very personal in an unpleasant out-of-her-mind way. The olo, ifa, ulene stuff was over-detailed and forced me to work too hard to decipher the plot in all of it. The author's expression of Jane's mind was unsettling and the racism of the book was too guilt-ridden. It was a little scary when Witt would \\"come\\" for her - that's a good thing. But in the end I was disappointed that the entire story was just about the magic and suspension of western beliefs. Certainly an intelligent writer, and intelligence appreciated.

And no, don't read it if you only like a simple straight narrative. The plot is quite decipherable, but the book weaves together the present stories of the two main protagonists Paz and Jane Doe, with the \\"past\\" via Jane's journal. I think the construction is almost flawless. The prose is gorgeous, but without sacrificing the suspense. The book lagged only the tiniest bit toward the end, then picked up again for a magnificent final confrontation. It also manages to be horrifying without ever feeling like sleazy horror, an amazing feat in itself. If you liked The Skull Mantra, or Smila's Sense of Snow, try this book, which also transport you out of the ordinary world. I did have some trouble with the morality of the twist at the end. There was something the author felt was more forgiveable than I did.

It's heroine is Jane Doe, a rich blond anthropologist now trying to pass as a drab, invisible-as-possible medical records clerk under an assumed name. Oddly, Jane Doe is not the assumed name. :) It's other main character is Jimmy Paz, an Afro-Cuban American homicide detective. Racism, family issues, and immersion in other cultures are all involved.

Towards the end of ToN, the whiff of the supernatural is a little stronger than Publisher's Weekly would have you believe. But the setup is so intelligent that the ending at least seems credible -- albeit stretching the limits of credibility. ToN is unputdownable, a masterful piece of fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spellbinding","review":"I love Michael Gruber and I'm going slowly through his books. I'm afraid if I rush through them that I'll be lost until he writes another. Tropic of Night spans decades, civilizations and parallel realities while drawing you in more and more, until you can't unwind yourself at the end. Gruber has vast knowledge about the wide world and what goes on in it, both past and present, but he never patronizes the reader. His characters are fleshed out with sensitivity and compassion, and his dry wit is unmistakable. But enough about Gruber. Tropic of Night will chill your bones. It is terrifying. A great mystery and a wonderful study of human frailties and, ultimately, love. That's the amazing thing about Gruber. He writes mysteries, but his books transcend the genre. They are full of human folly, adventure, intrigue and the complex bonds between families and humankind in general. Once you get into Tropic of Night, you're done. Send your spouse/kids/etc. to a movie without you and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone wake me when it's over!","review":"I tried really hard to hang with this book and hoped that it would improve, and maybe it does, but I've got to tell you folks, this is one of the most boring books I have read in a while. I forced myself to read to page 150, and just couldn't take it anymore, life is short and shouldn't be wasted reading books you are not enjoying. There were faint moments of excitement and mayhem, but it was a lot like reading a VCR manual for spiritualism. There were a ton of terms and vocabulary to learn in order to understand what was happening, and at least the part I read was so vague, you had a hard time deciphering what was taking place in the story.I had heard this author was great and decided to give him a try, but if all his books are this disjointed and boring, I think I'll pass, thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Compelling but boring at the same time","review":"Ok, this is a clever story, and I cared what happened to the characters. But the intense detail about the actual witchcraft bogged down the interesting parts. The book would make me want to keep going, and then I'd hit a wall, either because it was Jane Doe's over-detailed, and frankly not very interesting, journals, or several pages straight of Jane's every action in preparing for a ritual. At times I'm thinking, wow, this is a compelling book, and the next minute, I'd put it down and go to bed, because it was so tedious. My theory?

But it's just a kind of uneasy mixture of at least two different books and maybe three. I think the author was trying to come up with something different, but grinding one book on top of another and hoping it'll all work out is not the way to go about it.

Why?TROPIC OF NIGHT is one of the most audacious and complicated books I have read in quite some time. The author is trying to write mainstream fiction under the guise of a serial killer novel. In my mind, the novel doesn't work on any level. The pace is meandering as the writer tries to exercise artistic freedom and perhaps to \\"rise\\" above the genre. The plot is almost indecipherable.

I counted 35 fragmented sentences on one page.Trying to figure out what Jane Doe was thinking was like trying to translate with someone who has a limited understanding of the English language, and making sense out of fragmented gibberish.This book may as well have been written in Pig Latin.

Kudos for all the Nigerian and Siberian supernatural anthro stuff. Difficult to follow but creative. The strength of this novel is the central character Jane Doe, female anthropologist. All the strong writing comes from or is about her and her newfound daughter Luz.

I doubt that his future lies in writing novels.There was never much doubt about who the murderer was, just as there was little doubt about the outcome of the political races.While I have visited Boston several times, I don't feel qualified to comment on the political stereotypes in the novel past the point of saying that if true, Boston is still in the 19th century. If the novel is accurate about politics in Massachusetts, I cannot see how Gov. Weld was ever elected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fishy","review":"I found this book in the bargain bin at a super market. I figured that I'd be hard pressed to not get my money's worth on a 50-cent investment. Yet, sure enough, I put down \\"MACKEREL BY MOONLIGHT\\" after about 40 pages. I like politics and I like mysteries, so this book, by the interesting former governor of Massachusetts, seemed like a safe bet. Instead, Weld packs within those 40 pages every politically useful (for Weld) character trait he can apply to his lead character, including wholesome affiliations with people of just about every identifiable demographic group in, well, in Massachusetts. Maybe there's a story here beneath the propaganda, but I didn't wait around to find out. You shouldn't either.I gave this 2 stars instead of 1 because in fairness I didn't finish the book and I guess it could possibly get better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very heavy mug.","review":"These are very heavy, thick walled cups.

It was her birthday gift last year, and she's worn it every time I see her (I haven't asked if she always wears it or not). She was surprised when I gave it to her, but she loved it immediately. To get to the point: she loves it and I think it looks amazing, even after a year of (likely) daily wear. I highly recommend this to any dragon lover (or as a gift for a loved one who loves dragons)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fantasy dragon charm!","review":"If you're into dragons and fantasy and looking for something cute to give your S.O., look no further. I was hesitant at first about this charm because I thought it would be too big and look too cheap (like cheap nickel or pewter jewelry) but I was pleasantly surprised when I got this. It's just the right size, a little over an inch in its widest point, and the sterling silver looks great, not dirty or grungy. Instead it's very shiny and goes with almost anything. I am so glad my boyfriend got it for me. I'll definitely be proudly wearing this one to Dragon*Con this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Little Symbolic Pendant","review":"I bought this for my Wife for Valentines day '08.

The hypnotherapist is grossly made-up, the color and picture are poor, and the sound echoes. Second, this is not a tape about hypnosis! Instead, it is an expensive ad for something called The Radiance Technique, which is a healing method made up by the hypnotherapist. If you are looking for any other than a badly done infomercial, avoid this tape like the plague. If I could find my receipt, I'd already have returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Fascinated","review":"I really wanted to like this book. The synopsis sounded delightful, and a lot of the writing, per se, was very good. But ... our heroine was soooo annoying, I really had a hard time with the rest of it.

I did not like Grace at all, she was without honor. She comes to marry one man for his money and lets another man(not knowing he is the man she is to marry)seduce her after only the second time they had met and so forth. And Arran was no better,knowing Grace was marrying him for his money and was cheating on him (with what Grace thought was another man)(that's what his last wife did to him right;the reason he didn't want to marry again)felt he was falling in love with Grace on the third day. I'm sorry... but what crap! If you like petting and panting after just a few pages, this is the book for you, but if you are like me and like a strong female/male relationship where they actually take some time to know and have respect for each other first, you may want to give this book a pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Program~!

C'mon people!!! How tough is it to get a good master copy or at least dust off the one you are using. One thing about DVD. It sure shows off all the dust and dirt and white fibers.Also it is apparent that the scenery is always changing colors throughout the movies; like the copy they used was sitting in the trunk of a car in the desert for a couple of years before they found it for this collection. Holy smokes. If they can restore old Charlie Chaplin dissolving nitrite films to pristine condition why not these???!!!! I am disappointed that these classics that we grew up with and loved have been so poorly prepared and transfered to dvd. I love the movies. I hate the condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great shows, horrible transfer!","review":"The actual shows themselves are wonderful! These are the Christmas classics that I grew up with and it's great to watch them anytime you want without the commercials and annoying channel logos. However, the transfer to DVD is absolutely horrible. There is so much film grain and dirt it is at times distracting. You would think that they take these wonderful classics and remaster the video, but no such luck. Still worth the purchase, but I wish they would have done a nicer transfer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful walk down memory lane","review":"I loved most (don't personally care for Frosty Returns - don't consider it one of the classics) of these movies growing up and to get them in 1 pack instead of purchasing all individually is wonderful, considering my husband recently bought the Rudolph one by itself and spent almost $[...] for just the one. My 1 complaint: some of the footage is less sharp than the DVDs you normally purchase, but I would assume there were some restoration issues (and hey - these are from 35+ years ago). Frankly, I think only DVD snobs will be bothered by this (except the footage of Little Drummer Boy is rather dark in some places - yet you can still certainly see everything.) My 2 year old loves them too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible customer service","review":"The seller sent it to the wrong address and when it was returned to them they kept my shipping fee and never sent out the product to the correct address.

He watched them all several times. I would suggest this set of DVD's for families who want not only to relive christmas memories past of watching with their own parents (or grandparents) but to create new memories with your own children, and maybe even their children.

Some special content has been cut! Rankin's introductions are among the cuts. True, these intros were horribly corny and he failed miserably at trying to be intellectually profound in them but still it was part of the set's charm! Also, there are advertisements at the beginning of the discs now that can't be skipped!!!! If you're going to buy this set (which is otherwise great) do yourself a favor, go to ebay and buy a copy of last year's release.

While it is a quick and easy read, I did not find enough substance to make it exciting. The stories shared are universal and will appeal to many readers, but there are no conclusions that are not obvious. I wanted to hear more about what the lessons she learned from her experiences and observations as well as applications for the future. I did not want to hear that instead of shopping I could \\"color in a coloring book with crayons\\". Instead tell me that I should figure out that I don't want the shoes because they are not recognition, support, or love, they are just shoes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumbing down America","review":"Reading this book after having met the author, I was quickly convinced that America was doomed to continue plodding along a path of utter stupidity. A multitude of ten cent messages and hack phrases about banal themes left me thinking international children drawn to the book's cover would soon find the content, if that is the right word for the words glued to the soft spine, the disappointing Made-In-America fluff feeding a generation of \\"don't worry, be happy\\", cartooned existence.

This book leaves all children behind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely! Funny! Truthful!","review":"This is a lovely book with tiny treasures throughout, a great surprise. I thought it would be about shopping, but found out it was more about awareness and mindfulness. The story of her mother's healing (and shopping) following the death of her husband touched me deeply.

MacDonald and Travis McGee. Callahan is worldly and competent, but he's driven by his own inner demons to get himself about six feet over his head in deep and turbulent waters.Shannon sucks you into the world of Dry Wells, Nevada, and if you're like me, you'll become very impatient with anything that comes between you and your reading.I'm looking forward to many more exciting mysteries from Shannon! I'm withholding a star from MEMORIAL DAY only because I'm confident that Shannon will get even better as time goes by."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memorable Mystery","review":"This book is perfect for anyone who enjoys mysteries.

To make matters worse, the pieces seem to fit evenly and are very oddly shaped so several times we thought things were fitting and they later turned out to be incorrect. Pieces can seem to fit simultaneously in several spots. Very poor fit. There is no picture that comes with the puzzle to use; only the box which does not include everything.There are so many colors on the puzzle and we literally put something together that is not even on the photo on the box. My 10yo who got this as a gift is probably going to get through it but it is frustrating and a very unfortunate poor quality.They should have included an photo inside and made the pieces clearly fit or not! Some of them do not stay together either."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good casual listen","review":"I'm a big fan of bluegrass and the Shins. I happened upon this album from an unlimited music subscription, and had to take a listen.I found this album a refreshing and fun retake on some of the Shin's work.

I thought \\"when you sleep\\" was pretty good, so I decided to give the rest of the album a shot. First of all, \\"when you sleep\\" is very misleading. The entire album is much more mellow and sounds nothing like it, and had I known it was weird british crap, I would have passed anyway. Think Keane, but much MUCH worse. Not possible? I thought so, but I was wrong. There isn't anything rock or anthemic about it, its just badly produced brit-pop with annoyingly slow tempos.

Listened to it in it's entirety at the gym and loved every single track...how often does that happen? I am a huge fan of the Shoegaze scene and this band has just enough of that element to make me want to sway back and forth and stare at my shoes...I must admit, some of the songs teeter on the corny side (I suppose that's the Pop influence)and I can definitely see them on an OC or One Tree Hill soundtrack, but the songs have just enough droning guitar or catchy hook to suck me in.

The actual weight of the pot and lid is nice, however, the interior parts are quite flimsy. I even had to bend a piece back into shape before I could use the pot for the first time. The stainless basket is nice but the lid to the basket doesn't fit tight in the basket and you end up with a lot of grinds in the coffee.

I chose this one because it was heavy gauge steel with a glass top. No aluminum (alzheimer's contributor) or plastic (taste wrecker), so I bought it. It doesn't build enough steam, heat, pressure or whatever magic makes a percolator work properly to brew a decent cup of coffee unless you want to brew a minimum of 8 cups of coffee, and even that isn't good.

We will keep this one but we recommend for the price of this pot and the quality that you get - PASS, PASS, PASS on this product.Update on this: What a terrible product. In order to get it to percolate correctly, you have to make at least a minimum of 10 cups. So no small pot of coffee just a huge pot of coffee. We gave up on this.

You put your baby in the baby carrier and you move your arms around. You sit your baby on the mat while you do crunches. I didn't even do the workout--I just previewed the DVD so that I would know what equipment I'd need.

However, this one does not disappoint. As a matter of fact, of all Perret's books, this one is most likely the best, despite its flaws. Our subject is the greatest military mind this country has ever produced.Was Gen. MacArthur an egomaniac? Yes, name me a general who wasn't. But in America's 'brief' history, you will not find a more intelligent, and courageous officer than this man. During WWI, his personal bravery and daring led to seven Silver Stars. During WWII, he lost less men in the southwest Pacific in four years of fighting, than Gen. Eisenhower did at the Battle of the Bulge alone! During the Korean war, at seventy years of age, his offensive at Inchon was the height of audacity and planning. He wrote Japan's postwar constitution, he is also revered by many Japanese to this day.All in all, his career is enough to make one say, \\"Patton who?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting, well written book","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. Although long and detailed, I found its style engaging and well organized. It's an easy read. Being able to turn dense historical material into such an interesting book is a triumph.Writing a biography of a controversial personality like MacArthur is challenging and, overall, I think Perret has done a good job. It's too easy to fall in love with your subject and the author is able to resist the temptation to hurruh too much.I think, however, that there are a few areas, where the author seems to accept behaviors that are questionable and problematic. Into his assertion of MacArthur's greatness he never really factors in MacArthur's overly emotional temperament nor his lack of veracity. There is space for further debate here that I think the author missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for fans","review":"Usually, I don't like collections, but this one is a definite must.

Jim Chee is caught in the war for his soul as all of his instincts draw him to become a \\"singer\\" and his heart has fallen for a white school teacher.The third of the Jim Chee series contains a classic example of the use of backstory to tell the new story and move the character forward in growth.The story is a simple murder mystery, but the undercurrents are a strong narrative of a people at the crossroads.An excellent read.Nash Black, author of WRITING AS A SMALL BUSINESS."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rewarding visit with old friends","review":"I have been reading Hillerman since he first starting writing the Leaphorn/Chee series and enjoyed them all. The books and characters have become almost legendary and after reading FIRST EAGLE, decided to see if my impression of the quality of his earlier writings was as captivating as I remembered. I picked up the unabridged audiotape and have been in listening heaven for the last few days. What a treat! Hillerman's style has changed a bit - Leaphorn and Chee have both become more verbose - but the essentials that have made his books so readable are still present.

This is one of the best gangsta rap CDs that has ever been released, and if you're a Daz fan or even just a rap fan, you have to get this one. Tightest traccs: I Got Love in These Streetz, My System (the remix! way more knoccin than the original), Callin' My Name, Love & Happiness (funny as hell), and Shoot Em Up.

From the beautiful After All These Years to the funk rock of The Lever it's an incredible concert. The album is divided into sets and it really incapturates both sides of silverchair as Daniel puts it.A few weakness I've noticed with this album, however is that Daniel's guitar tends to be really low at times espicailly on Emotion Sickness. I'm surprised the orchastration is very high becuase Daniel always said that he didn't like overdubs.Highlights of the DVD and the entire tour for me were the funked up versions of The Door, Anthem For The Year 2000 and The Lever.If you enjoy Silverchair and appreciate their musical diversity then this package is perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"works part of the time","review":"Recieved this laser pointer yesterday, new batteries, it only works \\"some of the time\\".

Since we take our shoes off inside the home, this unit gets daily usage. One of the plastic tracks broke when I was putting it together so it pops out if we're not careful opening and closing the door. When we open the top door, the entire unit tips forward so you have to hold it in place to keep it upright.

The Professor, the Banker, and the Suicide King details these games.The book is a good read. There isn't much discussion of the actual poker hands played, which may disappoint some readers. Instead Craig focuses on the backgrounds & motivations of the individual players and the results of the games (millions won and lost). Craig's hard work to provide accurate results for the various sessions is a welcome contrast to previous inaccurate journalism on the Beal games. It's unfortunate that Craig wrote the book before the final sessions between Beal and \\"the company\\" occurred. As a result, the book stops somewhat mid-action.This book ultimately isn't very deep, but if you're a poker player you'll probably find it an entertaining evening's read. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who doesn't play poker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun story - no educational value for poker wanna-be's","review":"Full of interesting back-story info on the poker stars we see on TV. PB&SK allows us an insiders look at the high-stakes world of poker icons the likes of the Brunsons, Ted Forrest and Jennifer Harmon. It gives the reader a sense of what is really at stake for these people we normally see plunking down a mere $10K for a tournament. In this story $10K is peanuts and each of these players is risking money that could make a significant dent in their fortunes...all but one, the mysterious banker from Texas. The writing is a bit sluggish at times and the author doesn't always seem to finish his anecdotes -- I found myself looking for the punch line more than once, particularly at the end. But for poker afficiandos, it's a must-read, and for those who know nothing about the game and want to live momentarily the life of a risk-taker, it will sate their desire. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Inside Story","review":"In some ways this could be considered a story about negotiating terms and conditions - these factors were key in determining the outcome of \\"the game\\".

The deal brokering and risk management approaches of the top pros working together instead of against each other is fascinating. I always thought that the poker pros were lone cowboys, but that's not always the case. And Andy Beal would be a formidable opponent in anything he decided to take on.Not a poker instruction manual, but a fascinating glimpse into the high stakes world of the top Las Vegas poker room.

The main character has very few redeeming qualities...he seems to be out of touch with the world, very assured of his own opinions and beliefs, and in denial about so much in and around him.

He finds that it inaccurately states where his dead wife worked, and he makes it his mission to investigate and correct this mistake. But is it a mistake? Or are there secrets his wife never told him?I would classify this book as a conspiracy thriller. The premise really intrigued me, but I had a hard time enjoying it. I simply disliked, almost hated the main character. He just wasn't likable. He was in complete denial about his condition, and while this may be a common stage, he just took it too far.And his attitude and treatment of others? He just rubbed me the wrong way, and I couldn't get past it.Overall, the story was exciting, with some good twists and turns. But the ending was too fairy tale happy to fit the rest of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A DOUBLE WHAMMY","review":"This psychological thriller is a great read with all the intrigue, mystery, and espionage one might imagine. The book was complete in the hero's search for the truth about the death of his wife. It all becomes darker as people close to the main character start to die. One soon realizes that there is conspiracy of the highest level.As with planning a vacation, getting there is half the fun - more in this case. When the resolution of the mystery occurred, it was fast and undetailed. It seemed that the author was not as interested in the cover up as the process of discovery.The second layer of the plot was the protagonist's terminal illness. While it might be questioned why this was part of the plot, it added to the darkness and apparant hopelessness of the quest.

Whenever I feel burned out with my wonderful but explosive child, this books helps me to pull myself back together and renews my hope and energy. The Collaborative Problem Solving technique works! What a relief after so many failures.Dr. Greene writes about these kids with affection and respect - and less face it, if your kid is explosive and inflexible, affection and respect from teachers, therapists, doctors, police, etc (maybe even from yourself) has been hard to come by. I can't begin to describe the relief and hope I felt when I finally saw a description of my child that FIT (!) and didn't blame either her or myself for being horribly inadequate people and causing the whole problem in the first place.If you parent or teach these kids - you need to read this book.

As I read this book, I became more and more disappointed. The world is not \\"user friendly,\\" and simply preventing a child from exploding by indulging him with anything he wants is, unfortunately, not going to prepare him for the real world.

It also shows the importance of a parent rethinking their methods and behaviors with the adversarial child (of any age - 2 to 19).

I have to say I was skeptical at first, as I felt the author was talking down to the reader, however, I was being over sensitive. As the mother of an adhd child, often a person gets over sensitive to percieved criticism when none is really there. Anyway, this book opened a whole new view for me on my child's behavior and the basic reasons behind it. At last I saw why conventional behavior modification (token economies, loss of privileges, etc) didn't work and I saw what would work. I found this book the most helpful thing I've tried in years.

(\\"These criteria [for oppositional defiance disorder which, frankly, I do think is a bit of a crock] imply that oppositional behavior is deliberate, and I don't think that's true in many cases.\\") Well, maybe not the cases he's seen but definitely it's on purpose in MY house (\\"Mommy, would you like to go up the wall today?\\" Sigh.)

These children are miserable and looking to us to teach them strategies to feel better.Dr. Greene's book builds on the books on temperament such as \\"The Difficult Child\\" and \\"Raising Your Spiritual Child\\". He gives us a deeper understanding of the emotional consequences of temperamental mismatch.

There's a point where violence and disrespectful behavior cannot be solved with just talking it out. I needed a step by step guidance that's well balanced. I found \\"Parenting Children with ADHD: 10 Lessons That Medicine Cannot Teach\\" by Vincent J. Monastra. It's my go-to book. So far so good. Less defiance, tantrum, and explosions.

The first chapters deal with evolution in general and with real dinosaurs, where they came from, how they changed and why they might have died out. This is followed by chapters that deal with the different regions of Earth, how they have changed over the millions of years and what the animals are like. Not just dinosaurs either, but also creatures evolved from birds, pterosaurs, sea-reptiles and other animals. As in 'After Man' the whole book has been designed like a non-fiction text book, or a nature guide, but doesn't seem as detailed or as fun. While Dixon's 'The New Dinosaurs' seems slightly more realistic than 'After Man' which had such weird creatures as parashrews, it also seems to have less imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"The New Dinosaurs: An Alternative Evolution","review":"Good-but not very relasticDixion really should have bothered to look at the state of the world in the last 65 million years, because their are events that would still have happened. For example, birds would not have become extinct, neither would the mammals, both were doing very well. Also, the Pterosaurs would be extinct, or close to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Interesting Science Book","review":"Dougal Dixon's first book, After Man, was an excellent look at what animals might be like if humans became extinct. This book explores what dinosaurs might have been like if they hadn't gone extinct. It's a very interesting idea, and this book does a good job of it. Many of the dinosaurs are imaginatively designed, but are still remeniscent of real dinosaurs. However, the book is flawed in the fact that some of the dinosaurs are very improbable, for example, many have fur. These creatures are not as imaginative as those in After Man, which is one of my favorite science books. A website called The Speculative Dinosaur Project does a similar thing, except that the creatures are more plausible and more developed, and it is more thourough,Still, this is an excellent book with a well thought out concept, and in spite of what I have said, many of the creatures are very interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good re-release -- but more, please","review":"This is a re-release of an LP from 1982.Tony Rooley has been one of my favourite lutenists since his early duo days with Jim Tyler; and if (as he rather ruefully remarked) he has been technically outstripped by younger virtuosi such as Paul O'Dette, certainly no one has a deeper love, understanding or feel for the music of the period, all of which communicate perfectly on this album. The choice of tempi, the magic way he captures the nuances of mood of each piece, reflect the touch of the master.The vinyl record had one drawback: despite the quality of the music, confining the contents not just to the Renaissance but to Fantasias cannot help but bring a certain sameness, and the pieces are best listened to a few at a time. With CD track selection, this is no problem! Come home after a hard day's work, relax, and enjoy.The total time is 48'31\\".I just wish Hyperion would re-release Tony's two duet albums with Jim (\\"Renaissance Duets\\" and \\"My Lute Awake\\")."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great hero - Good book","review":"Imagine having a baby with someone you never even knew you had sex with...a rather unusual premise but thats the main thread in this story.

Also it's annoying when Maggie keeps trying to give up a guy as great as Nick! KEEP him I say!These few picky items aside, the characters were entertaining and seemed truly in love, not just lust. Definitely recommended if you need a quick romance fix.

The voice of the author is so adolescent it made me cringe- talking about a woman's \\"headlights\\" and giving \\"hand jobs.\\" Gosh! I thought I left that kind of talk behind years ago. It was kind of creepy for this old man to talk this way. I do not recommend this book for anyone who wants to approach sex from a mature perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"PURE GARBAGE","review":"This was absolutely the worst book I have read. It is degrading and offensive to women. If a man were to \\"just assume\\" he had the right to my body AGAINST my wishes, that is rape. I do not have to say yes to any man that treats me like a servant. I would not tolerate this behavior from a husband. I have been married 34 years and NEVER in all that time has my husband ever disrespected my in such a way as this book tells other husbands to do to their wives. Pure garbage!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Major concerns","review":"I think this book had a definite purpose to say that anything within the bounds of marriage is ok, including sex toys. I think most devout Christians will take offense to this. Not to mention he never bothers to comment that if one partner has biblical concerns about any act, the other partner should honor that. I didn't find this book to uphold a biblical standard for the sexual union within marriage. There are much better books out there for couples who believe sex is a gift from God not to be abused with worldly attitudes."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not Sheet Music, This is a book","review":"False advertising.

Probably best for engaged couples and newly married couples.

Somewhat graphic yet very scripturally sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"catered to the almost married","review":"The book's okay, but if you're already married be prepared to skip over the first 6 chapters because it goes into detailed information for engaged couples that those of us who have already been there don't need to be lectured about. Other than that, it's pretty enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for couples - newlywed or just-about-to-be-married","review":"Everyone woman should read this book a couple of weeks before her wedding and every man should read it the week before the wedding. It is an incredible book of helpful information regarding sex in marriage. It gives information for newlyweds that is absolutely invaluable, as well as what to expect for the completely clueless. It is one of the best books I've read regarding the sexual relationship in marriage. My husband and I are reading it together, which also gives great opportunities for discussion."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Perfect Manual on Marriage","review":"This book has covered everything from singleness, to dating, to the honey moon, to lifelong marriage. It helped me see where I was failing in my marriage to my wife of over 8 years. It goes into very minute detail of the marriage bed, etc. Speaks on in-laws, promiscuity and why it hinders a couple. It goes into the give and take of a marriage. It was a very helpful book to me. I do recommend it to anyone married or who plans to one day be married. The author uses God's Word to back up his conclusions for the marriage bed, therefore it is very enlightening and freeing to the conscience of believers to read this book if we are married."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sheet Music","review":"An insightful, well-written book full of helpful suggestions to improve a good marriage. Written from a strong Christian worldview, it has proven interesting and is causing distinct improvement in our marriage as we work through it together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read for Married Couples Everywhere","review":"Marriage doesn't automatically create an amazing love life. Sometimes you need a little bit of help or guidance on how to improve things or just liven it up a bit. My wife and I have always been wary of buying \\"sex advice\\" books because they tend to knock sex down to just the physical act and urges rather than bringing your relationship into it. \\"Sheet Music\\" was a refreshing change from that because Dr. Leman shows that many things come together to create a great physical relationship between a husband and wife and in turn that strengthens their marriage.Of course he gives ideas of how to spice things up, etc., which were aimed at both people and he was great at understanding and sharing both perspectives.It's definitely a must read for couples in any stage of marriage, but I'd also really recommend it to engaged couples to help prepare for what is to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful Book","review":"Easy to read book...shared parts of it with my husband. It has helped us be more open and free with our intimate relationship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Sheet Music","review":"Dr. Lehman's book is tastefully explicit in dealing with sex within marriage.

He speks very candidly about topics that many people have avopided for years. Even though this is a book about sex in marriage, it hits pretty hard at basic marital issues. If only people could get past the title and not view it as just a sex book, it dives into many important topics for marriages that in order to have a great sex life, need to be healthy. I would recommend this book all the time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommend for EVERY married couple- young or old :)","review":"My husband and I are reading this book together, and we LOVE it. Dr. Leman has helped transform our perspectives and motives about sex. When we first got married two and a half years ago we had a really hard time figuring out and enjoying intimacy.

I have been married 26 years and found this book very informative and beneficial. I purchased a second book for my son and daughter-in-law, I found it to be honest and definitely worth reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What the cover doesn't tell you","review":"Based on the cover of this book and knowing nothing else but what was writtne on the back when I bought it, I would not recomend this book. It's misleading. Nowhere does it mention God or The Creator that he talks so much about or the fact that he's a Christian psychologist. I was highly dissapointed when I found God on every single page of this book talking about the rights and wrongs of what God has planned for you as far as sex in marriage goes. This isn't to say that I'm against God or don't belive in Him, but really, that was not what I expected out of this book at all. I think some of the things he says could be used regardless of your religious beliefs, but much of it is too focused on what's right in God's eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT BIBLICAL","review":"Picked this book up along with Act of Marriage and Intended For Pleasure. At first I enjoyed the different perspective on a few topics, but was very shocked to read very un-wise suggestions. For example, the author suggests the groom-to-be engage in pre-marital lust before the wedding night. If I want worldly wisdom on the subject of sex, then I'll read Cosmo magazine. For couples looking for solid biblical and medical advice, my wife and I both highly highly recommend Act of Marriage instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"This was an awesome book to read. I read it after my husband and I had our first child, and I really feel like it helped to get my mind set back to having an intimate close relationship with my husband! I would definitely recommend this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Content","review":"If only all Christians knew that such a book was available.. This book is practical and gets into gritty detail that husbands and wives should know before marriage. It also has lots of good detail for those that are married. There are diagrams, breakdowns, biblical references, and more. My fiance(now wife) and I both read this book and love it! This will be a permanent recommendation to every couple I talk with about sexual intimacy in a marriage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noble purpose but lacking in depth and sensitivity","review":"While I appreciate Leman's purpose in writing \\"Sheet Music\\" was to create better sex and unity in marriage, his execution of that promise fell way short for me. First of all, he seems to share no real sympathy with the female perspective on this issue and comes across more as a sex driven pervert than a mature psychologist interested in nurturing the wounded psyche to consider thoughts of sex and the act of sex as pleasurable and important. He could have saved himself and the many victims unfortunate enough to read his book the time and energy and just printed a bumper sticker, \\"If you don't have sex with your husband...and LIKE it; he'll have sex with someone else.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Be cautious about some of his advice...","review":"This book is well-written, clever and entertaining with some great suggestions. I particularly value his emphasis on communication between a couple regarding sex. I can't ultimately recommend this book to others or give it as a shower gift because I think his advice about \\"self stimulation\\" is dangerous. Leman advices men to \\"self stimulate\\" in order to learn ejaculatory control. He advices women to \\"self stimulate\\" in order to understand her own body and what pleasures her. The danger here, and it's a very real one, is that it can lead to a habit of masturbation, which is destructive and divisive in a marriage and one's own spiritual life. Don't even go there. These things can be learned without \\"self stimulation\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for every couple","review":"My wife actually checked this book out of the library to take along during our 27th wedding anniversary trip. We have 13 children and have a very good relationship. Dr. Leman's advice to couples to use physical intimacy to combat the stress that we as couples deal with is good advice.Later in the book he devotes a couple of chapters to oral sex. There are some references to the Song of Solomon regarding justification for that practice. It's quite a stretch to presume that God smiles on that practice by simply quoting some of the scriptures referenced. Current medical advice also discourages it because of viral (and possible bacterial) infections that can occur in the mouth of those participating.My advice would be to take the other chapters and glean from those what you can. Just don't take another man's word for what Scripture says. Read the Word for yourself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great book, but...","review":"Ok, so as the other reviews have said this is a great book to read. That is why I gave it 4 stars. However, a few things said in the book upset me. Could just be me, but honestly putting people down for sex before marriage and calling it immoral made my blood boil. Some people are not devout Christians and this can be really insulting. But everyone is entitled to their own opinion...That being the only issue, it was a great read. He really did his homework and hit the nail on the head about all issues. My fiance and I are reading this together. If you cannot talk about sex before marriage, then how do you expect to talk about it after you get married."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Rates a Big Zero","review":"I've only read some of this book, which I have decided is not Christian at all. There is nothing in it to indicate that the author has anything more than a nominal Christian position, certainly not a Biblical one. I agree with those who found it pornographic in its emphasis. What makes the author think that perversions of the sex act are a-ok is beyond my comprehension. If you want a degraded sex life, then this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refresh the intimacy in your marriage","review":"Dr. Leman tells it like it is and gives a refreshing perspective on the subject of sexual intimacy within the boundaries of marriage. A must have for newlyweds! Adds a little spice to seasoned marriages!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really?","review":"Well, while I think much of the advice in the book is worthy, as a married woman I didn't get much benefit from the book. I felt like every other page mentioned just how much ALL men wanted sex ALL the time and women just have to stop being selfish and saying no. Really? ALL men want sex ALL the time? ALL women say NO? I don't think so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great resource","review":"This is a great book to help couples talk about sex. It's part of a healthy marriage, but not usually discussed with candor and sensitivity by most couples.

Get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful","review":"I was leery, but this book was recommended to us by our marriage counselor so we went for it. He's very straightforward.

I cannot recommend this book enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"haha, a little embarrassed","review":"My husband and I really enjoyed this book and it helped us to open up to one another, which in turn, helped strengthen our relationship.

A whimsical tale of a perseverant immigrant who saves Philadelphia by importing Sparrows to rescue the trees from the plight of inch worms. Jack dreaded the cross Atlantic journey to the United States, because he gets seasick. But, he wants to come to America for more opportunities at the turn of the 20th century. When the people of Philadelphia declare a state of emergency because the trees are disappearing with an infestation of inchworms, the main character comes up with a novel solution to solve a problem, but his community doubts him. He wants to try out his theory and on his own dime and dreading the journey, he once again sails back to his native England to collect sparrows. He returns and sets the sparrows free saving Philadelphia from the infestation.

Elvis is so close to the audience that it has a surreal quality to it. His voice is impeccable, raw, thick, and tough, at turns sweet and gentle for the ballads, and the skill with which he effortlessly and naturally moves between the two is amazing. This is a one of a kind experience showcasing arguably the best of the best of a brilliant career. Those who don't even think they like Elvis will be converts - incredible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just the basics of the 1968 Special","review":"This DVD has just the basics of Elvis' excellent 1968 special. If you want an in-depth presentation, you should get the 2 DVD Deluxe edition. This DVD includes nearly all of the footage of the original show. Elvis' performances are outstanding, especially the \\"informal\\" jam session, where Elvis actually plays his guitar instead of just using it as a prop! Elvis' informal jam session was an early precursor of the MTV Unplugged series that would follow more than 20 years later. The bonus material includes some outtakes and photos, but really does not add much to the set. This DVD should be enough for the average fan and it is available at a reasonable price.

I'm a huge Elvis fan, but this was not what I was looking for. It's not the full \\"68 Comeback special. I watched it with my dad, and he saw the original and this isn't it. It's 3 DVD's total. The first DVD, is pretty good. It shows a lot of the special but not all of it. It also left out a lot of Elvis with his band on the stage with him, in his hot leather outfit. That's the best part of the show and they left most of it out. The second and third DVD in this collection, shows take after take of Elvis doing the same thing over and over. Elvis up close, Elvis from this angle, Elvis's hand up close strumming the guitar. Yeah, that's ok but that's not what I thought I was purchasing. I wanted the actual comeback special and you can totally skip the second and third DVD's because their not that good. Save your money, because this totally misrepresented what it actually is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent DVD set","review":"This is a great DVD set for an Elvis fan. Elvis' energy during the sitdown and standup shows is phenomenal. He truly looks like he's enjoying himself, really gets into the songs, and he sounds like he's pouring his soul into them. The way his voice belts out these tunes is truly amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD","review":"This was a great purchase. My wife and I have long loved the \\"Comeback Elvis\\" but this is the first time we've purchased any of the material from it. The extra songs and takes are really good, although by the end of the second DVD we had seen enough retakes of certain songs that we had to take a break.Being able to watch the original TV show, than see the entire show as it was originally (both sit down and stand up sessions), then going back to the original TV show and see how they edited it was very interesting as well. All in all, a great little purchase for the Comeback Elvis fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must for your Elvis Library","review":"Absolutely wonderful.

It is missing the production \\"It Hurts Me\\"... And yes, it hurt me when I found out after expending too much money for it.This is the 3rd time it happens. The people behind the Elvis Enterprises are dishonest and they are laughing at us, in order to get the money. Next time, I will not rush and buy the next Elvis product on Ebay for a lot less money.In the \\"68 Comeback Special\\" you will see a gorgeous, energetic, Elvis; specially when he is singing with his original small group. It is a little bit annoying the full band that he uses for other songs. The horns are too loud and harsh. I agree with Paul McCartney when he said that Elvis was better with a small band than with a full orchestra ...and definitely I agree with Scotty Moore when he stated... \\"68 Comeback Special: A Farewell Performance\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money they're asking for","review":"This dvd should have been 1 disc instead of 3 and therefore priced that way. Instead greedy NBC wanted to make a big profit and added all this extra footage of outtakes. Please the comeback special broadcast would have been sufficient. If you like to see Elvis start a song and then stop because of some problem then you'll like this dvd because most of it is just that but I found it was very annoying and unnecessary. Hey NBC are you not making enough money that you have to suck every dollar from poor hard working consumers. Shame on you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elvis 3 set dvd - comeback tour","review":"I was very happy with the fast delivery service but disappointed in the fact of the 3 dvd's as they were very repetitive.

It was crafted to show his musical talents and personality, the reason so many of us love Elvis and his music. He was able to interpret many kinds of music with ease because he felt what he was singing and had the musical talent to handle different forms of music. I still like his rhythm and blues and country numbers the best, but I enjoyed all the music in this performance. He seemed so calm even though he said he was nervous. The production numbers were very good, but seeing Elvis in an informal setting was the best part of the show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elvisfan","review":"Great set of DVD's on the comeback special.

I'm an avid reader and can read quickly, but this book makes me slow down and think! The vivid images in this author's writing cut me to the heart of my soul. I laugh, cry, and look at myself in the mirror as I read them. Along with the author, I know that I am forgiven for all of my sins by God's grace of salvation in Jesus Christ! There is nothing I can do to earn it! The devotions, based mostly on his experiences as a father of three, are funny and refreshing. The honesty about his need for God to be his Teacher while raising them comes through as authentic. At the end of each devotion is a prayer and suggestions for practical application of the Biblical truth in daily living. Consequently, everytime I look at my own children, I remember something that God is trying to tell me through Wesemann's words and the lesson sinks deeper into my heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Help the Children","review":"This version of your song is the most beautiful song I have ever heard.

She loves Maisy, so I thought this would be a perfect way to introduce her to the concept of 'school.' Not quite. The book includes pictures of Maisy doing things all on her own, no teacher or other kids involved, no saying goodbye to Mom or Dad in the morning. Plus, the book is small and the pull tabs are really hard to maneuver. The book was ripped apart in a matter of two days after my daughter tried to pull and push tabs on her own.

I feel like every other page was mentioning that bison are harder to kill than deer. It was like a horrible game of telephone where every single character in the book had to say the same exact thing to every other character.Once they finished discussing bison I then had to hear every single character mention that Rabbit makes arrows. Over, and over, and over..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it his wife?","review":"I am not a sexist. Women, generaly, write every bit as well as men, and often better. But every sentence crafted under the stewardship of the Eddings couple causes my bile to rise anew. So trite, so banal, so. . .bad. I keep asking myself, is it just that I was really young when I read the Belgariad? I did read it in my early teens, but I was fairly well read then, and I don't remember it being anything like the peurile swill they've got us slogging through here. Very disappointing. Even worse than the Althalus book, and that was pretty bad too. I swear he's letting his kid write it, or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wont even read it...","review":"Maybe David Eddings should read his own books, for example \\"The Rivan Codex,\\" where he blatantly tells people they should not write fantasy adventure books if they are not serious about it. I thoroughly enjoyed all of his books up until \\"The Redemption of Athalus,\\" I've read and re-read his better books but I am done with this series. I could barely stomache the first two, and now I must give accelades to all of you dear people who had the furtitude to trudge through the 3rd book and then given me the insight to know that I do not want to read it. My only solace is that Eddings may actually read these comments and know that we as fans expect more from him then carbon copied characters, and endless drivel. Read \\"The Rivan Codex,\\" David Eddings since you wrote it and then re-read this series and honestly ask yourself if you consider this good literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"The Belgariad and The Mallorean are some of my favorite books. The next series was okay. The characters did not change but the story was good. This series sucks on many levels. The witty banter is present but the characters are one dimensional and almost all the same. There is no plot to speak of. They all gather, set up a fort and a natural disaster (1 of four can you guess??earth, air, water, and fire) saves the day. They spend most of the time discussing how the bug people evolve over and over and over again. Okay I get it already!!! There was no intrigue, no trying to figure things out, no quests, no fear that they might lose or that any of the characters were in danger. In short these books had nothing interesting. I had to force my way through the first three books and I have no intention of reading the fourth as I'm pretty sure of what is going to happen and I can probably fill in the dialogue too. I feel totally ripped off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly Disapointing","review":"As is true of many others, I was excited to get the new series (The Dreamers). When the first book arrived, I devoured it. It was a bit disjointed, but I assumed this was mearly plot and story development. Some books just take time to \\"take off\\". The second book was no better if anything it was weaker. The third followed suit. I have been and will be a loyal Reader of the Eddings'. But this series seems as if it were an old un edited project that was done long before the Belgarid or the others. It is Too weak and I guess the word I want to use is immature in style. But as I said I will continue to buy books from this author.ThanksKirby Overstreet"},{"rating":"1","title":"Once again - it falls flat","review":"I want to preface this review with saying that David Eddings is one of my favorite authors. I will continue to buy anything he writes with an expectation of a good book.Having said this - the 2nd and 3rd book in this series did NOT meet with approval. The first book was decent bordering on good but it ended there. I bought all three after they had all been published and must say I was disappointed.If you are new to David Eddings - you may like these. If you don't like them... Do NOT give up on his works!!! Go back to the Belgariad and read the whole series!! This is a VERY good fantasy writer!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is the fourth book necessary?","review":"I have read everything Eddings has written (fiction and fantasy) and this series is easily the worst of the lot. The duo Eddings use the same device: group of people from different parts of life band together, add a deity or two--win the war. It worked superbly for the Belgariad and the Mallorion, I could put up with it through the Elenium and Tamuli and I even let it slide for The Redemption of Althalus but for The Dreamers Series it is unforgivable. The aforementioned series is not well written, this series is filled with repetition, poor jokes and little imagination. He would have been better off to tell this story in a single volume or not at all...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Stop The Killing","review":"I just got to say this people what has happened to the Edding Books. I have been a huge fan for his many other series but this is the worst I have ever read. This book still has the same flaws as the others in the series. I'm sorry Eddings but these books dont measure up to what you've given in the past I dont know if its your wife or just your publishers rushing you but whatever it is Eddings needs to fix it badly."},{"rating":"1","title":"repetitive at the least","review":"I agree with most of what was said regarding this Eddings series. And to not make his same mistake, I will not repeat the comments again. I can't help wonder why the change in publisher though? His previous works (I have them all) are mostly Del Rey. This series is Aspect publishing, a branch of Time Warner. If the publisher did this, it's a horrible decision and Eddings should take them for what he can. If it's Eddings that was dropped from Del Rey for a lackluster story, then I will be thinking hard about purchasing any other series. Which is really too bad..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful to Read","review":"I have always thought David Eddings was the best fantasy writer ever and would vehemently argue this point with everyone. I bought the second two books of this series with the expectation each time that they would be better than the first. I was extremely disappointed. I don't believe Eddings wrote these books! The writing style is awkward and the chapters don't flow well. Also, enough with the cute little phrases \\"without a hint of a smile\\" or \\"with a faint smile\\" or \\"with a broad grin\\" or \\"so beat me\\", which all seem to be painfully misplaced! The story line is great, but the writing style makes the book(s) difficult to read. In fact, the books are so awful that I doubt that I'll ever buy another Eddings book. My advice -- if you must buy it, wait for the paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"Please do not take this series as Eddings - this cannot be him and I can only think that he is letting his wife to the writing. I can almost feel the difference between pages - some sound like good old Pawn of Propechy Eddings, and other just do not feel like its him writing it at all- almost like him and his wife take turns!Childish writing, boring storyline- I usually read a series through, but I cannot bring myself to do it this time..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain dull.","review":"I love the Eddings. Really, I do. But this series is really going nowhere. The Belgarad, the Tamuli, the Elenium, and the Mallorian series were repetitions of the same characters and mystical stones. But they were so well written and the pages flowed, so it was easy to overlook. But in this series, I think they went to the well one too many times. The endings are so disjointed and abrupt I had to blink and say, \\"They didn't just do that.\\" But they did. Sadly."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Review of the Crystal Gorge","review":"When I first read the Pawns of Prophecy, it captured my imagination and I burned thru the rest of the Belgariad with an obsesive zeal. The day that Gaurdians of the West came out was one of the happiest days of my life. I thought that the Elenium and the Tamuli were equally good, though bearing a bit to much similarity to the Belgariad and the Mallorean. I am sad to say that I have found everything else by Mr. Eddings to be a downward slide into mediocrity - to the extent that while reading the Crystal Gorge, I mostly felt that I was wasting my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Getting worse and worse...","review":"How low can this go? The Belgarion series was great, but the quality has dropped with each series. Is there ever any doubt that the heros will win? Not only do they have 4 \\"old\\" gods on their side, but 4 \\"new\\" gods, as well as an uber-god, who takes care of problems at the end of each book. The bad guys/gods get more and more cliche each time, and at no time did I feel anything could go wrong for the good guys.The heroes are caricatures as well - the greatest archer (able to kill a buffalo at 200 yards with one arrow the first time he sees one), the greatest general ever, the most inventive man ever, the greatest sailor ever, and on and on.

Characters we come to enjoy fade or nearly disappear while new ones jump in and steal the stage, though they are obviously just tools to move the story-which they do poorly. The end of the novel is a jumble of characters running to collide while spewing lengthy monologues about the meaning life, man's relationship with nature, and several other deep thoughts which are hard to care about. Overall Ventus is disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Unsynchronized Mixup","review":"It would appear that Mr. Schroeder could not decide what sort of book to write: fantasy or science fiction. In the end, it is like most compromises, neither fish nor fowl. The first fifty pages were boring. Then again, so were the next 150 before I finally gave up. Ventus gives new meaning to the requirement to suspend disbelief. It is simply tedious. Save your money for a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"How did I not know about this book sooner?","review":"Absolutely amazing. Some of the best storytelling I've come across in a long LONG time. Unlike anything I've ever read, in the best possible way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well plotted and rich in ideas","review":"I almost didn't read Ventus because I was disappointed in my first Schroeder novel, Permanence. I'm glad I gave it a try. Ventus suffers from some of the same problems present in Permanence: Schroeder's writing style is undeveloped, as are his characters. Indeed, he suffers from the classic characterization flaw of telling rather than showing (we basically have to take the narrator's word for it that Calandria May is unhappy with life, for example). Nevertheless, Ventus is overall a success. Schroeder keeps the plot moving and deftly handles the large cast of characters. The real centerpiece here is the planet, Ventus, and as we slowly learn more about its history and purpose, it becomes the most interesting character in the book. Although Schroeder doesn't develop them as far as he might, his ideas concerning the uses of nanotechnology, the nature of humanity and sentience, and far-future lifestyles and ethics are original and thought-provoking. Ventus is good SF."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated, I think","review":"A good story in which all the many dangling threads are resolved, but without seeming overly tidy about it. As others have pointed out, Vernor Vinge is probably the best point of comparative reference here: the numerous, complex characters (including women); the multiple, intersecting plotlines; and most of all, the contrast between a low-tech, quasi-medieval society and an advanced, space-faring culture. I could have used a bit more of the latter, especially further elaboration of the rogue AI backstory, which was intriguing. (I understand that he picks up some of that thread in his later novel Lady of Mazes.) I definitely can recommend this one, though, and I certainly think Schroeder is a talent worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing science-fantasy","review":"(...)I thought it was an intriguing book, one that starts out deceptively akin to a standard fantasy, but which quickly transforms into something much more interesting.With an engaging set of characters who undergo substantial shifts in circumstance and morality throughout the book (a rare phenomenon in standard fantasy, and welcome here), a good, swift pace and a really interesting piece of world building, Ventus is a piece of science-fantasy that is a credit to both genres."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Work - Bottle was leaking","review":"We followed all instructions and it simply didn't work.

So many of his example formulas and sample questions are just wrong. Try to follow his math, he doesn't show steps correctly, and if you end up with a different result you will never know why.

It is certainly capacious. But don't buy it for security. I was just looking at this product at a store today, and I was easily able to reach through the slot and retrieve the assembly instructions at the bottom of the box. If I can do that, so can a thief who wants my Netflix mail or a bank statement or anything else. To be fair, every \\"secure\\" mailbox except one that I looked at I could simply reach into and fetch things. This is placebo security."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive for the poor quality","review":"This mailbox will not stop anyone that is wanting to quickly get into it. When the keys to my mailbox were misplaced, I decided to try getting into the mailbox. I was shocked at how easily it could be opened without using any tools. If you give it a good tug, the door will open. Closing it without removing the lock would likely be a challenge though. What I hope is that it will at least cause a drive by snatcher to just move along. In case anyone has lost their keys, you can order a new lock mechanism with keys from the manufacturer via the The Solar Group."},{"rating":"1","title":"Locking Mailbox","review":"After inserting mail in the slot the flap does not come down on it's own you have to manipulate it by hand, and the mailperson is not going to take the time to do that.

It is a very nice looking unit but a little inconvenient design issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lock is theft deterrent only","review":"As a mailbox, this is a good product. As a SECURE mailbox, this definitely falls short. We had ours broken into, figured the lock just wore out or something though so we bought a new one.

We now are looking into a more secure box.If you're looking for something more secure than a normal mailbox, this is better only because it locks.

I had plenty of experience not relevant to nursing and was having a hard time changing my resume to fit my new career. This book was oh-so-helpful as it had examples of resumes for new grads as well as career changers. Additionally, it gives examples for a variety of positions from clinical assistant to LPN to nurse anesthetist. It even gives an example of a cirriculum vitae (another form of resume.)What you won't find in this book is how to write a resume. If you plan on using this book, you may also want to get a good book that gives the how-tos.

There was a single page that pertained to the information I was looking for and it didn't really apply to me that much. Ended up looking online for what I needed, so basically this was wasted money. It's a book of all different kinds of nursing, from CNA to specializations in the nursing field, which would be good for someone looking for a very specific kind of resume. But not worth the $15 .... can get it for $8 on other websites, like Half dot com, so I was not a happy camper with this purchase.

After being in the dishwasher, the surface starts to melt off. Even the other bad plastic chopsticks I have held up better than these.

It is very upsetting to my spouse and I if we forget to grab some when we get take out, and we started stashing extras at home in case of such an emergency. I needed to spend a little more to qualify for an Amazon kitchen coupon and came across these. I felt like an idiot. Buying some chopsticks instead of using the disposable had just never entered my mind!

The label clearly says they are WOODEN chopsticks but they are in fact cheap plastic pieces of junk. A very small amount of pressure can easily snap these chopsticks in half. I specifically bought these along with some stainless steel chopsticks in case I could not handle the slipperyness of the steel but these are poorly made, slippery plastic. When held together the small ends are beveled away from eachother with also makes grasping things even harder. This was also under the category of \\"japanese Chopsticks\\" and they are very much Chinese. The symbols are little more than painted junk that actually makes the chopsticks look cheaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Case","review":"I purchased this case because it has the wall-hanging option and a mirror to show off the back side of the ball that has signatures as well. It was very easy to hang, but my one complaint is that the plastic ledge that hangs on the wall and holds the clear case & ball isn't very sturdy and bows a bit to hold up the weight.

The D1 book had extensively commented source code which I found invaluable (I still refer to this book today). The Delphi 4 Bible does not. The D1 book was very comprehensive.

Maybe if she solved her crimes completely by accident it would be believable, but outsmart the police? It is also somewhat offensive to make fun of the things she does--the senility and forgetfulness in old age, joking and laughing about death and funerals. The sense of humor is an attempt at being silly but it is offensive. Living in this kind of environment where one is losing friends and family to death, the loneliness and sadness found there, is a topic and setting of bad taste. My guess is the author herself does not live under such circumstances, but when she does, maybe she won't make jokes about it anymore. Just another example of how people in our society take lightly and joke about things that should be taken seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tape around the World","review":"Great seller.

Howells initially wrote his Requiem in memory of his son Michael who had tragically died in 1935 (at the age of nine) of spinal meningitis. It is an intensely personal and intimately expressive work which was essentially kept from publication until 1980. It is interesting to note that this recording was completed in February 1983, less than two weeks before the composer himself died at the age of 90. The other Howells piece featured is the less well-known Take Him Earth for Cherishing, which he was commissioned to write in memoriam following the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. It was premiered in 1964. Matthew Best and the Corydon Singers have provided what is in my estimation the definitive recording of this deeply moving Requiem."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful CD","review":"Deep and beautiful music, excellently sung.

Cooke, who both writes and draws, makes everything seem so damn cool that you can't help but love this book.

The actor who plays Greg acts and looks more like Peter. Peter and Bobby simply share no resemblance to the true characters and have few cameos because of it. I thought the first part of the movie was confused and strained. Better plots are available. Some of the original series plots are brought forth, but never really captitalized on, except for the \\"slumber party\\" which was well done.

Dr. Placher has put together a collection of essays by 18 distinguished scholars. Nine important issues are discussed. Each section begins with a helpful introduction by Dr. Placher which serves to frame the discussion. Then two authors with different perspectives present their thoughts on the topic. At the end of each chapter are questions for discussion and a list of additional resources.This book could serve as an excellent launching pad for further research in any of these areas. The great thing about the book is that it is not set up in an \\"us\\" versus \\"them\\" way. The authors don't set themselves up on the opposite sides of issues. Rather, each presents his or her own views in a non-confrontational way. By reading two perspectives on an issue, more of the nuance of the topic shows through.

I must say that Placher has done a fantastic job of choosing a stellar lineup of essayists from a broad spectrum of opinion. Moreover, unlike some counterpoint books that leave the reader bewildered, each section here is unified by Placher's excellent introductions. The opinions expressed range from progressive evangelical to mainline liberal, and while there are definitely some places where my students were irritated (e.g. a defense of homosexual practice) or simply mystified (Cobb's process theology), their overall impression was positive. They recognized how much their horizons had been broadened, and that is the mark of an excellent introduction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible View of Theology","review":"I was very skeptical when I read the authors brief summary in the beginning of this book.

We have a very good silent wheel, but it's too small for our hamster. Moved up to the 8-inch Comfort Exercise wheel and found it a poor choice. The hamster does like and use it, but it's dreary from our point of view. The wheel is quite noisy and wobbles wildly when in use. We can hear it at night in our bedroom at the opposite end of the house. Though safe for the hamster because of the solid wheel, it has a cheap feel and does not revolve smoothly on its axle. The noise comes from both the wheel wobbling on the axle and from the entire contraption twisting and bouncing about as the hamster gets his workout. The packaging says the wheel can be suspended on the cage, but the 'key' that is supposed to secure it to the cage does not fit through our cage's frame.

I thought it was because she's lazy, but I \\"ran\\" my fingers on the wheel to determine the ease in spinning. It was sticking, hard to move and did not spin fluidly at all. I can see why my hedgehog won't go on it. The only plus is that it is solid so her feet would not theoretically get stuck and it fits perfectly in the cage. None of that matters if the wheel doesn't move."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have known better","review":"A quiet hamster wheel does not exist! This wheel is NOT quiet.

It is a pain in the butt to get it attached to the side of the cage (pull white stand out of holes on back of wheel and then pull the center out and reattach with center part on back of wheel on the outside of the cage and wheel inside of cage.

At least the hedgehog likes it!","review":"We're using the 12 inch version. The wheel wobbles a bit and had to be both screwed into the cage wall AND needed the stand underneath to keep it reasonable stable.. And it still wobbles. There's nothing \\"whisper quiet\\" about it, its pretty loud, not as bad as metal wheels, but pretty close. It's also very difficult to detach for cleaning. The only good thing about it is how much my little hedgie loves it.. All night long, on that loud wheel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I bought this for my adult sugar glider and it was a complete waste of money. First of all, it will not fit the bars on the cage so I can't attach it to the side like I had planned to. It is completely unusable on the stand it came with unless you can find a way to securely anchor it to the bottom of the cage. Every time my glider tried to use it the thing would wobble and scoot around until my glider got thrown out, making it impossible to run in. It is also incredibly difficult to spin, for a pet wheel. My glider can actually climb up and sit on top of it, and the thing doesn't even turn or throw him off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud wheel!","review":"We've owned several wheels and this one by far is the loudest.

As I have found with all the Canon products I've owned, these are rather expensive, but are of excellent quality. Having owned other, less expensive, and having been disappointed by them, I always opt for a Canon product if one is available in my price range. The toner, of course, is part of the bargain.

I read a few other reviews commenting how different the CD is from her former S Club days. So, I pretty much expected that. What I didn't expect was HOW different, and how much I actually DO like this CD.There are a few songs I probably won't listen to as much as the others, but I have to say I was pretty much in shock after listening to it the first time. I've listened to it three more times in two days-and am completely blown away not only by Rachel's vocals, but the production is a near masterpiece. The songs are well written, and the musicians are extremely talented. (Lot's of acoustic stuff).There's a small hint of dance music, but it's mostly rhythmic pop-rock. Even the song \\"Blue Afternoon\\" has a hint of 1960's Herb Alpert style jazz.All in all-it's a suprisingly OUTSTANDING CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the same cd Amazon has listed","review":"I love this album and Rachel, but I gave it a low rating because this is NOT the version that Amazon listed.

Hers is the voice of a mature writer who has absorbed and reabsorbed the experience of the \\"little girl\\" whose mother \\"bequeathed her the muse/ who disappeared beneath the magnolias\\" only to be recovered later through art. For Luther's characteristic persona, the disappearance of the muse permeates subsequent losses not just with grief, but with the possibility of invocation (from the magnolia, from the microwave, from fiddle music, from crickets and tree frogs). In paying her loved ones the tribute of words, she animates and is animated by the traces of their lives. In poems such as \\"Nuya Saligugi (Stone Turtle)\\" and \\"Sheaves,\\" among others, she recovers and expands her mother's own words in \\"Return\\": \\"your voice,/ Eager as a bird's song at dawn,/ Has struck an answering note/ On the string I thought broken/ Long ago.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"This was a great book.

I'd go as far to say he's a Christian Steven King. The book Obsessed is another example of his fine work. This particular one takes some dedication to get through, but when the stuff starts hitting the fan you can't put the book down. His visual writing style makes you feel like you are actually there in the time periods he is writing about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Obsession","review":"This is the first Ted Dekker book I have read and did not know what to expect. At first I wasn't going to finish it but it was a book for a book club. Actually, I couldn't put it down. It was so interesting how Dekker was able to keep you wanting more by making the plot more and more intersting as you read. Very good book, I ordered two more of Dekker's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"'This one's for the Circle'","review":"Ted Dekker has done it again!Obsessed is a spellbinding book with action, suspense, and plot twists galore! In all honesty, Ted Dekker is the master of the plot.The scene is the 1970s, hippies, classic tunes i.e: 'Ain't no mountain high enough' and Nazis! Which one doesn't belong?In a story that will capture you from the first few pages, and leave you staying up until all hours of the night to finish.the only question is: How Obsessed are you? what would you give up to claim your Obsession?This story influences everything and sends a new meaning for life, love, and God."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed","review":"I had not read Ted Dekker until I read his collaboration with Frank Peretti with the recent \\"House\\". I really liked that book so I was looking forward to reading more by Dekker. Unfortunately this was the one I read next and I was very disappointed. It was hokey. I'm hoping that some of his others are better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak ending is a letdown","review":"It's been a while since I read this, but my most vivid memory of the story is the weak ending. Dekker makes his villain seem like the ultimate evil this side of Satan, but then dispatches him with a yawn.I did think that the scenes in the concentration camp were tense and riveting, but the 70's part of the story struck me as odd. The protagonist's attempts to retrieve the objects of his obsession were so nutty that they played like black comedy. Dressing up like a woman to sneak into a building? What is this, \\"Mrs. Doubtfire\\"?As with much recent \\"Christian\\" fiction, there's not much here in the way of insight or edification. \\"Love conquers all\\" is just about the only spiritual message here. Bottom line, \\"Obsessed\\" isn't horrible, but there are better books out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"another great one","review":"I think that this one is another of his greats. I loved the way that he combined \\"history\\" with \\"present\\". I have never cried reading a book before, but this one opened the flood gates.

On one side is evil, in this case a former Nazi concentration camp commander and his son whose obsession is cruelty and death. On the other side is the love of God and his obsession with his people. In the middle is a Jewish American who was born in the concentration camp. His obsession becomes the need to find the truth about his mother and his past, and about a girl whose past is linked with his. His obsession blossoms into love. This story never lets up, from the beginning to the exciting and satisfying ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Can Never Go Wrong with DeKker","review":"Obsessed is brilliant. Spine-chilling. Creepy. Spectacularly written- as any of Ted's books are. This book stretches the limits of complete abhorrance toward multiple characters and pushes you forward, finding yourself rooting hysterically for the main character to defeat evil! Suspense drives it on. Ultimately, this novel is not for the faint of heart, yet everyone should experience the outrageousness of becoming... Obsessed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Ted Dekker 'Must Read'","review":"Again Ted Dekker has shown has amazing versatility as an author and as a Christian charged with the \\"great commission.\\" It would seem that subtlety would not be a term descriptive of anything Ted Dekker, yet that is exactly his style of evangelism, if not his actual writing. There are no omnipotent superheroes, but rather ordinary men and women seeking hope, even as prisoners of demonic Nazi torturers.This is a story that must be told, and Ted Dekker tells it in a characteristically unique style. I've read all his other works, and now I find myself \\"obsessed\\" with the anticipation of September, 2005, when the next (not a sequel) Dekker novel is released."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gripping tale with lots of heart","review":"Let's face it, Ted Dekker has his own style. Some love it, others like it, others hate it. Whatever you think of his style, you have to give him one thing, he writes with passion and emotion. And in Obsessed that's exactly what you get: a gripping thriller written with emotion.What the story lacks in characterization and detail, it more than makes up in theme. In short, Dekker succeeds in reminding the reader how much God obsesses over His children and that we are to obsess over Him in the same way. Obsessed is a modern-day parable worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"If You Like Out-of-the Box","review":"Ted Dekker does it again. I so appreciate a writer that isn't cookie cutter predictable. You can count on Ted to bring you Christian truth... but it's not all wrapped up in a pretty package. He has depth and an amazing imagination!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What are you're obsessions?","review":"Ted Dekker once again communicates the Great Romance in this mystery thriller novel. A definite page turner. Once you read it you will ask yourself, \\"What do I obsess?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Letdown","review":"I spent hours reading through this book, just to get to the final page that basically summed up the book by saying, \\"...and that's what it's like to be obsessed with something.\\" *Sigh* I REALLY wish I would have just read the last page before I wasted so much time on this book. The story was alright, but I read it because a friend told me to. I just got as much off that last page as I did throughout the entire book, so it was frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Am I Missing Here?","review":"Who wrote all the five star reviews? Obviously the Dekker fan club. This book is a piece of garbage. The characters are cardboard one dimensional figures and the plot is laughable. I found some really good laughs a number of times, particularly the places where the hero is in a tight spot and the action totally stops while he embarkes on elaborate soliloquies and rhapsodic day dreams, or a character at risk of being murdered is totally forgotten by the hero for a several chapters. I realize that this is supposed to be a mindless toss away read, but even in this category this book fails miserably."},{"rating":"2","title":"flashy but with substance","review":"I was a little worried about the quality of this korean made guitar but it turned out to be an amazing find. Looks great(if a little gaudy)and the setup was perfect. The intonation was damn close and the action was extremely low but didn't buzz at all even when dropped to b. I play through a Madison Omen stack which pushes some serious metal chunk and the stock pickups probably would have to be replaced if you don't play with a crapload of gain but in my kind of situation the pickups lack of gain gives me an amazing ability to dial in a perfect metal sound at any volume without any hissing or feedback. I've found this great for shows and recordings sound sweet on any format. comes with a case which was a huge plus since getting a guitar shipped is a crapshoot without a case and mine was delivered in only two days. SWEEEEEEEEETTTTTT GUITAR!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Different Generation","review":"A Different Generation is just one of the stories Carolyn Howard-Johnson included in her book HARKENING: A COLLECTION OF STORIES REMEMBERED. After a girl is married, Mom will continue to be mom and act accordingly even though she is at her daughter's home. Sometimes humorous, sometimes out-of-line, but she is still mom. This story brought back many memories of my own mother."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Picture Perfect Life","review":"This book was very good. The fact that the pictures really showed his entire life was refreshing. You felt like you were there throughout his life and were experiencing the events of his life with him. After reading the book I wish I would have had the opportunity to meet Jimmy Stewart. This book was a tribute to his life."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissappointed","review":"I wanted to return items because the items was not what I expected when I received the items. Company stated that I can not return if product is opened. Product is opened because I had to see how it looked. I do not understand why it is not clearly written on their return policy on amazon that they will not return if you open to see what you have purchased. Very dissapointed in company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"Broke the top cap on old stick. Figured it was time to replace, and found exactly what I needed.
