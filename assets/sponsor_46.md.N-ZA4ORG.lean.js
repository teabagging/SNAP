While the look (from a few feet away) appears quality, it is far from it. The cushion is hard and made of foam - you can actually feel it kind of crackle when pushing down on it - and the fabric is very cheap and loosely attached to the cushion. There is NO WAY this chair lists for over $900. Pottery Barn has chaise loungers that list for at or near that with much better quality. This chair is not some kind of great deal like it is advertised to be. The seller also makes it very pricey to return so I may be stuck with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap and not comfortable","review":"I agree with the other one star.

The first part includes general arrangement drawings of armour, followed by well-chosen photgraphs of the ship which show most of the details a modeller or historian would need. Some of the photographs are wrongly captioned, however, and they are not in chronological order. Some are also out of focus, but this is probably due to poor originals being used.The drawings of the ship are of exceptionally high quality and include all deck plans, all critical sections and elevations and a set of 'lines'. Although of small scale - about 1:1000 - they are sharp enough to stand enlargement.There are also a number of photographs of a museum model of Tirpitz, but these are not of very high quality and the viewpoints are repetitive and unimaginatively chosen.Overall, very good value and essential for any Tirpitz/Bismarck enthusiast."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like this hrad drive","review":"this is one of hte best hard drives because it can protect some of your files of outsiders.

Don't be fooled by the instrumentation that sounds like it could be interesting. The compositions are mostly used-up ideas, tiresome colors lacking a process or purpose. My first thought while listening was that this sounded like a disc of works written by student composers from third rate music schools. Then I checked the liner notes and discovered that's exactly what it is. Even the playing is weak - while perhaps a few of the horn bleats were written that way on purpose, there is an exceptional amount of awful playing hiding behind the fact that this music is unknown. This is one of the worst classical CDs I've ever heard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"Bruegmann tries to compare ancient Roman \\"sprawl\\" and post-WWII developments as the same things simply for their development outside of the city limits. He effectively puts any development in these areas as sprawl without regard for their urban form and pattern.Are streetcar suburbs the same as auto-dependent contemporary developments? Both are outside of the \\"city\\", but I'd argue they are completely different and not entirely sprawl.Bruegmann also dismisses many alternative viewpoints to his stance (usually in a sentence or so) without going into them in depth substantially. The book also uses some suspect sources that are notoriously biased.The only reason I gave a two-star was for the book's very good source and notations found at the end of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A thinly veiled overtly partisan rant","review":"I appreciate disssenting opinion, however, I do not appreciate when someone tries to present themselves as objective when in fact they are far from it. I would agree with some of the other reviews that indicate that the overall argument is far less than convincing. I would go further to say that at times the authors logic and bent economic egalitarianism is outlandish. I'm sure as a counter argument to outlawing children from 17th century British factories he would posit that the negative result would be increased prices because of a reduction in the cheap labor force. Much of the book is a thinly veiled attack on the left, reformists, academia and anyone who might weigh something other than economics as primary in their decision process."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak arguments","review":"I actually agreed with Bruegmann's thesis more before I read this book than afterwards. He's married to his one definition of sprawl, and since this conveniently lists Los Angeles as the least sprawled city, he can then use this as a blunt weapon to pooh-pooh any criticism of sprawl. He also notes that sprawl has been a force throughout the history of cities, but then fails to show how the issues people have with sprawl may have evolved over the years. Even when he mentions arguments in support of sprawl, I felt underwhelmed because they're just references to other papers; he doesn't present us with many numbers or analysis from these other papers. That being said, I agree with his basic premise --- that criticism to sprawl is overblown, and that most people prefer to own their own house and their own car. But I was looking for more solid arguments to support that, and this book did not provide them."},{"rating":"1","title":"A snoozer for me...","review":"I put the book aside about 25% of the way through -- a very rare thing for me.

Bruegmann's arguments against traditional anti-sprawl histories read more like a jedi mind trick than a careful argument. A more careful argument with more supporting facts would have added to the book. As it is, it seems to me that this book will do little to change anyone's view of the 21st century city."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of Sprawl Shills","review":"If you want honesty about half-century of suburban sprawl dominance in the United States, then this book is NOT for you.

I disagree, I think most children will lose interest with the cumbersome rules if they even understand them.

His vocal delivery is lacking and not convening enough to make you stand up and take attention (at least in the way you would want someone to pay attention). It is more of a distraction and takes away from what he is attempting to do.Many guitarists have faced up to the fact of not being great singers and have delegated those duties over to other band members who have those abilities. Hopefully, Slick will come to the realization of this soon and tweak his band configuration.I tend to believe that the other post with the 5-star are friends of Slick and not the general listening public.

I'm not sure why I felt the need for another vacuum, maybe because the carpets still didn't look that great after I cleaned, but I began researching upright vacuums and finally settled on this Bissell Total Floors Bagless which cost half of what I paid for each of the Oreck's. It arrived last week & I was totally amazed by the amount of dirt and pet hair that it picked up only a day after using the Oreck!!!! I have one pet, a short haired cat and no children, so my house should not have gotten that dirty in one day! It had to be the vacuum. I also love the little Turbo brush for cleaning the upholstery. Does a great job! I'm so pleased that I decided to buy it. It is quite a bit heavier that the Oreck, but other than that, it's far superior in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Customer Service","review":"Well, this was a great vacuum while it worked. It definitely lived up to all the promises of the other reviews. In just 3 months, and maybe 15 uses max, we had to replace the belt 4 times. Then the motor just burned out. After speaking with several discourteous Bissell representatives who told me I needed to drive 1.5 hours to get my vacuum fixed, I got a return label and sent the vacuum back to Bissell. I was promised a new vacuum in 2 weeks after my return. 3 weeks have passed, and I just now received my \\"new\\" vacuum. Unfortunately, its not new nor is it a Total Floors. In addition to the wrong model, they sent a hose that didn't fit the vacuum. So once again, I have a broken vacuum, not to mention a vacuum I didn't order. All-in-all, the vacuum works well when it works. However, Bissell's customer service is terrible and they didn't even provide the right vacuum. I don't recommend Bissell for their customer service."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great vacuum","review":"I bought this because I had to get a new vacuum. I don't have much time to clean up, so i figured that I would get a decent vacuum. I read a few reviews and researched a few vacuums and decided to get this one. I am very pleased with my purchase. This vacuum picked up dirt and fibers that I never knew that I had. My place feels a lot cleaner after vacuuming now. The HEPA filter works great too. The air doesn't smell like pet hair or dirt after vacuuming anymore. I have never used a Dyson, but I don't see how it could be better than this vacuum."},{"rating":"1","title":"performance is poor over time - pet hair","review":"This vacuum performed well when I first purchased it and for a few months thereafter. Unfortunately though, I have two cats and even with regular emptying, the cat fur now accumulates way up inside the clear plastic. Every two weeks, I have to stick a butter knife way up inside the vacuum and scrape the cat fur off the thing that seems to produce the suction. Because of the design, it is not easy to get the fur off the suction thing. Sorry I'm not using better technical terms. The point is that if you have pets, this vacuum will eventually lose suction. I'm now in the market for a bagged canister vacuum as I want a minimal-maintenance vacuum. Getting on the floor with a butter knife every two weeks just isn't working for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just fine","review":"Works great and no complaints so far. 3+ years of use almost twice a week and it's still running just fine.The only catch is empty the container often as to not let debris clogged it which can make cleaning it out a hassle. Don't forget about the filters and it will work for a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I got a lemon....","review":"I bought this for our cabin. We have both carpet and bare floors and two dogs. Initially, it seemed like it was doing a great job. Within a week I noticed that it wasn't picking up on the bare floors and it was leaving little piles of hair and dirt that it spit out the sides. I frequently changed the collection container, washed out the filter and turned it over to make sure nothing was stuck. Alas, it's just a piece of junk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment","review":"I bought this after reading all the great reviews on the vacuum. I couldn't wait to see what this highly rated item would do to my carpets and floors. However, I was in for a mighty disappointment. I could never get the green airflow indicator to show more than a teeny tiny bit. Could have been shyness but it was very frustrating. I called Bissell and after some discussion and experiments (including taking all sorts of pipes off that were really difficult to get back on) we decided that the vacuum was faulty. I am now waiting for my replacement hoping that this one is more confident and less deficient in sucking power."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this vacuum!","review":"I am here to tell you that it is not worth the trouble to buy this on-line. I purchased this vacuum and it came to me from GoVacuum and they shipped to me twice damaged!

They are now charging me shipping and a re-stocking fee for a vacuum that I never go to use! They are a terrible place to deal with and I suggest that you just go out to you local store and buy it!

I am not disappointed! This thing picks up so much dirt and dust and hair! I have two cats and this vacuum is just amazing. My 21 year old daughter wanted to try it and ended up vacuuming the whole house just to see how much it would pick up. Now she keeps borrowing it. The dust cup is easy to remove and I do clean the first filter every time--but only because of the cats.

I opened the bottom cover and found out it is very hot around the belt area and the motor axis is extremely hot. It was used in the CA ocean side area; the environment temperature is not high. So it means the design of this product has serious problem. Just image how many belt you have to replace it if it keep melting out in this kind of speed?).

I had new carpeting which shed. The shedding constantly gets clogged in the machine and it doesn't pick up anything anymore. Mainly pushes stuff as said in prior reviews. So aggravating that I have actually parked it (until I decide what to buy next) and now I use my shop vac which works 100x better and was only $40."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT CLEANING TOOL","review":"This vacuum is well worth the money. In fact, it is worth more. The fact that one can turn off the roller in the vacuum allows it to really suction the dirt off of a bare floor. Also, there is an easy to empty dirt receptacle, multiple level floor heigth adjustment, and sturdy tubing for cleaning hard to reach spots. I was really satisfied with this product that a few of my friends have purchased it as well. It is well made and does not feel cheap in any way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Fine","review":"I purchased this product as I have more tile floor space than I do carpet. It works wonderfully for both. I have no issues with spreading on the tile floor instead of picking up. It is heavy - I'm OK with that. The foot lever for changing level (1-7) tends to stick which is rather annoying. The brush on or off lever works fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pick something more durable","review":"I ordered this Bissell model based on the reviews and good price. Unfortunately, the first one arrived with a crack in the plastic housing. I returned it for a replacement, and the new one's housing was cracked even worse. Very disappointing and time-wasting experience! I'm going to buy a different model - the plastic construction on this one is just too cheap and flimsy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful","review":"Excellent cleaning power. Shocking how much came off a clean looking rug. Cleanup with a baggless is a little extra effort but you never have to worry about running out of bags and you can easily see how much dirt was picked up. I clean up after every use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy over the internet!!","review":"Trust the negative reviews, the vacuum came broken to my door. They do not pack it in anything other than what you would grab it off the shelf at walmart. No stirofoam or any protectant. The side of the box got smooshed and so did the vacuum. Whole bottom left side was broken off. Amazon is good to take it back however it takes up to 4 weeks to get your money back. What am I going to do until them with no good vacuum? Trust me, I decided to chance it, I recommend if you want this vacuum, get it at the store, even if you have to pay more."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS ONE DOES NOT SUCK...","review":"Literally, does not suck up much. Does okay on the carpet but just pushes stuff around on wood floors. I am VERY dissapointed. Listen to all the negative reviews and don't be fooled by the positive ones. They must not have ever owned a good vacuum that really does suck."},{"rating":"1","title":"BROKEN upon arrival","review":"Well, I have had the worst luck with vacuums for the past FOREVER! I can never find one that has good suction, or that lasts longer than a few months before it burns up the motor. Well, I as so excited about this one, with the other good reviews. BUT I dont know how well it works because when I opened it today it was already broken. Now i understand that UPS probably had a bit to do with it, but it seemed to be well packaged, however on the base by the on off switch there was a big piece of the plastic missing and left the space jagged and sharp, and on top of the base was a crack all the way thru. So, how durable is it? My guess not great if it could be this badly broken during shipping. I am supposed to be getting a replacement, so hopefully I can write back with a better review after using it a couple months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy something else","review":"I have had this vacuum for well over two years now. I did my research and decided on this one. My #1 complaint and reason for its dislike is the tip over hazard it has. When using the hose attachment the vacuum will fall toward you. This happens almost each time I use the hose. I have gotten cracked before and it hurts.My suggestion....find another vacuum cleaner without the tip over hazard."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST vacuum cleaner EVER","review":"This is by far the WORST vacuum cleaner I have ever owned. The hose gets clogged all the time, which means you have to clean it out every other month or so - otherwise it will pick up nothing. And this vacuum is not even a year old!Now the brush underneath no longer works (it no longer spins and picks up anything) so you can literally sit it on top of a big pile of lint or dust and it will do nothing whatsoever. Roll it over it a million times, leave it sit for 5 minutes, nothing at all. Vacuuming a room that should take 10 minutes takes more like 30-35 minutes because it takes forever to get it to pick up anything. It is highly aggravating and frustrating.I will never, ever, ever purchase a Bissell product again. I am extremely upset that I paid nearly $150 for this piece of trash. Trust me, spare yourself the aggravation and do not buy this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"2nd one hieght adjustment broke!","review":"This is our 2nd Bissell turbo upright.Both of them ended up having the hieght adjustment knob detent spring strip.You can't adjust the hieght on thevvaccum,its stuck at one hieght.I feel it wasn't due to heavy handed use,but a cheap,bad design.Its a nice vaccuum,but watch out with the hieght adjustment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay for a while","review":"This vacuum worked okay, but always left things behind after the first pass, for a while. It went through vacuum belts at an alarming rate, and did nothing for picking up pet hair. I got 6 months of use out of it, before it finally quit working completely. I wouldn't buy a Bissell again(it's not like it got really heavy use anyway, considering most of my floor is tile--which I sweep with a broom.) I'd recommend looking elsewhere for a quality vacuum, so you don't have to shell out another $200 for a new vacuum in a few months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely heavy","review":"This vacuum is too heavy and has a lot of cheap plastic. when we received it, some of the plastic had cracks in it. when i attempted to clean the dirt container, i got dust all over my clothes. I wouldn't recommend it to anybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have an old Bissell Clearview vacuum that didn't have the power I needed or the ability to turn off the brush on hard floors so I ordered this vacuum as soon as it came out. The first one was damaged in shipping and smoked/smelled when I tried to use it. Amazon sent a replacement out quickly, but the second vacuum smoked like the first one. The belt had been put on wrong and snapped within five minutes. Bissell sent out a new belt but the burning plastic odor didn't go away. It does pick up dirt/dog hair better than the Clearview, but the Clearview is still used on days I can't put up with the odor. The instructions to put the belt on are not clear so you might want to check out the configuration before it breaks so you will know how to put on the new one. Very disappointed as I have liked other Bissell floor products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of JUNK!!!","review":"I ignored the negative reviews and focused on hte positive ones because I liked the price and wanted to believe Bissell was a good name. Never again. My husband has had to take the thing apart pretty much every other week. There is always some issue, and always with different parts. I noticed a horrible burning odor while using it, and after much investigation, we noticed the brush was not rotating. My rug is very low pile and I had the setting on four, the brush didn't budge. I had to put it up to six for the brush to spin, and at six, it's too high off the floor to fluff up the carpet, so it looks very matted and dull and the vacuum fails to pick up smaller debris and hair. Bissell customer service is extremely not helpful with the whole situation. Next time I'll spend the extra money and get a Dyson!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Happy","review":"Very happy with this vacuum. Easy to put together. Use it on hardwood, tile, Oriental rugs and wall to wall. Cleans all well. Love the self propelled. Not too heavy. Love the long cord. Like the attachments.

Leaves the air smelling clean after vacumming while other vacuums left my house smelling like dust or other odors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Rehab Of My Grill","review":"I have owned a Silver Genesis B grill for 7 years now, and due to heave use - it was getting a bit worse for wear.This summer rather than buy a new grill - since the shell and frame of the old grill were still perfectly good - I replaced the flavorizer bars, cooking grate, the starter, and the gas tubes.The directions are very good, and I managed to get the old, decaying gas tubes out. The older tubes came with plastic insect catchers that have been replaced by built in screens - where the tubes connect to the propane gas manifold.

Then, the wife see's Sam Niell, whom I could not find one thing attractive about, and becomes obsessed with him to the point where she leaves her home and faithful, ever patient husband, and moves into town to stalk this bartenders every move 24 hours a day from across the street.

My only complaint is that, for no readily apparent reason, the authors insert a page or several of code. In the first six chapters I found myself skipping pages upon pages of code that was inserted, in my opinion, with no purpose. At the point of insert the author was talking in generalities and the page(s) of code added nothing to the discussion.

The sample application is mentioned, but code for the application is barely covered. It is assumed that the reader will install the CD and read the code to figure it out. When code is shown, it seems like it was purposely double-spaced to fill more pages.Visual Interdev is not covered deeply. An entire paragraph to skim the features of VI6.0 is a waste of paper.

The movie's hero's bother tells him that he was adpoted and I guess seems to hate his brother because he has a face of a bear. This movie has to go out of stock for good! And I also hope (because of this movie) I will not see another live action Disney film for a long time. Please people don't waste your hard earned money on this movie. Take my advice and skip this movie and see \\"Like Mike\\" instead because the Like Mike is so much better and has a much better cast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow worst Disney Show EVER!!!","review":"If you would waste your money or time buying and watching this dud you need your head examined.

Dittes, a professor at Yale Divinity School, has provided an honest look at the trials and griefs of ordained ministry, while also affirming the validity, hope and sacred grounding of the vocation. Dittes warns of the pitfalls, illusions, disappointments, and thanklessness that pastors inevitably experience yet rarely confess in public. Nonetheless, it is a compassionate and loving look at a vocation that many feel they MUST enter, come what may.Although carefully written in inclusive language and with the view that pastors can be of either gender, the book still exhibits a slightly male bias in terms of the biblical metaphors employed and temptations faced."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for any pastor","review":"Having known the author personally through seminary, I can say that Dittes' writing reflects his views on ministry and life in the church, especially in regards to how a pastor sees him/herself as opposed to the congregation's side of things. We are reading it in my clergy group and all 5 of us are touched at how close Dittes comes to expressing our experience of ministry and affirming the challenges we face. A must for those interested especially in inter-personal dynamics and understanding yours' and others' motivations for saying/doing the things we say/do every day, especially in the midst of local church life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor fit","review":"These mats didn't fit my vehicle at ALL!

The book seems to take the view that the more radical a notion is the more bookworthy it becomes. This concept is promoted by outlandish recommendations that clearly could not be practically implemented ... or even reasonable to consider. The author does not provide empirical evidence to support his opinion. The author seems to rely on a self-aggrandizing style to entrap other educators who may embrace his liberal ideas more as a defense against being labeled the traditionalist villian in this fictional work. Any educator who embraces this book has a parallax view of the classroom ... one that is upside down and inside out. In that case, the problem is not the classroom, but the teacher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Educators, Read This Book Carefully","review":"If you are considering the constructivist approach to teaching this book is probably as good as any others that address this topic. Brooks and Brooks present constructivism as an interesting array of excellent teaching methods. It is what I would call discovery learning, reminiscent of the 1980's. In other works the authors reveal the defining quality of constructivm and their postmodern philosophy more clearly by denying that there is any real truth for children to discover or learn. If you are a person of faith, I am asking you to think very seriously before you adopt a constructivist approach to teaching, and participate in its hidden curriculum: There is no truth. Can you teach as effectively, or more effectively as a discovery teacher? Pray, ask God to guide your teaching as you work with the greatest gift to us all--the children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short and Sweet and to the Point","review":"I first read the 1993 edition in 1993, and I was sold on it. There is no more clear nor concise book on constructivist instructional design in the business. The book is practical and can be read quickly. It doesn't get bogged down in too much jargon or theory. I object to one critic who claims the book is \\"ivory tower\\" and leans to much on science and math examples. The book is just the opposite from \\"ivory tower\\" and as for math and science examples, as a science teacher who spent years reading theory pitched toward humanities teachers that I had to adapt to my realm, I found this book refreshing. I would counter that creative,constructivist, dedicated teachers of English, World Languages, and Social Sciences would be able to adapt the Brookses's examples to their fields with ease."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book for course","review":"This book I used for my college course, it was a good and informative book.

I am agnostic, he is atheistic, but I found the movie wonderful, horrible, painful, and ultimately, satisfying. In my opinion, it reminds us that there needs to be people willing to turn the other cheek, to see the best in others -- of course this film explores the absurd extremes of those ideas, making you cringe as Ivan takes a beating... over and over again.

He finds in the history of the children's clothing industry in the US from 1917-1962, a growing ethos to see the world from the \\"child's point of view\\" (something he awkwardly calls \\"pediocularity\\"). In painstaking detail in some places, Cook shows how the growing clothing industry increasingly shaped the fixtures, floor plans and overall design of children's stores to be oriented to kids' viewpoints rather than the mothers'. One result, he claims, is that children have gained the status of persons in our culture because their \\"needs\\" and desires are catered to, not just by the clothing industry, but by all parts of our culture--often even over adults. Among the interesting cases are: how the \\"toddler\\" was invented by industry and the \\"preteen\\" girl in the 1950s as the forerunner of today's \\"tween.\\" If you are into this sort of reading, it pays off well."},{"rating":"2","title":"On Szymborska","review":"This is a splendid collection of verse.

It also has a vision of historical integration, whereby the ghosts of unfortunate memories speak to us softly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart of the swallow/have mercy on them","review":"What beautiful little worlds Wislawa Szymborska creates. Miracle Fair is an upstanding collection of her trademark intelligence, and simple yet very deep understanding of the mundane in nature and life's ironies. Her poems typically begin with the smallest of circumstances, and the reader follows it, assured of the simplicity of the theme, and then at the end comes the zinger which, with a line or two, transforms it into a much more complex creation. Which is not to say that her work is inaccessible; Szymborska is one of the most thoroughly enjoyable poets I have ever come across.

That is, he clearly sees the apologetic task as of primary importance. Furthermore, he holds to the modern notion of autonomous reason. In On Theology, Ogden lays out what he sees the task of Christian Theology to be. That task is to establish a fully reflective understanding of the Christian witness. Theology has the double task of being appropriate to the Christian witness and credible to common human experience. Ogden should be noted in the context as a theologian answering the death of God movement and as a scholar arguing for the importance of theology in the secular university.Ogden is firmly in the process theology camp and is also a disciple of Rudolf Bultmann's project of \\"de-mythologizing\\" scripture.

Also, it will NOT work with USB to PS/2 adapters. We already HAD a UAE-96, & it is nothing but problems with freezing for example. This WOULD be a great deal if it was actually the higher quality SBF-96.

It might even have been earlier, I lost my mail key while drunk a few nights before and was unable to check my mail for several days. Luckily, I found the key in a shoe on the first estimated delivery day, and my new caps were waiting for me!The only real cost is shipping, but I guess that's really the only way they are making money off of these so I can't complain.The caps themselves fit perfectly on my x61 tablet, and made a world of difference compared to the old one.

This album has a few really good songs. I particularly like 'Hide', 'Beautiful Redemption', 'Silence', and 'God Only Knows'.Her songs feature lyrics that reflect issues that most of us experience. 'Silence' deals with praying and wondering if God is listening. He is, but there are times when most of us wonder due to our own shortcomings. Another one that has absolutely superb lyrics is 'Hide'. It is very catchy and gets played fairly often on Christian radio.Although there are a few songs that I think are just ok, the ones that are good make this album worth the cost. I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just getting better","review":"I was introduced to Joy William's music through my kids who LOVED her songs.

I found her original album to be a little bleak, as far as the material went, but her voice is amazing.

Her vocal range is tested once again and her ability to write touching music hasn't died at all. If anything the experiences she's had over the last few years have given her a depth she needed to make a tremendous disc. Songs like \\"Hide\\" and \\"Beautiful Redemption\\", as well as \\"Silence\\" show her understanding of life, and the things we need to sustain in it.

We did not visit any of the cities of the restaurants listed in the book so I can't comment on the restaurant recommendations. We used it in addition to the Rick Steves' Italian section of his French, Italian and German phrase book. I left it with the owner of a restaurant in Monte San Sevino.

I have my monitor calibrated to my printer so color is usually never an issue. But when I printed my colors were really off and very bright. My pinks were way too dark and the whole image posterized, so I had to mess with my color, brightness, and contrast settings.I may be passing judgement on this paper, but is it that I was supposed to use HP paper w/ an HP printer?

This is a wonderful coffee table book, but if you're looking for a guide to owning pugs, do not buy this book. Basically, the book is an in-depth study of the origin of the pug. It reads like a college term paper, which is not necessarily a bad thing, if that's what you're looking for. The introduction sounds like the author chose every other word from a thesaurus--wordy to the point of annoyance! The photos have nothing to do with the text.

You really do see in his early skits the traits that later made him such a master of comedy. You also get a feel for the culture at the time.

Instead, I received a patchwork of skits pieced together by some inane editor who decided to pick and choose among skits meeting his own personal criteria, rather than presenting us with the total, genuine, virgin article.

My only complaint is born more from the fact that my tripod doesn't have any sort of clip at the bottom of the feet or on the head itself. As a result, the snap portion of the OpTec has to go around the legs and the clip portion attaches to the top of the trip, just below the head. As a result, while I can sling it over my shoulder, the weight is a bit misallocated. I'll probably rig something else to make it better distributed. If the OpTec had a snap type attachment at both ends or perhaps a velcro attachment instead of the clip, it might be a bit more versatile.

My daughter planned on wearing them with a pirate costume for halloween. Unfortunately, they fit terrible. The legs were all stretched out from that cardboard insert they place in them and they were way too short in length. I think the problem is that there is no elasticity in them. They are very cheaply made and don't mold to the shape of your legs. They end up looking baggy in the legs and won't pull up all the way. They also are not the same as the picture...the stripes are not really stripes, they are interrupted in the middle with a space all down the front and back of the leg.

The 12-part section, \\"Did You Know?\\" at the back of the book is invaluable for understanding biblical Judaism and giving Christians appreciation for their Jewish Messiah's culture. The Book of Ruth is presented as historical fact, but its underlying prophetic message is examined verse by verse with startling insights. The purpose of the book is to encourage unity of Christians and Jews, which will be the ultimate reality when the \\"natural branches\\" are grafted back into \\"their own olive tree\\" (Romans 11:24)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Book","review":"This book is truly amazing.

Like other readers stated, there was quite a bit of extra information that I skimmed over and the author seems to idealize Salk quite a bit, but besides that I enjoyed the book. He does make a good point about the Salk vs Sabin issue. Salk's solution was a quick and dirty implementation which was very effective. Ultimately a combination of the live and killed virus served to almost erradicate the disease, but salk saved a lot of lives and a lot of anguish by getting a solution out very quickly instead of wading through the proper social channels, which are designed to feed the hosses at the top, and not solve problems quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cardboard characters looking for money and fame","review":"The portrayal of Salk that arises from this book is that Salk was a political operator of the first order. The paucity of technical details and the \\"Oh, wow!\\" presentation of those few makes it very hard to assess the Salk's scientific contribution. Actually, the science of everyone involved is hurriedly brushed over. But all the key meetings, grants, confrontations, and even \\"chance\\" acquaintances - such as meeting Basil O'Connor's, chairman of the NFIP, daughter aboard ship and trying to \\"cheer her up\\" -- and Salk's reactions to these events are exhaustively recorded. It is mentioned a few times that Salk's battle-ax of a secretary actually had day-to-day control of the research group's operations. The charge of \\"Easy Bake\\" science is never convincing refuted by the author, even belatedly in the epilogue. The book was genuinely painful to read.

To those who wonder how so many Catholics have lost their way in pursuit of some feel-good comaraderie, this book will provide insight. The writing is not for the beautiful people. Some passages must be read several times and checked against one's own reality. Those who make the effort will, perhaps, gain some peace of mind and even hope.

It is full of 1 page, real life stories of how people chose to respond to what life has thrown at them. To paraphrase the book, we don't always have control over what happens to us, but we do always have control over how we respond to it. This book is about how people chose to respond to life in a positive manner and how that caused a positive effect on their lifes. It's a quick read that can last a lifetime. I read the entire book in one sitting. I now keep it next to my bedside. Every night, when I go to bed, I read one story.

I bought two of these pads, so I could wash one and have a fresh one on the bed. I would recommend doing that.He nows sleeps through the night without wetting the bed, but I keep this pad on the bed for occasional accidents.

The sides that wrap under the mattress are flimsy and difficult to get in place.I have previously used a similar waterproof pad (from another company) to put on top of my potty-training preschooler's bed sheet. The other pad had a nice smooth sheet-like top and protected the bed from accidents well, up until the time the waterproof material on the back deteriorated due to age/washings (at least three years).

I thought it should be told from Johnny's point of view not Fianne's. I didn't care much for Fianne's father back in book 2 and I don't care too much for his daughter in book 3. It isn't her fault but I don't like that her father is her mother's uncle. I guess that means Fianne's mother is also Fianne's first cousin. The story is a little predictable. You know Fianne will choose Good over Evil in the end. This is the type of story I intensely dislike. That's the type of story where a person with evil intentions pretends to be the friend of the \\"good characters\\" and secretly works toward their downfall.

She then went through and reiterated the romance and guilt aspect of it on every single page. Boring. I skimmed the second half and still guessed the ending. The first two were entertaining light reading. This was just annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Let's face it. It doesn't take all that much to rewrite archetypal fairy tales. What takes talent is making something whole and new up out of the depths of the imagination. I find this trilogy sorely lacking on both points, the rewrite and the \\"new\\" aspects of the story.I guess the threshold is very low. Sorry, can't recommend it. It's pretty on the cover, but the writing is stiff and not all that original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sappy and contrived","review":"The first two volumes in the series were better, though occasionally I had problems with reinvented fairy tales, and admire more the writers who actually come up with their own ideas completely. But this book reeked, I'm sorry. In an attempt to be more action oriented, Ms. Marillier falters badly. She should stick to the more romantic fairy tale fantasy she writes. There will always be a market for retold fairy tales, sadly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not rating, no Kindle edition","review":"Well I guess the publishers read Lundak's review and withdrew the Kindle edition - which is good and bad, I suppose.

The first two books were fairly good, even if the first person narration was grating at times. But this last book was unbearable. It had a bitterness to it that the others didn't, a kind of pettiness that was not sympathetic, it was merely annoying. Additionally, I found a number of details historically inaccurate or inconsistent. The first two are worth buying in paperback. This last one isn't worth having at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"WoW","review":"The Sevenwaters trilogy is amazing!

This book is as incredible as the first two novels, yet still quite individual. The ends left loose in Juliet Marillier's first and second books are tied up in this last book, and the characters are as gracefully developed as in the other two novels. You will be easily swept up in the story of Fainne and her trials and experiences, and if you have been an avid reader of the trilogy thus far, you will likely also enjoy the reappearances of many other beloved characters from previous instalments. With a few surprising and intriguing plot twists, this novel will be hard to put down. I recommend it wholeheartedly, and am eagerly awaiting Marillier's next series!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgraceful Trash","review":"Absolutely unbelievable. If you had the miraculous experience of playing the PC game Ultima 7, do not be fooled by this cheap imitation. The original game was one of the very first truly interactive worlds, and was a very open world. Not to mention fantastically fun and spellbinding. Now this ungodly filth, on the other hand, should not be allowed to be labeled with the name Ultima. Upon inserting the cartridge into my SNES, rubbing my hands together with anticipation, my first(and last) 10 minutes into the game, I developed a severe headache and had to drink down a bottle of pepto bismol to refrain from vomiting blood. My hopes and dreams were crushed. I had lost feeling in half my face, and had lost memories from my childhood. What I am trying to say is; Abandon all hope ye who buy this game. It would be infinitely more fun to crawl through broken glass and be sprayed in the eyes with battery acid. If only I could give it 0 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bargain Bin Garbage","review":"If you see this game for sale and think that it just might make it somewhere close to the PC version, for god's sake, don't buy it. You are totally wrong. This game falls so short of it's computer counterpart it is recognizable as a completely different game. I (unfortunately) bought this game at a local swap meet where all of the vendors came in from out of town. O! Woe is me! I could never return it, but really, that's okay by me, as I would pay three times the ammount to see it immolated along with all of it's twins. All of the fun in Ultima 7 was doing things that you weren't supposed to, finding hard to find items and collecting companions. Well, in this version, you can do NONE of these. If you have played Ultima 6 on the PC and the SNES, you know how perfect the port was. Exactly the inverse is true for Ultima 7. Save your money for a better computer or, jeez, a can of lighter fluid. Just DON'T BUY THIS GAME!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the PC version instead","review":"I absolutely agree that gamers seriously considering playing Ultima VII should invest their money and time into the PC version. The SNES version significantly changed the story, gameplay and overall experience. Unfortunately, the SNES version serves no substitute to the legendary, influential masterpiece known as Ultima VII.Ultima VII's beauty belongs to the fact that you can play with a memorable cast of characters and have fun doing exactly what you're not supposed to do. Ultima VII gives you the opportunity to act like an obnoxious little Avatar, doing absolutely everything in your power to confuse, frustrate and enrage the characters. The SNES version pales in comparison, and I am afraid I make a gross understatement by saying so.The time it takes to find a copy of Ultima VII and get it working on a Windows XP machine is well worth gamers' trouble. You will have a truly unique gaming experience that many do not know exists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book ...odd Printing","review":"This was a very good book with lots of interesting and fascinating developments.

I'm sorry, Mr. Pekarek, but this was, by far, one of the most difficult things I've ever read. The characters were stiff and weakly developed. The plot inched slowly in a straight line, with nary a hitch or a hop. And the literary devices were strained and transparent. Maybe I'm not qualified to write this review, as I set the book aside after about 100 pages. If nothing esle, however, reading this and realizing it was published motivated me to write my own novel.

An hour was spent with a screwdriver and super glue to get the toy ready for use. It is overall of poor quality construction & fit and very cheaply made (including the remote control). The plastic is fragile and the tread is very flimsy and comes off easily (and it is difficult to get back on). The grandsons thoroughly enjoyed the toy, especially the air gun (which frequently doesn't fire unless you tap the toy to redistribute the little yellow pellets). The speed of the toy is too fast; there is no slow speed, just fast or faster. The rechargeable battery pack is poorly designed and difficult to remove, recharge and replace in the battery compartment. A great improvement would be to have a recharging port on the tank itself, so the battery pack would not have to be removed every time it needs to be charged. Overall, the toy is not a good value for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy","review":"This tank looks really cool. You take it out of its box and charge the batteries. You get it all set up. At this point you are dying with excitement. After the batteries charge, you fire it up only to find out that it is soooooo painfully slow.

The new copy fixes the menu and has improved video quality, but when playing this DVD through my Stereo and Headphones I noticed a major change in the DVD. THE AUDIO HAS BEEN MODIFIED AND SOUNDS WORSE THAN THE ORIGINAL DVD THAT WAS RECALLED. The change wasn't in the quality of the recording, but rather sounded like someone modified the audio track to have a lower tone in audio. I am not pleased with the change and would rather have my recalled DVD back with the original audio recording.If it weren't for the ruined audio I would have given the DVD 4 stars as it was a great show, but Ultra Records really messed up this DVD as I highly recommend no one buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good live performance, but a rushed DVD.","review":"The audio quality sounds NOTHING like the original songs. The pitch is down lower than it should be. If you rip \\"Right this Second\\" from the bonus footage, you can manually change the pitch to fit the 128 bpm mark. Not a big problem, but it really should not be here.Many people think that the guys filming should pay more attention to the performance than the crowd, and they do have a point. But I think 1 or 2 glances at the crowd is fine. Other than that, it's a good buy.4/5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best video edit, but music is amazing","review":"The music is great but the video editing is terrible to say the least. I bought this DVD as I have been unable to make a live show. The editing makes it hard to appreciate the amazing visuals and stage show. For half the intro the camera is panning around the crowd instead of showing the stage/screen. You are better off just downloading the music from beat port or buying the 4X4=12 CD and watching youtube clips.

I think he's one of the greatest artists on the planet right now, and was hoping that this DVD would successfully convey the spirit of Deadmau5 live.The DVD is a huge failure. The main reason is the camerawork. I am honestly not sure if the cameraman/men knew that they were filming a live concert. It's ridiculous, literally (I mean literally) 90% of the footage consists of random shots of the crowd doing absolutely nothing. There are times when you just want to yell at the DVD to show the stage, it's insane.The DVD doesn't convey what Deadmau5 is like live, but it is indeed hard to express something like that through video, so that's kind of a given. The audio sounds fine, but not as amazing as it is live of course.The timelapse was the only thing on the DVD I found interesting.

But the book itself shows little RA, with page upon page of densely jargon-backed theoretical discussion, and almost no concrete examples of the highly abstract and difficult concepts presented. This makes it almost impossible to understand much what Bucci is saying without an extensive background in both cognitive science and psychoanalytic theory, a background few share. Morever, Bucci seems to take her integration too far, combinbing the work of cognitive science authors and perspectives that are strikingly incompatible without really dealing with this incompatibility. Cognitive science, like psychoanalytic theory, is a pluralistic, even anarchistic group of heterogenous voices, hardly the kind of unified front that Bucci often seems to want it to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reminiscent of _1066 and All That_, but without the accuracy or humor","review":"The basic conceit of Wodehouse's part of this book was to tell a version of the legend of William Tell as if all the characters were ordinary English idiots of the early twentieth century. The effect is rather like that of _1066 and All That_, but without the accuracy, and hence without the humor. Wodehouse's prose was written to accompany verse by John W. Houghton, which in turn was written to accompany illustrations by Philip Dadd. I haven't seen the illustrations, but the verse is much worse than Wodehouse's prose; I'm sure he could could have done it better himself. Wodehouse's style was quite good even early in his career, so the book is readable; it's just not worth reading if you can read his later work instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"perfect 10","review":"Good quality, although very cheesy narration and video use.

The writing style is extremely close to the one in the first books in the series and it is very pleasant to get back to it. Mystery is captivating and keeps you guessing until the very end. Once again the book is filled with small town gossip and secrets. Charlaine Harris does a great job creating the characters in such a manner that you feel like you actually know them personally.I've grown very fond of Aurora and feel a little sad that this is the last book about her adventures (at least for now).

I would hope Ms. Lockhart updates this format for ACAD 2000... and proofreads the exercises!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent program selection, but overblown performances","review":"This was a disapointment. After reading the list of songs included, I looked forward to hearing this CD. The instrumentalists are wonderful in interpretation and presentation, but the vocalists, though technically very good, seem overblown for these songs. Their performances border on the operatic, with just not the right amount of nuance for the repertoire. The soprano fares better than the male voices, but when there is a duet, they never seem to truly blend, but just compete with one another. I remember the great period recordings of Joan Morris and William Bolcolm, some of which are still available on CD(including a relatively new one- see Amazon for title and details), and this CD, though well-intentioned, never approaches that level of sophistication and purity of performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice dishes","review":"These are small dishes that you can use for quite a few purposes.

After that the ballast began to fail, just a few months out of 90-day warranty. Now it's at $600 doorstop. Many other people have had trouble with this projector dying on them; just google around a bit.

If you can find a used one, I would still definitely rcommend it. Note that if you are using it in a dusty area, you must clean the bulb filter about every six months (I blew the first bulb at a year by not doing this). However, I had a very different experience with the X1A. The composite video was never as good as the X1 which would seem to be because it has a different, inferior decoder. After a little more than a year it started making a loud buzzing noise and then it quit. Since I only had a 1 year warranty, I decided to just forget about it. I have since replaced it with a refurbished infocus 4805 which so far is working great and is reasonably quiet.Stay away from the X1A. I gave it 2 stars because for the year it did work it was excellent for playing DVD's from the computer."},{"rating":"2","title":"bang for the money","review":"I bought the X1a after much researching during thanks giving weekend (...)and I also bought the 3 year protection plan for $129.99 . I am satisfied with the quality of video i am watching through the projector. I live in an apartment complex and its bright during the day when i have to make the room dark but evenings and night excellent quality. it doesnt start up right away sometimes and i have to turn it off and on few times but that doesnt bother me much. I know its not great projector but for the cost its awesome. also if i get any of the problems the other reviewers have stated then i will be covered by warranty for 1 year by infocus and the following 3 years by officemax."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful story","review":"I began reading Katherine V Forrest's mystery novels and I hate to admit... but I wasn't terribly impressed. Yet so many of my friends said she was one of their favorite authors. So I finally picked up \\"An Emergence of Green\\" and now she is also one of my favorite authors.This is a wonderfully touching story of how the friendship between two women blossom into something more. I highly recommend this book to anyone, gay or straight.It reads very fast, and I was on the edge of my seat through many chapters not wanting to wait to find out what happens next. The setting is a bit dated, but the story refreshing. You won't be disappointed"},{"rating":"2","title":"'An Emergence of Green' stayed with me for a long time.","review":"Katherine V. Forrest has a tremendous talent. I cannot wait for her next novel. I started out reading her mysteries and then found her romance books. She has a way of writing that draws you into the story. All your senses are awakened. You are there with the characters, feeling, seeing, smelling and tasting. You can't help but be moved.

You can have two couples playing, and change the difficulty level for each player. So everyone has a fair chance. We play it for hours on end. I bought this since it had Tetris inlcuded. However, from looking at the box, this version has support for only 2 players, instead of four. I was very dissapointed in that the 4 player tourney is what makes it so fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best for SNES !","review":"I was lucky enough to find this game recently (It's very hard to find). I wouldn't say that this game is VERY addictive (although it can keep you hooked). I enjoy this game because it requires you to use your brain and think fast. It also has excellent replay value. If you still have an SNES, you should consider this game. It's truly one of Nintendo's best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The classics, on your SNES!","review":"It's great to see a game that can actually mix these two puzzle games from the NES. In Mixed Match, two players can compete in a race to get the most lines in Tetris (Type-A) after completing a stage of Tetris (Type-B) and a stage of Dr. Mario. Besides that, Tetris and Dr. Mario are two of the best of the classic puzzle games out there. It is great to be able to play them on the SNES if you missed out on your chance to get them while they were games for the NES."},{"rating":"1","title":"refillable is useless","review":"When I first bought this I thought it was great to have a smaller spray bottle to cary in my purse or jacket pocket.

It's actually based off of the Japanese video game puzzle series, Puyo Puyo. In fact, it's just like that, but covered in a Kirby theme.Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine also did this exact same thing, but with a Sonic theme instead.The main game is connecting 3 of the same color. It's as simple and addicting as Tetris and Columns. There's a VS mode, a Training mode (Which is like playing solo in Tetris), and a Story mode. All of the modes are very fun and you can just keep playing them until you're dead tired of puzzle games.The puzzling gameplay is pretty addicting, and it is still a fun game to this day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a kirby game!!!","review":"This is not a kirby game. It is another puzzle game like tetris but not as fun. It is exactly like a game i have on my computer called \\"candy crisis\\".... But kirby charecters unstead of candy falling down. What u do is match the objects up and try not to over flow the placement. It gives u two different objects at once and u make sure u match the things falling up to what is on the ground which u can move them over or turn them in different directions to match them. I like the original kirby on the nes so i tried this one and its just a puzzle game. I like all of the other kirby games better because they have a story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Kirby At All","review":"I don't like this Kirby game at all! Its boring sometimes frustrating and i thought Kirby didn't know English.

There were so many lessons learned, along with a mystery, that this was just a fascinating read. A woman conquers her past demons and so does another character, This book has so many dimensions and a very surprise ending!!The thing that I didn't like was that a child seemed to possess powers(don't want to give it away). She was 7 years-old and that seemed abusive. I grimaced when she displayed her powers.I almost threw the book out after her horrible reaction to something uncovered by a storm. But, I stayed because I liked the other characters, the mystery, and wanted to see how the other people solved their issues.I am the author ofDreams in August: Life, Love, and Cerebellar Ataxiaand Summer Born: A Life With Cerebellar Ataxia"},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating","review":"This is a wonderful book.

If the main character fell or stumbled or needed to be picked up by her love interest one more time - come on - even pregnant women in their 8th month can walk without stumbling.Overall, it felt like a teen romance with older characters. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"It is not often that I find a book boring, but this one particularly was... The setting in the South sounds gorgeous though, and the very end comes as quite a \\"wow, didn't expect it to end this way\\" that is pleasant, but appart from that, the story drags on for what seems like ever... Everything is so predictable, you just have to read the first 10 pages to figure out the whole romance thing.. In the end, it might be a good beach read but that's all. Took me forever to finish it!It was my first read by this author, but I'm not thinking of ordering another book by Karen White."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED it!","review":"I don't understand the critical comments. I loved this book! I enjoyed the characters. Although, I normally would not have chosen a book that included a \\"psychic child\\", I thought Karen did a great job with it.

I love the depth of her characters and the complicated family roots, entangled though they may be that affirm my view that family is everything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as other Karen White books","review":"There are many good books by Karen White; this is not as good. I do like Folly Beach, the Beach Trees, and the first two books in the Tradd Street Series. I like books with multiple points of view, and several plot lines that intersect. I also like books about ghosts and mysterious happenings. However, this book was a little slow for the story, and predictable. It might be one of White's earlier books before she learned more about writing, because that's what it reminds me of. A little too sugary sweet in places, and the hero/heroine don't have enough flaws to be believable. In fact, there was a lot of this book that made it unbelievable--and I can't exactly describe why."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent cd's for Messianic believers.","review":"These recordings give us the real Hebrew understanding of what the early church was like.

Bra takes a bit to adjust to front closure but once you figure it out it's fine. Band rolls up a bit, but that could be because of me being overweight, not the bra.

There is nothing that allows the double hook front to rest close to the breastbone and its bulk is obvious under all but the thickest tops. The bottom band, while thick and approx 1\\" wide, rolled almost immediately. The cups tend to \\"flatten\\" and shift tissue towards the \\"side-boobage\\" area which is perhaps a contributing factor to the center hooks not lying flat against the breastbone. I ordered my normal size and the cups fit properly, the band is the correct size but the bra results in the uni-breast look. Very unflattering.The only reason I gave 2 stars instead of one is because the bra IS actually comfortable, it just looks bad under clothing and requires more tugging and repositioning than is desirable. This one is going back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does lift","review":"I'm a big girl and I haven't found much that will lift you and hold you where you are supposed to be held at :) This bra does a good job at that! the only thing i gave it 4 stars for is the front closure sometimes comes undone. Not completely but at night i usually have a hook or two unhooked. And the back of it goes pretty high so it's hard to wear some shirts.

People who have nobley gone out and done their research, seeking out Passollini with a sincere curiosity are being rewarded with a misleading, partial work, presented as the whole. Is this the work of the prudish puritans, insensitive capitalists or a natural disaster? Who knows.What we do know is that the DECAMERON was clearly based on the number ten, not eight. Ten stories, as the original book has ten narrators, each telling ten stories. Passollinni even divided the film up three and seven to relflect the three men and seven women who told the stories in the book. Important? Maybe not.What is significant is that part of the movie is missing! and Passollini's statement, and of course he was making a statement, is incomplete."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was Pasolini Really Necessary?","review":"Like most of Pasolini's self-indulgent, grotesque, largely pointless, and badly made films, virtually any five minutes of The Decameron is sufficient to induce a raging migraine.

I find most of the movies to be amongst the worst in the horror genre, and the few times I have stumbled across zombies in books, I tend to roll my eyes. But Laymon has a real knack for horror, and made me really enjoy this entertaining and excitingly creepy zombie story. At first the villain, Melvin, seemed so sympathetic on account of his brutally bullied past, as the story continued, he really grew from bullied boy to a genuine mad scientist. Laymon kept it rather light, even comical at times and the overload of gratuitous sex scenes only added to the overall zombie-zaniness. While this was not one of his best books, it certainly is not one of his worst either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hit? Miss?

To me he's \\"shocking\\" to the degree that he takes things out of the ordinary and places it into everyday life as any good horror author should be able to.

It carved a niche in the market by covering not just baseball players but baseball people. But it also had loads of mistakes. I had looked forward to the second edition hoping that the factual errors would be fixed. Unfortunately, very few of them were fixed. Incredibly, this book still clings to myths such as the story of Ford Frick attaching an actual asterisk to Roger Maris' home run record. Dewey and Accocella's writing is certainly more consistent than that of competing volumes, so it is unfortunate that they didn't take advantage of the opportunity a second volume presented them to fix the mistakes that are almost inevitable in a first edition. Also, some of ther additions/subtractions are puzzling - why was Dusty Baker in the first volume and not in this volume when his baseball career has only gotten more significant since the first edition?"},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesn't hit for average.","review":"Ok, I didn't have any high expectations when I purchased this book. After all, any project with Jerome Holtzman involved is going to be hit or miss. Unfortunately, this one misses much more than it hits.I've always heard that some of the greatest stories don't come from the superstars. Sometimes, they are found in the lesser stars or the ones who had just a brief moment in the spotlight. Unfortunately, many of these players and their experiences are sacrificed for long-winded accounts of players that had been written about in excess over the years.Don't get me wrong -- there is some interesting information here. However, I've found a number of errors in dates, statistics and references. In addition, the book seems to have been rushed to print without the benefit of thorough proofreading.The good thing?

I must admit, I got the book because one of the authors used to be the literary critic for the Orlando Sentinel (where I live), so there was some local interest on my part. This book only goes to prove that critics do not make good writers. To me, the worst description a book can receive is \\"trite.\\" Unfortunately, this book fits that description perfectly. I found the writing poor, even juvenile. I have two suggestions for these writers: Either try writing on an individual basis and see what can be produced separately, or, try writing for young teenage girls. Sorry to be so harsh but, as a critic should realize, a review should be honest or it is of no help."},{"rating":"2","title":"Edit Please","review":"Marsh Madness...

Unfortunately, the Kindle edition of \\"Marsh Madness\\" needs to be edited for grammar, spelling and continuity. Several passages are misplaced in the book, leaving one to wonder how the heck we got here. It appears that the cut and paste button went amok, or an editor/ proofreader relied too heavily on spell check without checking context.

Hilarious!","review":"Along with Crime Busters and Go For It, this is one of the \\"musts\\" of Spencer/Hill's modern films for their fans. As usual, Spencer is involved in a convoluted set-up by Hill, eventually recruiting him (he plays a famous but retired gambler) to help capture a group of swindlers. All the expected comedy elements are here--many episodes of funny slapstick adventures and fights in diverse settings, including Hill and Spencer fighting each other, and a drunken Spencer COMPLETELY destroying a bar. We also meet Hill and Spencer's \\"father\\" and get a hint of how Hill got so conniving! A must for fans! Card playing sequences are on a par with the classic scene from Trinity is Still My Name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much of an Hill/Spencer film","review":"I would only recomend this film to very serious Hill/Spencer fans.

I'm For the Hippopotamus and Who Finds a Friend Finds a Treasure come to mind. For me, the two Trinity films and Watch Out We're Mad are the duos best films, and I'd rank Odds and Evens as my fourth favorite of thier films.Among the great gags in this (maybe I shouldn't ruin them) are Hill disguised as a nun and Spencer dressed up as a huge baby. Other great moments involve the duo's \\"blind\\" father (they are brothers again), the final climactic fight at sea and the very last joke before the film ends is priceless. Plus, there's plenty of cool action and boat races. If memory serves this was directed by the great Sergio Corbucci (Django, Comapneros, The Great Silence to name a few). Too bad there's no DVD, but the VHS I got wasn't bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic Game","review":"Length:: 1:13 MinsThis game is awesome, made by Jane's Combat Simulations, It combines realism with an arcade style gameplay, and its awesome. One of the early games by Jane's Combat Simulations, it was a modern-day flight simulator that let you fly about 20 aircraft, i think, but it is fun, because instead of learning a massive curve for the game, you can just go and start flying in under a minute, and it has very awesome music! For a 17 year old game, it is still awesome to play nowadays, but only one problem, running the game, because you need MSCDEX installed, which is a pain in the butt, but with DOSbox it is easy to play.

The song \\"Somewhere over the Rainbow\\" is a beautiful Hawaiian rendition of an old Classic. The CD is lighthearted, fun, and introspective at times, offering a track with audio from Iz talking about his battle with obesity (something hardcore Iz fans might enjoy).

At one point he claims that command turbulance wasn't that bad even during Barbarossa. He cites statistics. But what I would've needed is some comparison. It's fine to know that less than X% of certain types of commanders were relieved of command, but it would've been nice to read some comparison: how was it with other armies...

Looked over it for about 20 minutes trying to figure out what was wrong, rereading the lesson and looking at the example. The example was wrong! They showed the correct answer, but the work to get to it was not completely correct. Awful editing. I finally quit using this book and used my ETS GRE prep book and focused on their math review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Idiot's Guide to Geometry","review":"This is a very poorly edited book, with dozens of misprints and mistakes that are essential to understanding. Angles and triangles can be labeled incorrectly, so you are trying to prove the unprovable theorem, or the wrong formula can be listed and you need to find the correct one in a different chapter. Sometimes mistakes are obvious when an acute angle is labeled obtuse, and sometimes they take a lot of time to figure out. Just a few examples (these are from the last test) - none of the multiple choice answers to the problem 41 are correct (the correct answer should be 6), the answer to problem 57 is wrong (the correct answer is C, or 1/2), the problem 58 is stated wrongly - impossible to solve, same for problem 59. The answer key to Chapter 19 is missing altogether. These are just a few from the long list of never-ending mistakes. Save yourself time and frustration, get another geometry textbook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Idiot's Guide to Geometry","review":"Good supplement to any traditional geometry text.

Shugo and his twin sister, Rena, are new to the game and have won two legendary characters, Kite and Black Rose. They meet and make many friends but also run into dangerous monsters. High level monsters that seem to be appearing in low level areas.Is it a bug or is something more happening behind the scenes? The two characters they have won are not your run of the mill characters.

I'm the type of person who usually loves everything I watch, I love almost every genre and its easy for me to like things. Especially anime. If I say an anime is bad...its pretty dang bad. This anime is about 2 siblings who win 2 legendary skins for the online game, .HACK. They won the skins of 2 legendary characters who beat the game. Even though the sister is excited (her skin is Black Rose, yea, you know who I mean .HACK video-gamers), the brother (he has Kite's skin) well... isn't excited. It's just a pretty lame show that insults the amazing video games and the OTHER .HACK anime which is a masterpiece. If you really--and I mean REALLY--want to check out this series, I reccomend the manga; it's MUCH better."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"sure i may be a kid but ive seen a lot of anime and gone to some conventions too.

The discs don't play on all machines, some problem in the coding. Bandai knows of the trouble with the discs but hasn't said anything about it or if they'll be doing anything about it. So be warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jane Misunderstood","review":"Lev Raphael's review said it best, so I'll add only this. Jane Austen didn't write this novel as a romance novel, but as a parody of one. This irony escaped the screenwriter as well as Gillian Anderson. In the book, Tillney's feelings for Catherine remain ambiguous to the end (note to readers: a spoiler comment follows) -- does he propose because he loves her or because his father forced him to court her and he now feels bound by honour to marry her?Jane Austen was so much more than a romance novelist -- why do adaptations insist on reducing the complexity of her? I agree with other reviewers -- for the real Jane, try Emma Thompson's Sense and Sensibility, and the BBC version of Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth. Other adaptations fall too far short."},{"rating":"2","title":"my favorite jane austen movie","review":"I absolutely LOVED this movie. It is definitely my favorite Jane Austen movie I have seen yet. Northanger Abbey has always been my favorite Jane Austen book and Catherine and Henry are my favorite couple and this movie just made me love them more. JJ Feild was PERFECT for Henry. Every scene he was in, he stole the show. The chemistry between Catherine and Henry was undeniable. Loved the rain scene and the horseback riding with them..so romantic! I am so glad we now have a decent movie version of NA, because it is truly a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Northanger Abbey Movie Review","review":"The actors, especially the main heroin, were adorable. It is an Austen classic, so slow in parts for some people, but if you are an Austen fan I think you will agree they did a great job with it overall. I love all things Austen, and yet had never watched this one before, so I was very happy to get it for Christmas. I watched it on New Years Eve, so I wasted no time getting to it, and I was not disappointed. I think any Austen fan would enjoy this film version of the book. (Although it has been awhile since I readNorthanger Abbey (Barnes & Noble Classics), so I am not a good judge at how close they stuck to the original work!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This was fantastic!!","review":"This was great! Truly this was the best romance movie that I have watched in a very long time. I really liked the main characters and they definitley had some on screen chemistry too lol! But nothing dirty mind you this is very clean. I just loved the whole gothic feel and the music is beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spicy gothic tale!","review":"Really delightful adaptation. Some people have gotten upset about the liberty taken with Catherine's fantasies...enough that the American release has been edited by 10 minutes. For some reason, we can watch a grind pool on MTV but not see Catherine's naked back! Go figure...JJ Feild is a charming Henry Tilney and the last kiss is probably the best captured on film! Perhaps not the most stringent adaptation but definitly captures the light satiric tone Miss Austin favored. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"I've watched this multiple times already. A very good rendition of Northanger Abbey. It's not completely true to the book but very close in many ways. The characters are portrayed much like the book describes them all, right down to Mrs. Allen's obsessions with her gowns and fashion. If you are a Jane Austen fan, you should buy this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Jane Austen - Masterpiece Theatre does it best.","review":"Although this is not my favorite Jane Austen book, it is a pure classic.

(the new film adaptations are generally too short as it is to do justice to the novels, except maybe the new sense and sensibility which seemed well done in this respect.) but i find this so infuriating. i hate this practice. thus, no purchase. hopefully some other executive at PBS will do their job and correct this stupid error."},{"rating":"1","title":"Danger alert: 30 minutes cut!","review":"Just a quick note -- I went over to Amazon.com.uk -- Northanger Abbey is 120 minutes in UK -- in US, only about 90 minutes....

If your significant other absolutely won't sit through the BBC version of Pride and Prejudice, try this instead. The characters are cleverly drawn, the plot is engaging, and Catherine's social predicaments are both delightfully amusing and strikingly familiar. You certainly don't have to be a devotee of Miss Austen to enjoy Northanger Abbey, but if you are, you will not be disappointed by this faithful and lively rendition."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Adaptation of the Classic Story","review":"I have always enjoyed Jane Austin's Northanger Abby.

The 80s BBC version did not capture any of the humor or sarcasm, and Mr. Tilney creeped me out. This version does a very good job keeping as much of Jane Austen's wit as is possible (some of the funniest parts of the book just can't translate to film). I would definitely recommend this movie to any Jane Austen fan.(Oh, and J.J.

I guess if you make it big like these guys have, you can just repackage the same material and sell it with a new title. The only difference is the delivery - it wasn't as good as the first time. Why spend time actually developing NEW material when you can keep pushing the old stuff on your unsuspecting fans? What a dispappointment.

I found myself smiling as I read the words that made the artwork come alive. Likewise, I found myself recollecting over the memories of the past when my relatives would come to visit. And, I felt as if I, too, were a part of this book. Having experienced growing up in a small town where you don\`t see that many people, I believe that when relatives come to visit, it almost seems like Christmas. As a result, when the book expressed the joy, laughter, and celebration of family, it stirred up these memories of the past.

We love this book so much that we've bought other Cynthia Rylant books, \\"Christmas in the Country\\" and \\"When I Was Young in the Mountains,\\" and they are also fabulous and highly-recommended.

A very solid effort by all accounts. It's nice every now and then to not have to look for albums from the 60's and 70's to find music with actual content and feeling. These songs don't contain alot of catchy choruses or guitar hooks, but they'll grow on you fast and you won't be able to let go. The lyrics are standard issue Farrar, insightful, inspiring, determined, choppy, sometimes melancholy, but never boring. Overall, the CD is more listenable than Jay's last two albums with Son Volt. Two small complaints, all of the instrumentals are very short and don't really add that much to the album...similar to Jodel from Wide Swing Tremolo.....and some of the other songs come in at just over 2 minutes. However, I'm only going to deduct half a point and still round up to 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grassroots heritage","review":"Jay Farrar's new self-proclaimed \\"project\\" \\"Sebastopol\\" is a rejuvenating throwback to familiar days of Uncle Tupelo--days I sorely miss. The new album sounds \\"dusty\\"--a time-worn 33 1/3. The album begins with a meandering pace in \\"Feel Free\\"--a radio-friendly piece with Farrar's trademark lyrical stylings and continues to impress from there. The kitschy \\"Voodoo Candle\\" is a low point though many will find it somewhat hypnotic. It is apparent that Jay Farrar has learned his lessons well and his experiences with the aforementioned Uncle Tupelo and Son Volt were not wasted. \\"Sebastopol\\" is a tremendous work that deserves a listen--and, as always, No Depression."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't listen to the Arizona jackass above!","review":"This CD is pretty decent, and certainly deserves the fourteen or so bucks you will pay for it. The songs are more mellow than those on Farrar's previous solo album, and much more staid, though at times more developed and well-crafted, than his records with Son Volt or Uncle Tupelo.The main reason I wrote this though is to tell you not to listen to the jackass above from Arizona. Son Volt's classic album is titled \\"Trace\\" not \\"Trance\\", a grievous mistake that simply displays this man's incompetence in this area of music. Don't take the word of an amateur here, especially one that cannot even correctly identify the name of an album by a man whom he is reviewing!Just buy a great record, support a great artist and review it for yourself; whatever you do, forget the thoughts of the reviewer above!"},{"rating":"2","title":"it's a crime(a)","review":"He has a voice ... and writes songs that can be rated among the best of them... but. Son Volt or not, there's still not much difference. Don't get me wrong, i love this, but i just felt it was lacking something, not sure what though. It's a great listen, powerful songs of social and lifestyle disenchantment and interesting arrangements, but it just lacks an edge. Maybe it's the sequencing, but when it's over you feel unready. If you're a fan you'll want this, if you're curious then it's a great buy. It's great, but should have been genius."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll Pass On This One","review":"Another example of an original artist misguided by corporate greed.Check out \\"No Depression\\" by Uncle Tupelo instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"The brilliant Jay Farrar has surpassed even his unmatched earlier efforts with his latest solo album. Sebastopol is the work of a true musical AND literary genius. I cannot think of another modern-day musician whose song lyrics could stand alone as successfully as with the music. And Farrar is complemented beautifully by several other accomplished musicians such as Tom Ray of the Bottle Rockets, Steven Drodze of the Flaming Lips, and Gillian Welch. Alternative tunings and experimental instrumentation keep this album sounding original and fresh throughout. This is no backing band of \\"fill ins\\". Farrar is continuing a career that, in many ways, parallels the great Townes van Zandt. Musically, that is. He may not write the songs that will reach the largest audience, but he writes the best ones, and for true \\"listeners\\", rather than casual music \\"fans\\", that is more than good enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoy this one you guys, no balarky pop. Real true music!!","review":"Good album! For all those who like SonVolt, Uncle Tupelo, and the \\"No Depression\\" genre of music, this is the guy who started it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkable!","review":"I didn't check to see, but I expect some No Depression Junkies to be a little unnerved by this open, modern, Rock sound, but I think it's great! I love Trace, but the songs deserved more space. On Sebastapol the production is clear and the playing is sparse and even funky. Sort of a modest mouse or flaming lips (Lips drummer is present here to great effect) crossed with Son Volt. I don't know yet if the songs will play into my subconscious like earlier Farrar songs, but right now it's hard to beat Barstow and Damn Shame. 4 stars for now working on 5. Barstow deserves 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jay solo = good","review":"After 5 straight run throughs I am very impressed with the results. This CD is consistent from start to finish, unlike the previous 2 SV albums. His choice of musicians was highly appropriate, Drodz's keyboard give the whole thing an uplifting (for Jay) tone. Barstow is a classic, he seems to be almost parodying himself and even slips in a few jokes. Clear Day Thunder is grand and Damaged Son is Jay at his 'trying to climb out of the depths of depression' best. The one thing I wish he would have done with this material is turn the instrumentals into songs. He should also include Jay speak decoder rings in the jewel box to reveal what a Voodoo candle or a Feedkill Chain are."},{"rating":"2","title":"I rank this behind only Trace","review":"Trace is a better album but I rank Sebastopol second. I think Sebastopol is better than Farrar's Son Volt efforts, Straitaways and Wide Swing Tremolo. I think the tunes are pretty catchy, so I don't see how people say the album is boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Consistanly brilliant","review":"Jay Farrar continues to write and perform the most consistantly brilliant music now available. From beginning to end, Sebastopol challenges the listener, whether through the powerful \\"Clear Day Thunder\\" or the evocative \\"Vitamins.\\" \\"Different Eyes\\" strikes me as a cautionary chant of encouragement while \\"Voodoo Candle\\" also propels us forward into the unknown. This is a fabulous cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointing Solo Outing","review":"Jay Farrar's first solo release is, unfortunately, a bit of a disappointment. There are some catchy songs, true, though nothing you haven't heard before from Farrar. The main problem, though, is that the production seems to be attempting to set Farrar's lyrics against an epic, semi-cosmic backdrop--not necessarily a bad thing, as Farrar's tourmates Varnaline demonstrate on their latest release--but what results is a muddled, over-produced mess, heavy with instrusive string arrangements and the sorts of sound effects that you thought were really neat coming from your Yamaha keyboard when you were fifteen. This is definitely one to avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Incredible Talent Lost in the Fray","review":"Nine times out of ten when groups split it just means more great music. Example Ryan Adams and Catilin Cary. Evidently this is not so with the split of Uncle Tupelo. It's all artist's license, but I know what I like. With exception of track four, \\"Barstow\\" with Gillian Welch, Jay's unique voice and poetry are lost on Sebastopol behind keyboards, drums, and a tambura? He seems to be desperately trying be a rock star with a voice and style that's far above the rock scene. Why can Tweedy pop toasters and ring clocks with Wilco and it seem right, yet jay's direction seem all wrong, I don't know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the usual, but still good stuff","review":"I don't think Jay Farrar gets any better than Son Volt. Sebastopol covers rather different sonic territory - sitars and tablas, oh my! - and Ferrar doesn't sound quite as confident outside the realm of Alt.Country, but some of the songs are quite good.For long time Farrar/Uncle Tupelo/Son Volt fans, this album will require several listens to acclimatize."},{"rating":"2","title":"listen in bulk","review":"please listen to jay's.....ryanadam's....spiritualized's...remyzero's......all taken together give a feeling of comfort from west to east to west coast.....look for casino-7's saloon songs....coming soon......laketahoe/barstow/slots/stateline/cigs/drinks/desert/luv"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where&#65533;s the angst","review":"I love Uncle Tupelo I believe that Jay and Jeff would feed off each other and reel each other in. Maybe it was that they were younger and had more angst. In any case there are a few good cuts on this CD Damn Shame being the strongest. Overall it was a good attempt but maybe they have been leading too much of the good life and needs to find the fire and passion and the angst of years past."},{"rating":"1","title":"whiskey bottle?","review":"This is watered-down version of Son Volt and bares no resemblance to the great Uncle Tupelo. Studio musicians and fill-ins quash any continuity. Farrars singing voice has become progressively worse since the break-up of Tupelo and on Sebastopol, his nasal, rangeless drone varies little from track to track leaving us searching for a melody or hook of some sort among the seventeen tracks. Unfortunately, there is little here. This album plays like a dirge and is utterly depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"STRIKE ONE on solo effort","review":"This music by J.F. should have never been released. As the cd cover says it is a project and the music sounds like it should have been left in the oven a lot longer. I have listened to this cd twice and will sale it today. There is not one good song on it.There is not one good instrumental solo on any song. Just give me a couple screaming guitars somewhere or a lap steel solo. I bought this cd from reading the reviews at amazon and the uncle tupelo connection, but was terribly disappointed.Those reviewers who like this cd, are either die hard fans or need to get out more. The cds i have bought recently by whiskeytown, ryan adams, blue mountain, and \\"the word\\" are great...u go through each day wanting to play their music. I respect Mr. Farrar's artistic efforts, and i hope he tries again. As they say, Babe Ruth had many strike outs before he hit all those homeruns....damn shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"SO BORING","review":"Do not believe the hype!I like Ryan Adams and was therefore recomanded to get this album, but I must say that I have (almost) never listened to a record that is so boring as this one. Farrer's voice is boring, the songs are at best mediocre, and there's no melody to speak of. The only decent song is \\"Feel free\\". Some people call this alternative country, but I can't hear anything \\"country\\" at all on this record.I don't know about you, but I would spend my money on Jayhawks instead ... That's alternative country."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review from Natural Hazards March 2004","review":"\\"This book provides a comprehensive one-volume summary of the state-of-the-art in both the basic and applied aspects of earthquake occurrence and seismic risk reduction.

Very, very bad! Worse, even. This could be a very good bird-cage lining material. The writers' ridiculous obsession with opals, which has stretched for several books now, is making me think they're in serious need for help. Letting them write more books like this one is NOT the answer! (and now they've added a fascination with salt and crystals, too!)I won't even go into the content of this poor excuse for a book. Enough is to say that it has nothing to do with the Krynn we know and love.Buy it if you must, but be warned! This is a series-killer"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Dragonlance I've read thus far.","review":"This book was pretty weak. I didn't like the way that I was the least bit interested until one half way through the book. But I pushed on. Some of the characters were decent. I liked the elven interpreter and the mute slave. After that it was the same old same old from the Williams'. I especially couldn't figure out who the hero or even the main character was supposed to be. Granted, the book was about Takhisis, but there is not a whole lot of chaeracter development that can go the supreme being of evil. But I couldn't even figure what Sargonnas was doing. I didn't want either side to win. I also didn't like how the author referred to the irda raiding parties. In every other book the irda are a race for good. Especially in Lost Histories II. I also didn't like the conclusion. I understood but I was confused by the inaccurate telling of the reason for the cataclysm by the incredibly long lived mute human."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worthy of Takhisis","review":"First things first, the book draggs; chances are, after reading the first two chapters, you'll put it down and not return. The information in this books seems as if it was pulled out of thin air, because it is completely inaccurate to Dragonlance history. With such a interesting goddess like Takhisis, it's amazing that someone could write such a horrible book. And believe me, it is horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap of the highest odor!","review":"This book stinks! I had hoped that Teri Williams would have some effect mitigating Michael's \\"talent\\" but that was a hope in vain. Not only is this book badly written, it has almost no consistency with the Dragonlance universe. It's greatest claim to fame will be that it was another, maybe the last, nail in Dragonlance's coffin. Don't waste your money buying this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring; same old stuff from Michael Williams","review":"I didn't bother finishing it. I didn't care to read about more druidesses, black glain opals, and incorrect information. Williams mentioned a druidess in at least 2 of his Dragonlance short stories and \\"The Oath and the Measure\\". The opals were referred to in both of the Heroes Volumes' Weasal stories. I can't count how many pieces of ignorant and inconsistent information I came across"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this book as if it were a death knight!","review":"Easily, the worst Dragonlance book ever written.

Writing of the darkest of all the gods is no easy task, but what has been produced is a travesty and a shame. This is a weak book with boring characters.

Jones fits the stereotype of trailer trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible! Bad grammar, language, and behavior.","review":"Junie B. Jones is the worst (or should I say \\"worstest\\", like she would?) example for children. She's bratty, mouthy, and acts and talks like a future juvenile delinquent. As other reviewers said, she calls other kids fat, stupid, and dumb. She uses poor grammar, and no, all kids do not talk like that! My three-year old uses better grammar than Junie. I got a bad feeling from the first page of the book. She says she doesn't like her middle name, Beatrice. Great, that's very close to my daughter's name, Beatrix.My other daughter bought this book from a school book fair. I'm very disappointed that they had these abysmal books available for kids. It's going in the recycling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad we didn't buy it","review":"I got this book from the library to give me something to read my kindergarten for her daily reading. We got through about half of it this afternoon and won't be finishing it. I'm already constantly correcting her English so reading a book where the main character uses poor English may be realistic, but not helpful to young kids. I also found I had to constantly skip over or modify words like stupid, hate, shut up, dumb, etc. Junie is just not a very good example to children her age. Even my daughter mentioned during the book \\"She's not being very nice.\\" So at least she gets that! But we'll be looking for a book where the main character is a better example."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inappropriate book for young readers","review":"While the concept may be \\"cute\\" for older readers, we do not encourage our 6 year old to use words such as \\"hate, dumb, stupid\\" or engage in name-calling.

After two chapters I had to tell my child we would be returning the book, as it was inappropriate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Concerned parent","review":"This book is typical an entire genre of books that inflict adult language and concepts on young children. Any caring adult will not wish their children confronted with issues of drunkeness, stupidty, fat mouth etc. in a book ostensibly for children. I understand this book is sometimes assigned by teacher's or read to 1st graders. It is not a book to raise up children, but rather a book that in it's outlook and concept appeals to the lowest common intellectual denomenator in both the child and the adult. I recommend all parents read this book before deciding to inflict it on their children."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that good","review":"played this game for a few hours and I have to say I wasn't impressed.

Gone was the perfect amount of flavoring the chipotle chips had. Instead the chips had so much seasoning it was darn near falling off the chips. I've had a few brands of habanero before, but this one tasted nothing like any of them. It has almost a sweet flavor to it. I personally didn't care for it at all. On top of it all, the chips aren't even very hot. I was very disappointed in how hot both chips were considering the brand is called Death Rain.

The rock/pop/country flavors are held together by Hyde's stellar songwriting craftsmanship and his quirky, imagistic lyrics (\\"Walked another crooked mile with a candy cane to ease his pain/Tried to make a perfect smile mean it . . .\\"). The performers (some of whom have played with Hyde for years) are excellent musicians in the best sense of the word -- engaged and focused as a group, as well as strong as individuals.

This game has some funny enemies like piles of throw up, crazed seniors, and Mr. T. Okay i was kidding about Mr.T but he does make an appearance because this game takes place in modern times. Also there are no random encounters like a lot of RPG's. This game is definitely not too short and is pretty lengthy.

This system however is how I remembered it, faults and all. Graphics a step up from other home systems of its time, but yet quickly over shadowed by PC games of the time time.By todays standards the controls are small, but still have many options. It took me some getting used to in having a wired controler again.

It brought back alot of memories playing Zelda! The pricing was great. And you can still get all the old games for it!I would like to mention... Be sure to get one with Composite plug (red, white, yellow), because some come with the old RF Adapter cable (like a cable tv coax plug) that won't work with newer TV's. About half come with the Composite and half with RF. If it comes with the RF plug, then you can buy the Composite plug that fits both the SNES and N64 for about $8 (from LukieGames) that works great on new TV's! Just wanted to let you know so that you don't get excited about it when it arrives and then find that you need a different plug, like I did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SNES System","review":"The system I received was nice and clean.

Super Mario World was the pinnacle of platform games, Street Fighter II is still considered by many to be the best fighting game of all time (in at least one of its bazillion incarnations), and console RPGs really came into their own with Final Fantasy II & III, which to this day are still my two favorite games. A lot of what made games fun has been lost in the move to sometimes overly-complex 3D games, and anyone who values gameplay over graphics should own a SNES."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE Greatest System","review":"For those of you who were never lucky enough to own the Super NES, I pity you. From a time when graphics were near obsolete, games focused on the story and gameplay. You can go and buy some Next-Gen system with super-realistic graphics but when you come away from playing the games it leaves you with a sliver of what the Super NES would. The games will touch beyond belief. If you ever buy ONE system it should be this one. I've played it since I was a child and it never grew old. The games offer a greater experience and will take you more then a few measely hours to compltet. If you want to be touched by games like Earthbound, The Legend Of Zelda, and countless others I would recomend this sytem to you. It will leave you speechless, breathless, and will strike a cord deep in you, deeper than anything else ever will.

I don't have the best musical ear in the world. I can't sing at all, but I swear the lead guitar throughout the whole album, all those solos that we're heard again and again, like Suzie Q, are out of tune with the rest of the band. You really notice this on a CD instead of a radio or elevator or k-mart store sound system or TV sound track (Apocalypse Now). I find this first LP hard to listen to. I was wondering if technology of some kind can bring the lead guitar solos into tune with the other guitar and bass. Hey, we've just discovered the Doors first LP ran slow since the begining of time, and they fixed it!!!!!

I still have this game.Gomez Addams comes home only to find his entire family held hostage to bosses in several different parts of the house. You have to go through each level and defeat every monster along the way until you get to the bosses. Your strategies are golfballs to throw at enemies, a sword, a fezi-copter something else with a special Super Mario Bros twist that temporarily makes you invicible while you pick up valuables along the way including riches and extra lives. There are also special bonus bosses that you can defeat for extra hearts. Once you've saved everyone, you've beaten the game!

(era Kelli Ali), I did expect her solo effort to be a little darker than Tigermouth. After the first listen I was a little put off, but after giving the new sound a chance, I realized that this is a really good cosmic POP record. The lyrics are very sunny and smooth, and at times at times schoolgirl-ish. The sound is lighter, and more layered than the sneaker pimps sound. Bottom line, If you lower your expectations, and pretend that the Sneaker Pimps never existed, this can be a fun summertime driving record. 4 stars is generous, but the album cover gets a star on its own!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nobody does it better","review":"For Bond fans, no description of the plots, acting, or special effects and stunt work are necessary. This DVD collection, however, is outstanding for all the extras that go along with the movies. There is extensive commentary and behind the scenes material on the DVD's, as well as written material that tells you everything you want to know about the actors and how the movies came about. It's a little disconcerting, but very interesting, to see the stars in interviews made 40 years after the movies. A lot of money and talent goes into the visual and auditory qualities of the movies, and the technical quality of the discs doesn't disappoint. This collection gets an enthusiastic thumbs up."},{"rating":"2","title":"A View to a Kill","review":"This was a Christmas gift for my husband.

I was somewhat disappointed by his live release as well as the Gift, because of the vocals and the orchestrations. Now Jim Brickman is back at what he does best: simple and and introspective melodies. I give it four stars instead of five because I really do not like the title song, which is so pretentious and loud that I can't even hear the piano playing. If you're like me, you should also check out George Winston."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historical Fiction","review":"I really like this series (Genreflecting Advisory Series) and this volume is very good.

Made after the success of \\"The mark of Zorro\\" with Tyrone Power some years earlier, but since this is Tin Tan, don't expect the story of Zorro. Actually it's a satire on Hollywood, with a mixture of \\"Zorro\\", \\"Doctor Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde\\" and with a touch of \\"Robin Hood\\" and even \\"Laurel and Hardy\\". With a great cast that includes a beautiful young Silvia Pinal and at least two Tin Tans. I wonder if you can spot his real brother \\"Don Ramon\\".

I understood early on that the anger and jealousy would end up being replayed in Kate, Greg, and Jon but I couldn't figure out which one of the guys would be Marcus or Nion.But, the ending really confused me. Is Kate now 'possessed' by Claudia or is she still Kate, in love with Jon? Is Jon now 'possessed' by Nion or is he still Jon, in love with Kate? Is Greg now 'possessed' by Marcus and will pursue Kate/Claudia and Jon/Nion? Or is the ending saying that he let go of Marcus out of his love for Kate?Very confusing.

Would have liked a lot more clarity for the ending though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will give you chills","review":"One thing I can say about this book is that it gave me chills when I was reading it late at night.

I hope that Barbara Erskine will write more books like this one.Buy it if you like scary stories!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"merely a pamphlet","review":"This book was a major disappointment after just having read two dozen books on the Manhattan Project, beginning with \\"109 E.

The leather was spotty; dark in areas like oil from a person's skin had stained it and lighter in other places. The leather was also frayed around the edges, as if someone cut the pieces with a dull pair of scissors. I don't know if the shoes are true to size b/c I didn't even bother to try them on. Its a shame, they are very cute shoes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad copy from this seller - no help on a return","review":"Bad copy - unusable - no help from seller.

Nothing new here...moving right along."},{"rating":"1","title":"At best, FAIR","review":"A large majority of the information presented in this book can easily be found by using popular search engines on the Internet. It seems that the author simply rehashed documentation he created in the course of his job and made a book out of it. There is no clear direction or any attempt at explaining his methods and/or techniques.While he has an impressive area of letters following his name (CCNA, CNE, etc), none of them have anything to do with a security related certification. Where is the GSEC, GCFW, GCIA or the default standard for security professionals, CISSP??? Granted, industry certifcations usually don't mean a thing unless they can be backed up with experience but if you are going to use certifications in an attempt to sell a book, at least choose some that have something to do with information security!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"advertised as original classic LP reissued on cd","review":"I am an ex-DJ with many of these LPS in storage, plus I played many albums like this one on a professional level.

The population turned out to recreate the statehood parade down 2nd Ave, and the recreation parade was better than the original.

As a side note, Amazon has been great about the return policy."},{"rating":"2","title":"not 5 because...","review":"Yes, it does have neoprene, no it is not enough to really do anything. You'll find it to be a very thin layer, in fact you can even see your hand imprint from the other side if you put your hand in the outer pocket and push against the outer neoprene flap. Otherwise, this is a very efficient, compact case. The shoulder cushion pad is very nice, can be removed and used on other straps given they're around 1 inch wide or less. Since I'm paranoid about scratches, I kept the bottom of my laptop facing the inner pockets, which seemed kind of pointless and defeats the purpose of a so-called laptop attache. This product gets a 4 for thin+Light form factor, thin/very little neoprene, useful outer pockets yet seemingly useless inner pockets. Given my laptop was 1.3 inches thick, anything thicker than an ipod (like a mouse, certain hard drives, and definitely power bricks + spare batteries) tended to make the case bulge and lose its aesthetic appeal."},{"rating":"2","title":"simple, slim, light","review":"very simple case for laptops up to 15\\". I have a Dell Inspiron 1545. It fits in this case but it would be better if it had a bit more room for the power cord and mouse.the material is durable and looks nice.

It takes you to through a guided tour of many of the sites in the book. It also visits the sites of Lincoln's other books. If you can't make it to Southern France this is the next best thing. I enjoyed the DVD, but this will only be interesting to someone into this kind of mystery-history. If you've read Holy Blood Holy Grail and haven't been to these sites you'll enjoy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leather Good...Personalization Bad.","review":"The leather product is decent with a slight overprice; however, the personalization is worthless. I was expecing my initials embroidered, but instead got my name stamped on a metal strip, then glued to the leather valet. It looks pretty cheap, so would not recommend paying all the extra cash for personilzation."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a scheme for getting your money.","review":"A poorly organized collection of author's publications and maybe somebody's Ph.D. thesis introduction.Even on subjects that I am familiar with, I had problem to trace the thoughts. It seems that book is a few days copy-paste enterprise.This highly overpriced book cannot be used as an introduction. Neither can it serve as a review of the topic becauseonly author's and, sometimes, his near colleague's results are included. The latter are often not central and usually represent onlyspecial achievements among a number of remarkable results that are completely missing from this book.Book arrives in a plastic cover, which opening prevents the owner from returning it. I would give 3 stars for the topic onlyif it were not for the price that I payed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adorable Easter Chicks","review":"These chicks are adorable and all of the children loved them. But note the actual size is only 2 inches. Description should note these as miniature."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor design","review":"These skates broke the second time my daughter used them. They are very fragile and made of weak materials. The plastic pieces are very thin. She fell and bumped the wheels on the ground and the plastic support for the wheels cracked causing the front wheels to rotate out of position. The entire wheel assembly rotated on the bolt! Very flimsy! Very dissapointing for my daughter as they were a birthday gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fail","review":"They sent PINK ones instead of black, and they were in womens size. I started skating and fell and sprained my wrist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not The Best Skates","review":"I bought these skates for my son as a gift. First problem is that they run very small. He wears a men's size 10, and these 10's are equal to a men's size 8 & 1/2. Secondly they are advertised as speed skates, and even though my son only tried them on our hard wood floor in the hallway and kitchen, he said they were very slow."},{"rating":"2","title":"I havent gotten them yet","review":"I haven't gotten them yet but the reviews are worrying me!!! ahhhh!! Are they really bad?? will they work on a 140 pound women??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Not very happy with this. My 12 year old son wanted to try the new skates out the next day after we received them. Went to the roller rink to find out that one of the wheels was totally different than the other 7. The are all grooved and the one is smooth even slick in texture which my son says it makes a difference. Also the velcro strap came apart and I had to sew it back together."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible product","review":"Please, Please do not purchase this product it is awful. I purchased this for my daughter's birthday and gave her a skate party and would you believe the things broke 30 minutes after putting theme on for the first time. My daughter fell and was injured because the wheels completely broke off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"I would not recommend this product to anyone. First of all they're described as \\"unisex\\", but when I received them, they were in a mens size. The second and most important reason I would not recommend these skates is the poor quality. I ordered these for my daughter and two friends as Christmas gifts. It is now only two weeks into January, and two of the three pairs ordered are already broken. Some of my daughter's other friends received the same brand of skates for Christmas as well, and most have broken as well.

After 25 minutes into a skating party at a local Roller rink they broke 2 of the 8 wheels altogather feel off save your MONEY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great skate but terrible wheels","review":"This is a great inexpensive skate if you are just using them to skate around in. However I do roller derby and the wheels are extremely slippery when I go around turns. The skate overall is really good. Just those darn wheels need to be replaced."},{"rating":"1","title":"you get what you pay for","review":"I bought these to use in a a community theater production that required very little use of the skates. I didn't expect much out of these since they were cheap. And I guess that is the real finding. These are cheap. They worked for a few weeks of light use before they broke. The fit was ok, the performance was ok, and I could have probably fixed them but didn't want to chance them breaking again in a show. I ended up buying a more expensive pair to replace them. If you want to go cheap these my work for a while, if you want something of quality you just can't get it at this price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Play with my kids","review":"Great product, I strongly recommend it.

They fit perfectly, no need for a return. She has used them several times already and they worked great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very flimsy and cheap construction","review":"There's a tradeoff when it comes to things like kid's skates. They're not going to use them a whole lot before they outgrow them, so it's tempting to buy a cheaper product and move on before it falls apart. (The alternate approach would be to take the nicer item onto the used market when you're done with it.) These skates though are a bit too far into the cheap and junky territory. I wouldn't claim these to be unsafe out of the box, but the wheel assemblies are not very strong, and they do fail after a few hours of use..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chicago Bullet Men's speed skate","review":"When we received these the nuts and screws were not on the one skate!!?!? We had to go to Lowe's and purchase them, then take it to the skate rink to make sure they were safe for our son's use. Very disappointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How can anyone wear these???","review":"I purchased the size 3 mens. The length and width of the shoe part of the skate appears to be correct for this size. The problem is the height of the inside \\"toe area\\" is inadequate. The front 2\\" of the shoe part has only 1/4\\" to 3/8\\" verticle clearence for the toes. In comparison the average shoe of the same size has about 3/4\\" of clearence for the toes.

First, there is no radio tuning knob, only a button that scans through the FM dial with no indication what the frequency is. Second, setting the clock is an exercise in non-intuitive design as the buttons are not labeled logically. Third, the switch to turn the radio on and off, the switch for alarm radio/alarm sound, and the switch to change Mater's phrases are all on the back of the clock-radio. Even with all these issues, I would have tolerated them (because my son did enjoy it), but ended up returning it because the time display was failing (some clock digit segments were disappearing)."},{"rating":"1","title":"mater clock","review":"horrible product...impossible to set time...a huge waste of money and time...disney should be taken to task for putting their name on this piece of junk"},{"rating":"2","title":"pioneer","review":"this game was the very first ever of its type. think of it like an on-line rpg, with 20 people(each controling a group) all under your command.

Yuming sheds her image as a subdued singer-songwriter and begins to experiment with different music styles (pop, rock, Latin, ballad, folk, orchestra accompanied)in 14th Moon. Much of her music style to this day evolves from the musical diversity expressed in this album. Masataka Matsutoya (Yuming's husband to be)is arranger on the album and the songs reflect his influence, coupled with the heart warming lyrics Yuming is known for.Among the songs recorded on this album, the marquis tunes are 14th Moon, Chuo Freeway, Asahi no naka de hohoende, and Tenki Ame, which have all become major single hit songs.

The graphics may not be up to what you see today but that doesnt matter at all. A game can look like a movie but if it doesnt have any substance beyond that its not even worth playing. If your a true diehard fan of RPGS and you grew up in the era of the Super NES and you still like those games instead of the crap they make now then you will love this game. I wish Square would decide to remake chrono trigger and also secret of mana for gameboy advance. If they are going to bring out all the final fantasies they need to do some of there other classics as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best RPG ever!","review":"I have played many rpg's in my life. I started to play rpgs with the first nintendo. This is the best rpg I have ever played. I have struggled so many times trying to find a game that matches its uniqueness and its excellent story-line, but I cannot seem to find one. I have played every single final fantasy, granted they are good games, but they just do not match up to chrono trigeer. Its sequal chrono cross does not even come close to chrono trigger. They made the game, chrono trigger, come so alive and it was so hard to ever put it down. I hope one day one of the new gaming systems will come out with another game as good as this one. I am looking for it and keep buying many boring games looking for one."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE ONE AND ONLY GAME","review":"It was the best game I ever played...even better than the final fantasy series... though sometimes I dabate about that... but still A MUST GET. I mean you have to get this game its better than any other rpgs and challenging enough to get you involed for months. Literally."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite RPG's","review":"One of the best games ever created. No point in haveing a long winded review it has all been said before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Travel through time save the world and become a legend.","review":"Excitement... Danger... The Warrior desires these not, but craves them non the less. If you like Final Fantasy or RPGs at all then you will love this game. Hard to find and expensive when you do, but well worth it. You play as a young guy named Chrono and travel through time to save the world. Changing events in the past effects events in the future which gives this game multiple endings and paths to explore, allowing for hours of game play. Not a game that you play once and put away for years, you will find yourself playing this game many times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Worth the Money","review":"Quite simply the most epic, engaging game of all time. With a rousing soundtrack, huge story, and the best battle system I've seen to date, Chrono Trigger is best game I have seen to date. It is one of those opportunities you cannot let pass by."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be prepared for the Final Fantasy Chronicles","review":"This is a great game,possibly the best RPG ever. But it was a victum of poor timing, it was released just a year before the Playstation and N64 burst on to the scene, yet even though it is a SNES game it is one of the best games ever. And Square realized this and a few years ago re-released this game for the Playstation in Japan, and later this year it is coming to america in a package called the Final Fantasy Chronicles. It will be packaged with Final Fantasy 4. Both of them are being refubished with new video clips and better translations like in the Final Fantasy Anthology, the ones for Chrono Trigger are truley amazing they are all Anime, my only problem is that Chrono (the main character) looks overly buff in the video clip. Don't go crazy looking for this game on SNES, wait a few months for the Chronicles, it's going to be great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative and entertaining","review":"John Warren has in this book taken instructional material about various BDSM scenes and applied it in stories that show how to use this information to construct erotic and fun scenes. While this book might be considered primarily for \\"SM beginners,\\" there's still a good amount of information and ideas for anyone looking to spice up their love life. John has written fourteen stories based around various \\"scenes,\\" ranging from spanking, wax play, a staged kidnapping, to enemas and humiliation play. At the beginning of each story, John gives a list of items needed to stage the scene, as well as safety information about each scene in notes on the side of the main text in each story. In fact, there is some additional safety information listed at the book's end.This book might be considered a kind of \\"BDSM lite book\\" and makes a good companion to other SM books like SM 101, Screw the Roses, and Sensual Magic."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Dixieland album since The Preservation Hall Jazz","review":"I owned this album as a teenager (the 50's)and it was my favorite then.

I had previously purchased another Weber ingiter kit but you have to watch the date of your grill's manufacturer - this is the part for older grills.

It was a little over two years. The porcelain burned off, and they rusted through. I replaced the bars with stainless steel bars so they would not rust out again.Now the steel box on the ignigtor is rusted out, and the grill won't light. The cheap tin electrode enclosure rusted so bad that half of the enclosure was gone (vaporized ?!).Now my grilling grates are begining to rust through. The porcelain is burned off and the grate is rusted through.It's costed me over $150.00 in replacement parts already.I would not reccomend that you cover your grill if left outside. The cover will keep the moisture inside the grill and the components will rust out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the replacement effort","review":"Can't say too much for a replacement ignitor system but it works. It installed as easily as expected, and appeared to be of a slightly better quality than the part that it replaced. If the previous part is any indication, it should last about 5-7 years, hard to believe in this time of designed obsolesence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Writing like poetry","review":"This is a finely crafted novel, told with a clear affinity for language and for the craft of writing.

It was by far the worst megaman game ( along with x5 and x6). And i beat them all might i add. But x3 had nothing new. The only two things new is u can play as zero. BUT if u die with him, he is gone for the rest of the game. And there are 8 capsules. But 4 are the normal armor and the other 4 are extras. But u can only get one extra. Megaman x1 is alot better and so is x4. Get those two and u are set."},{"rating":"2","title":"the defining moment in X's history","review":"ther are very few games that are worth this kind of dough. When i looked this one up the price had me spinning! after purchasing this game i have officially topped of my SNES collection, and its impossible to be a hardcore megaman fan without this game. If your a fan of skillful fighting suicide jumps that you actually make, and etc., you may find a warmer welcome with the plain megamans 1 through 7. However if your passion is new bigger weapons that wreak the ultimate havoc on evil, pick this one up, believe the hefty price tag is nothing compared to the smiles this game will put on your face"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Mega Man X game EVER","review":"Mega Man X3 is one of the best games and better than X1, X2, X4-8. In X3, you can play X or Zero, Mega Man X3 had many many sercets like the gold armor. To get it, you have to get all pf the heart tanks, have all of the armor powerups, full of 4 E-tanks, go to the Doppler stage and start at the first stage, have full health, beat the t-rex boss and be careful not to get hurt and waste one of your E-tanks if you do, you will not get the powerup. If you have the gold armor, you will have the edge to beat Sigma. If you are a huge fan of Mega Man X3, BUY THIS GAME."},{"rating":"1","title":"Distracting","review":"I found this device very distracting. You have to watch the lights to see if you are in the \\"zone.\\" If you have meditated in the past you may find this thing to be a time waster and take you away from reducing your stress.

Think of something that makes you feel love or compassion.3. Breath out.See if you can keep the breath pace the same and your pulse low, and make the light turn green.Geez... here is how you can do it without the box.1. Breath in for a count of 5...1,2,3,4,5..2. Think of good things...3. Breath out for a count of 5...1,2,3,4,54.

This device is nice enough, though the lack of an LCD read out and the necessity of deciphering all the weird colored markings is something only a Klingon could understand! For $180, I think this is a very disappointing device. Plus, the 5 difficulty levels are a joke. I \\"mastered\\" levels 1 and 2 in the first sitting, if the green color is to be trusted. The higher levels didn't take very long to \\"master\\" either so where's the challenge? Maybe if I spent a lot of time with it, I might get something out of it.

After a fight with my husband I tried it and even though my breathing followed the lights perfectly I couldn't get past yellow and kept going back to red. Thus, I'm not sure if breathing always contributes to lowering your heart rate. In fact, I was getting more frustrated that I couldn't get to green even though I was breathing accordingly. No doubt keeping my heart rate higher!Also, I never use it. I used it a few times when I first got it. If you have a lot of time and patience this might work for you.

They have the same flavor, but are not as spicy nor as flavorful. I tried breaking them up and using them as taco meat and they weren't so bad that way.

While it does share a good bit of history and interpretations from one branch of the Christian faith, it also comes across as rather contemptuous of other belief systems. If the purpose was to educate, this is not a successful piece. Rather, it seems to cause those of an opposing or curious view to reject this author's stance out of mere self-protection and escape from insult. However, if the purpose was to further validate those already on board with the author's philosophy, Congratulations."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL","review":"This was the worst book I've ever read. Using the Bible to prove that Christianity is the one true religion is like using the Koran to prove Islam is the one true religion.

If truth is absolute why would it need the Bible, or the Koran for that matter, to make it's arguments? Wouldn't absolute truth transend them all? Is God so petty as to allow only one way to reach him? All rivers flow to the ocean, no matter in which direction they flow. Is God any smaller than the ocean?This is a great book if you're already a believer (and therefore it's worthless). But if it's goal is to convince people with doubts, this book is a total and complete failure (and therefore it's worthless).I wish someone could recommend on this site a truly worthwhile book on Christianity for me.(A book I would recommend to others: \\"The Perennial Philosophy\\" by Aldous Huxley)"},{"rating":"2","title":"What more can I say but it's a TROMA FILM","review":"Funny and it has all the things I look for in a Troma film,good punch lines and it is a great spoof on the movie JAWS would defently do bussness with this seller again"},{"rating":"1","title":"Generally Low Marx","review":"The Marx Brothers in less-than-stellar form.

The book has a main plot that does not center on a character outside of the author as much as the movie does. But there are characters in both the book and the movie as well as quotations.The book is well done (though a bit wordy) and is a good read even if you have not seen the movie. I enjoyed the book and recommend it, and especially so if you are planning the pilgrimage of Saint James in Spain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Off the road","review":"Great book. I ordered it after seeing the movie \\"The Way\\" and, although the movie had a different plot/story, Jack Hitt's writing is very engaging. I loved the way he marbled the chapters with historical anecdotes and the way he describe the different characters without ridiculing them...I suspect we'd all retreat to our quirky selves after walking for a couple of days. Really enjoyed it and will probably read other stuff he's written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"Well written. Never boring. Gave me a different perspective on the way I think about history."},{"rating":"1","title":"A road I wouldn't recommend","review":"Save this book for a very long plane ride going nowhere. Its---Ok. Yeah, Mr. Hitt is very detailed about his pilgrim's progress, yeah, he doesn't tell us why exactly he is a pilgrim---thats good---but.....I just was not impressed with this book. It wasn't a life changer. Was this journey a life changer for the author? If you are looking for a read that gives you----something----an insight, a little education, a little relief from boredom....look elsewhere. Its not entirely too clear to me why this book was written in the first place. Its as rambling as the many pilgrim roads his feet trod upon. Read it if you're a relative or a friend, but my advice would be to skip and reexamine Canterbury Tales.....again......"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"Having read a favorable review of this book in one of the Seattle papers, and having heard my wife tell of the Pilgrim's Route to Santiago de Compostela, I looked forward to reading this and was very prepared to like it. Though Hitt is clearly a writer of some talent, the narrative was rather poorly drawn and aimless. There was simply not much interesting in his story. What's worse, the Kirkus Reviewer is right: Jack Hitt does adopt a smug tone, discussing the religious aspects of the journey and the concept of \\"god\\" (with a pointedly lower-case \\"g\\") in a belittling manner at every turn. He seems to incur experience but to absorb none of it; he seems to learn nothing, because he knew everything he wanted to know when he started. In short, this is a regrettable effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why is this book out of print!!","review":"Having just completed the Road to Santiago myself, reading Jack's book again was refreshing and helped me recollect a lot of what I saw. He does a great job describing the life and mind of a pilgrim and the history of the road. I would reccommend this book for people interested in walking the ancient road and for those who have completed it. It captures Spanish culture and history and combines it with the humor and challenges that the Camino brings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Off the Beaten Path","review":"I honestly must say I was disappointed with this book. The author writes well, very descriptively, and he provides much history in relation to sites on the path. However, the author does admit that he is not a religious person and is quick to point out many of the odd and not really good practices in the history of the church. This is ok, I guess, but I would be more interested in his inner journey which he keeps at bay from the reader. So I found this book to be a description of events on a walk which is meant to be a pilgrimage, a spiritual journey. It is my own fault for expecting to read the effects of the journey but all I know is he met strange characters, got very tired and sometimes afraid of wild dogs and some people but otherwise it is oddly a soulless journey of what is historically a spiritual journey or a journey within one's heart at least. I was disappointed but read until the end hoping for a glimmer which i never found."},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay, we're going on the pilgrimage","review":"We saw The Way (Martin Sheen movie) and were smitten by the thought of making the pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela. This book is mentioned in the movie credits so we decided to read it for more information. It is unlike the movie, but seems to convey authenticity, primarily in the absence of earthshaking revelations attendant the walk. Hitt makes the reader feel the walk, the slowing of time, the historicity of the Camino, and the strange segue into simplicity which makes the smell of manure a welcome experience (no kidding - manure means a town is near which means the opportunity to eat, sit, lie down, etc.). If you read Shirley McClain's book about the same hike you may wonder why nothing much happened to Hitt. You should wonder more about Shirley's veracity. Hitt makes it real - it is a long, often solitary, walk which permits life's frantic pace to slowly fall away so that the occasional time of peace may be noticed. That's plenty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Las horas del dia","review":"You send the wrong DVD twice and finally you decided that it was better to give me a refund since you did not know when the movie was going to beavailable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good invention.","review":"As much as Nintendo comes out with fabulous products, they come out with some really bad ones too!

I will be wearing socks with these. The sole is very hard(not much cushion) and there is not much of the sheepskin lining in the toe of the boot. I can't imagine doing alot of walking in these. The leather is in very good shape and the stitching seems to be well done. It's probably worth the $32 price for the boot, as long as your not looking for the comfort of Uggs or a good Ugg knockoff.

As a Pastoral Minister who deals with over 2000 children each week, one of the things I do is expain death to children. This is a concept that for them is very hard to understand. Why does God take someone they love away? This book expains clearly, correctly, the concept of death and what happens when someone dies. This understanding is done through the use of clear, concise, easy to understand language. I recommend this book to anyone who works with children or to a parent who are the first and primary educators of their children.

If as many people as these myths state have been victims of SRA were in existence, half of the US would have MPD. As it stands now, the psychiatric field is questioning the existence of MPD at all!

This is the first and probably the most important of the Satanic Ritual Abuse (SRA) books. It allegedly documents horrendous abuse suffered by Michelle at the hands of a Satanic cult. This single book gave a kick start to the entire SRA movement in the early 1980's. The Wiccan Information Network and other groups have found that much of the book content was derived from Dr. Pazder's personal studies of African native rituals, rather than from Michelle's memories. When the accuracy of his book was questioned during a seminar, Dr. Pazder stated that he and Michelle had never claimed that the events in the book actually happened! He is now promoting \\"Sadistic Ritual Abuse\\" as the new definition of SRA. He believes that the Satanic conspiracy does not exist. He believes that recovered memories of SRA during childhood are often based on real memories of incest to which a false overlay of Satanic ri! tual has been added."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does anyone out there NOT know this was faked?","review":"Open your eyes and read the truth:http://www.witchvox.com/whs/kerr_pazder1.html"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Received my Order","review":"I ordered a used copy of Michelle Remembers from Amazon.

Now, if you believe that, you may be able to swallow the rest of the stuff in the book - that is, if you can read it. The writing is even worse than the content, both wooden and confused.Hello, guys, this is the 21st Century.

Sure there is the occasional case of a drug confused teenager who says he killed for Satan but nothing as organized as described in this book. This book is typical of the ritualistic abuse panic of the 80's like the McMartin pre-school fiasco. People began describing the most deplorable acts of human depravity. So incredible that it seemed untrue. And guess what, it was. Authorities could not validate a single claim of RA amongst pre-schoolers and they couldn't validate any of Michelle Smith's either.

Phineas Fogg, instead of being an enimgatic, imperturbable English gentleman, is a goofy halfwitted bumbling scientist. His journey round the world resembles that of the original story not at all. The beautiful Indian princess whom Fogg rescues from death in the original has been replaced, for some reason, by a Frenchwoman, presumably because it's impossible to imagine this idiot Fogg rescuing anyone. The plot of the original story has been replaced by a baffling and incoherent yarn about the theft of a jade Buddah (why?

Bad computer graphics make real location shots look fake. The actors playing the two main heroes (Chan and Coogan) are horribly miscast. The fight scenes look boring (it's a miracle, considering Jackie Chan's participation, and I'll attribute it to the towering ineptitude of Frank Coraci as the director). The plot (I am being charitable using this word) takes totally unnecessary liberties with the setting and with the original material (the classic 1873 Jules Verne novel).Do yourself a favor.

Lord Kelvin was famous for supporting scientific research and encouraging many other famous scientists. He was in fact not born into the aristocracy but knighted in recognition of his achievements.Beyond that I was disappointed that it didn't include the many and varied modes of transport and constant push to beat the clock I seem to remember from an earlier version (although I can't remember which one).It annoys me that people like Disney rewrite these things and keep the same name. It's not that I object to the rewrite (although it was pretty poor in this case). But why pretend it's the same story?I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Disney Film","review":"I was actually surprised that I enjoyed this film. The key is that you have to take it for what it is, a Disney film for kids. One of the things I like are how many cameos of stars are in this film, every country has someone famous there. Jackie Chan's action was exciting as usual and the jokes were funny. I didn't think I would like this, but I gave it a chance and it was enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boooooooooring...","review":"I'm gonna be short, because I believe the producers of this stinker did the same thing with the script.Just get the Michael Todd version instead of this horrendous movie and have fun beyond your imagination.That's all."},{"rating":"2","title":"An English Letter Home?","review":"While I quite enjoyed this movie for various reasons.1. It was a bit of a different part for Jackie.2. It had a delightful lighthearted feel to it.3. different viewpoint then the original4. the accidental painting was great5. well its just plain fun, you know the type of fun whereyou check your brain at the door and just sit and enjoy.the only issue I really had with the entire film waswhere Jackie's character writes home about getting thejade buddha and he writes in english to his chinese family.This is one of the biggest moments where I almost always gothat just doesn't fit. If I'm in china and write home, I don't write in chinese.Otherwise, this is just a fun romp.I'd also recommend Gorgeous for a really different part for Jackie and quite good."},{"rating":"1","title":"A glossy and unfunny disaster","review":"This is a highly glossy, effects-filled movie as befits its $100+ million production budget.Unfortunately, as also befits its total box office take of about $24 million, the film, loosely based on the Jules Verne novel, is saddled with a stilted script, many jokes that fall flat, uninteresting cameos (except for the Brothers Wilson - Luke and Owen - who had a certain charm), and unoriginal fight choreography.Those wishing to see Jackie Chan in better form in an American production are advised to see \\"Shanghai Knights\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: Only appropriate for 12 years old and younger","review":"Disclosure: I did not sit through this entire movie. The tedium and boredom won out after 60 minutes of abuse inflicted by watching this horrible film.This movie is so poorly written and acted that only viewers younger than 12 could find enough enjoyment to warrant their attention. There is nothing here that is fun, entertaining, exciting, funny, or remarkable in any way; except for its awfulness. That is remarkable."},{"rating":"1","title":"...Only because zero stars is not an option","review":"This is worst movie i have ever seen. NO talent was exhibited-the acting blew, the script was horrendous, the \\"humour\\" was not humorous, and it contained about every racial cliche in the book. top that with a predictable forced romance, ridiculously bad accents, and a scene in china that has abosolutly nothing to do with the story. i would not want to own this movie even if it was being given away free, which it will probably end up being, because it sucks. the only reason i saw it was because i was on an airplane and incredibly bored....although i regret it now and i would have been happier threading my hair into a loom and ripping it out of my skull as i weave a blanket for mutant, orphaned, third-world llamas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reason why it flopped","review":"Answer is :Jackie Chan.

She absolutely loves it and took about 50 pictures so far on the first day. You need a lot of light, need to be very still, and can't be too close to what you are taking a picture of. I think it's a great starter camera (pictures are not totally clear, but the kids don't mind since they take pictures of anything from the door to the dishwasher), it's extremely easy to use and very easy to download the pictures once you load the CD, she's even started to learn how to plug the wire into the computer and where to click to download. I would definitely recommend this as the \\"first\\" camera for girls..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted my money!!","review":"I was going to buy this for my 5 year old sister but lucky I tested it out before I gave it to her. I couldn't figure out how to take pictures with it and when I finally took some I couldn't even see what I was taking. When I tried putting a picture in the little locket it kept falling out because you have to open it up to connect it to the computer. I didn't care that it wasn't going to be that great of quality because I know it is only a kids camera but for $30 it was a waste and I don't believe I got what I paid for. It's cute but that's about it. You can buy a webcam for only $20 and it works a lot better and my sister would have more fun with that then trying to figure out how to take pictures with the camera. A little girl shouldn't have to only take pictures in the right lighting and making sure she's holding it exactly right just to be able to see a picture that is crappy anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment","review":"My 8 year old daughter has loves to take photos with our camera so I thought this would be ideal.

One of the best and realistic films showing the courage and the ethics of the early days of climbing. One reviewer panned the movie for \\"taking liberties\\" with the facts. Every movie \\"based on true events\\" takes that liberty from time to time. It in no way detracts from the quality of the film or the storyline either. After watching this film, you will have a new perspective about mountaineers and why they do what they do. If you climb you will identify with the emotions and motivations that drive these men. If you don't climb, be prepared for a riveting and suspenseful story that may or may not turn out the way you thought it would. Excellent to the very end."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent drama","review":"Well done movie that keeps going. you forget you are watching a subtitled movie. we really enjoyed it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply a Magnificent Movie","review":"I am rarely inspired to comment on movies. This one is simply too good to leave hidden. On every level this film excels and is memorable.From the very first frames, the cinematography shows careful framing of every image. The landscapes are so spectacular that you cannot communicate them in words. Everything is vast and yet made intimate. You are really made to feel like you are scaling the mountain.The film communicates a sense of culture in a very intimate and realistic way. You feel as if you are a witness to Germany and Austria in 1936. These are very believable 1936 Germans. You don't feel you are watching actors.The tragedy is enormous, but there is also a cautionary tale here about hubris and decision making as well. It is a tough movie to watch, even for a hardened adult. I don't recommend this one for young children. But for those who can stomach watching the cruelty of this kind of alpine environment, this is a truly magnificent movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Photography","review":"Two young brave mountain climbers push the envelope to attempt to become the first to scale the north face. One does not have to be a mountain climber to appreciate the importance seemingly small decisions have on the results of our efforts. Be prepared for surprises.

We have the \\"underdog\\" dynamic (that's the one where the 'anti-NAZI' brothers beat the NAZIs). We have a sordid love affair with a blithering bimbo who decides to go ice climbing in high-heels. Then there is the \\"bad guy\\", a NAZI of course, who just wants to drink wine, eat veal and sit by a warm fire while our courageous brothers risk their lives trying to climb a huge ice cube wearing pajamas and tennis shoes. In the end the brothers all die and the ice-bimbo moves to New York to take pictures of black musicians (presumably to prove her open-minded anti-NAZI bona-fides). But, of course, she'll never love like THAT again. Blech!

That movie was about survival. The NorthFace is what climbing to me has always felt like, and even though its in German it still beats any US climbing movie by far, and it makes you just want to laugh at Bill Paxton the next time you watch Vertical Limit. Vertical Limit is a climbing comedy BTW. In The North Face you get to see what drives people to the top, the challenge to discover the unknown while almost leaving all morals on the ground, and the thought of a summit that can drive people mad while ignoring common sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Adventure Movie","review":"Great adventure movie about really life experiences a must watch if you are an outdoor person.

Pay close attention to the dialogue to catch the subtle politics emerging in the social setting at the posh hotel in the Alps. The mountaineers make basic mistakes which result in a nailbiting climax. The film is based on a true story and should be watched by anyone who thinks they want to climb a mountain. I'm recommending it to all my dear mountaineering friends and relatives to remind them to plan well, climb wisely, and return home safe."},{"rating":"2","title":"North Face","review":"This foreign (German) film (subtitled in English) was very good.

For instance, I was hoping to see some of the strongholds and accompanying footage of the associated engagements. There is very little of this and in fact the majority of the DVD focuses on the political aspects of the conflict. I think my expectations were to high with regard to the availability of filmed resource. For the most part, a lot of the battle footage appears to be shot from a Russian perspective, collocated with the Viet Minh.

I purchased it new for 15 dollars, and at only an hour in length, it feels like there should be more.The focus is mostly on the larger strategy (troop movement and reinforcement, trench construction, logistics, etc.) with a few geopolitical highlights, so if you enjoy minute battle details or sweeping political sagas, this will leave you feeling hollow. For my tastes, I thought that it was about right. I also enjoyed the extensive war footage and strait-forward style of the narration. I never got the impression that the film was given from an American perspective, and any appearance of this is never as egregious as what can be found on the History Channel.I agree with another reviewer that this would be an excellent film to show in a classroom setting, as well as for people with a casual interest in this (rather narrow) period of Vietnam history."},{"rating":"2","title":"How funky is your chicken?","review":"Spasm jazz in the best sense of the term, coming to grand fruition in concert.

If you are a hardcore anime collector and are looking to see this show in it's orginal Japanese turn as far away from this as possible. The subtitle track for the Japanese language is in fact just a hearing impared track for the dub of the show. So not only does it have things like (laughing) or (yelling) in the subs but sometimes there will be subtitles when no one is even talking because they added voices in the dub that wern't there in the original Japanese audio. The \\"dubtitles\\" also fly by at such a fast rate that you can't even read how incorrect they are most of the time. On top of several other technical issues I can't recommend this release to anyone. Flat out terrible. It's a shame to because the show underneath it is actually really good.

Granted, Teenager of the Year is a very tough act to follow, but I think of CoR as somewhat of a Trompe Le Monde after Doolittle. While Teenager is definitely his masterpiece, CoR is one of the most unique moments in his discography. Remaining an amazingly melodic songwriter, he continues to stretch his experimentations in structure in beautiful, inspired rockers like \\"Cult of Ray\\" and \\"Men in Black\\", while \\"The Marsist\\" reaches a textural and rhythmic weirdness that should intrigue and excite any intelligent listener. His lyrics are also as clever as always, and yet the two instrumentals, tracks 7 and 10 are very rewarding to repeated listening. Perhaps the darker, more metallic sound of this album is what bothers some, but to me it is one of its highlights. I would definitely pick this over Black's next three Catholics efforts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated solid album","review":"Sadly, this album is very underrated compared to his other albums. Strangely though, many critics who loved his first 2 solo hated this and many who hated his first 2 loved Cult. There isn't as much diversity as Black is capable of, I don't think there were any two songs from his first 7 albums that sounded the same, but on Cult there are 4 or 5 well produced punky surf songs that sort of blend together. That's fine though. One comment, someone said there was only 40 minutes of music on this disc, originally Black had this one almost as long as Teenager, but the record company made him cut it. 7 of the songs (a few better than the average cut on here) can be found on the B-sides collection Oddballs. There is also another B-side on the \\"I don't want to hurt you\\" single, if you're an intense completist. If you love this album though, get Oddballs, it has lots of awesome stuff on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Below Average","review":"A labor of craftmanship and skill, but there is no genius in sight.

I had loved the Pixies and really enjoyed Frank's first two solo albums. I knew this was going to be a masterpiece along the lines of Dolittle or Surfer Rosa. Damn was I wrong. I haven't been this let down by an album since...well Bossanova, probably. All of the wild experimentation and genre-shifting was gone. What was left was mediocre bar rock. Only \\"The Creature Crawling\\" and \\"The Last Stand of Shazeb Andleeb\\" really stand out as classics. The two instrumentals are completely unnecessary. Frank seems to value a gravely-voiced style of delivery in place or his spectacular falsetto. It's a shame, really. The album serves only as a reminder of how great he once was. He later partially redeemed himself with Dog in the Sand and parts of Pistolero, but this album remains where it all went terribly awry."},{"rating":"1","title":"immoral people","review":"First few scenes should not have been included: Ina in her mink coat, Ina talking about servants cleaning the home and video showing a child of about 4 years old scrubbing a cabinet in her family home; then the most telling: her describing the wife of the man (Jaap) she was pursuing, though he was married, as having \\"irregular facial features\\" as if that was a good reason why adultery should be okay. When in a concentration camp, the wife asked her husband to stop holding hands and walking with Ina--shameful, disgraceful. And the dialogue with concentration camp footage continued--This movie is a true story of adultery and the horrors of a concentration camp. Unfortunately it shows the character of a bland woman of privilege who with her coiffed hair and arrogant attitude leaves you with a taste in your mouth and the phrase \\"shame on you\\" in your heart.

My hopes were dashed, however, early on. The heroine, Elizabeth doesn't seem to have read the Heroine Guidebook, which clearly states that gothic heroines must be somewhat retiring (even if it's a facade), reluctant to be seduced (even if they really want to be), willing to entertain the possibility of the supernatural (even if it is against her will), and able to put two clues together (even if she comes up with the wrong answer).I plodded my way through page after page, trying hard to like this book. Even the sex scenes didn't make the going any easier. (And these were very detailed, which can seem odd when phrases like \\"delirium of sensual delight\\" are the norm.)

Additionally, O'Callaghan has managed to, through his exceedingly dry prose, completely emasculate this otherwise exciting and vibrant subject.

There is just no sense that this is a $60 brand name item or most definitely not the $99 claimed retail. Of course it remains to be seen how they will hold up after several months/years of use, but my prediction based on the quality and sturdiness of the frame that it will be more like months rather than years.On the small plus side, they are polarized; if you have a large face, they probably wont look terrible; and they do come with a neat little carrying case.All in all, I am disappointed with this purchase and will probably just use them only for driving."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISCONTINUED A GREAT PRODUCT","review":"I am giving this a one star review for this reason: I must be one of five people who bought the Intelliclean system and loved it.

I knew I'd have trouble finding a copy, but after I saw the movie I knew I needed the soundtrack.It's a great mix. It's filled with great gothic-techno songs that seem like they were made for the movie. The songs are very impressive, and it's easily becoming my favorite soundtrack I own. Watch out Jawbreaker!This soundtrack is out of print, and extremely rare. Try your best to snag a copy, you won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A spooky mix.","review":"The intro is Rose Mcgowan's character in the movie saying \\"There is just no place for us in this world\\". Other than a few odd-balls, the rest of the soundtrack is an electronica/shoegazer type of thing. It's a good selection of cool bands. I especially like the \\"Curve\\", \\"Cocteau Twins\\", and \\"Verve\\" tracks. \\"Lush\\" is always a good thing to hear. The \\"Slowdive\\" song closes the disc nicely too. There were a few bands in the movie that are not here, like Porno for Pyro's and Nine Inch Nails, but what can you do. The movie itself has alot of dark sex and violence, and is similar to \\"Natural Born Killer's\\", (another good soundtrack). If you like the tracklist of \\"The Doom Generation\\", you might like the soundtracks to \\"Nowhere\\", and \\"Splendor\\". All three movies were directed by Gregg Araki. Oh, and I think this is out of print, so happy hunting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clasic, 90's industrial/glamer rock/disco","review":"The movie maid me want to get the soundtrack.

The combination of constantly changing typefaces, different content/writing styles, and pages which were just way too busy (bordering on the messy) made reading this book less than enjoyable. I got nothing which conveyed the charm, history, or intrigue of the Valley. A much better and superior read is the Valley of the Kings chapter within Thomas Hoving's book on Tutankhamun. Basically a textbook or resource for quickly checking facts and figures. Book does, however, contain beautiful photographs and drawings."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"Excellent book, if you are interest in ancient egypt, read this book, you'll learn a lot of interesting facts about the valley of the kings, the pharaohs, etc.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Once again, Reeves et al hit the mark!","review":"This volume is filled with great information. I could not imagine touring the Valley of the Kings without having read a similar book. Full of facts and anecdotes, this is an indispensable reference for amateur Egpytologists. Many scholarly works have been written on the various tombs in the Valley, but those sorts of journals are not easily accessed by the general public. Reeve's book serves as a great index and introduction. Each location is thoroughly but briefly summarized. The illustrations, both photographic and drawn, are well produced. Many books on Ancient Egpyt are much more beautiful (and expensive!), but the information presented here is hard to beat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb!","review":"Excellent summary information on the Valley of the Kings, presented in a concise and coherent format with lots of correlated information.

While the book is somewhat dated today, it still captures the racism that is faced by black Catholics in a church that is still mostly White. This book would invite you to ponder on the possibility of being black and Catholic. The book is easy to read and the author is transparent as he shares his feelings. The book needs a revision."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hillerman has nothing to worry about","review":"Comparing this book to Tony Hillerman is like comparing apples to wilted spinach.The main characters have nothing in common and are as grating on the reader as they are to one another.

I still agree that this should be posted clearly, and for that matter it should be stated for all films! I can't stand most English dubbing, so it drives me nuts when an anime that I've been wanting to watch pops up on amazon, and it's in English.but seriously, where are the rest of the episodes? you can't leave me hanging like that; it's like only putting up half of a movie...Dream Eater Merry: Complete Collection [Blu-ray]"},{"rating":"2","title":"OUTSTANDING DEAL!!","review":"I had priced this unit elsewhere as a refurb.

It is a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works for me","review":"The spray button is a nice touch. A solid gun, although hideous, and the grip and trigger are nice. No jambs to report. I actually shot 18ga nails in a pinch out of this gun (not recommended!) but it shot them two at a time for a while and still didn't jamb! Why they made it look like an alien respiratory system, I don't know, but form over function here, it's really not a beauty contest. The only (minor) complaint I have is that the large round head/tip is not perfectly tailored to small 2 5/8 crown moulding. It is still possible to get it where you want it to sink the nail well, but if you don't use the tip right you may have to set 1 out of 20 with a nailset which is fine if you keep it in your belt. I do think the tip is fantastic and sturdy in all other situations. Maybe I should just use 2\\" brads for that mould."},{"rating":"2","title":"NT65 M2 Straight Nailer","review":"This gun works well as a replacement for my old 16 gauge Hitachi gun, which is 10 years old and still works but jams too often .This version has a quick release so jams are easier to clear now hope it lasts as long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Nailer","review":"High quality and very comfortable to use. I've shot hundreds of nails through this gun with no jams. Buy this nailer, you'll be very happy with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not recommend","review":"Bought this product re-conditioned from Amazon. Initially it worked well, however after a period of time I got constant nail jams in the feeder, then the gun fired 2 nails at once with one trigger pull on a regular basis, then nothing, then back to firing 2 at once. Nail blocks would end up overlapping one another in the feeder mechanism, especially when the first block is down to the last 10 or so nails, which just seems to show poor manufacture to low tolerances. I'd expect this of a cheap nailer, but not of this caliber. Not worth the money. Avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book about the landings on Utah beach","review":"This book is a must for all those who wants to know what happened at the Cotentin peninsula in june 1944. It covers the beach landing, the airdrop and how the allies fought their way to Cherbourg.The book has a lot of good maps and illustrations to help the reader. These include maps of which german troops the allies thought were defending the beaches and the peninsula as well as maps showing exactly what reality looked like. Complete OOBs for both Axis and Allies are included. Historically very correct book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugly is bad and pretty is good","review":"As an adult, I now understand the meaning of this book; but as a child I actually understood the story to mean that being ugly was bad and made you unloveable and that being pretty was important and made you loveable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful illustrations and a well-told story: buy this!","review":"Like most parents, you want your child's home library to include standard fairy tales. Jerry Pinkney's \\"The Ugly Duckling\\" combines incredibly detailed ilustrations with a nice balance of both strong and muted colors AND a wonderful re-telling of the generations-old standard tale. In this verson, however, people are woven into the story in a way that I haven't seen before, and I like that very much. It's easy to see why this book was selected as a 1999 Caldecott Honor Book. Pinkney's a very gifted illustrator, and he really has to be given credit for his well-constructed text as well as the gorgeous pictures. Authors who write and then illustrate their own stories are somewhat rare, and as an adult, I appreciate the incredible mix of talent and hard work this represents. My children, of course, just love the pictures; they'll grow to appreciate good writing as they get older."},{"rating":"2","title":"I want more Jerry Pinkney Classics!","review":"It all started days ago when I read the free ebook on my kindle that I found. Then we read it again in Mary Engelbreit's Fairy Tales. One was long winded and harsh, the other was much shorter and plain (but with great images!). Then I discovered there was a Jerry Pinkney version and i just knew I had to have it. I first discovered the artistry of Jerry Pinkney in The Lion and the Mouse. Practically wordless, the story was amazingly portrayed in vivid detail.I was not disappointed here. It was closer to the kindle version in story text, but not as harsh I'd think. The illustrations are so textual that the animals seem to almost russle off the page. This has got to be my favorite version of the story. Yes it is wordy, but original to Hans Christian Anderson ina great adaptation. The images portray so much and a child (or adult) is left really able to ponder the nature of it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for walnuts and brazil nuts, otherwise avoid","review":"My wife purchased this nut cracker a couple of years ago, so we have experience with it, and it is not good. It appears to be designed by a male who's never been in a kitchen, like so many other inferior kitchen products. This cracker, while great at cracking open large nuts such as walnuts and brazil nuts, is absolutely worthless when it comes to small nuts like almonds or hazelnuts. With any small nut, you will find yourself having to search for the widest part of the nut to crack at the very \\"top\\" of the cracker. It will try and push the nut \\"down\\" (toward the wider part of the cracker) when it can't grip the small nut properly. You can spend 30 seconds just trying to position a hazelnut or almond in this thing before you can finally get it to cooperate. For this reason, I find this cracker worthless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love","review":"This is a great little product that does exactly what it is supposed to do.

I was able to fit three glasses in each row but after one of them slipped out and shattered all over the kitchen, we decided to only put two in each row.

The 2 disk package is comprised of a brief \\"hollow earth\\" theory and presentation by a mumbling lecturer. Many of his comments were inaudible. Also, there was little evidence to substantiate his claims. Though i did not time the first segment, it seemed to be less than an hour. What follows is a boring expose on the Artic and Antartica. This very long segment finishes the first disk and runs well into the second. We see ice, polar bears, many penquins, walruses and ancient footage of early explorers.There is no UFO subject matter. The final segment, an old black and white docu-drama,was more than i could sit through. This DVD was deceptive as it was marketed as UFO exploratory research.Don't waste your money,,,this one's a dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch!","review":"This is likely the poorest quality DVD I've purchased. It frequently froze screen and skipped sections when playing on a high quality DVD player; there are no menus.

His Nietzsche is an irrationalist with no contributions to knowledge or philosophy worth remembering. The book is tiresome and the prose tends toward moralism, pedantry and saccarine pride at being a postmodern moralizer. The industry review supplied here at Amazon is innacurate: the chapters are on Birth of Tragedy, The Gay Science, Zarathustra and the Genealogy of Morals ONLY! There is no chapter on Beyond Good and Evil, not on The Antichrist, nor on Twilight of the Idols, nor on the autobiography. I disagree that Allison has covered the principal works since he ignores so many of them.If you want another Heideggerian-Derridian \\"reading\\" that is more about living people than about Nietzsche, then maybe this is for you.

Miley Cyrus's character was a typical teenager, but quite boring. Her mother (Demi Moore) was even more boring. It wasn't their fault that the writers gave them nothing interesting to say or do. I thought them going to Paris might have saved this crappy movie, but once again nothing they did made sense.

I thought this was a good choice because of the actors and because I knew husband would never watch it with me. But don't waste your time on this one. I cringe to think about teenagers watching this movie and thinking that the behavior is acceptable.It's one of those movies where they try to make 'right look wrong and wrong look right'. Everything about it was wrong--mom was a mess, dad was a mess, daughter tried really hard to have morals-but then ended up a mess too. I was disgusted by the sexual references in this movie. There are better ways to teach kids about life.

We totally overestimated this movie. First of all, according to the summary, the movie seems like one of those hilarious movies that shows a teenage trying to get along with her mom. We both predicted that there was going to be some kind of good moral in the end, but most of the part is just talking about a highschooler with a bunch of love issues that she goes through. Her mom is just this single mom who later on dates a guy that gives her a ride home. The only part that matched the summary was when Lola said that she knows her mom will always be by her side. Second, the price is wayyyyyyyyyyy to expensive! If you want to take the risk of watching this video, just please consider looking at the price... (like FOUR DOLLARS after tax for renting only TWENTY FOUR HOURS)!!!I'm sorry if I spoiled everything for you, but this is NOT the right choice of movie for the family."},{"rating":"1","title":"The original French LOL is amazing, this is a very bad copy.","review":"The French movie LOL from 2008 is a great movie.

Not only is it the same lines, they make the actors look like the french ones and the situations are identical. Its horrible to watch.

In the end, the movie compares Miley to her mother (Demi Moore) and how alike they truely are. The movie is cliche and uneventful, and the acting is sub par.

My daughter gradually lost interest and the lack of a true and original plot certainly contributed. All the characters and actors were \\"beautiful people\\" which is incredible infuriating in this day and age. Very few right messages or positive modeling to counteract the wrong ones.

I ordered this variety and got the sensitive skin instead of the extra gentle version, but it's only a little bit stronger. Local stores have quit carrying both, so I can't complain. This product probably wouldn't cut it if you have very oily skin, but it'd never caused me any kind of irritation, unlike Nivea's non-sensitive skin products.

Rather, I found the introduction staid and the remainder of the novel difficult, rambling, and not fulfilling, lacking the strength I admire from Walker's other works.What is redeeming about this book is the tone--the very apparent importance to Walker herself in the telling of her story leaving the reader with an appreciation for the effort if not for the work itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"peace with the changes life offers","review":"alice walker weaves her ideas very subtly into her stories. her books contain a philosophy but it manages to inhance not detract from the novel itself.

What I found is a book totally devoid of any redeeming spirituality. There were excerpts from Walkers sexual history which I could have done without reading. This book read like an awful diary than was meant to be thrown away but, was found.......by an enemy intending to stab you in the back!

Sadly, the limited edition CD went nowhere also. He incorporates ex TV bassist Fred Smith on this album and does his homework good.

In typical M-Audio style, the functionality is terrible as well. I'm not alone when I complain about the double-midi problem with this thing. That's right, try recording or playing something.

Complex splits can be managed with ease, and with 17 buttons, 24 knobs, and 9 faders, you can control just about anything. The buttons are in a straight line right above the keyboard for easy access, I can bring loops in and out without missing a beat. All of the controls, including the transport controls, are thoughtfully placed with the performer in mind. The bottomline is, if it broke, (knock on wood), I'd get another one. I love my pro 88.Oh.

On one the acting and filming was attrocious. On another, the actress playing Fanny Price lacked a look and presence of innocence that the character should have held. In this version, Fanny runs around with her hair scraggly and long--I want the true style of Jane Austin's time period! It is missing far too much of the plot also. I'd like to issue a challenge to a filmaker out there somewhere to make a really good quality Mansfield Park, that has good casting, acting, directing, filming, music, AND costuming, as has been presented in A&E's Pride and Prejudice, the Gwyneth Paltrow version of Emma, both the BBC and Emma Thompson versions of Sense and Sensibility, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, rushed, and ubelievable","review":"If you love Jane Austen, you probably won't like this film. It is rushed, and I don't think the actors play their parts very well. I wasn't convinced that each one WAS the character they were playing. Billie Piper is a lovely girl, but she just isn't Jane Austen type. Her portrayal of Fannie was just...weird. Fanny wasn't the kind of lady you'd expect to see in Jane Austen's time, that's for sure. Even the romance elements of the film were downplayed and rushed. If you're looking for a good period romance, watch \\"North and South\\" with Richard Armitage. If you want a good Jane Austen film, watch \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" with Colin Firth, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" (either one, but the BBC is more accurate), or \\"Northanger Abbey\\" by BBC. If you're looking for pretty much a waste of time, watch this version of \\"Mansfield Park\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I was very disappointed. I hated the lead actress, Billie Piper. She's awful and just ruined the movie for me. She is so homely and awkward that it's really hard to watch her. My husband refused to keep watching the movie after the first 15 minutes. I finished it because it's one of my favorite stories. This version was better than the 1999 one with Hannah Taylor-Gordon, which butchered the story and misrepresented many of the characters horribly. The only accurate portrayal of this story is the old BBC version with the cheesy staging and bad filming. This version is pretty true to the story, but a lot of detail is left out. I read the book and loved it, so I'm still hoping for a good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Readers Digest Condensed...?","review":"I am a long time fan of Austen's books and movies. However, Mansfield Park is my least favorite J.A. book. The main character, Fanny Price, is the long-suffering poor relation. She is sooooo humble and good that I had trouble believing that certain rakish characters in the book could ever fall in love with her. That said, this new movie adaptation chops a large book into a mere 90 minutes. Characters, locations, and key passages have been completely removed. Mansfield Park wasn't merely condensed - it was crushed. As some earlier reviewers have said, the best way to watch it is to forget the original book and pretend that it's a brand new story."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"While Mansfield Park is not the most appealing of the Austen novels, it deserved a better effort than this latest version. Most fans of Austen have read the original books, so we understand much of the manners, custom and dress of the times, and have certain expectations. Other reviewers have pointed out the problems, and I agree with them. I also could not get past Fanny's appearance (which was more like a bar maid than even a servant) to have any empathy for the character. I did not understand the director's decision to dress everyone else in the piece for the period and not the main character. Keeping every scene in one spot and mostly in the same room might have been cost effective but hardly does justice to the richer world that Austen was so adept at portraying. Although I own most DVD versions of other Austen productions, I know I will not want to see this again. My recommendation is to watch it on PBS or rent it before you buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes, Ms. Austen, look what they've done to Fanny this time!","review":"The sheer unadulterated awfulness of this absolutely amazes me. Fanny Price as a flirty, pouty, bosoms almost falling out, bottle blonde with bed hair and an acting style straight out of \\"Tom Jones\\" pretty much ruins the whole thing singlehandedly. The intended villainess, Mary Crawford, looks downright demure by comparison and a far more suitable match for a clergyman. Then there's the inconsistent uncle who starts out Simon Legree and ends up Father Knows Best. And the otherwise adequate and attractive actor playing Edmund who's given about 15 seconds of close-up across the family breakfast table to show, with just his face, the aha! moment when he realizes it's Fanny he loves after all. That scene alone may end up earning this movie a place in the so-bad-it's-funny pile. I don't think Jane Austen is turning in her grave; I think she's laughing herself silly at the ludicrousness of it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Under false colors","review":"This is not Jane Austen's \\"Mansfield Park\\"--it's another story altogether, from another place and time. The first, and establishing portion, of the novel has completely disappeared, the themes of the Austen book have vanished, the language is pure 21st century, and the characters, their bearing and their manners bear no resemblance to the originals--the actors just happen to be wearing Regency garb.I would have no objection to, and would in fact enjoy, watching a good melodrama decked out in 18th century costumes--just don't try to tell me that this is \\"Mansfield Park.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"I love historical period pieces --- particularly Jane Austen and Elizabeth Gaskell. I had read other reviews that this edition of Mansfield Park was not the best. But I wanted to try it anyway. Big mistake. It was such an utter failure. No hint of authentic Jane Austen to be found.

One of these days, somebody will make a great miniseries of Mansfield Park - or we can hope."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some small merit","review":"This is a rushed, abridged version missing many valuable componants...Fannie Price's family and it's influence on her character, the childhood of the leads, and clearer views of the family scandals. Ms. Piper is the Belle du Jour, but a poor fit here. There's nothing really wrong with her acting, but she's too modern looking and whoever dressed her made her look like and ill kempt farm girl. The whole time I was watching I wanted to part and comb her hair.The rest of the cast was good, especially the cast of Edmund. But this is a lightweight peice not destined to be a classic. Poor M P will once again have to wait for a better adaptation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Masterpiece Theatre disappointment","review":"I expected much better for Masterpiece Theatre. It is based only loosely on the novel and leaves out many important scenes and characters. So far the best video of this novel is put out by BBC."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I loved the 1999 film version and enjoyed Billie Piper on Doctor Who. I missed this version on PBS, so I ordered the DVD. If I had seen it on PBS, I would have never ordered the DVD. It felt like I was watching the cliffnotes version of the Mansfield. The acting was stilted. The production value was poor. The only bright spots were Blake Ritson as Edmund and Hayley Atwell as Mary Crawford."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mansfield revisited by fools.","review":"In all the English speaking world, I can't think of a young actress less suited to play Fanny Price than Billie Piper. Why do so many film directors think that Jane Austen needs to be changed for contemporary audiences? We keep buying the books and loving them as they are, so why think that we can only relate to running, bouncing, loud, flamboyant protagonists?Fanny is my and Jane Austen's favorite and I'll not soon forgive this travesty, for both our sakes."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed!","review":"I was so looking forward to a new version of Mansfield Park. Most of us were disappointed in the 1999 movie. This version turns out to be disappointing for much the same reason as the 1999 movie.1. Most of the characters in the movie don't resemble the characters in the book. Did the director ever read Mansfield Park?2. The story line has been completely changed. For instance, after refusing Mr. Crawford, Fannie doesn't go to visit her family. This is a major part of the story. Why on earth would they right this out of the plot?3. The acting seems lifeless.4. If you are fond of Jane Austen's work this version will make you mad. If you want to watch it, rent it before buying it.The original BBC production is still the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I had high hope for this series and particularly this installment as I so love the book. Thusfar each of the first three episodes suffer from the impossibility of condensing a rich period novel into 90 minutes. There is no real chemistry between Edmund and Fanny--- and since there is so little time for any real character development that is crucial to making this piece work.The concept behind the series--- creating collection of Jane Austen films-- was wonderful. But why not full blown, authentic, quality productions instead of 90 minute tv movies?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Realistic","review":"I had trouble looking at Fanny Price as a bleach-blond with dark eyebrows. Those features just don't go with the character in the book. Also, this actress looks hard when Fanny is supposed to be the picture of demure and delicate. I bought the DVD version so I could turn on the subtitles, but, even though they say they have them, subtitles are missing. Grrrrrr. I'm thinking these might be bootleg copies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Mansfield Park will never work...","review":"The beauty of Mansfield Park the novel is that Fanny is the perfect narrator - discounted by all as a 'no body', she is perfectly situated to observe and report all the events occuring around her.A movie based on someone who is a 'no body', who nothing really happens to other than some mild bullying and a lame attempt at a seduction will never work. It's my opinion that Mansfield Park as a film would only work if the character of Fanny is either \\"sexed up\\", melded with attributes of other Austen characters, or dispensed of entirely. Which of course, would not please Austen fans.So, please do not waste your time or money by purchasing this film - you would be better off by reading the actual novel, and then watching \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" or Emma Thompson's \\"Sense and Sensibility\\".P.S. Not to mention, Billie Piper's overbite is extremely distracting."},{"rating":"1","title":"hm","review":"A rather dry and lifeless retelling of one of Jane's most sexually charged novels. The screen writer managed to purge all the wit and style out of the novel, leaving the lack luster cast to strole about the screen with no real sense of tension or connection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even bother!","review":"As other reviewers have already said, this is Mansfield Park in name only. The movie cuts out so much of the story that nothing is left except to wait for Edmund to have his ah-ha moment, which fortunately doesn't take too long. Billie Piper does capture Fanny's sweetness, but the movie is so rushed that it doesn't really make much sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't waste your time","review":"This production is awful and an embarrassment. It is far from accurate and, in addition to lacking important aspects of the book, truly lacks the tone and feeling of the book. Moreover the leading actress has little to do with Fanny Price as she is and looks and acts in the novel. Austen would have been seriously displeased."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is very very badly done............","review":"I cannot beleive that this was made by Masterpice Theater,(who in my opion Love, and they have not dissapointment till now). Its a disgrace to Jane Austen and Fans everywhere as was the 1999 version, where do these people get thinking they can change a perfectly good story? I have read the book three times and dont understand why they must make a movie in \\"fast forward\\" mode. And another thing that just gets my goat is Fanny's Uncle is made to be a most horrible man , when in truth was a wonderful Uncle and Fanny was one of his favorites, He loved and repected her more than he did his wife and daughters, come on people get a clue and dont mess with good if you cant make it better or follow with what a billian Author made. I'm so sorry to make this so harsh but I just got it in today and cannot beleive i spent money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jane Austen and Masterpiece Theatre fans beware","review":"Like many Jane Austen fans I was excited at the prospect of this newer adaptation of Mansfield Park by Masterpeice Theatre. I had viewed Persuation and Northanger Abby and was pleased with these versions-although they should have been longer. However I was thoroughly disappointed with this version of Mansfield Park. Don't waste your time and money on this one.I suppose that Materpeice Theatre is allowed to produce a dud film once a season-just once please for the sake of your loyal viewers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasntly Surprised","review":"I had just recently finished reading Manfield Park, by the great Jane Austen, when I started to look for film adaptions of it. When I came across this one, I read all the reviews (most of which were poor) and quickly went the other way. I first watched the 1999 version, it having better reviews, and I liked it quite a bit (aside from thinking \\"Where is William?\\"). But, still curious, I came back to this version, having always liked the adaptions this group put out, and was astounded that it could recieve such bad reviews. I loved it. Some things are missing, if you are considering the book to be the supposed script. But, I thought it flowed very well even with those pieces missing. If you enjoy the book, you will most likely enjoy this movie. It is not word for word in line with the book, but there are many key quotes that make their way onto this film adaption of Mansfield Park. I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad acting by everyone!","review":"I bought this movie in a pack of 3 so unfortunately can't even give it away as I definately would. What a waste of money this movie was. I fast forward most of it so can't really tell you everything but only that Billie Piper was so poor a choice for an actress. She dyed her hair blonde for the movie but unfortunately she has a deep undergrowth coming through. Umm, not sure if she knew that girls didn't really dye their hair in that era and that I am sure she would've been able to afford it even if they did. Without watching her hair roots everytime she was on camera, she and the rest of the cast gave off such a poor performance that you didn't care what happened. They must of had a small budget as the movie never leaves the estate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fanny? Where is Fanny?","review":"I read this book for the first time just before I saw the movie, so I mourned them ignoring the heroine Jane Austen wrote, and creating their own. The book made me cry for poor little Fanny, the movie made me violent toward bounding big \\"Fanny.\\"I have tried to re-watch this movie many times, pretending Billy Piper is playing a different role than Fanny Price, but I cannot without grinding my teeth. Her hair, Louisa! Her dress! Three inches deep in the bust, I'm sure of it!Also I did not read Edmund as being this spineless and ... insipid. I watch him in this and want to yell, \\"Stop being such a wimp!\\" I like him much better in the previous version (though not a version I like either).This movie is Snoresville and too many liberties with history and Jane's wonderful work were taken for it to be good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"Austen, of course it has to be a classic.

It had been a long time since I had read the book, so was really excited to get this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"They Should Have Read the Book...","review":"If the directors had actually read the book and not just copied word for word the script of the other movie - it might have been a good and different adaption. The acting in this movie was also very poor. I would stick with the 1900s version."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking?","review":"Why Billie Piper? There are so many gifted actresses who would have made this role believable. Blake Ritson is new to me, but I really enjoyed him as Edmund. But how to get past the glaring miscast of Billie Piper? What were they thinking?I own and enjoy the version from the 1980's starring someone with the improbable name of Sylvestra LaTouzel. She's just right, in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad cinematography","review":"Like so many have said before, I bought this movie sight unseen with high expectations of finally having a good version of Mansfield Park, but instead was horribly disappointed. I won't go into the bad hair or missing scenes, because that's all been covered, however I will mention the bad camera work. It had to of been hand held, it jumped all over, why on earth didn't they use a steadycam? It made the film look bad! When it was steady, the shots were done so awkwardly; the angles were wrong and close ups were used when it would have been better to have a wider angle. I noticed the camera work was practically the same with Persuasion. I don't know what Masterpiece Theatre was thinking, I know they can do better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mansfield Park","review":"I am a big Jane Austin fan.

Although it's well done, it's too far from the novel and if I would've read the novel first, I wouldn't have bought it. It's a feel good movie, but it isn't Austen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho - Hum!","review":"This was the most boring production of a Jane Austen novel that I have ever watched. There is no real action throughout. You never get a real sense of who the characters are and why they act as they do. Fanny Price barely says a word for the first half of the movie. The scenery is gorgeous but other than that, I can not say anything positive about this movie. If you want a good movie version of Mansfield Park, get the 1999 version. It is more in depth and true to the Austen novel and the acting is vastly superior."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh and talented execution","review":"I listen part of this disk on Juan Gabriel's Web site and I liked very much.

I don't doubt there's a great book to be written on media bias & politics, and I thought that's what I was buying here. But it's just standard Clinton-bashing, with selective research and shoddy leaden prose as well. I'd love to see a companion volume by the same crew on the 2000 election, and compare their reporting.

Even if they do support the game, sometimes the support is sub-standard. For example, for Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers, they don't have the infinite health cheat. I mean, why would anyone bother to use a game enhancer if there is no infinite health? There is actually a much better game enhancer called CodeBreaker, which supports pretty much every game out there. But GameShark decided to sue CodeBreaker, and now it's no longer for sale. I guess that's the reward you get for making a superior product these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!","review":"DO NOT buy any type of gameshark! I will tell you what happaned to it.

I brought this in december, now it's like a useless piece of garbage! Why can't I upgrade this or something?! Well one things for sure, I'm not spending another 40 bux for another gameshark, just to play my new games. I'd rather beat it on my own. If you don't have a gameshark, and need one, get version3, but then they'll screw you over in the future when version 4 comes out. Interact is just too greedy for their own good.

Once you're in, it's anyones guess as to how stable the software is. Be prepared to be entering the zillionth code and have it crash on you.Also, it doesn't always work. So also be prepared to finally finish entering the last code out of 100 of them. You put in your game and press X to play and the game doesn't start. Yes, one of the codes you just entered is causing the game to freeze. Now you have to try and find out which code is freezing it out of 100.

The nitrous is fun to use during the already fast gameplay. You compete against a little less than two dozen racers in this game and it's very fast and you always have competition against another racer who acts like a second player via split-screen. You race through numerous cities and countries to earn your way to the top as it is with any other racer. This game is a lot of fun, both single player or multiplayer and should really not be missed by any SNES fan despite grudges against Kemco for future disastrous titles that followed.

There were a lot of things that I'm sure young girls, whether they're Latino or not, can relate to. The only thing with this book was how it went back in time. I'm not sure why the author chose to do the most recent first and then the days of them as children last. I thought it should have went the other way, but oh well. Some parts of the book went a bit slow but it didn't last long. I liked the whole plot line, how it didn't go \\"oh, my life sucks\\" the way a lot of books for teenage girls do.

While being quite entertaining, it also gave an excellent insight to traditional life in the Dominican Republic. The novel thoroughly delves into the controversial matter of being raised an extremely patriarchal society, adjusting to a more liberal one later in life, and difficulties one encounters when returning to his or her homeland. The reverse chronology the author used was primarily a bit hard to grasp, but became more natural as it progressed. When one usually reads a novel, he or she is always waiting to turn to the next page to see what will happen next, but here, the urge comes from the stylistic writing and intriguing character development. Overall, this novel is a fascinating analysis of what modern-day immigrants experience upon transplanting themselves to a new place and culture. Julia Alvarez has done a wonderful job with this educational yet delightfully fun piece of literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required reading for writers","review":"Anyone aspiring to be a writer should read this book.

And when the door shuts behind you, all you can say is \\"IS THAT IT?\\" The author never really develops the characters and what could have potentially been a wonderful plot is just a series of brief glimpses into the Garcia family at different stages of their lives.

I found the reverse-chronology to be very creative and effective.

The story was hard to follow because of it's dullness and lack of substance. An easy read, sounding as though it was written by Yolanda herself (a 4th grader).

The father has gotten into some trouble with the government and the family needs to leave. After a long process, they move to New York, where the girls face different bumps in the road by being different.The author tended to be random, saying things about a girl who was an anorexic monkey, but talking about one of the girls.We would not recommend this book to anyone.

We don't learn anything really about the other sisters, and if we do its a paragraph or two.The author can't hit our emotions with the other characters and the ideas seem a bit contrived and unorganized.

I like to read cultural or time-period novels, I like to read of others' experiences and backgrounds, however- for me, I just didn't care about these people. Maybe I am naive, but these are lifestyles for which I had no appreciation (maybe I lack understanding). I wanted more of a description of life and culture, not poor choices, poor language and poor examples. I tried to plug along, but I will find another Alvarez to read.I hate to think this would be on anyone's high school reading list. This is not for teenager's consumption."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very etertaining","review":"I was very impressed with this book. It is about the 4 de la Torre girls who talk about their experiences with their family and the United States. The gilrs were sent to the United States for school and there they had to deal with prejudice and trying to live in in both the US culture and their home culture. The girls would spendd the school year in the States and the summer back home on the island with their cousins. Instead of starting from when the girls were younger, it starts out in the present and works it's way backward in time. At first this type of format seemed odd to me, but you read about what they are doing as adults and find out later why they turned out the way they did. During the entire book, I was engrossed in the story because Alvarez does a very excellent job of describing the family. I really enjoyed this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A LATINA WRITER WINS ONCE AGAIN!","review":"I heard much about this novel and finally settled down to see what all the reviews were about. I really enjoyed this book and was amazed, which I shouldn't have been, about the island similarities to Puerto Rico. I believe every 1st and 2nd generations from countries, their parents homeland, can easily identify with Alvarez.Latino or not. I immediately read YO! the contined story of the Garcia Girls with the main focus on Yolanda. She did an excellent job in flashbacks and working her knowledge of the Domican regime with the Domican Republic realities. The runner up would be the world through the YOUNG Garcia girls and how they learned what it was to be Domican and American. I would definately recommend this book to those who can appreciate the sacredness of our cultural knowledge. --Sandra Concepcion, Age 20"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept...lousy execution.","review":"Julia Alvarez tries so hard to make us understand the Garcia family, through the experiences of Yolanda(who is the best of the Garcias), Sofia, Sandra and Carla. She starts in the present with Yolanda or \\"Yo\\" exploring the island her family had to flee. Then the stories move back in time, and all are either too short, or spoil the mood by making you hate the characters. Alvarez does try to tell us the truth about the Domincan republic and the immigration experience, but writes a medicre series of stories instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO","review":"worst book. so confusing and boring and just plain weird....If you just want to read this for fun, DONT"},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprising disappointment","review":"I did not enjoy this book. The reverse order of chapters was confusing and unnecessary: more than once, the author mentions an event and then tells the entire story many chapters later. It was hard to keep track, and distracted from the story as a whole. My biggest gripe is that I didn't care for the sisters that much, I could barely tell them apart! They sounded the same, and I simply didn't get drawn into their lives and heads the way I hoped I would. The political events were interesting, and the social order in the Dominican Republic was a surprise to me, so I did learn something. However, the novel didn't flow for me and didn't hold my interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Slow","review":"This book was one that I chose from a list for my Soc 101 class. Had I read the reviews that said that the book was slow and that the characters were disconnected, I would never had read the book. This book is very hard to analyze because it doesn't move anywhere, and is often confusing due to changing time, character, and language. Although I know that the book is obviously going to use Spanish, this was a bad example of how to use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does it get any better","review":"I am 1/3 of the way through this book and I am stalled -- I have read 2 other books since starting this work. It just isn't a rewarding experience for me. There is no driving beat in the book to drive me on."},{"rating":"2","title":"okay","review":"The book was good but not very good. It had many flaws. It lost me somewhere in the middle. I kept confusing the sisters."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Never Gets Old","review":"I read this book a few years ago in high school and it was assigned again in a college anthropology class. It's a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why should you care how the Garcia girls lost their accents?","review":"If you like reading books that tell a story, have a main point and come to a perfect, nice, neat ending then you shouldn't read this book. This book contains a bunch of stories about a family and their struggles and how they deal. It brings up many issues that make it interesting to read but it has no plot. Just as a family there is no beginning or end and there for when you write a book on a family there is no beginning and no end, you can talk about family members before you but that's it. And just as this book had no plot but only stories, families have no plot and have memories and each other to stay close to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Novel producing negative cultural stigma on Latinos.","review":"Since this book is categorized as a multicultural novel, it is included on required reading lists for high school children in numerous school systems, including Philadelphia. Although this novel won critical acclaim, the book is brimming with graphic, profane language describing illicit sexual encounters, drug use, child molestation, and many negative social promiscuity's. The plot is weak and only seems to thread through the smut. A poor example of exemplar prose. Alvarez describes situations in the Latino community that place a negative cultural stigma on Latinos. Totally undermining to parental influence, it is a far cry from the excellence of \\"Joy Luck Club,\\" and \\"Angela's Ashes.\\" School Districts need to reevaluate required selections with an eye toward classic literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy-to-read, but not as good as \\"Butterflies\\"","review":"After happening upon \\"In the Time of the Butterflies\\", I was delighted to find another Latin author who could mesmerize me as Gabriel Garcia Marquez had continued to do over the past 25 years. But after finally pulling this book off my shelf, I soon learned it could not hold a candle to \\"Butterflies\\" in its character development and story thread. I found the characters all blurred together and failed to distinguish themselves from one another and although the backward development of the story was unique, it was a bit confusing if I put the book down with more than a few days in between. All-in-all, I enjoyed this book, but encourage readers to continue on with \\"Butterflies\\" for a real treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's worth your time","review":"I read, \\"How the Garcia Girls lost their accents\\" for my \\" Women of Latin America\\" class. This book was very interesting. This book is nothing like anything that I have read before, but I was still able to gain something from reading it. This is a wonderful story of how the Garcia de la Torre girls acclimate themselves to a new way of life when they are abruptly uprooted from their home. The United States and its culture are difficult for the girls to understand. The book takes us in to their lives and tells of the trials and tribulations of starting over. The best thing about this book is how the author is able to write the girls so accurately. I have two sisters, and I felt as if the things that the Garcia girls did were things that I can remember, or picture my sisters and I doing. The book is very easy reading and it is worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor little rich girls. .. .","review":"I found this book to be well enough written but the story was so-o-o whiny. Somehow I had trouble empathizing with these poor little rich girls who have to move away from their fancy lives but soon enough spend summers back on the island, go to New England boarding schools and live well again, albeit with fewer servants."},{"rating":"1","title":"How the Garcia Girls Lost Their Accents","review":"I did not care for this book at all. To me it was boring at best. It was a book club selection, and not one of their best to say the least."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Garcia Girls","review":"This book was very well written. It was neat to experience Alvarez's interesting writing style. She wrote the book by starting in the 1980's and then it ended in 1956. As Alvarez begins the story it starts out at the island that they grew up on, the Dominican Rebublic. Then in the middle of the story the family abruptly leaves and flees to the United States were the story continues. There the family had to change there entire life style as they were thrown into New Yorks' \\"American Mainstream\\". The main characters of these fifteen short stories are the father Carlos, the mother Laura and their four children, Carla, Yolanda, Sandra and Sofia. The story was based around the years of their childhood into adult hood. This book of short stories was very entertaining and one could easily relate to each of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Assimilation in America","review":"I found Julia Alvarez's book to be a perfect example of the struggle between whether or not to assimilate. By showing the hardships the Garcia girls go through in their new life in the United States, she shows how adopting a new language and starting a new life in a different culture can leave one afraid to resort to their old past and home language in order to be able to survive in a new life. Through each girl's memory, a new problem is presented,leaving the reader overwhelmed at all the complications moving to a new society can bring. I highly recommend this book to anyone who holds their heritage dear and to anyone who has moved to the United States to start their life anew."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was dissapointed","review":"I devoted myself to this book, beginning to end. However, when it came to the end, i said \\"that's it?\\" I expected much more from the book. I think that Alvarez is a talented writer, for she did a great job with illustrating each one of the stories. I was on the edge of my seat just waiting for the climax. I feel, however, that there was no climax. Each story had it's rising moments, but there was no climax. You're left wondering what happened and by the end you feel as if you went nowhere. It was a little hard to follow who the speaker was throughout the novel yet it kept me attatched. I just feel that there should have been more resolvement or more understanding of what happened with the Garcia family. Or, at least, each character's stories should have tied together somehow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks great but...","review":"This combination of two backpacks that can be attached together sounds and looks great, but just doesn't make much sense. Zipped together they are far too bulky and heavy to be used as a single backback and so must be wheeled, but it will be too front heavy to stay upright on it's own. If one were to separate the two backpacks to use the smaller as a daypack, you'll see that it's too small to do you much good unless you're just going to carry a book and a sandwich- I was not able to fit a light sweater into it. I only used this for one trip, and now I just take a nice rolling carry- on and a backpack. I have a lot more room that way."},{"rating":"2","title":"So awesome","review":"This has to be one of my favorite purchases ever. Very high quality, looks great and very authentic. I love it so much. It's a great deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bergman Is Superb in Saratoga Trunk","review":"I would rate this film high on my list of Ingrid Bergman films. Ingrid's beauty aside, her talent is evident in scene afer scene. She was sad, mean, witty, snobbish, flirtatious, delightfully funny, loving, tender, sorrowful, distressed, happy, etc. You name it, she was all those things and more. -And so convincing. She made her character come alive! What an actress! The electricity in this film between Gary Cooper and Ingrid Bergman is evident in every scene they are together. I have watched Saratoga Trunk many times. Each time I have come away with the feeling of deep satisfaction and enjoyment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"This, in my opinion, is a wonderful movie. Ingrid Bergman is glorious and simply ravishing and Gary Cooper as handsome as ever. A must see in my book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saratoga Trunk","review":"I love this movie! Both Gary Cooper and Ingrid Bergman are superb! I hope it will soon be released as a DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ONLY Gary Cooper movie I've ever liked","review":"Miscast? Hardly (in my opinion). This movie was a favorite of mine on the local stations' after school or latenight slots (in those ancient days before cable) and I waited years for it to be released in video. I can't imagine anyone being a fan of both Bergman AND Gary Cooper, but Bergman fans shouldn't let Cooper's presence be a deterrent . . . he's actually kinda attractive in this. Ingrid is, of course, stunning. But why doesn't anyone mention the fact that she plays one of Ferber's favorite archetypes: the light-skinned Black woman seeking to avenge her mother's mistreatment? She's quite believable in the role and the relationship between her and her maid/companion sets this apart from a lot of other films where Black actors are cast only as servants."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unusual but worthwhile","review":"For the spare production values(WWII- 1945) the acting is OK considering that the 2 leads where having a long term affair at the time the movie was made make it an OK comedy. Not a drama definately. Cooper & Bergman get to act more naturally as themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Junk","review":"Absolute Junk!!!

I like horror movies but I would have to say that this is more like horror comedy than fetish or horror. I laughed my head off!! Some of the acting was so terrible I couldn't hold back but I think that they must have planned it that way because the script was pretty campy. Debbie Rochon was really great as always, she is beautiful and can act. Persephone can act too and she has some great outfits. There were alot of cliches in this one but hey, it's low budge! Good fun but one word of advice to Mr. Creepo...dude stay out of the camera's way and find someone who can shoot! Your face is beyond Creepy so stay out of the lense's path!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fake, inaccurate, and just really weird.","review":"This is FAR from the documentary I expected. They actually used adult actors to play the roles of all the children! Whose idea was that?Also, I don't remember any of the bondage stuff from the evening news. It's all too clear that this is a sad attempt to profit from a recent tragedy, but this is exactly what happens when you release something too soon after an event happens: you produce a shoddy work loaded with inaccuracies. Maybe next time, Mr. Beckley will wait more than negative three-thousand two-hundred thirty six (-3,236) days after an event to release a film chronicling it for the history books...or at least take the time needed to get their prescient facts straight.

There are sometimes random periods of time where all connections on it turn on and off for hours at a time making it quite impossible to use. Also it tends to lose connections alot when transfering large files between computers and/or are trying to upload or download large files to and from the web.

It was like a cross between Neal Stephenson's Cryptonomicon and William Gibson's Pattern Recognition. But I was totally deflated by the ending, and shocked that it didn't go where I was expecting (instead it went nowhere).I thought that when that when Alice got on the sailing boat with her new friends, they would reveal that they were really the evil treasure hunters, and that the whole NoCo thing was an elaborate ruse. They would then force her to hand over the code on her necklace. After that, well, I don't always need a happy ending, but I guess her father could show up and rescue her and then they'd find the treasure together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Story seemed to stray, but definitely a good book overall","review":"Popco is definitely not like a lot of the fiction books coming out today, and it was quite a refreshing change, especially when many women authors are writing sappy, feel-good stories or brainless chick lit. This was definitely more thoughtful and intellectual, though some of the code and math and video game details got a bit overwhelming.I do agree with some of the other reviewers who said that the book sort of fell away at the end. I kept thinking that the story was building up to something more sinister, but then it took a sharp turn and ended up in something I wasn't entirely expecting. Although I did appreciate seeing the anti-corporate themes, I felt like this part of the book wasn't as strong as the build-up to it.Overall, I'd say that Popco is definitely worth a read for anyone wanting something with more thought and intellect to it, but be prepared for a bit of nerdiness in parts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Popco was our book club selection","review":"It came highly recommended by one of our members and I just loved it.

This book is an anti-corporate diatribe disguised as a novel, which makes it almost as dishonest as the corporations it castigates. Perhaps she was striving for social commentary, but all she manages to do is preach, on and on. Ms. Thomas totally loses what begins as a promising story to an obsession with PETA-style anti-globalism. 2/3 of the way through, it bogs down into a tedious rant from which even sympathy for the issues does not save it. Worse yet, after hundreds of pages of proselytizing, the reader is offered as 'solutions' things like 'pour Coke on your keyboard'. Oh Please. Apparently, these characters are too busy being 'outsiders' to try logical routes such as 'government' for their causes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever but somewhat disappointing","review":"This book is an amalgam of many many stories: a young girl's growing up following abandonement by her father (and living with grandparents); growing up as an adoclescent and dealing with problems of fitting in or not fitting in and what that all means; interpersonal relationships as a twenty-something; the creative approach to problem-solving for a toy company; a \\"down with corporations\\" group of guerrillas; codes; mathematical theory; homeopathic medicine; have I left anything out?And, some of these are more successful than others. For instance, the young girl/adolescent passages are very well written and moving and heartfelt. But, the math seems to be ladled on for reasons that stop the story cold, although I did like the dissertations. But I felt that I had to re-start the story at the end.It's a fine book, one that I truly enjoyed. But, the parts don't really add up and the end of the book comes with a whimper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Engaging","review":"Unfortunately, this book was so poor that I chose not finish. I did not find the main character, Alice, likeable at all. The author went on and on about Alice's unusual habits, how she chose to dress out of style and didn't want to be part of any group or have any friends. It seemed like she was trying to hard to be different. But then she goes and has sex with a guy without even speaking to him first!In addition to the plot, there were pages and pages of math and information on breaking codes. Some was interesting, especially the part about creative thinking methods, but the rest was just monotonous.

This book has caused me to back up and view much longer cycles as known and recorded in ancient times in Egypt and India. Just as we measure our year by the orbiting of our planet around our sun, and the zodiacal year by the precession, the ancients measured the orbit of our solar system around the galaxy's central sun and even the galaxy's rotation around the great center of the universe. They even measured the fantastically long cycles of the creation, expansion and dissolution of creation in the greatest cycle of all.

However, unfortunately, you find in many cases that the author says \\"this is difficult to measure\\" or \\"this is one of the most difficult to measure\\". This book is a bit less useful than I expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Keeping Score\\" Right On Target","review":"I ordered Mark Graham Brown's \\"Keeping Score\\" just as I got involved with a Balanced Scorecard implementation. As we worked through the process of designing our internal scorecard I found this slim volume (<200 pages) an invaluable aid. From the introduction through to the last chapter, I found this book full of practical ideas and advice. For instance, one of my personal pet peeves is the short shrift most larger companies give to the value of their people. In chapter 10: \\"Measuring Employee Satisfaction\\", Mr. Brown addresses topics such as the short-sightedness of improving profits through downsizing and how a balanced scorecard can help underline this mistake. He ends the book with a practical 10 item list \\"The Key To Successful Plans\\". After all the theory, I was glad to have a roadmap handy. I'd recommend this book to anybody who is contemplating a new scorecard, or rehabbing an existing one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Solid and Detailed Performance Measurement Guide","review":"The author makes a number of important points in this book. There is an emphasis on the few key measures that matter, linked to strategy and stakeholder needs. As to their characteristics, he recommends metrics that provide a view of the past, present and future. While it is relatively easy to develop metrics with a focus on the past or present, developing future oriented metrics is a little more difficult. Unfortunately no generally applicable guideline seems to exist.One very good aspect of \\"Keeping Score\\" is the presence of summaries at the end of each of the chapters of part 2, telling you how successful organisations measure performance in the areas of finance, quality, suppliers, customer satisfaction, processes/operations and employee satisfaction. Whether or not you currently have a system in place, you're likely to find more than a few useful ideas here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Waste of Money","review":"My 5 year old recieved this for her birthday and it does not even work.

I even double-checked the order and packing slip - they just shipped wrong item. I'd be OK with that, but when I contacted them about fixing *their* error, they wanted me to ship the product back to them at *my* cost. I had just had a baby (which is why I was buying shampoo online to begin with), so loading a newborn in the car and going down to my post office so I could ship the wrong bottle back to them just wasn't going to happen. I ended up keeping the conditioner, and buying shampoo from a different merchant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't lather well and left hair feeling dry.","review":"I feel like I need to use a lot of this product to get it to lather even a little bit.

It is not the same Bumble & Bumble you buy in a salon. It's watered down, dries your hair and you have to use twice as much as the original just to get some lather.

When I received the product, I used it right away, but everyday I keep thinking about how it isn't the same product I've been using for years. It's diluted and watery. Usually the product lasts me MONTHS, this time it is almost done within a month. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bumble & Bumble Creme de Coco Shampoo Diluted?","review":"Although I purchased this shampoo in June, I just started using this particular bottle. I have been using Bumble and Bumble shampoo for years and have always been pleased with it, however this latest bottle seems to be diluted. It takes much more than normal to get a lather. Either the company has changed the product or the seller has done something to it. I read one other review from a buyer who had the same complaint. Has nobody else noticed anything different?Update: I wrote both Amazon and the seller about this problem. Amazon is refunding me. The seller admitted to getting a bad batch of the product. Why they continued to sell it, I don't know. Contact Amazon if you received this defective product."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING: Not authentic product","review":"I've used this product for over four years and it's a fabulous product. BUT!! this vendor either is intentionally selling imposter products or doesn't realize it. I ordered the shampoo and conditioner and knew immediately something was off. After going back and reading the reviews I realized I wasn't the only one who thought this. I got a refund and went to a salon that sold Bumble and Bumble products and purchased the shampoo and conditioner there. When I went home I compared the one that I bought through Amazon's vendor and the one from the salon. FAKE! The bottle's design was slightly but when compared obviously different and the wording was even in a different language, the smell was different and even the consistency and color. Awhile back my hairdresser warned me about this and advised me to always buy my products from a salon. I learned my lesson and I hope this review prevents you from making the same mistake.

If you like cocunuts then this product is for you. Have used bumble and bumble products in the past, this one is a bit more drying than their others but nothing that a little leave in conditioner once a week won't fix. Also a plus, a tiny bit goes a very, very long way.

Would rather but it in a store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great shampoo with visible results","review":"I was never a believer in more expensive shampoo until I treated myself to this one that my salon uses. I use it around 3 days a week (and use Pantene the other days) and EVERY time I use this product someone comments on whether I colored my hair or I get a compliment on how my hair looks. This product pulls out the natural highlights in my hair and creates a very healthy shine. I highly recommend this product and I as I said I am not one to pay more than $5.00 for shampoo prior to this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fake, or reformulated--either way, it's lousy","review":"I agree with the other reviews, the last bottle I bought from Fragrance Net was watery and smelled different--you have to use tons of it to get any lather at all, and it leaves your hair squeaky in a way my previous bottle did not. Fragrance Net may be selling a watered down, fake version, or else B&B reformulated this stuff in the worst possible way."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is FAKE DO NOT ORDER!!","review":"Wow I wish I read the reviews before ordering this. I order so much through my prime account, I thought I could trust Amazon with some Bumble and Bumble (which I've used for over 10 years). This product is not Bumble and Bumble. It turns your head into a crazy ammount of suds when you use the shampoo. Then it leaves it dry and stringy. NOT Bumble and Bumble. Bumble should take a lawsuit out on Amazon over this. Amazon, you should be ashamed!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought it was","review":"I had seen a couple of reviews where people had stated that the product received was not consistent with what they were used to. I took a chance as I also saw some positive reviews and hoped that I would be one of the latter. Upon opening the bottle, the smell was not the same. It seemed to have chemical-y smell to it that I was not used to in a B&B product. When I used it, it was thin and watery, not at all what it usually is.The bottle looked like it had some wear on it once I inspected it further, like an old bottle that had been refilled.I will never buy a product from this seller again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think the product has been watered down!!","review":"I have used Bumble and Bumble products for years, purchased from the salon. I needed more shampoo so decided to buy it on line-big mistake ! Whoever is selling this is thinning out the product and making it impossible to use unless you use half a bottle. It doesn't foam up like it should, this product should be very concentrated so a little goes a long way. For the price of this item, I will NEVER buy from Amazon via a seller (unknown) again. I'm sure Bumble and Bumble would not want their product marketed this way.

This is not the original album, from master tapes or any other sources. It's not even the short versions but, more like, shortened versions of the short versions. The CD lists the duration of each track to match the original album and, this is where the misrepresentation LIES. I've come to learn that it's a Hit or Miss proposition with Hot Productions.

At the time, it is difficult to share it with her because she is too young and not gentle to the books. These books are combination of lift-the-flap and pop-up. On each page, you lift a flap and something pops up, which is quite neat. Recently, when she turned a year old, they suddenly become her favorite books. She is eager to turn each page and find the surprise (the flap). She tries to be gentle with them too. I find that she is more interested in the books that only have one flap per page than the books that have several flaps per page at this age."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT ENTERTAINMENT FOR YOUNG AND OLD","review":"It was nice to see these old films of the Little Rascals in color.

These movies are nearly a full century old yet they are as popular as ever. The extras are great & I would like to see more of them sometime. The extras were my main reason for buying this set. The comedies were originally made in black & white & they're colorized on this set. I do feel that the originals should not have been tampered with. I do admit however that the colorizing is well done & looks good so I'm ok with it. I wonder did they try to remaster the Singing Lesson starring Alfalfa? The opening credits look very fuzzy. I was trying to read the copyright when this was released. It looks as though Alfalfa made this film right after leaving Our Gang but I'm not sure.

That's the \\"danger\\" of buying self-development books - for some (new to the ideas), a book like this might be life changing, but for folks who have read dozens of books that may each go into greater detail, the book becomes a quick scan and a bit of a disappointment. That being said, I recently read ANOTHER book that I thought consolidated much of the current research on personal change (\\"This Year, I will...\\" Ryan), and bought multiple copies to give to friends.

From the moment I started reading it, I had a hard time putting it down. I pulled so much for Terry, the protagonist, that I had to remind myself that I was reading a novel, rather than a memoir. I'd recommend this to anyone looking for insight into addiction and recovery, but the story is about so much more than that.Also, Bufford does a great job of capturing the landmarks and culture of St. Louis.

Marians guest is Dizzy Gillespie, one of the greatest Jazz Trumpet players. Whilst Dizzy's Trumpet playing was a little past its best by this time he could still belt it out when he wanted to. Listen to the lovely version of 'In A Mellow Tone' on this recording. There is no greater examination of a Jazz musicians skill then when they have to play solo or without bass and drums. On this track Dizzy still has it. However I suspect he could only play Trumpet for shorter periods of time by the date of this recording. So on five of these tracks Dizzy plays Piano at which he certainly competent, but I expected more Trumpet.Marian McPartland is the perfect host. A gifted Jazz Pianist in her own right and she gets the best out of her guests. Dizzy of course is funny, and fascinating to listen to. Telling stories about a few of the greats - Monk and Ellington to name but two.Well worth getting, just a shame there wasn't more Trumpet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep, probing analysis of modern american military history","review":"I had the pleasure of reviewing this book while still in its manuscript form.

Fun for a couple of turns but not the entire game.It is good in making the player solve problem scenarios. But playing the game gets so annoying and repetitious you often forget it's supposed to be fun.If you think you might like it, rent it first. It really isn't on the level of interesting or good games offered on xbox."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is going on with these games?","review":"The Great Escape is how you are supposed to try to stay away from being a prisoner at a jail. That is what all games are, but this game has a bad way to doing this. The graphics are bad, the controls are bad, and the game is not even fun. I stopped playing after the first 5 minutes and wanted to return it. They people at EB Games said it would be $.75 because it would be considered a trade in, no wonder. Who would buy such a game that has a replay value of 0? I am sorry for the people who created this game because they did a terrible job of doing this game.

The band is also great, it is kind of hard hearing the vocals of this singer doing Jimmy's songs. No one could sing with the soul he had, with that aside overall the DVD is well worth buying. This has a great song selection also, it is new stuff to me. I like the original Trower better, this sounds like a complete different band. But they are still an excellent band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still has that great sound as in the 70s!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Robin Trower was the first concert i went too & it just blew my mind ! I was standing rt. in front of him and had a great view of cranking out on his guitar!!!!!!!! The dvd takes me back and that was around the mid 70s I'M 48 & Robin still has it!!!

Happy Birthday Robin Trower."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Trower Lovers","review":"Robin Trower defined that rich, full overdriven modulated (Hendrix-inspired) sound of his way back in the early '70's, and he still lays it on thick. As a guitarist, i can't help but to STILL love that \\"sound\\", even after 30 years! This DVD will serve Trower up to you on a platter. Hey...i don't care if the guy looks like someone's Grand Daddy standin' up there .... we're all growing old too, right along with the stars of our youth. It's great that he can still pull this stuff off and come out sounding as fabulous as he does. (No arthritis in THOSE hands, i can tell you.) Now, if you DON'T love Trower, the show will probably get a little old after a few numbers. But if you DO love him (and that \\"Sound\\" ...), and particularly if you play, you'll thoroughly enjoy this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're a Trower fan, DO NOT MISS THIS ONE","review":"He's only gotten better as he's gotten older (and wiser). This is a pretty intimate club show in Europe (Germany?) recorded for television, but the production quality is pretty good and the audio outstanding. He's flawless, through new material and old, and the trio is tight for all but one very brief couple of measures on one tune. I've always been a huge fan of his music, but have had limited exposure to video of it. I'm even more of a fan now, having seen this. There is a pretty interesting interview segment after the show as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely Amazing","review":"Trower captured my attention in 1976 with Fool and Me from Bridge of Sighs. It is wonderful to see him at the top of his form. The sound is great and he has his tone dialed in perfectly.

This is a great DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still has magic feeling","review":"Great DVD here, I'm a fan of Robin for many years. He is looking a bit worn, but his playing is no worse from the wear. Its Bluesy Rock mist with a mastery that only he can bring to the stage. His Solo's on Too Rolling Stoned,Daydream,Day Of The Eagle and Bridge of Sighs made me weak in the knees, and made my eyes water up with days of the past. NO ONE plays the blues like Robin Trower! All fans need this DVD, any blues rock fan should check this out. He could teach some of these newer bands that play with little or no feeling how to feel your music. Don't miss it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"killer!","review":"I'd give this disc 5 stars just for \\"Bridge of Sighs\\".

This book was easy to read, especially for someone who finds biographies daunting, and interesting. It also included several pictures that highlighted the beauty of Jean Harlow wonderfully.

David Stern shows the young woman who was under her mother (Mama Jean)'s thumb but not completely down-trodden.

The authors have researched the (sorry) state of our food chain, what we as consumers can do about it, and in the end, offer a hopeful and practical approach to eating well and doing right by our planet. I can't help but think that they love luscious eating as much as I do. What really surprised and inspired me was the idea that by changing my behavior just a little bit, I could have a significant impact on the environment, farmers, and animals, while significantly increasing my access and enjoyment of great food.

I've been telling everyone in my family about the dime under the so-called free range chickens. I've always heard about all the steroid and antibiotics in our meats, but I never really understood how they got in the animals. Now I know CORN is the culprit!

Overall, the recording quality is better than on Preston, and certainly enough to capture the intense energy of the legendary band. And that's basically all you need to know - if you've already heard the songs from the studio albums (probably, if you're considering this CD now), I don't need to sing their praises to you.

It definately gets the most reply out of all the songs on the disc. On this single is the edited version of it, which simply means the tracks opening is much shorter than the albums version. Also represented are two B-sides which, in my opinion, sound as though they came off of his last album 'No More Shall we Part'. Not that thats a bad thing, as that album was one of his greatest.

It is a mix of a short Hemingway biography and a travel book. For those that want an introduction to Hemingway and like to travel, it is an enjoyable read and I highly recommend it. If you are looking for a detailed Hemingway biography or a travel book only, then I would not recommend the book.Also, some chapters are better than others. For example, the short section on Pamplona (within the chapter on Spain) is well written and entertaining. But the rest of the chapter on Spain and bullfighting is rushed and incomplete in my mind, given that bullfighting was a subject of so much of Hemingway's writings and that Hemingway's \\"Death in the Afternoon\\" was practically an English language treatise on the subject.Further, at times, the book seems to be more of an independent travel book than a \\"following in the footsteps of Hemingway\\" book.As I said, good but not great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make sure you get the right book","review":"Being a big Hemingway fan I was very excited to get this book after I first discovered it.

I sure was surprised to get a little paperback with not a single photo. I saw the book I thought I was getting for $5 in a used bookstore the other day. There is no warning that the book you get is entirely different from the one you get to see.

Anecdots about Shakespeare & Company bookshop on the Seine river bank were quite instructive about Hemingway bad temper. It was a pleasure to read Whitman's point of view about Hemingway vanity. This book is the kind of book you would love to write. It's a pilgrimage's diary. Something annoyed me, however.

I got this unit to replace the same model that had a disagreement with a fallen tree. This unit works great and for the most part is easy to use all it's functions.

A Masterpiece!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine Primer for Understanding the Problem with Our Sexual Culture","review":"The author is a doctor with a profound respect for reason and good sense. He makes cogent, non-religious arguments based on statistics and studies from the leading psychologists of the day. His arguments are based on reason and his own experience as a doctor. Through out the book, the author weaves in conversations with patients and their sexual struggles, giving a human face to the positions he takes. His advice is sober and rational, which is probably why it received acclaim from Christians, Jews, Muslims, and non-religious groups. One big point he drives home again and again is that America needed a sexual revolution, but that we just got the wrong one. For those fed up with our society's sexual health, this is an excellent book that will enable you to make non-theological arguments against the latest sexual trends and fads of our declining sexual culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"This book is very disappointing.

It is just a plastic insert that has two pegs on the bottom and snaps onto the top of the frame.

The editor took care to give more space to more influential weapons, such as the M-16, to get better information regarding the subject. However, some of the summaries I have heard before, verbatim. Not that big of a deal, but something toi think about. Excellent pictures, most I have never seen before.

If you don't have a reference for infantry weapons, get this now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated","review":"This book would have been up to date about 15 years ago. Much of the information and descriptions appear in older works, and more modern weapons are completely omitted. For example, there are no mention of the M-4 carbine, which has all but replaced the M-16A2 in US military service; the AN-94 assault rifle and Bizon SMG from Russia; the M240 machinegun (although the FN MAG does get a good article). The M-47 Dragon AT missile is in here, but no mention of the Javelin missile which has entirely replaced it. Likewise, recoilless rifles which haven't seen service anywhere but the Third World for the last 25 years get articles, but no info on many more modern systems.

Its bright, vivid VFD display won me over as I can see it clearly from across the room at any angle.The MS8050 is pretty useless for measuring capacitance less than 100nf, and the PC software that it comes with it pretty basic and plots a red line on a teal background which is about the worst color combination to see in the world.

It's very hard to see where to go, and exteremly easy to get lost (which costs you valuable time). There's no save feature, instead you have to write down passwords, which to me is a bit primitive considering most GBA games have save options. Finally, there are NO SIMPSONS VOICES!!

Heard elsewhere that adding synthetic lubricant to the few areas that came with a little lubricant applied to them also keeps the machine silent and problem free.So far so good, very minimal to no noise and I'm very happy with how the machine feels and operates.

The squeakiness had decreased a little but not much. I noticed that the eliptical had a slight wobble to it as I moved with the foot pads back and forth. I thought no problem the machine still works and I can get my work out even with the noise and slight wobble. At 3 months I tried to increase the resistance level to 14 and the whole front wheel makes a harsh grating noise and locks up. At 3 months I also noticed a consistent thumb as the front wheel would turn about while using the machine. I suspected the machine was not of good quality but today confirmed my suspicion.

It's a shame because this is otherwise a good machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"good luck so far","review":"Unit assembly was fairly straight forward. All parts were there. Had a few noises after the 1st couple of uses, just had to tighten some joints. LOVE the motion, very good workout (like the fat burner mode). Front of shoe tends to ride to the front of the foot pad (very little built-in traction). 418 seems like a solid unit and a good value at $550 (gold box purchase). I would recommend to a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Turned Out Fine So Far","review":"I read the reviews - although not many - and was worried. I later found the delivery fast and efficient. The delivery company went well out of their way to get it to us when we weren't home. The comments said it was difficult to put together (apparently if you are a child). My husband said it was the best directions he has read for a piece of equipment in a long time and had it together in less than two hours. I have been working out on it for three weeks and it works well and provides a great work out. It has good options and runs smoothly and quietly. The comments said not all the parts were there but all of ours were. I have really enjoyed it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Same problems","review":"Unfortunately I am having the same exprience as some of the other reviewers. My console does not work and turns off any setting I try to make after 4 minutes. I have called customer service 4 times and written twice to both Nautilus and Amazon. I should have gone ahead and returned it immediately, but it looks like it could be a great machine if the console worked correctly. They have told me it is the cable from the pedals that is not working correctly and that is installed at the manufactor. Then they say they have technicians everywhere, but.....in my area. Now they say there is one, but he is on vacation and will call.....very soon. Meanwhile Amazon says my 30 days are up. So I may pay a substantial amount of money for a machine that turns off every 4 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Need a little more time","review":"I have been very happy with my elliptical until just recently. My muscles haven't looked and felt like this in years. BUT, it has started to make some noises that I don't know how to fix. I tried tightening everything I could think of and now need to call the company. Until I can contact them and see what the results are, I will have to leave it at a semi happy with the product. The one thing I have liked so much is that it has been sooooo quiet. Now, we shall see if Schwinn comes through for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"OUTSTANDING VALUE","review":"The schwinn 418 was an excellent buy for the $500 range! It took me about 2 hours to assemble, but could tell that quality materials went into the bike. I had concerns I'd hit my head on the ceiling, but the motion was such that it wasn't so; plus my I knew the bike would hold up well to my 220 pounds. IT operates quite smoothly, no knee pain, and the elctronics worked right out of the box. A number of exercise profiles are available; definitely a value purchase. 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Has everything I expected based on reviews and description","review":"Great product. Did a lot of research and felt overwhelmed at times before finally deciding on the Schwinn. If you are looking for a great elliptical to work out on and does the job well, this is the one. I am so glad I did not listen to the neg. reviews about ellipticals in this price range. I was afraid that if I didn't spend $2000 on one I would regret it, not so. If you are on the fence and don't know what to do just buy it. It has been smooth, normal amount of noise which I find to be very little and feels very sturdy. Great stride length and I am 5ft.8. Can be used 5-7 days a week without any problems. I have been on gym quality machines and this does the same job. Increases your heart rate, arms move, digital programs, pulse reader, timer. I would buy it all over again. It took my husband and I 1.5 hours to put together and was easy to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is niiice?","review":"My wife and I are really happy with this machine.On the downside, the box was really heavy and it took a couple hours to put together. I had a couple washers left over at the end and had to figure out where they went based on a \\"clanking\\" sound that developed.But since we've gotten it all together we've been very satisfied with it. We use it nearly every day. It has some good pre-programmed exercises on it and allows us to store some basic User info for each of us. The interface for switching users could use some work, but it's not too bad.I'd recommend this machine. It's sturdy, has good movement, and was priced just right."},{"rating":"2","title":"solid product","review":"The whole family ordered this right after Christmas so we could all start to get in shape this year. So far, the elliptical is wonderful. It feels as sturdy as a gym machine, without the cost. The stride length is appropriate for my mother who is 5'2\\" and my brother who is 6'2\\". Additionally, the company used for free shipping was excellent. I am giving this 4 stars because while the basics are great, the computer screen came broken. Schwinn is out of stock on them, so it is taking 3 weeks to get a new one. It doesn't make or break our use of the elliptical, but it is a little annoying, and I noticed other reviewers ran into similar problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceeded my expectations","review":"This product is well made, works well, is quite, and was not difficult to put together.I have been using it for about 3-4 months now and have no complaints.I was also concerned about how steady it would be, and while not as heavy as gym models, I have found it to be very stable. It's not really an issue.Set up took about 2-3 hours, watched TV while putting it together. Tools needed are included. No hassle. Instructions are clear and straight forward.A great bargin on a great piece of exercise equipment. It rolls on its front legs/bar, so it's fairly easy to move by lifting up the back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another defective 418","review":"My 418 arrived on Tuesday this week. I assembled it reasonbly quickly, and was delighted with the smooth quiet operation. The same night, however, as I held on to the center grips, I heard a crack. I shook the center mast a bit and got another crack, and now the whole center mast just wobbles and the unit is unusable.Schwinn sent a replacement mast within 48 hours, but it was the incorrect mast. The new correct mast will not be available for a month, but I'm not certain that the mast broke, or if it was the bracket inside of the base unit that supports the mast. I just can't perceive of how the mast itself could fail.It's going to be tough in either case to dissassemble and return it, or wait a month, disassemble and repair it.In short, it's clearly a gamble if you're going to buy one of these machines. I'm skeptical of reviews that are only a few days old!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't hold up","review":"I was very happy with this machine for a short time. Then it started making a clunking noise in one of the pedals. At first I was able to make it go away by tightening screws. Now, only having had the machine for about a month, I cannot stop the thing from popping and clunking when I use it. $800 is not cheap for a rickety clunky machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Schwinn Elliptical is excellent!!","review":"I recently gave up my 8 year gym membership. I did not want to spend thousands to get one like the gym's. I bought this trainer after lots of research and reading many reviews. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this product. It was easy to put together, my husband and I did this in about 90 minutes. It is quiet and the different training levels are wonderful. The only complaint I would have is that the display is not lighted and in the early morning hours is sometimes hard to see. Otherwise, I am very happy with my purchase. This was a very good value and I would recommend it highly!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Happy","review":"I am very happy with my new elliptical trainer. The assembly was straightforward; with easy to follow directions. It is sturdy and has many features found on the health club units. For those who are considering one for the first time; keep in mind they are heavy (which is good) so you will need to find a permanent location. Overall the footprint is about 3' x 6'. This is a very quiet unit which is good if you like to work out when others might be sleeping. This is a great unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of problems","review":"1. got lost in transit, big hassle2. usually smooth but sometimes makes strange screechy/crackly noises3. feels flimsy4. i read the golden reviews too.. don't get it. just a very average system"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I bought the Schwinn 418 Elliptical trainer after my old ProForm elliptical machine broke. The Schwinn is obviously a much better product. The motion is very smooth. The machine feels stable when supporting my 220 pounds. The ProForm was very noisy and rocked back and forth.There are two reasons I did not give it five stars. It is a little squeaky (but very quiet compared to the ProForm) and the display is hard to read.The machine was a little frustrating to put together, but I can live with that. The illustrations of the washers in the directions make it difficult to tell which one is which. I eventually figured it out. Overall, for $500, this is a fantastic deal. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy","review":"I love my elliptical machine. This product is a great buy for the money. It's quiet and easy to use, big pedals so you don't feel like you might slip off. The only complaint I have is that the time for the programs is not adjustable, it's set at 30 minutes. Otherwise, I have no issues with my machine and would highly reccommend it to someone looking for one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!!!","review":"Great product. I'm glad I ignored the negative reviews and ordered the Schwinn 418 anyway. Every experience with purchasing a product on-line will be different and ours just so happened to be a very pleansant one. We received the 418 in less than a week and after taking inventory, to make sure all pieces were there, my husband and son had it assembled and ready to go in an hour and a half (and that's counting a potty break). We have been using the machine for couple of weeks now and are really enjoying our purchase. My husband and I are in our early 60s and we find that this is an excellent cardio workout, easy on the knees and hips too. All in all, an excellent workout!! Once again, Schwinn continues to live up to their reputation and Consumer Reports has helped us in making another favorable purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"very loud","review":"I purchased this trainer about 3 months back, as it is most economical elliptical trainer with good reviews. After couple of months of light usage, it is not worth it.Pros: 1) Only fully featured eliptical trainer in less then $1000.Cons: 1) Tooo noisy, the noise is increasing day by day. I don't know of any way to reduce the noise. To get an idea how noisy it is, I am unable to excersice in morning without disturbing neighbors in my apt. complex.My word of advise: Don't but it if you live in shared housing or an apartment complex."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice quality for reasonable price.","review":"I chose this machine after months of research. I managed to put the entire machine together in under two hours with only a little lifting help from my husband. The parts list was a bit confusing as they were not labeled but I laid out all parts and read the instructions before I began assembly. There is a note in the parts listing that lets you know some of the parts are already attached. The machine is incredibly quiet and gives me a great workout. I have been using a gym elliptical for two years and notice very little difference in the performace of the 418 aside from the programs and placement of the cup holders. I also appreciate that I can run the computer with batteries or the ac adapter. The only complaint that I have is the machine is not quite as easy to move around as the information led me to believe. It moves fine in a straight line but is difficult to turn. Overall, I am very happy with our purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book","review":"I found the beginning especially touching as we see the horrors of WWII through the eyes of an innocent child. The back end of the book is very moving and inspiring as Andy Grove flees Hungary, leaves his home and family, and makes his way towards America.In a time of great fear and uncertainty, this story demonstrates the will to live, the will to be free, and the potential that exists in each of us if we but dare to take risks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must be heard to be enjoyed. Up there with \\"Night\\"","review":"I picked up these audiocassettes free from a store and I don't regret it. I got it because one of my favorite pastimes is reading biographies of great entrepreneurs. I am currently taking an IT class and I listen to the tapes on my way to school. I am so inspired by hearing his story and the narrator gives the right amount of emotion to Andrew's words. It is at times funny, painful, and historical. I haven't finished it, but I plan to, so was disappointed to find out that this book doesn't really deal with the time in his life where he founded Intel. In spite of that, I rank this book up there with \\"Night\\" as an excellent memoir to tell about the tragedies of WWII for people of Jewish descent and he and his family's triumphs over adversity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perservering in great adversity","review":"I found this to be an enjoyable, easy read. In fact, my 7th grade daughter read the book and did her book report on this autobiography.

Read Swimming first and was astonished at the poor presentation of Grove's young life. Very little in it to make it compelling reading though you do feel compassion for his struggles. It's as if he took notes but forgot to fatten the paragraphs. There was not enough information for a book this size but could have made a good magazine article. The contrast in writing was amazing when I read To The Edge by Johnson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ain't nothin' like the real thing","review":"Poor remake of the Phil Spector classic (one of the greatest albums ever made).

How could you go wrong with that? These are two incredible musicians playing some beautiful pieces of music, and I can only imagine that they deliver some wonderful performances...That is, I own this CD, and although I've listened to it several times, I still can't tell what on earth they're playing because the audio quality is so terrible. It sounds as though it was recorded on someone's answering machine, then the master tape was left out on a counter under direct sunlight for a decade or two.

Don't make the same mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon, please fix this.","review":"Not really one star on a track-by-track basis, but this is not an accurate description of this album.

The UK Castle release has 26 tracks, making it a much better deal. Same front cover, very different track listing.Don't buy this CD.

All the influences are here-Diddley, Berry, Harpo and of course some originals!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Kinks","review":"This album -- their first album -- is, in my opinion, essential for any lover of 60's punk/rock and roll. The Kinks were a wonderful poprock band that had a bit more edge than The Beatles. Their music mainly consisted of slightly overdriven guitars, primitive drumming, fine adaptive bass lines, and vocals that are less confined than other bands of this era and more energetic. Yet I must warn you, this is not exclusively the \\"harder\\" material by The Kinks. While you'll get rockers like \\"All Day And All Of The Night\\", you will find that most of the songs are more melodic and even hillbilly-ish. The Kinks did a fine job at not only early hard rock/punk music, but also rockabilly and poprock music. Still, in the end, I find this album quite satisfying. Within time, there will be few songs you'll skip while jammin' out to these somehow missed 60's tunes by the band that was equally under rated, The Kinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drive won't open","review":"I have to go with the earlier reviews that this is not a very durable machine.

Worked fine for 3 weeks, then the audio output circuitry for the DVD player went south. The sound would die after playing for an hour and the only way to get it back was to shut the player off for 15 to 20 minutes. I suspect an overheating problem in the circuitry despite more than adequate clearance and airflow. VCR continues to work fine. The store (Circuit City) gets this one back today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zenith DVD/VCR Combo","review":"I bought this unit for a child's room. Having both DVD's and VHS's this is the perfect solution. It is very easy to use and set-up. I don't use the remote much because we just pop in a DVD or tape and enjoy, which makes it easy for the kids to do themselves. I did not give this a 5-star because you are suppose to be able to record DVD's over to the VCR. I thought this would be really handy because I have a VCR in my vehicle and it would have been nice to record the DVD's over to VHS for that reason. Everything is copyright protected so that is not possible. So the \\"copy\\" button is pretty much worthless. This isn't Zenith's fault, but it shouldn't be considered a selling feature either. I'm not using this unit for anything special, but if you're looking for a combo player that's easy to use, this is it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only lasted 1 year","review":"This was my first DVD purchase and I thought it was a good buy initially, considering it combines a DVD and VCR in one product. However, I am disappointed to report that at exactly 1 year the display began flickering and jumping around like crazy. The remote no longer works and the display is unreadable. The record timer for the VCR doesn't work anymore either. When I contacted Zenith with my problems, they told me it would cost $45 plus shipping just for them to diagnose the problem. Then, they would let me know how much the parts/labor would cost to repair it. I told them that was not acceptable but they were totally inflexible. There is no reason why an electronics item like this should fail after only 1 year. I'm not sure why they call it \\"customer service\\". This customer will not buy anything with the Zenith name on it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"My player lasted only 6 months and was used very little.

Tananbaum was deputy chief counsel to the late-'70s House Select Committee on Assassinations. He has Karp play a similar role in this fictional account.Perhaps when the book was originally published the material was fresher and less 'conspiracy theory' rehash. Tanenbaum was certainly close enough to the subsequent investigation to bring real insight but thirty plus years later we have heard it all and it reads as second hand retread of every theory ever put forth.The book is disjointed - Karp runs down blind alleys and into all the roadblocks the original quasi-investigation had problems with as well. Marlene seems out of her element and the entire book dovetails too conveniently.Dinner and drinks with Tanenbaum while he gave you his real opinion on what happened, who did it and why would be priceless - the book is a pale imitation at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come on, get serious","review":"This may not be the most disorganized potboiler I've ever read but it's certainly in the running for that distinction.

Evidently Tannenbaum wrote this book to express his displeasure with the Warren report, but it does nothing to discredit Warren's report or to suggest an alternative.

My expectation of Lego is fun first!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sluggish, something wrong, NO customer support.","review":"My son was so anxious to get this new release I couldn't keep him in place. And yet I've never seen him so dissapointed.My computer is a power-house that way exceeds the game's minimum requirements. Yet it's slow, sluggish, low frame-rate, no details, nothing. My boy gets impatient and turns the game off after a few minutes.I expressed my concern to Lego, but in a form e-mail simply replied that it not tested on Windows XP. Some nerve they have. The OS is out, and Lego isn't aware of it? Just to be sure, I checked with my video-card manufacturer (ATI Radeon) and their support service was just as useless.Caveat Emptor!!! Buyer beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good game, but needs a high performance computer.","review":"Like Lego Island 2, this game requires a high performance computer. Although it requires 16M graphics card, I was able to run it with only 8M.Over all, it's still a good game, but it's not as good as the first Lego Racers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad install","review":"My whole family loves Lego Racers 1, and we couldn't wait to install Lego Racers 2.The problem was that it appeared to install OK, but wouldn't run. What's worse, it hosed up EVERY other game and graphics-intensive program on my system. Uninstalling Lego Racers 2 didn't help, and I never did get my system running again. I ended up having to re-load my whole system from scratch and restore from backups.I've never had *anything* mess up my system this bad before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Sequel","review":"My 6 & 3 year old sons loved the original. They actively dislike LR2 & I agree with them. What happened to the jaunty music and simple, eye-catching design of the original?The sequel is a poorly designed, badly implemented mess with cheap & nasty production values. It looks and feels like one of the crummier download games at real.com.Whatever inspired LEGO to trash their good name with this rip-off?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good game, but not as good as Lego Racer 1","review":"While this is a fun game, it is not as much fun as the first game. The races are more challenging, and that can be either good or bad. My younger children found this game too hard to play and they went back to the LR1. There are not as many options for building cars. Perhaps the biggest drawback is that you cannot save multiple games. Only one person can have a saved game. (You can get around this by having different people log on to Windows XP using different accounts.) Having said this, it is very fun to play. Some improvements over LR1 include the option to explore different worlds. This aspect of the game is very amenable to younger players."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK","review":"Oh, that sounds harsh, & that's not what I mean.I've just had a chance to review this book, & I already own Williams's \\"Publishing Your Own Magazine, Guidebook, or Weekly Newspaper,\\" & I feel that the latter is far-&-away the better book, not to mention cheaper. Call it a prejudice, but I really feel you'd be better served by reading the other one, despite its quirks -- Williams can get a little scattered at times, but he speaks from personal experience, & I've found him not only inspiring but informative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intelligent page-turner","review":"An intriguing twist on standard whodunits with a rich stew of Holywood-in-Manhattan characters. The whole thing is a little gaudier than reality, but intelligent and well-written enough to enjoy it. The main character, Uncle Chubby, is from the first page intriguing; the first-person author, a literate foil to the television excesses. The characters are thoroughly interesting, and the writing is sharp and full of the right kind of detail. And the whole thing moves along. Great entertainment, while occasionally provoking a thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good for food crazed cats","review":"Automatic Cat Feeder-CSF-3 Super FeederThe above linked feeder is the way to go for cats that are OCD about food. This feeder is easily broken into (knocked off of the cabinet) and hard to set the time for, especially if you have more than one cat.I bought mine at a garage sale for $5, and for that price, it was a good deal. I wouldn't buy it again though as my very food aggressive cat knows how to break into it or thump it just so with her paw that the lid opens up the next serving.All that said - if your cat is only a grazer and doesn't much care about dinner, this would work OK probably."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of money","review":"I paid $11 to receive a completely defective item. I tested it for two days and not once did the cover move to reveal the clean feeding area. To return it, I had to pay another $15. Am I upset? You bet. What a complete waste of money.

VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea that doesn't work very well","review":"I used a dry food feeder for my cat for several years, but now he is older and for health reasons has to eat wet food. I've tried to use this feeder several times now, following the directions exactly, and it seems to skip meals for some reason. The timer device is really hard to figure out, not at all like the electronic one on the dry food feeder. I don't understand why the manufacturer doesn't use an easier interface for this feeder.

It is impossible to program. I tried for days with no luck. My wife took over and finally got it to work at the right times but the thing is falling apart. Pieces coming off particularly the plastic cover over the timer. Plus my cat can open the compartments to feed herself, so the thing is useless. I am trying to find a replacement auto feeder right now online.Just steer clear of this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUY THIS IF YOU WANT YOUR CAT TO DIE","review":"I bought this piece of crap online and it malfunctioned. After I had used it a few times,I was gone for gone 4 days-and it NEVER OPENED. My cat was so hungry she ate a plastic plant in my house and puked for 10 days-the plastic was coming up each time she threw up. However, less of it started appearing in her vomit so we took her into the doctor. $1750 later-blood work, xrays, surgery (had her stomach cut open), she's fine. I've written the company letters with copies of my bills and they tell me to return cat feeder to them WITH MY RECEIPT and get my money back for the feeder. Give me a break. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS PIECE OF CRAP! I hate to think what would've happened if I had been gone longer, if I had an older cat (she's only 2), or if my kitty had complications during the surgery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have had one of these for over 15 years","review":"Frankly, I've had my Cat Mate C50 for so long, it might have been more that 15 years. It has worked fine all that time. Yes, lately the battery has been a little loose, and it will fall out if someone walks by and kicks the feeder. Otherwise, I've had not problems with my Cat Mate at all. I was back on Amazon checking prices, because I figured it was time to buy a new one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery falls out","review":"The title pretty much says it. There's nothing keeping the battery in. I've never seen anything like it. I came home the cat had been starving for 2 days because he had pushed the feeder and the battery just fell out. As far as the rest, it's hard to read where the number \\"Zero\\" is at to put the first food in because they designed it to look gray over a gray background. Also, confusing to use, but after using a couple times was ok with it. But 1 star because of the battery thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good for Smart Cats","review":"Really liked this product at first. The directions are horrible, but once you figure it out, it is actually quite easy to set up. It worked perfectly for about 6-7 months for when I was out of town. Then, my cat figured out how to get the lid off and help herself. It only takes her a couple of minutes to pop the top off of it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"A handy tool for regular meals","review":"I have been using my Cate Mate for 7 years now, and it has been a godsend. I use it as a way of making sure my cat is fed at his regular mealtimes when I am only going to be gone 24 hours or less. When I'm going to be gone longer, I have a neighbor check in once a day, to be sure the cat (not just the feeder) is OK.As one reviewer noted, my cat managed to knock out the battery once trying to get at his food. (Cate Mate take note, it would be a good thing to redesign battery placement.) A small piece of duct tape took care of that little problem. Other than that, I've been very pleased with the Cate Mate."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful product","review":"I read the other reviews of this product and totally agree. This product is very poor. My cats have gone unfed for a couple of days. Luckily I also use a gravity feeder just in case. It's too bad because there is great need for a product like this that actually works!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly designed automatic cat feeder","review":"This product is poorly designed. I've had multiple instances where my poor cat was not feed when I was out or was feed the entire amount at one time. The battery is on the bottom of the unit and the cat has knocked it out trying to get to her food and went for two days without being feed! The plastic cap also comes off easily and the cat can advance the dial and get feed all at one time. The last straw was when the cat opened the plastic cap and broke the timing mechanism and didn't feed for 40 hours! I threw this unit in the trash last night. It's just not reliable!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"c50 DOES NOT LAST FOR 96 HOURS!!!","review":"Please note the ice packs no longer uses the thicker fluid to freeze (after two meals my cat was unable to eat the third and got sick).Upon contacting the company regarding this item I was advised most people don't use it for this length of time.I asked that they do something about their marketing as many people will presume their pets are safe using this item and they're obviously not. I will update if/when I hear further."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for a while, but...","review":"I purchased this automatic feeder a little more than a year ago to provide precise portion control for our two cats and help them lose weight, and also so they would stop bothering me for food all day (I work from home). It took a long time to get the knack of this; I had to write down the steps on a post-it and refer to that for about a week before I got the hang of setting it up every day. Needless to say, if we went away for more than a day, we didn't even bother to try to explain it to our pet sitter, and instead have her come 2x per day, which defeats part of the purpose of having the device. Finally, after about a year, we noticed that one of our cats had gotten quite svelte, but the other had not. After some observation we realized that the larger cat had figured out how to defeat the device and was eating portions that were supposed to be for later in the day. I'm still not sure how he did it, but I've finally given up and am looking for an alternative feeder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for long weekends!","review":"I've been using this feeder for about 18 months and love it, its perfect for long weekend trips. I have two food-obsessed felines who managed to break into all the other feeders I bought, but with the C50, they just paw and wait. I have no idea how someone cant figure out how to program machine, you just align the arrows to the next feeding times and you're done, much more simple than the digital feeders. Word to the wise, use a new battery each time, although you can visually verify the battery is working when you set it, if it dies later that day you'll have a very hungry kitty when you return."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product; Such a life saver","review":"I bought this because my cat is older now and can only eat wet food.I used to be able to leave her for a day or two with no issue cause dry food can stay out for a long time.Now, if I'm going to be home late, I'm concerned about her being hungry waiting for wet food.I've been using this for months now and it has worked perfectly. Never failed. I even use it with rechargeable batteries and it has never failed.I am worried about the battery so I recharge once a month to be safe, but not because it needed it.I use it often, so I bought a replacement set of ice packs so that I can have one in the freezer at all times and always be ready to put food in and go.Such a life saver for me since I don't need to worry as much cause if I know I will be home late or staying somewhere overnight, I can set the automatic feeder and go."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was unable to use it","review":"I returned the item to the seller because it was used and did not work properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"May be good for passive, non-food obsessed cats.","review":"Theoretically this seems like a good product, but in practise, my somewhat hyper, and dare I say it, very smart 5 year old food obsessed cat Jasmine, broke into it within 30 seconds. I have the break in on video. I offer up her services as a test cat to any feeder manufacturer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"I have had mine for 4+ years, It is great for a weekend get away without worring about feeding the cat. My cat has tried repeatedly to get into the food, without success. I have never had this item fail.

It's the only one I found for canned food that has at least a little cooling added in the form of 2 little containers that are pre-frozen and placed under the dish. Too bad one can't be made that is \\"refrigerated\\" but barring that, this one works the best. The timer can be set at whatever # of hours you want (with a minimum of 4 hrs). Since I have a cat that no longer can eat dry food, this allows me to get away for at least 24 hours without someone coming in to take care of the cat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't seem to get it out of my player","review":"Beautiful vocals, mixed with piano and a dancy beat for a combination they leaves you wanting to dance and sing-along at the same time.

BUY THIS!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Depeche Mode fans will love it","review":"If you like Depeche Mode...you will definatly enjoy this releas. The vocalist has a unique voice and sounds similar to the mixture of Dave Gahan and Martin Gores vocals. The music is extreamly melodic with lots of great synth lines and some spice of piano. The tracks are low to mid tempo but certainly rejuvanate your soul. My only commplaint is that most of the tracks sound similar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wesley's CD is aw-sum!","review":"Wesley's CD \\"Fabian Road Warrior\\" reveals a lot of the \\"new\\" material Wesley is working on, while keeping the beat of the previos albums-the beat played on his Casio keyboard. Songs like \\"Alanis Morrisette\\" show his feelings about other members of the music world, while more personal songs such as \\"Annie Vookman\\" and \\"Wesley Willis\\" reveal much about the inner Chi of this 300-pound paranoid schizophrenic. We learn that the music keeps his \\"demons\\" in check. he no longer has the need to destroy portable CD players, as his demons often tell him to do. And some of his tunes \\"Rock the nation\\", \\"Spank Wagon\\", etc., are just plain fun. Most people who have heard the music of Wesley will think its just the same as his other music. This would be true. But this CD is quite a glimps into the psyche of the artist that is Wesley Willis.

Upon seeing the animal (who has escaped from the zoo), they decide they are dreaming. They go into their house and wreck it with abandon -- eating their winter supplies of food and breaking things. Then they go for a swim. Meanwhile the zookeeper tracks down the kangaroo and comes upon the house, which has been wrecked, not by the zoo animal, but rather by the bear and the bird. The zookeeper cleans up the mess. Bear and bird then return to face a cleaned up house.

Its size gives it the illusion of being comprehensive. However, it only includes plants that will grow \\"somewhere in the British Isles\\". It omits a number of species which are U.S. natives (e.g., no Rhododendron catawbiensis, although the author offers a whole section on Asian rhododendrons). It also misses species cultivated in the Southern US (e.g., no gardenias). List of cultivars circa 1989 is getting dated. I would also hope that the next edition would alphabetize the order in which species are presented within the sections.

Tech Suport was no help, like the other reviewers, they just suggested to update drivers, my computers brand new, so that was no help. When I read the other reviews, I REALLY felt their pain.

My favorite part is when you get to do the challenges. The only thing I would disagree on is that the sound quality isn't that flowing like it skips. But, However, I got this game and it added 2 new fonts on to microsoft word. They are lego, the lego font and hogwartswizard, that is the harry potter font, the same thing that is on the cover title. I think you should buy this because it has widend my imagination a lot infact,so much that i am going to read the whole series over.

Building the rooms is tedious, frusterating, and time consuming2. Students and Teachers do not interact...they simply jump around3. You can only add certain feautures to certain areas4.

Its controls are contra-intuitive, clumsy, and v-e-r-y s-l-o-w. It locks up and freezes, some times coming back and executing your mouse click up to a minute after you've thought it didn't take, and have moved on. When it's running, it's sensitve and twitchy. Those who have said the controls are bad or frustrating are being quite kind. It takes hours to get the simplest things set up.Then, when you're finished, you can't actually DO much with your creations.Lego has a variety of software titles and should include good products; perhaps the second title, \\"LEGO Creator: Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\\" will be usable and fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Game that Misfunctions","review":"I just bought Lego Media Harry Potter (at a store) with my Christmas money and it always freezes when I come to the first menu.

They did not get it right. First, I could not get it to work on XP. Oh, well. I should have looked more closely at the package. It makes no Windows claims. I did get it to work on Windows 98. But my 9-year old and I had a very slow go at figuring out how to make it work. The graphics are poor. Everything ran slow compared to our other games. (Working with 256MB memory, 32mb video memory, lots of free defragmented disk space.) The help is disfunctional much of the time and extremely slow the rest of the time. Too bad the Harry Potter enterprises did not contract with the Humongous crowd to do this.

It is made up of minigames mostly, with poor graphics and sound. The story line of this games is that Tweety has developed a petrification curse, and Granny needs to collect the 5 Magic Gems to save him. The rest of the Looney Toons decide to compete against each other and try to get the Gems themselves. This game would be OK, if the board game and minigame features had not already been taken. You move by drawing cards, and you can trigger random effects by land on certain places.The main bad thing about this game is that it is too complicated for a kids game; Having 16 minigames, 50 different items, and over 200 spaces, it takes more than an hour to play a game of nonsaving action. This game should not be bought at all, as it is simply boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"The stupid computer....","review":"WEll, I thought this game would be cool because it was like a Mario Party, but boy was I wrong! The Mini games are ok, but the actual game bites! The computer cheats like mad even in Easy Mode and plus the board is so impossible. THere are so many dead ends and many of the roads you have to take take forever. Plus, you have to watch the computer move and it takes forever.

This game is great for everyone, but little children will love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chris Hartman","review":"i think you shouldn't buy this game because the graphics are not really that good at all.

The majority of readers might also hope that Pybus had buried these odes in cement or only preserved them as marginalia in great dusty tomes and the kind of heavily footnoted journal articles used to torture graduate students, accessible only to the library-bound and the savage and compromised inheritors of a ruined civilization.

FIF's previous releases were rather unexciting to me, but I absolutely love Electric Boogaloo. All I can say is \\"Wow... what an album!\\" Exciting from cover-to-cover. Some of these songs are very deep, including \\"The Day We Killed,\\" \\"Juggernaut,\\" \\"Car,\\" and finally, the best album-ending track I've ever heard, \\"Eulogy.\\" What makes this album great other than the powerful lyrics, guitars and horns, is that listening to it, and thinking about the message will likely give you major goosebumps.

But every song on this CD is a wan, underpowered late '70s disco tune (lots of syndrums). None of the cuts have that wonderfully rich, orchestral Philly Sound.

The quality is very good, it's worthy of showing off watches whether you need to or not.Just be careful, if you put a watch in so that the stem hangs over the edge of the box, it will get pinched when you close the top, especially if it closes quickly after being bumped by accident.

The other point worth making is that my feet stayed comfortable while climbing.Maybe the most telling comment I can make is this one. I ran into another climber with the same shoes.

This book was a major disappointment.When a person is playing tennis or squash, the worst thing he can do is think of two shots at once. Invariably, he tries both at once and loses the point. This is what Dunning did in this too long novel. It is a novel about radio and a mystery novel. In trying both \\"shots\\" at once, Dunning loses the point in a big way. He should have chosen either and stuck with it. The mystery never convincingly wove into the radio novel.In Dunning's other works, he successfully uses his intimate knowledge of bookselling and journalism to enhance the mystery. Here his radio marathon smothered a tenuous mystery plot. Read his earlier novels, but skip this one for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two O'Clock Eastern Wartime","review":"I thought this a classic story. If I was an Eng. Lit. Prof (instead of a Biol. Prof), I would make this book required reading, and my students would delight as they moved through it. A wonderful story evoking the power of early radio, precisely two years before I was born. But I remember radio (in the UK) just before TV and then the DJ's took it over. This is a wonderful book. I hope John Dunning does another one.I can't believe I found it in paperback in a supermarket, and I bought it just because I had read everything else on the shelf (worth reading). That was two years ago and I have read it three times so far. I have no doubt I will chose to read it again in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"It brought back memories","review":"Set in 1942 on the Jersey shore,it's about spys and OTR and a very special romance. I probably liked this especially well because I could visulize the whole thing, having spent my youth right about where the story unfolds. I've worked in radio and John imbued the story with the \\"feeling\\" of a studio at the hight of the golden age. In fact I felt a lot of emotion while reading portions of it. Unlike another reviewer, I found the story had plenty of twists and turns and I enjoyed it to the end. Like Dunning, I was born in 1942, and that to lent a special quality to the book. He researched that era and nailed as far as I can tell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where was the edtior?!?","review":"I have been a fan of Mr. Dunning since his first book \\"Tune into Yesterday\\" came out in the 70s. The two \\"Book\\" volumes were marvelous reads and fueled my hopes that \\"2:00\\" would be a captivating read. And it was, at least when Mr. Dunning concerned himself with the radio station. As for the mystery segments...well, it's a mystery to me why his editor allowed the book to go to press with far too many characters that blend together, a plot that often made no sense, a killer who the reader wasn't even sure he/she knew, and a bizarre tie-in to the Boer War, Nazis, and the IRA. Not to mention a vast expanse of dunes and ghost towns that always seemed to be in walking distance of the radio station. Shame that all this book needed was some reality slaps from a good edtior to make it great. I'm sure Mr. Dunning will return to form next round."},{"rating":"1","title":"False Advertising","review":"This is just not a thriller. Yeah, yeah, I know there's a mystery here, but it's not a good one. It fails on several levels: you don't care enough about the dead man to worry about how and why he was bumped off, and the ending is far too contrived to be credible. Finally, Dunning is far too fond of his other true loves (radio and horses) and tells us way more than we need to know about the mechanics of either to advance the plot.Having said all those good things, now let me proffer some deserved praise. As a purely historical novel about American life in the years before and into early WWII, the book works nicely. Dunning provides a vivid glimpse of a world now many years removed, when radio (not tv or the internet) was the mass medium, when American men in the millions took to the road because it was the only way they could support themselves, and when the fear of foreign invasion was all too real.It's not what it promises to be, but it was a pleasant minor historical read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have met the enemy, and it is us...","review":"Walt Kelly's Pogo is nothing short of extrodinary, and this is a perfect example, I own a copy of the origional printing of this book, and despite the fact that every page is loose, and it looks like it has been through a war, I still read it every year or so.See three at bats, with baseball references made by bats (the flying kind) in bowler hats.

I generally criticize authors when they put in too much description but this book was just the opposite: it was like reading a Cliff Notes of a gigantic fantasy novel. Needless to say it was a great story-severely hampered by poor writing.

This book was obviously written by a first time author and maybe later on he'll write great books, but this isn't one of them. The actual storyline/plot is great but the story-telling is done horribly. One of my major pet peeves in a book is a bad job of editing. I lost interest when right off the bat, I saw typo city.

The inlet reciever on the Fishmate filter is a little bit small if you're running a length(5 to 6 feet or more) on a pitch. You might encounter a flow problem.I stepped the size of the inlet up by gluing a coupling onto it and chose a hose size that fit over the coupling. This fixed the flow problem I was having. I didn't have a problem with too much flow after I did this, it was perfect. If you're running a length that's less then 5 feet(pump to filter) on a pitch, I'd recommend using the standard inlet that's given.There'a also a \\"flow valve\\" that's included with the pump for a waterfall flow adjustment you can modify to use if needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Buy From These People!!!!!!","review":"A month has gone by, no product, they don't answer emails, they don't answer the phone, is there something wrong here?"},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, so good","review":"This pump is replacing another exactly like it that failed after less than two years.

The action is ripping and the books hard to put down. However there is a preponderance of battles with none of the blood and gore spared. I find this a little dispiriting but acknowledge it was part of a warlike time in history. My disappointment also runs to the lack of satisfactory conclusion to each novel and the omnibus. However that makes it worthwhile getting the next parts of the series. If I was reading one of the novels in isolation I would find the ending quite disappointing.

Noreaga always talks about how grimey he is, but all he does on this record is rap over jiggy Neptune beats in an attempt to make club songs.

Save your money and buy CNN's War report, because this album is terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weak Production","review":"I am a big CNN fan so I picked this up as soon as it came out, but the production just doesn't help Noreaga out. Personally, I think Capone is the better MC of the two, but Nore is a good MC. But, he doesn't get very good production on several of the songs despite the fact that big names like The Neptunes, Swizz Beatz, Kyze, Irv Gotti, SPK, and LES do the production. There are still several good tracks, like Grimey, Nahmeanuheard, Mr Ceo, Love Ya Moms, Head Bussa, Banned from Another Club, and Nahmeanuheard Remix. The Life of A.. is a good song, but is just Capone. Live My Life and Black Clouds are both songs that grew on me-I didn't like them at first, but after a couple listens they are better. Capone makes the best guest spots, but Dwnlzy, Musaliny, Maze, Gold, Troy Outlaw, Ja Rule, Final Chapter, Cam'ron, Fat Joe, Complexions, and Cassidy all have good moments.

Having only read 2 books of the series, I have already realized how much Buckley has constructed his stories by using historical events and figures of the time in which the novels take place.

It's hard to find good collections of waltz music that aren't over the top or played almost as salon music. Frankly I didn't know who Barbarolli was before hearing this CD. Knocked me over. Absolutely perfect renditions of Strauss and Lehar with fabulous sound dynamics (be prepared to adjust the volume, if listening in your car). Beautiful music, beautifully, memorably played, lifts the heart. Actually not so good as writing accompaniment since it's so much more than background music! These performances have the weight of symphonic concerts as the music probably really should be played, rather than for schlocky nostalgia. First rate."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT GOOD","review":"I hate being disappointed. I ordered these binoculars based on the description on the website. I spend a lot of time out on the water and was excited to find inexpensive binos to view nature. I tried them once and tested the waterproof and floating abilities. Needless to say they float, but are not waterproof. They fogged up so bad with water and condensation the very next day that I sent them back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smashing debut by a very talented teenager!!","review":"If you're in the mood for a good shiver, read this one alone at night! The author, a 16-year-old prodigy, has a flair for dramatic imagery. Most adults would be proud to \\"set the stage\\" the way she does! She also has a wonderful way of taking historical facts and adding (in italics) her own imaginative details.

The storyline was dull and so were the characters. Not recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pooly done, even for this genre","review":"This book is a horrific let down. While admittedly no one expects to it be the next Lord of the Rings, I have rarely read a novel as poorly written and unbelievable as this. I found the entire book felt like it was written by a grade 9 student. Medically, it was accurate, but english wise, it was atrocious. While reading this, I felt like it was a glorified Nancy Drew books, you know, the ones we all loved when we were 6 or 7 years old. the characters are superficial and unbelieavle, the scenerios and plot are even more artificial. The character of Tony is one of the most unrealistic fictional characters I have ever come across. It was pretty obvious the author knew absolutely zip about organized crime when he wrote this book. Overal, a very poorly written and unbelievable book. No one is expecting Shakespeare, but we're at least hopeing for some entertainment. This was painful to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic","review":"I've been recommended Robin Cook before but this is the first time I've ever read one of his novels. I was pleasantly surprised. The book sucks you in from beginning to end. The foreshadowing's all there, but it really doesn't become apparent just what's going on until near the end of the book, so it always keeps you interested and guessing. The pages fly by with great action and character moments, and the characters themselves are fun to get involved with. Also, the book never gets bogged down in too much medical explanation. There's just enough to let the reader know what's going on, but you don't need a degree to understand what's being explained."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the real Robin Cook?","review":"This was the beginning of the end. Cook has always written engaging plots, even when retreading on similar territory, but with this book what little ability he had for writing believable dialogue was thrown out the window. His prose is filled with cliche, but what is worse is he puts them in the mouths of his charaters. The 2 mobsters sound as if Cook learned Italian mobster slang from watching the the Godfather translated into Chinese and then dubbed back into English. None of the characters dialogue has any subtext. They all say exactly what they think at any given moment, none of which sounds natural at all. Unfortunately, this trend seems to have continued with his later books. One must wonder if he is even writing them himself anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still good","review":"Yeah, I am a Robin Cook fan so I guess I am biased. However I find it amusing when a book critic simply overanalyzes what is essentially just entertainment. Yes the characters are cliched and the plots similar to the other plots and so on.. All of that is irrelavent. Cook's books simply flow well. I am still reading this one and admittedly somehat amused by the formula but at the same time I find his prose simply flows off the page and time passes while reading. These books are like watching the friday night mystery thriller, no expects a work of art, just to be entertained and this book entertains."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bone-chilling suspense that doesn't let up!","review":"This is Robin Cook at his best, crafting a brilliant page-turning story about one lady against an entire system of gangland murders and treachory.

You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite possibly the worst book ever written","review":"This book is terrible. The only reason I read it was because it was in my mother-in-law's bathroom when we were visiting and I got sick and stuck in there. It was either this book or the backs of shampoo bottles. In hindsight, I should have stuck with the shampoo bottles. The only reason I gave this one star is because Amazon wouldn't let me give it zero. Terrible dialog and a completely unrealistic plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly cliche ridden, ridiculous dialogue.","review":"This book is a terrific example of bad writing.

Some of the ideas were fantastic. The NTeQ model for integrating technology seems like a great tool for teachers to use for help when building their lessons.

While I am not looking to be a teacher, I am pursuing my masters in educational technology and looking to work in higher education. The information in this book will definitely help me during my career as an Educational Technology Specialist. I can hopefully use this information even at the college level.

They sing nursery rhymes but the singing isn't synched with their voices and it is just kind of weird. There are also barney-type animals dancing around some of the time.

This tape was made in some other country and the people in it dress in funny costumes and paint their faces.

(As a simultaneous example of the latter two, just read a paragraph allegedly explaining why atomic orbitals of the wrong symmetry do not contribute to a given molecular orbital. The author hardly knows simple group-theoretical explanation, so he provides nebulous metaphysical fertilizer instead). IMHO, the author merely does not understand physics well enough to help reader's understanding.References to nonexisting equations (e.g. Eq. 6.104 in Chapter 6), numerous numerical errors (e.g. to convert answer from Joules to calories, the author multiplies (rather than divides) by 4.2, \\"typos\\" like C(n,n)=0 instead of C(n,n)=1,and other types of sloppiness do not help either.I had much better luck with Nelson's\\"Biological Physics : Energy, Information, Life\\" - much more instructive and insightful exposition, which reads like a strenuous hike over a beatiful terrain"},{"rating":"2","title":"One professor's opinion","review":"I bought this book just before teaching Physical Chemistry. It started with a strong development of model use which laid a strong foundation for the remainder of the book. I found it a pleasure to read, if one can imagine that in a p-chem book.

Some have said he is a \\"modern-day Julian Bream for the next generation\\"; perhaps an overstatement, but still a good measure of his growing reputation.The music on this CD is relatively unfamiliar. My own favorites would have to be the Suite #2, Hika, and Una Dia en Noviembre. These are all works which I have listened to several times over.

Without previous experience in anthropology, I was able to understand the concepts he has laid out and the reasoning behind them.

Im my opinion, i definately feel this book is challenging especially as a freshman attending college. The vocabulary was often advanced and difficult to understand, however the chapters were short which made reading easier to follow. In my opinion, the author clearly specified how life was in the past and how we can use the advancements from the past in the future. I was pleased with the ending where he gave suggestions to how to deal with certain issues today. Overall, I thought the book was rather confusing. The jargin was complicated and it took a while to comprehend what was being stated. Often times, I would have to read over the same paragraphs in order to understand the jist of it. The paragraphs constituted a type of domino effect, however, they didn't run smoothly.

If she would only 'let go and let God' she could answer all the questions she asks.This is the second book of hers I've read, and they both have the same flaws. Ms Wicker manages to find some of the most bizarre personalities to define a lifestyle, and then with smarmy, mean descriptions, she managed to demean people in a very disillusioned way.To get to the point....if a psychic experience hit her over the head she would dismiss it, and for those who may also experience it, they are nuts.

The author is obviously an experienced world traveler and quite qualified to write such a book, however, if you met with Doug Lansky for a couple of hours, you probably wouldn't be discussing most of the items contained in the first 200 pages of the book. This section could have been written by any travel writer or even lifted from another guidebook as it covers general travel information. The next 100 pages gives a very broad overview of eight sections of the world. There are many headings with one paragraph explanations of a generic nature. I hope that Doug Lansky eventually writes a book that gives the reader more of his expertise and specifically deals with around-the-world travel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away Team","review":"Firstly, in common with Activision's previous Star Trek title, Elite Force, this is far too short for a full price game. The plot's none too poor, and has some pleasant twists that suprise, but the gameplay is repetitive and limited, so that by the end it has ceased to be a joy and more like a test of stamina. Of major concern is the lack of an equiping screen and though you do get to choose the team that goes out, each mission's requirements pretty much pick the squad for you anyway. Couple this with the fact that you have to micro-manage your team's every move (they won't even shoot back when shot at, just cry out) and there's no multiplayer option except co-operative over a LAN, means that this is one isometric squad-based shooter to be avoided. If you like this style of game you could do worse than buying Fallout Tactics instead, or save yourself [the money] and pick up a copy of Abomination - The Nemesis Project."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Have Been Better","review":"Away Team could have been much better.

Because after you play the 17 (18?) missions, it's game over. The missions aren't really playable \\"over and over again\\", and without a mission creator for the Internet community, this game will probably be deleted from your hard drive after its initial play.

Examples in the reading consist mostly of long drawn out, and totally unreferenceable word problems. There are no diagrams to help visualize concepts until chapter four. Summaries are wordy.

In particular, I found the treatment of the moment generating function especially impressive. There are numerous practical applications (albeit they are somewhat outdated) that are good for practice. I would recommend this book to any math major or actuarial student studying for test 1."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very very used","review":"I know I bought the most used copy but the description still let to believe it was ok and it is completely falling apart. On the first day the entire first chapter fell out of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wordy, bland, and needlessly complex","review":"This is the third course in probability I have taken over the last 30 years and have not found a good textbook yet. The book is pure drudgery to read. Overly wordy, complex explanations are the norm. Or as the authors probably would have put it: The text makes use of a multiplicity of non value added ink-on-paper replications of verbal communication to excessively inhibit the coherent transmission of information vis-a-vis the learning construct. Presentation of the math concepts is inconsistent, partly set aside in call outs and partly buried beneath tons of words in the text, and partly assumed from the ether. Problem is, you don't know which.I really would like to know why statisticians feel the need to obscure what is really fairly simple math within a world of illogical terminology and backwards thinking. That is, the actual math is fairly simple assuming you can decipher the word problem and figure out which of the hundreds of formula to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"not entry level","review":"This isn't entry level book.

This is true because the book is poorly written in a very bland voice, the few examples are often difficult with little or nothing to do with common problems you will encounter, and as a whole, this book seems to assume that all of its readers have a solid background in statistics; the problem with that is this is used in introductory courses. Everything I learned in the class for which this text was required was from lectures, and I normally learn extremely well from text books. If you take a course that requires this text, either try to find another book or run (don't walk) to the good old drop and add department!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just discovered this gem.","review":"Brilliant.

Check the measurements, it's about 7\\" x 8.5\\" which is tiny for an art book. I was surprised to see this book in the store because it looked tiny compared the the other art books around it. Not good if you want to look at Basquiat's art.You are much better off buying the original 2005 hardcover edition of this book with it's larger page size of 9.8\\" x 11.7\\" which I own. Amazon also advertises a 2006 paperback version of this book at a slightly smaller 9.4\\" x 11.4\\" size which I have not seen in person.Out of the three versions available, this 2010 is the least attractive and definitely not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"So many beautiful pictures!

He's come up with some great music from albums like When Disaster Strikes and E.L.E, but his new one just seems out of place from his previous releases. Yes, \\"Break Ya Neck\\" has a pretty good beat and some other cuts from this record are listenable(\\"Betta Stay Up In Your House\\" and \\"What It Is\\" to name a few), but overall it just isn't all that great. I would suggest Jay-Z's new one or maybe even Nas's. Either way both are better than Busta's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Busta Rhymes - Genesis","review":"Busta Rhymes new cd \\"Genisis\\" is one of Busta's greatest albums. It is good from start to finish. With songs like the banger \\"As I Come Back\\" and the hit \\"Break Ya Neck\\" and the new joint \\"Pass The Courvoisier\\" (Mine also has \\"Pass The Courvoisier Pt.II)but I purchased mine at best buy. It shows Busta is back and better than ever. Other great songs are: \\"Betta Stay Up In Tour House\\", \\"We Got What You Want\\", \\"Bounce\\", \\"What It Is\\", \\"Make It Hurt\\" and \\"There's Only One\\". In my opinion this is on of Busta's best albums. It is a must have for Rap and Busta fans. I'd give it 10 stars if I could.

I don't normally write reviews, because I generally only buy things with very high reviews, and I didn't buy this product at amazon. But this stuff is so terrible that it sickens me to think of other people buying it. I actually came to use this starting a couple weeks ago when I grabbed a new one that my wife had bought and never used. It is terrible. It is very very tacky and unpleasant to have on your lips. I have berry, and it is more like wax and less like anything else. I've used it for almost 2 weeks now, and my lips have become more chapped than when I started. This is an inferior product to the big brands (or anything else I've tried, and I've been a brass player since I was like 10 years old, and have always had to use lip balm to avoid with chapped lips) because it does not work at all and is unpleasant to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning, not the originals...","review":"...and not really all of his greatest \\"hits\\" either, for that matter.

There are still plenty of great old Detroit (and Chicago, etc.) tunes that the Northern Soul movement (bless them) have not yet issued on CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"more Corelli magic","review":"The writing of Marie Corelli was a glorious discovery. The Devils Motor is a short tale put out with illustrations by Arthur Severn. It lacks the depth and intensity of The Sorrows of Satan but it is still a fine read. Corelli exhibits less compassion for the devil in this tale than in The Sorrows of Satan. There is still a bit of a Faustian overture in this tale. Ultimately one can still save ones soul. Corelli seemed obsessed with salvation. She went against the grain of much late 19th Century literature and achieved great success. As in The Sorrows of Satan there is finally gradually, gently and by faint degrees, glimmers of pale gold dividing the darkness with the wavering rise of dawn. (her words) Indeed, from darkness unto light. It is a biblical theme Marie Corelli knew all too well and a fine job she does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roger Burrows Images 5: The Ultimate Coloring Experience","review":"Very disappointed in this item since I thought I was buying a new book.

I think these are excellent alternatives to the usual kind of children's coloring books, and should make them stretch their imaginations quite beyond the bunnies, trees and simple pictorials in most of these books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Structure is the Key","review":"As we learned in The Ultimate Ride, structure is a big part of a training program.

I have never been in favor of book burning, but if I was I would start here. I'm on chapter 4 of this book, and so far it has discussed 1) how white therapists are racist, and if you don't admit you are, you're in denial and MORE racist 2)the fact that I am a spiritually unclean person because I eat meat. And 3) the fact that cancer patients shouldn't get chemo because its worse than the disease, they should look for good herbal and physical therapies instead. I am not kidding, that example is actually used in there. All of this on top of how grinding your own flour and eating organic, locally grown, in-season foods will make you more wholesome and a better therapist. And backed up with a bunch of un-true statements about the benefits of organic foods by the way.

I love his older work too, but this album is just incredible. Some songs - the ones that start slower like Cataracts and Armchairs - took me a while to get into, but when I finally really listened to them I kept going back to them.

Amazon has 12 songs listed, but only 11 songs are on the album. The 12th song listed is the one missing, \\"Yawny at the Apocalypse\\". I feel ripped off because the vynil is worth twice as much as the cd version, so missing one entire song is proportionally worse. I wouldn't be so offended if Amazon hadn't falsely advertised this product. I'm willing to change this review if I am compensated the difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genius","review":"Wow -- holy crap -- this guy is a genius. When I first put this CD on, I was kinda bored by it. It didn't grab me right away. Seemed kind if dull. Four listens later, I realized I was hearing something totally amazing, incredible, beautiful, poetic, mind-blowing. From the brilliant lyrics to the brave arrangements and atypical structures, this guy is to be worshipped like a god as his music is profoundly mind-blowing and soul-stretching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not to my taste","review":"Based on the reviews I read, I was really looking forward to hearing this. The artwork featuring a bird is very eye-catching. I just couldn't get into the music. I've listened to it twice, hoping that it would improve with familiarity. It didn't. The lyrics might be good but, the musicality of Andrew's work escapes me. There's nothing catchy here and most of the songs are downright depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mush for Breakfast, Anyone?","review":"I don't see how this artist can get 5 stars worth of anything. He is impossibly difficult to understand, unless you take the time, and follow along, word by word, his lyric sheet. Does the CD even come with one? It should be mandatory. Heaven knows, he may be gifted, but why try, is my question, when he sounds like he has the kitchen towel stuck between his teeth. Lovely. Must be some worthy reason he wants you to try so hard to follow along...I'm not buying it, and the CD either."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish he would learn to play the freakin' guitar!","review":"First of all, let me offer my support of Invisigoth. A very well-balanced and thoughtful review (which maybe didn't match with the 1-star rating).Secondly, I refuse to join the bandwagon of Andrew Bird worship. Especially around here (the Twin Cities), he gets played very frequently on indie rock stations here (namely, The Current), and the DJs seem to adore him. While I freely admit he's incredibly gifted as a musician, most of his songs seem to boil down to about 2 quite uninteresting chords. And anybody's who's ever plugged in an electric guitar at the music store could sound like his guitar. He seems to have no idea of how to nuance a guitar and amp to really get the richness that is possible. And I'm sorry, but \\"Fiery Crash\\" is just plain boring!He can do better than this, and I hope he does on his next album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never got book","review":"I never received this book after numerous times of me contacting the seller thru email and never got a response.

I counted at least 30 mistakes before I got to page 5 so I quit reading it. I could not get past the mistakes so I knew I wouldn't be able to trust the content either.

The quotes stem from old masters and theologians as:Frizt Kunkel, Karl Barth, Carl Jung, Aldous Huxley,and Thomas a Kempis. Even though this is a classic, the copy which was quoted as being\\" collectible\\" had a brittle cover, falling apart with handling, the book reaked of mold and musty smell that made it difficult to read at length.

I really like the idea that Michael isn't successful his first time and has to practice on the potty--exactly what my 2.5 year old needs! This is much better than the Ernie Goes Potty book, which is too short and simplistic. My son likes it in combination with the \\"Everybody Poops\\" book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and cute reading to get started","review":"This is a good introductory book to the potty world. I love that it cover many aspects of potty training like Michael having accidents and explaining that he sat for a long time and nothing happened. The text is simple and the images are cute.

I have to strongly disagree. This book pales in comparison to Mick Foley's Have a Nice Day. We are given an inside look at DDP, which, as it turns out, is not much of a treat. He is not an interesting subject for a book. If this is going to be the trend of wrestler biographies, then they need to stop now."},{"rating":"1","title":"worthlerss","review":"The book is worthless. He just rambles on about himself on how great he is. Seems he is really a very boaring person who is just pumped up on steriods and likes the tanning booth.

After reading the book it is as if he did a bunch of nose candy and extacy on started to write his ego."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Book I Have Ever Read","review":"First, let me say that I love wrestling and have enjoyed most wrestling books I have read, though they are often very amature from a writing standpoint. DDP's book, however, is not worth two cents. Most of the book focuses on on DDP's life outside of wrestling, which is not nearly as exciting as he thinks. The portions about wrestling are mostly quotes from DDP's friends in wrestling talking about how great he is. At best, DDP comes across as arogant and cocky. Yes, I did say \\"at best he comes across as arogant and cocky.\\" I can not think of a nicer way to paraphrase my thoughts on this book and Page Faulkenburg (pardon my spelling). After reading this book, I am glad DDP is stuck in a near \\"jobber\\" persona on WWF TV these days. In summary, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK unless you like to throw your money away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Positively Biased","review":"It is a well known fact that DDP is a no talent in the wrestling business who got to the top by kissing Eric Bischoff's ass. They were next door neighbors for godsakes. DDP's book is full of crap. He never drew flies. His workrate sucked. He was over, but not to were he drew money. The book itself is bad. 400 someodd pages of his life. 200 of it on wrestling. He writes about how he was a bar manager for 200 pages. This was incredible dull. He puts himself over so much that it is tiring and he positively sucked. He was a product of the WCW Bischoff era and we now know why WCW went under. DDP you will never be in the Wrestling Observer Hall of Fame. And that's not a bad thing, that's a good thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what you might expect","review":"This is not really a book about professional wrestling.This is a book that is partially set in the world of professional wrestling. The subject of the book is really positive thinking.It's out of print, and it may be hard to get, but if you are into human potential and the power of change - combining discipline with positive thinking - then this is a VERY good book.If you know (or if you are) a wrestling fan who needs to hear this message, then this may be the PERFECT book.Some people think that Dallas Page is a relentless self-promoter, but they're the ones who haven't been listening. He believes that anyone can do anything that they really want to - if they're willing to work hard enough for it. He uses his own life as the example.It's worth a read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only A DDP mark would enjoy this book","review":"If you are buying this book to read about the inner-workings of the wrestling business dont bother,If you are buying this book because you are a DDP mark then this is for you.

Basically, it pretty much begins and ends at sticking sequins, beads, glitter, feathers etc. on every object and surface in the dining room, including the dishes and flatware. Apparently, Ms. Porter has never met a guest who objected to getting feathers in his food.

Upon inspection it had a small hairline crack, which I don't know where it came from because it had never been dropped, etc. I literally ended up throwing away $300.

I bought it anyway (from amazon) with the intention of using my 30 day return period to test this sucker out. It performed well taking great pics underwater, being splashed, stuck under the faucet and even soaked in a glass of water for two hours. No water in the camera and it still works. The pics are good and the camera is easy to use but probably not the right digital for the avid photographer or someone that really knows what they're doing. I'd recommend this product to anyone along with one key piece of advice: buy it from a merchant that offers at least a 30 return policy, put it to the test and send it back to the merchant if it dies. You DO NOT want to get stuck dealing with Pentax directly as their customer service is, shall we say, less than satisfactory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trouble trouble trouble!","review":"We have had this camera for 4 years. In this time we have had to send it away for repair twice! It costs over 100$ to repair9first time was under warranty). We never used it underwater as that voids the warranty and if you read reviews, it does leak. It does take beautiful pictures, when it decides to take a picture! Often it takes so long to turn on that the moment has passed and if you do get it on and press the shutter button, it sometimes takes up to 5 seconds to take the picture! That's fine if the object isn't moving! Save your time and money and by a Canon. That's going to be my next camera. They have great customer support and a good product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Optio Underwater Camera is excellent!","review":"This camera is wonderful! We used it on our honeymoon to take pictures of our snorkeling adventures, and it worked like a charm.

We researched what was available for water/weather-proof cameras, and narrowed it down to the Olympus or Pentax products. As I own a Pentax K10d, I was already familiar with the quality of Pentax optics, and the Optio W30 lives up to the Pentax name. The battery holds a signficant charge, and lasted approximately 350 shots prior to recharging. I also like that the lens does not protrude from the camera.

I contacted Amazon who - to their credit - sent me a replacement camera immediately at no charge. Sadly the camera suffered the same fate as the first - except this time water found its way into the screen within the first minute of submersion. I again contacted Amazon who informed that\\"As it seems that the problem with this item is more widespread thanwe originally thought, we are not able to send another replacement.We will gladly refund you in full for the return of this item.please return the set.\\" Fair enough. I then placed an order for the SeaLife ECOshot SL321So, excellent customer service from Amazon, dissapointing product from Pentax."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not touch this camera","review":"I bought this camera for a holiday in the Caribbean. After using it for 20 minutes in shallow water, it failed. I returned it to Pentax who (eventually) claimed the warranty was void because it had sand on the battery cover which has compromised the waterproofing. This is nonsense. How it could have worked under water with sand on the battery cover was beyond the Pentax technicians ability to explain. Also, the possibility that any sand on the battery cover had lodged there after the camera failed was also too much for the Pentax customer service (an oxymoron if ever there was one) to explain.So, lousy camera and even worse customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Screen retains water - can't see what picture you are taking","review":"I just got the camera 5 days ago and have used it on 2 different water occasions.

Went for the Optio because of reported better image quality and video capture capabilities.The photo quality above water has been good and underwater has been great.

But the tradeoffs for compact size and most of all waterproofing make this a good second camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than Expected","review":"I got this camera primarily for its waterproof capability; it is not my primary camera. I've had opportunities to use it for movies in the rain, in a swimming pool, etc, and the movies are more than adequate. The sound is mono and the frame rate is o.k. It takes nice close-ups and has exposure override (+/- 2 ev) so nice HDR pictures are possible as long as the dynamic range isn't too great. It will use the new high capacity SD cards so one gets over 500 pictures on a 4 GB card. Battery life doesn't appear to be an issue; although carrying a spare is always smart.I purchased the \\"camera condom\\" for it which reduces dings on the camera body when hiking or swimming.It's a great second camera for active or clumsy people. ;-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great for one whole year!

I took pictures of my child learning to swim at 1 year of age and then as he approached his 2 year birthday it died. Pentax was no help, a repair costs 70% of the cost of a new camera. What to do?The camera worked like a dream for the first 12 months. Perfectly. I mean like a dream. Excellent quality, water proof. Durable. Good battery life, you name it. Then it up and died. Hmmm....."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!","review":"Although the waterproof feature is fun, and it's really nice to be able to take both stills and videos on the same camera, the shutter lag on the Optio is obscenely slow. This camera is really only useful for landscapes, portraits, and videos. When you snap the shutter to catch that once-in-a-lifetime shot, you end up with a picture that's a good 2 seconds AFTER that irreplaceable moment. I tried my best to make this camera work for me (the quality of the photos is really quite good), but I've got 8 & 10 year old daughters, and I finally got sick and tired of my photos showing the top of their heads instead of their beautiful smiles, or their feet on the ground when I actually snapped the shot with their feet in the air during a perfect cartwheel!

This particular set from Cameron includes \\"It's a Shame,\\" recorded by the Spinners during their short tenure at Motown. Cameron sang with the Spinners before embarking on a solo career. One of his singles is included in the set, \\"You're What's Missing in My Life,\\" which was previously recorded by the Supremes, but only as an album filler. Cameron gives these songs an edge as a strong, soul singer. If you are a Cameron fan, you will probably want this in your collection.

On one hand, one review suggests that the updated version of \\"It's a Shame\\" is enough to purchase this CD. While I thought this might be true when I first ordered the CD, it was quickly obviously upon listening that this is not a very inspired update of that song. There are two other criticisms: 1) poor production (e.g., annoying drum machine) and 2) insipid remakes of classic tunes. I would have to agree with both criticisms, but did enjoy one of the covers. The good news: there are better songs on the CD, including several co-written by GC Cameron himself that are worth the price of the CD.

However, in this second book, the characters were much less likable and romantic/sexual. I turned this book into my local gay bookstore for a store credit as soon as I could.I would NOT recommend this book and I hope Ms. Abbott's next book has more likable characters and does not get into the nitty gritty of 'the law' and concentrates more on developing the romantic relationship between her characters.

However, it seems when the designers of these toys no longer have a living reference to look at they have no idea what to do. Their fantasy figures are very badly designed compared to the rest of their products. They could learn a few things from McFarlane toys, or at least hire some different designers for their fantasy series. To be fair, a child would probably enjoy this or any dragon toy no matter how broken its wings look. But for those of us who are older and still like having some cool, well painted desk toys, these don't hold up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice dragon","review":"I was shopping for realistic dragon toys and this one fit the bill.

Unfortunately, this CD was full of one lackluster performance after another. I'm sure that she enjoyed putting these works together. The CD lacks the professional polish that it should have, however. The thing that really put it over the top as a CD that I will not keep was her performance of \\"Ave Maria\\". I simply cannot overlook the repeated and overtly mispronounced words in the song.

Educated, one of Russia's most competent rulers, and successful, she has had the bad luck to become a heroine of romantic fiction who is remember more for her sex life than for what she actually did and did not do. This book by Isabel de Madariaga shows us why Catherine was call \\"the great\\" and it wasn't because her life and loves. This was the great era of Russian expansion, cultural development (Catherine's offspring would get the benefit of the seeds she planted in the 18th century) and greater westernization. In all areas except one, the persistent problem of serfdom, which dominates the Imperial period of Russian history, Catherine advanced. I doubt very much if this will alter the image of Catherine that has been crafted in 1,000s of works of popular fiction, but readers wanting to know the whole story should take a look at this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A compelling premise, marred by shallow reasoning.","review":"Rev. Carter's premise, that secret Old Testament prophecies foretold slavery and that racism is God's judgment against blacks, is compelling. However, his argument is ultimately an intellectually shallow, mean-spirited diatribe on everything that he sees wrong with African Americans today. At moments, Rev. Carter, himself an African American, comes across as a bitter racist. Of course, he has a right to his controversial opinions, but he should at least back them up with credible research and not hide behind questionable, subjective interpretations of Scripture as the primary evidence for his case."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHO DID HE REALLY TALK TO????","review":"AFTER READING THIS BOOK, I HAD TO WONDER WHO THIS MAN REALLY HAD HIS CONVERSATION WITH ON BOARD THAT AIRPLANE?

I do like the music selections for this set. These are the original artists and as far as I can determine, original songs.The sound is clean and full. The tracks were pulled from the 60's, 70's and 80's.Artists from both sides of the pond (heavy with the English acts), are used so several artists/songs I wasn't familiar with like Chesney Hawkes or Clifford T. Ward but the sound & songs fits well here and with the theme of 'so in Love'.All the tracks I would consider slow jams with a Soft/Rock or Pop/Rock feel. There's no metal, hip-hop, reggae, or rap here.Enjoy.."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"although it is different than the bands first cd(healing)it is still a very well done album,they have matured since their last album,they also added some new styles of music i noticed through out the cd,that happened cuz of the line-up changes and as the band matured,their first cd had more of a metal sound,this cd has more melody and emotion to it,with 3 of the songs being acoustic songs and the rest just more emotional than the first,i highly recommend this cd to anyone who owns the first one and liked it or to anyone who likes emotional hard rock/metal"},{"rating":"2","title":"You will be hearing a lot more about this band very soon!!","review":"I saw these guys in Lincoln, NE with Disturbed, Taproot, and Chevelle and I was very surprised at how good they sounded.

Let's see ...The first song, \\"Crashing,\\" starts, and yup, I was right. Essentially, there's nothing separating Unloco from bands like Staind. Unloco fits perfectly within the \\"nü metal\\" category, and the tracks on \\"Becoming I\\" suggest that there is a predefined, cookie-cutter method involved in doing so.There's no doubt that Unloco has the potential to hit the big time--all it needs is sufficient radio play on the Clear Channel monster. Oh, or maybe they can play Ozzfest--they've already opened up for the likes of the Kottonmouth Kings, System of a Down, and Powerman 5000.The second track in particular (\\"Failure\\") has the potential to be the same kind of cross-over hit as Staind's \\"It's Been Awhile.\\" They just need a heavy hitter to set it up, but I'm sure the record company has a good idea which cookie-cutter song in the batch will do the trick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I bought this CD with high hopes, and I was disappointed with the results.

Well, I also saw them and I thought they were awful. Their drummer is really good, and vocals weren't horrible, but their sound is just repetitive and boring. I don't recommend them at all based on the live show. They played 7 or so songs and I couldn't wait for them to get done so we could move on to better bands. The other two with me at the concert also thought they weren't any good, including the one guy who had really heard of them and liked them before the concert."},{"rating":"1","title":"Becoming Nothing..... Healing Something","review":"One word... Repetitive. Most of the songs sound the same. All of the songs are about the same thing... relationships. Becoming i is Unloco's biggest mistake. Healing, on the other hand, is a good record. A lot heavier and a lot better. It's too bad they broke up though. When I think of Unloco, I think of their first album Healing.And to Adam from Princeton, Wv and your Nov. 21 review... yes Unloco did break up... i mean look at what your review said... \\"i saw them a couple of months back..\\" Did you think, perhaps, that maybe they could have broke up in that two month range?

Little did i know pieces would break off all through my home as i carried it. That is when we bought these hampers. With tiwns you do double the laundry and i feel some days i live in the laundry room. But the mess baggie that you take off the wooden legs makes it so easy. I just grab both bags from both rooms and off to the laundry room i go. Its alot easier than carrying around those baskets i was using. The coments about washing the bag. Hand wash it and air dry it. Ive washed it 5 times now once a month. Still works and looks great"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommend","review":"This hamper is so convenient!!! It is very lightweight. All you have to do is take the lining out which takes a second with the babys laundry and you are ready to wash. Plus it is an attractive hamper to keep out in the babys room.

I recommend it to anyone with a stroller!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be attached better","review":"The display works well, when it gets a signal from the transmitter. The problem is the way the transmitter attaches to the frame of the stroller. Every time we use the stroller we have to readjust the transmitter so it doesn't rub against the wheel. I will most likely have to make something to mount to the frame of the running stroller. I have a different brand of speedometer/odometer for a bike and the zip tie attachment is much more secure."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Gave Up On It","review":"I was very excited upon first receiving this item, however soooo disappointed after trying to use it for quite some time.

I finally gave up and have yet to find anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea - Wish it worked","review":"I bought this for my wife for Christmas and she was thrilled since she loves her bike odomenter and was interested in one for her stroller. Unfortunately, we had nothing but problems, from the computer contact not working (needed to have a 2nd one shipped to us) to the magnet not staying in position so it could record the wheel revolutions, to our toddler very easily ripping the sensor off the stroller, to the computer consistently freezing up on us. We are bummed to have sent our back and asked for a refund. Customer service was always great, but they couldn't fix the problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea, Poor Design","review":"I bought one to go on a Bob Stroller and while I love the concept the design does not work for me. The problem is in the mounting of the arm that picks up the pulse from the magnet on the wheel. The arm and it's method of mounting are not secure or rigid enough to consistently keep it close to the magnet for a prolonged period of time. The whole principle of how this unit works it that the sensor mounted near the wheel picks up a pulse from the magnet mounted on the inside of the wheel and sends a wireless signal to the digital control unit. When the sensor is too far away from the magnet, none of the features pertaining to distance or speed will work. It worked fine for it's maiden voyage and after that I have to readjust it every time I want to use it. To me it's not worth the money with if you have to fool with constantly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for 3 months","review":"I have a BOB ironman sport utility stroller deluxe. I installed the computer and sensor and the unit worked fine for a month or two. I did not like the flexible mount (which wobbled) nor the rubber strap that attached to the stroller. I put it on as tight as I could and the thing still rotated to the point where I would have to stop and adjust it because it stopped recording.Then the computer stopped working one day, I thought I had left it out in the sun too long, because it was fine the next day. Then a week later it turned off again, and now it's on but I can't seem to make it do anything but show the wrong time. I'd return it if I could. But I waited too long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great.. if the magnet would stay on","review":"I ordered this product about 4 months ago. I followed the instructions very carefully to attach the magnet. I thought it was odd that it would just \\"stick\\" to the wheel. I cleaned the tire with the the alcohol pad, I was careful not to touch the sticky side when I removed the backing, i attached it to the wheel and held it there for a while... still, once around the block and the magnet was lost for good.I tried to superglue the magnet. I cleaned the wheel again and glued it... no success... I've now been through 2 of the 3 magnets. I am going to try epoxy for the last magnet; if that doesn't work, nothing will!It worked well, before the magnet fell off. I can see why people would really like this thing and become \\"addicted\\" to it. I really liked the display and all the functions. It really did make walking fun.. for the block or two that it worked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not perfect","review":"Simple to install, and generally a joy to use. I love knowing how far I've walked with my son while pushing him in the stroller (especially since, like most new moms, I've got a little extra poundage to lose) but I'm already on my last magnet (the Strollometer comes with 3), despite following the instructions carefully. (Yes, I wiped the spot down with the alcohol wipe!) I also had to duck tape the sensor so it wouldn't move around while the stroller bounced along bumpy sidewalks. But considering this is the only product for this purpose (nevermind that it also comes with so many great features: time! temperature! distance! and an option to measure in metric, too!) and it works well most of the time, I'll give it 4 stars. If my problems were addressed, I'd give the product 5 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Gift","review":"I received a Strollometer in January and love it.

Unfortunately, it never worked for more than a week. Here are the issues:- the sensor that attaches near the wheel moved every time we went over a bumpy sidewalk, road or curb, as well as when loading in and out of the car. regularly, it would knock off the magnet on the wheel, so it couldn't read any more.- the battery life was really short. the founder said that it's because the unit constantly measures temperature. my bicycle computers have batteries that last for 2 years with constant use, yet this battery died after 1 month of use.- there is no odometer, just a trip odometer. in other words, all your data is erased every night at midnight, so you can't track how far or fast you went over the past week, month, etc.Overall, the reliability issues caused me to return it. 5 stars to Giggle for excellent customer service -- They tried personally to fix it three times and then refunded it when I gave up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"This is great!

This makes the head susceptible to being knocked as you take the stroller in and out of doorways.Better option I think is to buy a pedometer which can be put in a bag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not working after 1 week","review":"I loved the item for one week. Then it ceased to work. I threw out the box and hope that I can return it for a new one. If it works, its great. Hope I just got a bum one! I just wish that the wheel guage didn't move as easily as it does because after folding up my jogger sometimes it moves and I have to adjust it so it doesn't hit my wheel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea...needs work","review":"I thought this would be great when my wife told me about it. It turns out however that the surface you walk on needs to be as smooth as glass for this to even be kind of remotely accurate. The best accuracy I could achieve was it clocking 1.4 miles for each mile we walked...and that was after a long time of set up. I even used digital calipers to accurately measure the wheels of the stroller. The sensor that reads the magnet on the wheel is so bouncy that I'm not sure it will get a correct reading with the slightest bumps in the road.Would love to see the product improved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Price is Misleading","review":"When I saw the original price according to Amazon ($300) and the selling price(39.99), I thought I am getting a great deal and a great product. In fact the set does not worth even a $50. The quality is poor, it looks nice but the material is of low quality, thin cloth, less filling, poor stiching. The color in the picture is also misleading, its kind of pinkish in the picture but actually its brown.So if you are buying, don't expect the quality of a $300 comforter, it just worth $30-40"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, but not quite the best of I had hoped","review":"Some great material truly shines on this album, but I wsih that the group had been a little less populist in their choice of repertoire. There is a little too many arrangements and folk-like material, with the exception of the wonderful \\"Dulaman\\", and I would like to have heard some more varied repertoire. That said this is an excellent starting point for this amazing group."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent novel about armored combat in WWII","review":"G.F. Borden is very familiar with the technical issues of World War II tanks, including the Italian tank that is at the center of the book. However, he never allows his considerable knowledge to detract from the horror of war. Here, he describes the efforts of a tank crew far behind enemy lines to get their captured Italian tank back to safety. His main character, an American who has been fighting fascism since the Spanish Civil War, has no illusions about war. You need not be obsessed with World War II to enjoy this book; it is well-plotted, and the characters are quite believable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific","review":"This rug is a good deal for the price.

I returned the first rug becasue I thought it was defective and ordered another. Same problem with the second rug. I had to return that one as well. This was not your average garden variety wool rug shedding--This was where after one day, balls/clumps of tufts and red fibers were on the floors of every room in my home; and believe me it was unsightly and a headache to clean up. I'am surprised no one else has mentioned this issue with this rug."},{"rating":"2","title":"M. Sherman","review":"This is a beautiful rug. The size is perfect for a medium size living room.

God's favorite is more consistent than His last solo record Melvin Flint.

His previous two solo albums have been classics, but this was not impressive at all. Maybe its the chance to defjam, maybe its cuz I dont like the lead single. Noreaga isnt devling into new issues, and he isnt even providing basic entertaiment. Given that critisim their were still two tracks I felt that were nice \\"Love ya Moms\\" has alot of heart to it, and is a good song. And the last track by Capone, forgot the name, it was pretty ill too. Though both tracks are with Capone. Maybe Nore isnt as hungry anymore, maybe Im just not into atm, whatever it is, I still will check out his next album, and look forward to Capones upcoming debut album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's petition for a ZERO-star option!","review":"Because giving this album one star is generous. Noreaga has got NO FLOW WHATSOEVER. His lyrics are some of the weakest, most meaningless babble I've ever heard. How no-talent, obnoxious posers like this guy make it so big I'll never know. Heck, I wouldn't spend my money on anything that's come out the last few years. Better off getting some classics like Illmatic or Reasonable Doubt. NORE is about as hardcore and fo' real as a Barbie Doll."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this guy kidding me ?","review":"Noreaga...is straight up wack. I haven't wrote any reviews saying bad stuff about an artist but I have to on this one. This is just bad. Even though his previous works are wack, the lyrics were darn funny. It made no sense. On GODS FAVORITE, his rhymes aren't funny anymore. He is just wack. He has always been wack. And the beats are wack. Please don't support this. Worst song on this album : Mr. CEO !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Noreaga can't flow anymore.......","review":"He is not near the old Noreaga of the War Report and it is getting worse with each album he drops. His beats alone can make a good album worth listening to, but his lyrics are lazy like someone else said, he just doesn't really say anything on the microphone anymore that moves me (He says alot of stupid things for that matter). If you like commercialism with no real meaning to the lyrics you will enjoy this album because of the beats, but the lyrics are just blah. He needs Capone by his side on every album now, he is the best one out of the two and has some really tight thugged out lyrics. With Capone and other guests he is listenable, but with him and some whack guests on the albums I just can't bare it, period."},{"rating":"1","title":"AVOID AT ALL COSTS","review":"This album is total crap and should be avoided at all costs. In fact anything that Ian Levine has had a hand in should be treated like the plague. The Marvelettes were a wonderful Motown group who disbanded in 1970 and were IMHO very misguided in agreeing to make this appalling record. It sounds like it was recorded in a garden shed with a drum machine & a computer. It's sounds as much like the Marvelettes as I would. Please, please, please don't buy this record but instead seek out any of the girls Motown or Spectrum collections for the real thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beach is closed -- undertow","review":"SUMMER ON THE BEACH is a collection that's hard to categorize: post-disco, perhaps.

Regardless, I had no problem with this. The movie is entertaining and fun. Cantinflas is an \\"extra\\" at a studio lot for various productions. His way with words, double meanings and incomplete sentences are his trademark. When he \\"dreams\\", he becomes the protagonist and changes the outcome of each different scene in a hilarious way.

As a travel journalist myself, I was shocked to find that in many instances the authors did not even bother to research exact addresses. They simply wrote, \\"ask the locals.\\" Isn't that what Cadogan Guides paid these writers for? In addition, it's pretty scant--information you could easily find within a day of your stay on one of the islands. It was poorly researched! When I wrote to the publishers, livid that I had spent the money on a book that doesn't even list full addresses, they did not even bother to reply. That is how concerned they were with a reader's opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not what you see on the picture","review":"I thought it was a shoe organizer with three shelves, like on the picture.

It was packaged in the original box and bottle but the scent is not as potent/adhering or fresh as the original scent. It's a soft scent that would stay on my body all day with a small squirt. This perfume here fades fast by the time I walk out the door, the scent is gone. I used to spray once and the scent would stay on my wrists all day even after washing my hands...it's very disappointing. I thought I got a good deal for the same quality perfume but I was wrong.Next time, I will stick with Perfumebay which costs more but the scent is the original and lasts all day and night. I chose Amazon because I've purchased so many other quality products and thought this one would be the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for assessment class!","review":"This book by Ganellen is an excellent resource for two of the personality assessment classes I teach at the graduate level. Integrating MMPI-2 and Rorschach findings is a critical aspect of good assessment, and this book is an outstanding resource in helping the reader effectively integrate the two instruments.

I would recommend it highly to anyone interested in this topic--for teaching or for practicing psychological assessment. A must read.

Readable not just for the historian, but the layman as well, the writing is superb. Snippets of information in side boxes offer amusing and informative anecdotes. One major strength of this work is that fact that the reader comes away with an idea of the Japanese perspective on the West, specifically the United States. Often either demonized or put on a pedestal by Westerners, this book provides insight into both the strengths and weaknesses of Japan as well as the West. The only drawback is that this book ends in the early 1990s, before the onset of deep recession in Japan. It would be of great value to get Dr. Boyle's perspective on the decade of the 90s and how the Japanese recession has affected Japan-US relations, as well as Japanese attitudes towards Japan itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recorded in a Garage With free standing mics","review":"I consider myself a BIG Steely Dan, Fagen, Becker fan...and unless you like to spend money just to be able to say that you have everything ever published by SD, you won't want to spend money on this CD.

Many toys now require odd numbers of batteries, and you can't charge odd numbers of batteries! Very disappointing. Also, there's only one battery charge indicator light, so detecting problems is difficult."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price for the speed and ease of charge","review":"This really is rapid. My mouse batteries can die, pop them on the charger and 15 mins later they are full capacity to keep surfing the web for a couple more months.It also does AA and AAA so all remotes and Wii controllers are good to go. Point is batteries never die at a convenient time. However, only losing 15 minutes as opposed to an hour doesn't interrupt much. Highly Recommend"},{"rating":"2","title":"great item","review":"I have had other chargers that broke or did not charge. The energizer is great.

The charger has a fan that can be a little loud, but overall the charger works as expected - quick!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK for infrequent use, can kill batteries","review":"Bought this as an upgrade to the standard energizer slow charger. Initially it was great, but over time found similiar issues that other people have had. It's very picky, it will reject batteries that the old charger would not. Plus I've found that repeated use of this charger will cause the batteries to take less and less of a charge until they're only lasting a couple of hours after charging.Overall, it's good when you have to quickly charge up 4 batteries for your camera before you leave for a party. But other than that, stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed at not receiving a world-traveller adapter","review":"The product in itself is good and useful but only to those that travel within the US.I bought this 'Rapid' charger for the reason that we travel a lot, all around the world and the voltage is 240 V in many countries. Often, when traveling there isn't enough time to charge camera cells for 4-8 hours as required by traditional chargers. So, this 15-30 minute charger is a boon in such cases.But, this one was shipped with a US only adapter(CH15MN2-ADP-US - 100-127 V). Though Energizer also manufactures a world traveller adapter(CH15MN2-ADP-CA - 100-240 V) for this set of recharger, it is shipped only in Canada.This should have been mentioned in the description of the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great charging station","review":"This isn't really a 15 minute charging station. It takes more like 30 minutes to charge the battery. That still beats waiting 2 hours to charge the batteries. It works great for toys for the kids. In addition, the batteries hold a charge for a significant amount of time. I would definitely recommend this to anyone. All charging stations should take less time like this one. A+ product. Thank you for the fast shipping on this also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Red light flashes alot","review":"Worked great for a few months, now I get a lot of flashing red lights indicating a problem with a cell. Out of the first 4 cells, one was rejected form the charger. A week later a second cell was rejected.

It charged the same batteries packaged with it 2-3 times initially, no problem.

I was a bit disappointed with it from the start as it refused to charge my older batteries. I didn't worry too much because I knew they were a couple of years old and got rid of them. Today, it refused to charge the two AA batteries that came with it.There is absolutely no reason to buy this charger. As far as the total ownwership cost goes, you may be better off by getting a 40-pack of Alkalines for $10 when they are available on sale. Those are always ready for use.

I guess we were slow to figure out that the super fast charges are not good for rechargable batteries. We have 30 to 50 rechargable batteries for outside lights and a camera and so on. What tipped us off to this thing cooking our batteries was discovering that the 4 sets of batteries we carry in one of the camera bags, just were always dead when we went to use that camera. Then we read about over charging, even the 2850mah ones just lost life and would not hold a normal charge. So the price of the quick charge may cost you for shorter battery life.

Pretty cool... But...Cons:At first, this charger worked great. But after the first few weeks, the charger began to reject perfectly good batteries (including quite a few very new 2500mAH ENERGIZER brand batteries, so compatibility can't be the issue here.) Overall, it seems to accept about half the batteries I feed it, and then, it charges them only abouth half-way, as far as I can tell. I've bought two of these chargers and both have the same problem. From other reviews on this page, I see that I'm not alone in my experience.Obviously not everyone has had these problems here, but my own experience is very negative (2 defective chargers) If you choose to buy this charger, it may be a bit of a gamble... so I would strongly recommend registering your charger to enable you to get an exchange/refund in case you get one of the many lemons they seem to be shipping out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dud charger","review":"I have two of these chargers.

On this DVD, the So-called former Delta guys never introduce themselves or give any background info.

Also, while I realize that the tone of the text is meant to be fun and lively, I found it a bit silly and overly wordy. Less empty prattling would have left more room for additional information. I found German for Dummies to be a much better book."},{"rating":"1","title":"exercise solutions","review":"I have only gotten through several chapters in this book. I think the content is a little less dry than say take off in German by oxford press(which by the way is very good) and therefore I can read through the chapters more quickly. I do think that the solutions to the questions in this book should be correct however. There are numerous problems with the solutions. It seems this book was never proofed at all.

When I find a bunch of mistakes it makes me wonder how many other mistakes are there that I'm not aware of so I lost my trust in this book and found a better one.All the teach yourself books have a few mistakes here and there but this one has way too many so I would highly suggest that you find a better book than this one if you're looking to learn German, especialy for a begginer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"It smells extremely nice, I doubt that the pheromones in it really work but if nothing else the scent will is excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Sturdy Cards","review":"This deck is the \\"prettiest\\" Old Maid deck I've ever seen. The artwork is beautiful. The old maid is charming :) The cards have a matte finish rather than a glossy one which adds to the beauty of the cards, but does make it harder to shuffle and deal the cards. The cardboard box it comes in is very sturdy with a slide out drawer built in. There is a silly warning label going across the top of the box saying \\"May be a choking hazard for those under 3\\". (It's not shown on the picture.) Probably wouldn't matter to most people, but I think it takes away from the box and is ridiculous to have that on there in the first place. Nevertheless, my kids and I have a great time playing Old Maid.

In no way does Brozman cover any lap slide basics. If you already play lap slide in another format, this dvd may be helpful in learning blues style slide but if you are a slide beginner or even intermediate, pass on it. It provides no exercises, no basic material to work on--it goes right to advanced level playing. In my opinion, Brozman is not a very good teacher--he goes over stuff to fast in too little detail, provides no connective material or exercises. He's a fine musician, he just can't teach.

There you will see a section titled \\"The Glass House\\" (the title alone is a dead giveaway of SOE's attitude towards their customers), where customers who complain about EQ 2 threads are all locked and sent.

Despite my background, I found it difficult to follow and found myself often going to 3rd party sources to learn the concepts. The book was simply a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mathematically disappointing","review":"Ott and Longnecker's book has been used as the textbook for a course on statistical methods in a mathematics department. As a student, I was very disappointed. The book is well-written, and makes direct applications to simple problems easy. However, almost no mathematical explanation of the methods adopted to solve problems is provided! The book may be appropriate for a course offered in lower-division engineering or in social science, but as a textbook for a math class, it is overly simplistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Book","review":"The reason I only gave this book 4 stars is too many unusual ingredients for my taste....also often expensive. However, so saying, my rule of thumb on a \\"good\\" cookbook is that I find at least 3 good recipes and that is certainly the case here. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute and fun","review":"I love this toy. I bought it for myself for something to do. I also thought it was cute. I think it would be great for two to four year olds. I think children who are older might want something a bit more challenging. Overall, it's a great toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost Faith In Mountain Goats","review":"-I respect musicianship and this album deserves 5 stars, 0 is representaive of my feeling for this album-I feel saddened because the Mountain Goats have lost their charm to me. The majority of listeners in the music-world like production, but I hear them as lacking the rawness of their early albums. Production is the ultimate enemy to music in my opinion, which I accept is the antithesis of most peoples' view. I miss when it sounded like a guitar recorded in a boombox. All Hail West Texas was so revalent and sweet-hearted. There was a detachment from the self-concious sound, which is the epitome of independent music. Everyone progresses, but I appreciate a regression towards simplicity. A ballad with just a guitar proved to be something something outstanding because it was a refreshing break from music coated for the masses. The Mountain Goats have moved into a direction I cannot bring myself to support, but I respect their movement nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"A mostly-great album","review":"Okay, so I'm by no means an uber-fan, and I don't have all 308 Mountain Goats albums, but of the few that I do have, this is easily the best. I don't always \\"get\\" Darnielle's songs, lyrically, but The Sunset Tree has some of his most straightforward songs. My favorites are \\"The Broom People\\", \\"This Year\\" and \\"Dance Music\\", all of which are beautiful songs with really moving lyrics. Just when I though I didn't care much for The Mountain Goats, here's a reason to keep listening!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Triumph","review":"This record is a triumph in every sense of the word. IF THERE WERE EVER ANY \\"stops\\" in John Darnielle's works they have all been pulled in The Sunset Tree. Exquisite arrangements and musicians with passionate intensity and shared vision carry this story of an abusive relationship to heights unheard of in this day of musical fluff and flash. Darnielle's songwriting has never before been so consistently on-target and downright beautiful. The entire record is a revelation with my favorites being This Year, Up the Wolves, Hast Thou Considered The Tetrapod,Song For Dennis Brown, Love Love Love and the heartwrenching Pale Green Things. Perhaps this will be the record that gets Darnielle the recognition he so richly deserves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Piercing Candor","review":"It's hard to figure how Mr. Darnielle works his particular magic, but this concept album of sorts about his upbringing by his abusive stepfather, is not as depressing as you might think. In fact, it's rather uplifting...I guess it's the humanity that shines through and the determination and undauntable spirit evinced in lyrics like, \\"I'm gonna make it through this year if it kills me\\"...Beautiful, deep and penetrating lyrics set to gorgeous chamber-folk arrangements. Essential."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't stop listening","review":"I honestly can't go more than about an hour now without listening to the Mountain Goats. This certainly doesn't disappoint. It's fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great organizer","review":"I am a single career woman and no mom, however, this organizer fits my needs much better than various \\"professional\\" organizers. In fact, it is very much according to Steven Covey's \\"7 habits of successful people\\" idea, where you list all the projects for each week, and then at the end of the week have them completed and crossed, or just copy them to the next week. So, the \\"menus\\" and \\"grocery list\\" is what I use for work and other projects :)It is bulky, perhaps the paper can be thinner?The front page is not very presentable in public, so I tend to pull out my calendar folded :) I see most other reviewers complain about it, so yes, do change the cover.18 months is ok, it is a marketing gimmic for new customers, however I buy my calendar every year so I will cut those pages out.Yes, it is great that there are no cute pink bunnies and Martha Stewart-like pictures of perfection. Yes, keep it clean and orderly."},{"rating":"2","title":"I actually use this all year long!","review":"Unlike other calendar/organizers that get left on the shelf come February, this is my tool for an organized family/life for the whole year. The tear-off grocery lists, the to-do lists, the menus and the weekly layout really work well. This will be my fourth year using Amy Knapp's Family Organizer, I wish I had found it sooner!A previous review questioned the year and a half length. I don't find it a waste at all. We all have dates and appointments that are ahead of time. I can go through the schedule provided by the school and put down a whole year's worth of vacation dates, etc. Mark down in September a one year checkup. When you get your new organizer move the date over.Like any organizer you have to use it for it to help. But I think that the layout works well for families trying to organize daily to do lists, weekly menus, grocery lists, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good enough, for government work . . .","review":"This is a serviceable little pin. I bought it for my legion hat, to put with an assortment of other small pins and am pretty unimpressed. It will do; I certainly don't want to buy another, but . . . it is very blurry and the backing isn't great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coyote Ugly Soundtrack","review":"This is an AWESOME soundtrack...I wore mine out & had to track this 1 down...the movie was also AWESOME!!! If ya want a great CD soundtrack...THIS IS IT!!! A++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ms. Twain, MOVE OVER.....","review":"I bought this CD because the music made the movie fun to watch. I was blown away by the first four songs!! LeAnne Rimes does a great job, and what a voice. It makes you wonder why she ever did country in the first place.I was disappointed to discover the omission of Blondie's \\"One way or another\\" from this album. One would think that because the song played an important role in one scene, not to mention the fact that I came out of the theater with it stuck in my head, that it would have been included. Were it not for this, I would have rated this album with 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left out too many songs","review":"This CD is good, but given the amount of awesome music in the movie, they could have made an effort to have the CD be all-inclusive. A pivotal point of the movie in which Violet sings \\"One Way or Another\\" should have made this song a top priority. Others in the movie but left off the soundtrack include:DEF LEPPARD- Pour some sugar on me BILLY IDOL - Rebel yell STRAY CATS - Rock this town LENNY KRAVITZ - Fly away UNCLE CRACKER - Follow me KID ROCK - CowboyAs I said, the songs they did included are great, but when watching a movie and hearing the awesome songs, one expects them ALL to be a part of the soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Missing the Best Part!","review":"The best part of the movie, in short, was Alex Band and Aaron Kamin's musical performance of \\"Wherever You Will Go\\". However, they were not included in the soundtrack. So instead of a 5, I'll have to give this CD a 1, because WYWG would have been the best song on the CD anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"All good stuff, except LeAnn Rimes","review":"The soundtrack would be much better if they had used her voice from the movie instead of her regular voice. I don't really know how they did it, but they made LeAnn Rimes' voice sound good in the movie. It was great that they included music from different genres and eras (i.e. INXS and Charlie Daniels). There are several songs that I really like, but don't own the cd, like \\"Unbelievable\\" by EMF and \\"The Devil Went Down to Georgia\\". If you like these songs and can tolerate LeAnn Rimes, buy this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Worth It!","review":"I went to 11 stores in one afternoon to find this CD, and let me tell you it was worth it. The first four songs are GREAT and with bonus songs like the Devil Went Down to Georgia, well let's just say you shouldn't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Buying!","review":"This CD has awesome songs from the movie! It has four of LeAnn Rimes' new songs including Can't Fight The Moonlight, which is the Coyote Ugly theme song. It's a very upbeat CD worth buying!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfect","review":"The soundtrack is awesome. LeAnn Rimes makes this CD worth buying. The fact they left Kid Rock off makes the CD even better. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is that Pour Some Sugar On ME should have been on the soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bah, where'd the songs go?!?","review":"I'm not the biggest fan of Leann Rimes but I did enjoy 'Can't Fight the Moonlight'. The movie, however, struck me as just a chance to get cute girls in tight clothes and Leann Rimes more publicity. The music was -great- but they didn't include half of the good stuff on this CD. What I want, what I CRAVE and cannot seem to find is the version of 'Lodi Dodi' they used. Remember when Piper composed 'Right Kind of Wrong'? The fellow across the street was listening to a remake of Snoop's \\"Lodi Dodi\\" and I have searched high and low for it. Ah if only they had included it on here.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome soundtrack for an Awesome movie!","review":"Coyote Ugly is a great, great movie, and the soundtrack is one of the reasons why. I don't personally like LeAnn Rimes very much, but the four new songs she sings on the soundtrack are awesome... especially \\"The Right Kind of Wrong\\" and \\"But I Do Love You.\\" The soundtrack also includes a collection of timeless classic songs like \\"The Devil Went Down to Georgia\\" and \\"Unbelievable\\" (among others). However, I cannot give the soundtrack a perfect score of 5 stars for one obvious reason: the omission of Def Leppard's \\"Pour Some Sugar On Me\\" and Kid Rock's \\"Cowboy.\\" Were the producers of the CD smoking something when they left these two songs out or what?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy It","review":"This is like the best cd, I love the song Right Kind of Wrong, by Leann Rimes! The movie's even better than the soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"sweeeeet soundtrack but way more kick azz movie tho...","review":"When i saw the movie i was so xited cause i figured the sountrack for it would kick azz. I looked for it forever (well not that long but like 3 stores and all sold out made me upset) but found ONE last copy and bought it!! I wasnt disappointed @ all with the songs that ARE here, its what ISNT here the keeps it from being a 5 STAR.I dont know but i think i heard \\"Semi-Charmed Life\\" playing once in the movie by TEB and that is mah fave song!!!!! i luv that song so much, although i got the Cd i still think it would've been nice if it was there. The songs that are here are really good tho, I stayed away from LeAnn her music was too country-ish for me (YUCK!) but with this turn to POP, LeAnn's gonna be BIG! Stay that way and dont go back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best soundtracks in years.","review":"The Coyote Ugly soundtrack gives the movie it's life. The mix of those great dance songs put together with Lee Ann Rhymes special touch give this sondtrack the quality it takes to join in a list of great soundtracks like the ones from MOULIN ROUGE, TOMB RAIDERand GLITTER, all had a great mix of modern music that rocks and we all love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Great!","review":"This was a very good soundtrack for an excellant movie. All the songs were great, new and old, and I enjoyed it a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dying to Know","review":"This is a great CD, worth every cent.....however like many other customers I was disappointed that some great songs were not on it. I would still like to know the artist and song title to the song that goes \\"Someday or another...I'm gonna meet ya...\\" and also the song played in the background when Violet hugs her father goodbye....END"},{"rating":"2","title":"coyote ugly cd","review":"I subscribe to \\"Netflix\\" and I watch movies every night. I loved the movie \\" Coyote Ugly\\" and new i had to try and get the music soundtrack cd. I am now enjoying it very much, as I fantazize being up there on the bar dancing. The disc is in perfect condition. I had to order twice as the first seller did not have it in stock."},{"rating":"2","title":"great cd","review":"this is a great cd. I bought this as a replacement for my daughters cd that was broken. you won't be disapointed if you liked the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why LeAnn Rimes?","review":"I think the girl who played Violet did a great job of singing the 4 songs in the movie, so why are they done by LeAnn on the soundtrack? I think that takes away from the CD even though they are such great songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing the mark","review":"The music is very enjoyable when taken for it's own merits, but there were a lot more songs in the movie I would have like see such as the Elvis song or Pour some sugar on me. There are at least 7 songs missing that I can recall off the top of my head (all of which would have been great additions).This should have been a two CD soundtrack. The LeAnn Rimes songs are bunched together at the beginning which made me feel I was listening first to one of her CD's and then to a compilation CD.Good music poorly packaged would be my synopsis."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!","review":"I LOVE the cd!! I also loved the movie!! you feel like you're in the movie when you hear the songs!! it's GREAT!! Go and BUY it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Darn Good","review":"I really liked all the music on this CD. The only thing I didn't care for was the fact that all of Leanne Rimes' songs were clumped together at the beginning of the CD. It would have been much better if they spread her songs throughout the rest of the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coyote Ugly","review":"I absolutely loved the movie, and the soundtrack is just as great. It's full of upbeat dance songs, and Can't Fight The Moonlight is my favorite. LeAnn has such a great voice, and it sounds great on this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"A favorite soundtrack!","review":"I don't usually buy soundtracks, but I had to buy this one. It includes 4 new songs by an official top 10 artist of the 90s...LeAnn Rimes. The 4 featured songs are written by one of today's top song writers, Diane Warren. \\"Can't Fight The Moonlight\\" and \\"The Right Kind Of Wrong\\" are awesome songs. The great thing about LeAnn, is now she doesn't place country or pop. She has it all no matter what type of music she sings. \\"But I Do Love You\\" is a soft song saying all the things I don't like, I do love you. Finally, the beautiful ballad \\"Please Remember\\" is just unexplainable. It's such an amazing song. You've got Diane writing this powerful song, then LeAnn's strong voice singing it. The rest of the soundtrack is pretty good. It has a unique, but good selection. Buy the Coyote Ugly soundtrack, or an upcoming single off it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of The Best Movies (And CDs) Of 2000!","review":"I saw \\"Coyote Ugly\\" for the first time this week and I have to say that it is one of the coolest movies out there! The story was good, the actors were hot and the music was the bomb! I knew I just had to have the CD, so I raced out and got it! I'm so glad I did! I can't get \\"Can't Fight The Moonlight\\" and \\"The Right Kind Of Wrong\\" out of my head! Leann Rimes did an awesome job! (I'm not really crazy about her, otherwise.) The 80s and 90s tunes brought back good memories, as well. I highly recommend this CD and movie to anyone who wants to feel good and get up and dance! You will not be sorry! Do I smell a sequel? Let's hope so! Have fun and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I went and saw Coyote Ugly opening night and when I got home I immediatly went to my computer, kicked my brother off and opened up Napster. Then I found the playlist of the soundtrack and downloaded all the songs and burned all the songs onto a cd. And when I was falling asleep that night I was listening to Can't Fight the Moonlight! But not to worry I also bought the cd from a store the next day. This soundtrack is so good! All the early 90's dance music is great and Can't Fight the Moonlight is my favorite song... that is after Jimmy Buffett's Pirate Looks at 40! Leann Rimes does an awesome job on her four cuts. The only thing missing is a lot of the major songs in the movie did not appear on the soundtrack. I can't wait for the Coyote Ugly DVD! Deep in the dark, you'll surrender your heart..."},{"rating":"2","title":"LeAnn Rimes makes the Coyote Ugly soundtrack a \\"Big Deal\\"","review":"With 4 songs by LeAnn Rimes, she sure takes over the cd with her new pop sound. As a country songbird this soundtrack has opened some doors to her. Her fans are very suprised about how her sound has changed. With a cameo appearance in the \\"Coyote Ugly\\" movie, her fans will get a taste of what leann has wanted to get a chance to do which is acting. With other artists, such as, Don Henley, The Charlie Daniels Band and other awesome artists, this soundtrack is going to be big with lots of #1's on it's way."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT AGAIN AGAIN!!","review":"I just wanna say that this is one of the best movies i have seen as soon asi got out the theater i wanted to see it again!! The soundtrack is good but missing some of the songs which were played more often like \\"One way or another\\" and \\"It takes two\\" but leann rimes does an excellent job on the album i just saw the music video for \\"can't fight the moonlight\\" it should be a guarenteed number 1. All the songs are great its well worth buying!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"coyote ugly","review":"Fun film with a back story of hidden desires and longings for success. great cast, and John Goodman is particularly delightful as the overprotective father."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that bad...but","review":"I don't like Leann Rimes to begin with, but the other tracks were pretty cool in a not at all sort of way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!!! What a great CD!!","review":"I would just like to say that after seeing the movie 2 times I fell in love with it, both times! The LeAnn Rimes songs are soo incredible! She is an awesome singer...it's unbelievable! I was sooo amazed! If you haven't seen the movie yet, I highly recommend it and then buy the soundtrack...it's like the only thing that I listen to now! I love it!! If anyone knows of where I can find the words please let me know...rorolee34@aol.com! It's an awesome cd!! Buy it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite New CD!","review":"First of all, I loved the movie. So, as I often do, I ran out to buy the soundtrack. The songs by Leanne Rimes are my favorites, but all the other songs are lots of fun to listen to. My only regrets are that they didn't include \\"I Will Survive\\" and \\"One Way or Another\\". Overall, I totally reccommend this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT INFORMATION!!","review":"This is a great book on losing weight and getting in shape.It is very motivational as well as informative.The author really knows his stuff.It is the kind of book that will fascinate you once you start reading it.
