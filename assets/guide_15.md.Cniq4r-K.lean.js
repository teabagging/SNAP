The high-energy classic rock songs are still here, but this time they're slightly more original, and noticeably more refined. The tracks that resembled jumbled messes of noise are gone, and replaced with more thoughtful, toned-down tunes. The song that really pushes the album to the \\"great\\" level, though, is the title track. Although its similarity to Oasis' \\"Stop Crying Your Heart Out\\" is too blatant to deny, it still showcases a depth nobody saw coming from Jet.Standout tracks: Shine On, Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is, Stand Up"},{"rating":"2","title":"Long Live Rock!","review":"I am ashamed to say that I was hesitant to buy this CD. Only because their debut was so good, I didn't think the follow-up could possibly live up to it. I figured I would wait until the reviews came in, but when release day came around, I found myself running to the store after work to pick up my copy. What a GREAT album!There is no sophomore slump here. JET is back with a set of songs just as strong as their debut. Fantastic rockers, beautifully melodic ballads.. So many more reviews here have gone more in depth. I just wanted to say that if you loved the first album, please don't hesitate, pick this one up TODAY. You WON'T be disappointed!I will NEVER doubt JET again.

There are some other songs on Get Born that produce similar adrenaline rushes. \\"Shine On\\" produces nothing. \\"Rip it Up\\" rips up nothing. Hum the guitar riff from the song . . . times up. You can't because there isn't one that you can hum. \\"Stand Up\\" is ok - just. Two many slow (boring) songs on the record (three in a row at one point!) Is the band that lacking in common sense when it comes to album flow? The Oasis comparison is apt. It's not rocket science boys: get in the studio and rock! Riffs, drums, uncomplicated beats. Hoops and hollers. Rocking chorus. Get Born had lots of blues-based stuff. This album doesn't.

Of course, this means that there's nothing to compliment, either..except maybe that they do an excellent job sounding a hell of a lot like too many other bands. People compliment them on bringing the 'old' and adding the 'new...' but I hear nothing new in their music. It's just ordinary, clichéd classic rock, except for some reason no one told them that the classic rock era was about 40 years ago. If I want to listen to classic rock, I want to hear it on the classic rock stations, not the modern rock stations.

First, it was even more violent than Open Season, a book that I DID like for the most part. Second, it had only one sympathetic character other than Joe Pickett. I really hated the ending and found it totally unnecessary after all the trials and tribulations the characters had gone through to get to that point.I also felt the character of Pickett was overly thorny and obtuse. His aw shucks boyish charm didn't make up for it.All in all, it had some good parts, but it wasn't worth the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Strong Follow Up to Open Season","review":"\\"They draw near who follow after wickedness;They are far from Your law.\\" -- Psalm 119:150 (NKJV)C.

His targets are again environmentalists and those who oppose them, making both sides look pretty silly in their own unique ways.As I noted in reviewing Open Season, Mr. Box certainly does like to soak his stories in blood. This one has even more than Open Season ... but it's not quite as upsetting. However, if you like your mysteries to be reasonably bloodless, you'll probably find this book to be over the top.Some of the humor in this book reminds me of the books about the ridiculous ways that some people die. It's definitely graveyard-variety satire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exploding cows and environmental activitsts","review":"This is the second novel featuring Wyoming game warden Joe Pickett.

They are willing to hunt people, arranging to kill anyone who opposes them.They are opposed by environmental activists (sometimes called tree huggers) who are willing to violate the law if it suits their purposes. Both sides have an attitude that the end justifies the means.Joe Pickett and others are caught in the middle, and things emerge about his wife's past.

The subscript of the title says, \\"Hot women, Hotter cars,\\" and I figured out why. It is because that is the only good to come from this movie. Millions of dollars went into making this movie, and the highest paid actor had to be Eddie Griffin because he is the only well-known actor in there. The writers got paid nothing...they were monkey's remember? Honestly, if you REALLY want to see it, rent it or borrow it from a friend.

For the production to use real cars, unlike all the fast and furious CGI, and wreck the Porsche. They were able to obtain such rare cars like the McLaren, Koenigegg, and the Enzo which I think is the harest to purchase do to the fact you needed to have a prior Ferrari. All of the other racing movies feature basic autos that most people obtain. Nadia is great in this Movie, I hope she can breakout and become the next biggest star out of Hollywood.

I came here looking for more by the same author. I've been feeling kind of crappy, and I have had books on ways to cheer up. The other books are full of cutesy things that make me feel like a failure at life for just reading them. This book reminds me that its okay to feel down and there is hope, usually in the form of a laugh or giggle.Like another review says, I also do not recommend this book for people who are clinically depressed, which to me is something completely different from \\"having the blues\\" or feeling \\"down in the dumps\\".This book works best when life seems a bit overwhelming and wish you could sit under a blanket until it sorts itself out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother wasting your time","review":"This book is a total waste of time!

So, Greenberger had the idea of having Jack sing all the songs he knew into one side of a 90 minute tape. What we have here is the unedited 47 minute tape that resulted. Jack sings 129 songs within the 47 minutes. To be more presise, he sings a few lines from 129 songs (not 129 different songs, some are repeated). He can only remember a few lines from most songs, and sometimes he sings \\"la la la la\\" to cover the parts he can't remember. His singing voice is pretty bad, too.

The only song I have trouble listening to now is the duet with James Taylor of Mockingbird - for me it just jars with the senuality of the rest of the record, but hey, its still a good song.

Two - Browne's maudlin and self confessional lyrics are almost insufferable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music and Outstanding Lyrics","review":"A great music CD is one in which Every song on the CD is Fantastic! \\"Late for the Sky\\" is all that and more. If you are looking to purchase a single Jackson Browne CD it should be this one. \\"Late for the Sky\\" is clearly one of his best. Ever buy music CD's you don't listen to much? This is NOT one of them. This is one CD you'll love. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love this music and Jackson Browne, then...","review":"As so many have said, this is a masterpiece. Listening to it after not hearing it for a couple years is like re-reading a favorite novel.But if you love this CD, then please listen to Jackson's alter ego, Warren Zevon. Such a great songwriter and his first albums were produced by Jackson. Unfortunately, Warren is no longer with us, but his music lives on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely fabulous lyrics and music","review":"This is Jackson Browne's crowning achievement, a real masterpiece of music and lyrics which portrays the upbeat side of life (\\"Walking Slow) as well as spending much time on the more painful aspects (\\"Late for the Sky\\" and \\"Fountain of Sorrow\\"). \\"For A Dancer\\" is a great introspective piece and Lindley's violin really caps off the song beautifully. Still, the gold CD seems to have lost some of the clarity of Browne's voice, which sounds slightly dull and muted compared to the original CD. I didn't think that the sound was as clear for what is touted for the gold format, and that's the only reason I've given this classic a four-star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best of Jackson Browne","review":"There is no better Jackson Browne album and perhaps no better album) than 'Late For The Sky'. It combines beautiful music with superb and heartwrenching poetry. It evokes a time in my life that was both hopeful and challenging. Each song is special in its own way. I enjoy this album as much today as I did when I bought it in college many years ago. My favorite songs are 'Late For The Sky', 'Before The Deluge', 'The Late Show', and the most beautiful and haunting song I have ever heard, 'Fountain Of Sorrow'. If you've never listened to Jackson Browne start with this one. If you're a fan try it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jackson is a pure gem.","review":"I totally agree with all the reviews of this album. I always cry when I hear \\"For a Dancer\\", it is one of Jackson's most beautiful, thoughit is so hard to say that given the masterpieces that he has written. I am in such awe of Jackson Browne, I don't think anyone can lyrically touch him, his songs have such unbelievably perfect lyrics for the feelings he is so deftly describing.He above all others in my book deserves a spot in the \\"Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\\" I have most of his recordings, I also adore \\"Before the Deluge\\", how true all Jackson's words are.I love him to death."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite","review":"I am a big fan of Jackson Browne. I'd have to say this one is my favorite. Each song is a work of art- the lyrics are powerful and eloquent, backed by music that conveys perfectly the mood of the song. Even the album cover knocks me out. It is one of the albums I would consider perfect, made even more so by the picture on the jacket. This is an album for all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"FINISHING BECCA ...a book with many layers.","review":"I just finished reading FINISHING BECCA, a book that I picked up as a possible addition to a cross-curriculum unit that I present (I'm an 8th grade English teacher) with an American History teacher. We already use MY BROTHER SAM IS DEAD, and APRIL MORNING. Both are outstanding and written from young boys' perspectives. In the past, we've also used THE WITCH OF BLACKBIRD POND, but I have been disappointed with the \\"meat\\" of the book in comparison to the other two. I was looking for something of substance from a female perspective, and I believe that FINISHING BECCA meets or surpasses the \\"meaty\\" requirement. Ann Rinaldi is authoritative in her grasp of the nuances of American's Revolution, and she gives a very respectable presentation of Benedict Arnold's betrayal. I highly recommend the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty boring","review":"This book is a very good book if you are into historicalfiction, are doing a report for school, or into learning about famous people long ago. If not this book may bore you. It did to me and I could'nt finish it. I'm sorry for all rthe people who like this book but I couldn't find anything great about it. but then again i like realistic fiction books. not historical. I hope this review was helpful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of her best...","review":"I believe this is one of Rinaldi's weakest story ever! The lack of fluency made this book hard to read. The only reason I believe that this book deserves attention is for the fact that it was a story about the once well acclaimed captain Benedict who decided to turn against the americans for the crown because of her silly selfish wife."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finishing Becca: A True Bedside Companion","review":"Rinaldi has really done it again in this beautiful retelling of the story of Peggy Shippen and Benedict Arnold. The story's charecters are portrayed in a vivid, believable form and the story is moving, well-written and historically correct."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sure-fire winner!","review":"There's not much I can say about 'Finishing Becca' except that it was one of the most enthralling books I've read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well written book about the personal life of Peggy Shippen","review":"This story has been well thought out but the ending was not very conclusive. It is hard to read a story when all you have for an ending is a sudden rush of information and then you are done. The storyline on the other hand is excellent! Not only did it reach out in detail but of persice description of how Peggy Shippen Arnold handeled her spoiled little self during the war."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good topic, poorly executed","review":"I purchased this book because I was reminded of a favorite from my childhood, Peggy by Lois Duncan, which is no longer in print. I wanted to revisit the history of Peggy Shippen from another author's point of view. I was torn as I read the book whether to keep going or put it down because I was interested in the historical characters but bored with the created ones. Yet even the historical characters were drawn thinly with no credible foundation for their actions. Additionally, the author's choice of words (soup bubbling on the hearth--so cliche!) and methods of conveying story (talking to the cow?) were intrusive and jarring. While this is a great topic for a historical novel that can spur readers to explore parts of history on their own, I think that the book itself is poorly executed and would have benefited from a focused editing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book","review":"Finishing Becca is about a servant who works for a 16 year old girl who marries Benedict Arnold. It was a great book, and I enjoyed it very much but I think the whole Benedict Arnold point took a long time to get into. When she started talking about it, the book was more than halfway over. Otherwise, this was a great book, and I would reccomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finishing Becca","review":"I very much enjoyed this book. You learned a lot about the revolution and it had a wonderful story line. The only thing I found in the story that I didn't like very much was that the main character,Becca,didn't ever speak up for herself. She was a character that was easy to get into but I found myself gritting my teeth with anger because she never spoke up and said something! She would be in a situation where I would go biting mad and she would almost shrug it off. I very much liked this book but I found Becca to be quite spineless at times. She did do one thing that took guts but that was about it. I very much liked the book and I do recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The point of view of a girl during the Revoulutionary War","review":"A GREAT book that everyone can enjoy!

It was a great Book, --I could not put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful portrayol of historical figures, a great read!","review":"This book was wonderful. I think it deserves even higher than just 5 stars. The way the author portrays and describes all the characters, people who actually lived, is excellent. It gives the reader a spectacular sense of what occurred in the history of Benedict Arnold and is such a wonderful experience for the reader to imagine. I would recommend this to anyone who has a love of history."},{"rating":"2","title":"This my first time reloading .","review":"Since this is my first time reloading I will have to give further feedback after I progress in reloading ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can you handle the truth?","review":"I believe that one of the reasons that reading professionals are blindly - cattle-like - following the NCLB and other new reading legislation is that the truth might not be something they want to know -- it would just muddy the waters too much. This book clearly walks readers through how we find ourselves in the current mess - botched and sloppy meta research methods by the NRP followed by knee-jerk governmental responses run the risk of us failing to provide exemplary literacy instruction for our nation's children and non-literate adults.This important book will help you make sense of what is going on around us and maybe, just maybe, be able to articulate to our legislators the need for the TRUTH to be discussed in a constructive way.

Well, I've swum through enough crystal water, and come away after the read with nothing.

Equally fun for any number of 2 or more players, this game has aspects of \\"Let's Make a Deal\\", in which you frequently must choose to take the points you've accumulated or bet them all to continue to rack up more. This makes for a lot of coaching and cajoling from other players, as the longer your turn the higher the stakes become.Someone said the rules were hard to read and it's been so long I can't say ... but they ARE very simple. It's also one of the few games that encourages you to extend and change the rules, so long as everyone agrees, and doing so keeps it from getting boring over time.It's a lot of fun with only five dice; very portable and I appreciate the fair pricing for the basic game given its simplicty. It's a lot of fun and highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game - Tough Directions","review":"This is a wonderful game I discovered from a friend earlier this year.

The new cast just isn't funny. They try too much to live up to the greats (Chris Farely, David Spade, Mike Meyers, Adam Sandler, Dana Carvey, etc.)but they don't realize that they will never be as funny as them. This movie is a perfect example of that. SNL went from actual humor to just 2 hours of ongoing sex jokes. Although I did laugh at the Roxbury SNL skits, this movie just made me dissapointed, along with other SNL movies like Superstar and a couple others. They should just give up now. The old SNL cast was a legend. This time, it's just a wannabe joke. Watch the Roxbury skits and save your money on the movie.\\"A Night At The Roxbury\\" runs for about 90 minutes. It is rated PG-13 for sexual humor and language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like many other SNL films","review":"A lot of films based on SNL characters unsurprisingly fail at the box office because of the inability to actually develop the characters. The only exception, and everyone knows this, is \\"Wayne's World\\" with the exception of the sequel. \\"A Night At The Roxbury\\" follows the two misadventures of Steve and Doug Butabi, two hopeless romantics and brothers who spend their days irritating their dad (Dan Hedaya) at his plastic plant shop, and their nights at attempted club hopping which results in them getting shunned away by the doorman. Will Ferrell and Chris Kattan are very talented but they try to make their SNL characters real and it just doesn't work. Everyone knows the theme of the overplayed and now familiarly known as the Roxbury Theme. The problem is, the film just doesn't seem to go anywhere. It gets inevitably boring and recycles jokes in the movie continually. Look for then unknown Michael Clarke Duncan as a doorman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh....My....GOD","review":"Ok, this was absolutly the stupidest movie I've ever seen.

But I have to agree with others and say that it is so stupid, that it's funny. So whether you like it or not basically depends on if you like stupid comedies or not. Personally, I think the movie is entertaining, fun, and has an awsome soundtrack. It definetely is worth checking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shocking comedy...","review":"This movie is without a doubt one of the funniest movies that I've ever seen. Will Ferrel and Cris Kattan make an extrordinairy duo. This is the first movie me and my girlfriend actually \\"saw\\" completely.

Unfortunately, it did not work on my Sony BDP-5370. This is the first blu-ray that has not worked on this player. Toy Story 3 worked just fine. As an alternative I downloaded the PC version from Amazon which worked good other than an occasional scan line or two. This is a great series according to my wife. She ripped through the other two seasons which we were able to get from Netflix on disc. I may have to buy a new player. This one is not even a year old yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Darwinism & Witchcraft","review":"It's too bad that the writers of this show could not help but slam Christianity and promote their views of darwinism and witchcraft. Their hatred for anything from Christendom comes through so loud and clear, that the acting was at times way overdone; almost 'comical' and contrived. The writers' views are so saturated in episode 2, that my wife and I finally just turned it off. We are Christians and did not expect that such an 'innocent' production would take on such hatred towards a particular group or religion. We are truly disappointed in the BBC."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"Not withstanding rave reviews, because of which I bought this series, I must object. The postman charactor was so bad as to make one disc all I could watch before I put the whole thing up for resale. Stupid is the only way I can chatactorise the way this role was written. Unbelievable is another word as the rest of the story line is quite good. The female roles are well done and the photography-location is excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"larkrise to candleford","review":"Still waiting for the refund.

The package arrived when expected and looked perfect. We slipped the first disc into our blu Ray player and nothing came up. We tried several discs in the series and none would work in our player. We tried a blu Ray movie which we have - and it played perfectly.The shining lite in this comment is Amazon and how good they are to their customers. I called with my complaint on the blu Ray disc and they were so kind and understanding. I was able to send it back to amazon within 24 hours and they refunded me for the disc.

Show me the exit, please","review":"I liked the first two seasons, couldn't wait to get to the next episode then.But somehow in Season 3 this series went on autopilot. Laura's going to fall in love with every young stranger who comes to town and get her heart broken. Thomas Brown is going to find something to sputter incoherently about. His wife will wear her perpetual dazed/confused expression. Alf and his siblings will still be prating about happily (Parents? What parents?). Dorcas will respond to every situation with a series of pretty smiles and her feminine wiles. I feel I've seen every expression Julia Sawalha has.I have to agree with the person who complained about the music. It's grating and for the last 12 eps I've had to mute the sound at the beginning and end because they play the same tiresome theme over and over.Enough. Go on without me."},{"rating":"2","title":"a harvest celebration","review":"Perhaps the quintessential Larkrise episode! Episode 4 of Season 3 entertains and enlightens with songs, dress, and (best of all) life-and-death crises which were all too real a part of our ancestors' lives and are still all too real a part of many people's lives. We see the gleaning after the harvest for the farmer, the terror over the possibility of not enough kernels to last each hamlet family through the winter. We see a measles epidemic in Larkrise and its effect on Candleford neighbors. This is the perfect episode to slap yourself back into gratitude or slap your students, children, or grandchildren into gratitude and action."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop the music","review":"By the time I got to season 2 the background music is just too much to handle. The characters/plots got so ridiculous and some of those who should have been adored became idiotic and just so unbelievable. I don't think I'll get thru the last season 2 or 3 of this show. I wanted to strangle some of the characters! I purchased all 3 seasons as I had an accident which left me sedentary for quite a while....I'd rather stare at the ceiling than listen to that music/theme again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Was good but Could have been better","review":"Who are all these people.

This particular story takes seemingly inconsequential struggles in life and shows how important (and absurd) these struggles can be. Extremely droll. Good if you're needing a bit of a lift or are in the mood for some character-driven comfort comedy. Nothing too challenging here, just a relaxing period bubble bath with some of the series' funniest characters!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Braff","review":"I bought this cd after having listened to the first couple of Jon Butcher Axis albums.

You never knew for sure what was going to happen next. The story line explained how everything happened (the angel tomatoe). The main characters were very well writen and supported. It is really all the little things that happen around here that makes the book really good. She does one little thing and cause something really big to happen. And then there is just a bad case of someone out to get her. She is a walking talking case of trouble that really tries to help those around her.There are humans, vampires, pixies, fairies, a ghoul, demons, and a person we are not sure about yet for characters. And they all have their own personalities quirks!This is an excellent read for something funny/with supernature beings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good enough","review":"The book is funny and in a way entertaining but I would rather read someone who has a different take on vampires like J R Ward or even Lynsay Sands, I am really tired of the same Undead, cannot be in the sun and will burn or be in great pain if it touches a cross ...

It started well. Then the author threw in one new thing after another. The characters are ok, the world is fresh and inventive -- but the rules kept changing.

In the end, I was tired of trying to follow the changes, and didn't really care any more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love - Love - Love","review":"I love every book in this series. Its grown up.

I would recomend thisbook to any fantasy and fiction fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh...","review":"This series was recommended by a friend. At least I thought she was a friend. I don't know if she even likes me after having read the first book of this series. It was close to torture. It takes A LOT for me to not like a book. I can read almost ANYTHING, but this book... I can't even put it into words. I had to force myself to finish reading this and when I was done all I kept saying to myself was \\"WTH was that and what did I do to my friend to tick her off?\\" What really drives me insane is that I was so revved up by her praise for series this is I went out and bought the first three books right away. Now I have two books sitting around that will more than likely NEVER be read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to get through","review":"This book had potential. It has some interesting characters, a fairly cool plot and some moments of suspense. Unfortunately Harrison's writing style is tedious and many of her characterizations unbelievable, especially the lead character's confused sexual persona. The world she creates--the \\"Turn\\" with \\"Inderlanders\\" and \\"live\\" and \\"dead\\" vampires are not explained well and serve to add to the tedium of slogging through the story.Not a book or a series I would recommend -- I am an Anita Blake/Sookie Stackhouse/Weather Warden fan. This one just doesn't cut it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly lacking!","review":"I don't know why there are so many 5 star reviews of this book -- it's incredibly boring and poorly written. I love paranormal fiction but this is the worst novel I've come across. It is the 1st book I actually did not finish and I have never not finished a book before (no matter how drab). It seems like the author didn't think the book through and just started writing it. There's no structure, characters are not 3 dimensional, and plot appears randomly contrived. Save your $$, don't buy it, trust me! If you want great paranormal series try: Richelle Mead (Vampire Academy, Succubus Blues, Storm Born) or Mortal Instruments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like the book","review":"I agree with the reviewer who said this was a mishmash of a book. I hoped the book would get better - but it never did. This book is no comparision to the Anita Blake series - skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"This book was a huge let-down! The writing was repetitve and dull. Rather than explaining some concepts, like \\"going vamp\\" they were just used over and over again. It seemed as though every few encounters someone was experiencing nausea, feeling sick, or feeling ill. Rachel was exceptionally paranoid about her supposed partner Ivy and the most relatable character was Jenks the pixie.I kept reading in the hopes that something would change for the better but it just continued with the same lackluster performance. It was compared to the Anita Blake series which is a complete disservice to that series and author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lot of World Building Going On","review":"Generally, I liked this. But it was really hard for me to get through. Harrison spent so much of the book world building that I think it took away from the characters and the story. But it was good enough that I want to check out the second book, as I've heard from several people that this the typical first book for a series, the next is much better.I'm not sure what to make of Trent, but I'm excited to see him in the next book, if he shows up, and see what all that stuff was about. Lots of twists and turns that kept it entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"This is one of my favorite series - the characters are fun and well-written, and I am always left wanting more. The first time I read Dead Witch Walking, though, there was so much going on that I got kind of confused and I almost didn't bother to read the next book. That would have been a mistake! Stick with the series, then come back and re-read - it is totally worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"dead witch walking","review":"Love this series! Very captivating and imaginative. I am \\"spellbound!\\" i would definately reccomend this series to my friends and other fantasy readers! I am on book #3 now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent plot, hard to follow writing style...","review":"I am almost done with this book and I am finding myself leaning towards previous reviewer Jeffrey Hammond's comments. Although this book has a decent and somewhat entertaining plot, the writing style is so choppy and confusing that you sometimes find yourself plodding along slowly. I am an avid reader (I read 2 books a week) and I constantly found myself double checking sentences to make sure I had read them correctly. I am going to try the second book in the series(I hope the author gets a much better editor though!). The book DID start to get better towards the end though and I will try the second book in the series out to see what else happens with the character. If you want to read something similar to this than check out The Anita Blake series, The Sookie Stackhouse series (My personal favorite series) or anything by Kelley Armstrong (Especially BITTEN and STOLEN.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Start","review":"I would equate this novel with the first X Men film. It was good, but most of the story was spent on introducing characters and settings for future sequels instead of on plot. In general, the entire series will probably be quite good, but this book lacks quite a bit in the story line department. Most of this first novel is just the main character dodging all the assination attempts thrown her way. The author does a good job explaining the \\"Hollows\\" as well as their particular brand of magic, but it's a bit over-explained; hopefully in the next novel none of these exhausting descriptions will be necessary and the book can just flow and concentrate on more important matters. It's a good start -- but I hope there is much more to come.I would consider this the poor man's Harry Dresden."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the big deal about this book????","review":"I bought this book based on all its great reviews. Am I the only one who wonders what all the hype is about? Some reviews compared the main character to Anita Blake and Stephanie Plum - Rachel doesn't even come close to those two! I thought the main premise of the book was never spelled out and as the story unfolded, I kept asking \\"why?\\" and \\"so?\\" I finally gave up about halfway thru the book. I don't like books that I have to \\"work\\" to keep reading and this is one of those books."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think the other reviewers read a different book","review":"This book was a mish mash of a story. I made myself read the entire book just to see if I could understand what was happening. By the end of the book never could understand the character's motivation. I would have rated this a negative number if it was offered. There is no comparing this book with LKH. That is a JOKE. Hopefully the next book will at least be understandable. PASS ON THIS ONE. HORRIBLE.!!!! HORRIBLE!!!! Good for lining a bird cage, maybe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I read the first 100 pages of this book. It is boring. Contrary to advertising, the main character is not sexy or exciting. She does not have much confidence and she describes herself as flat chested with frizzy hair. Also the book is way too steeped in fantasy for my taste. The lead character actually has a pixie named Jenks that tags along and rests on her earring.Don't waste your money, or more importantly don't waste your time: )"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy It -- Borrow It If You Must Read It","review":"I found this book to be terribly written and incredibly unimaginative. If you want to read it, check it out from the library and save yourself some money."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE LOVE LOVE KIM HARRISON","review":"I can easily put myself in Rachel Morgan's shoes and feel the happiness, pain and fright she feels time after time throughout the book. Reading in a time of vampires, wares and pixies are usually written only for a certain personality, but think anyone would enjoy this book if diving into it for a first time. Detailed enough to keep me interested chapter after chapter!Kim Harrison's fascinating work of fiction makes you enter a civilization of vampires, fairies, witches and werewolves which at times makes you think \\"Is this fiction?\\"I enjoy reading the reactions humans such as ourselves and their responses to this supernatural life, which are both positive and negative, and helps keep you intrigued.Stimulating Thrilling and Pleasurable are words that come to mind on this one..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like it much","review":"I have to agree with another reviewer who called this a mish mash of a book. I basicly forced myself to finish it. I thought the author would tie up all the ends but I don't feel she did at all. I won't be picking up the sequel. By the way -no comparision to the Anita Blake series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly overated","review":"I've read so much hype associated with this book. What it is not: Laurell Hamilton, Kenyon,Kelly Armstrong or MaryJanice Davidson at their best or worst. This book is so over rated I was forced to buy it. It is only the second book I actively disliked this year Minion by L.A. Books was also a radical disappointment. If you need your vampire fix try somewhere else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed so Much I Continued With The Entire Series","review":"Read about Kim Harrison in local paper so thought I'd give this book a try. I don't want to end up with bad dreams from books (no Stephen King) so I started the book with some trepidation. The characters and setting are truly unique with witches, weres, vampires and more, but they encompass the complexity of human characters. In fact, the main character, Rachel Morgan, reminded me of Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum. A particular surprise was that the plot had so many unexpected twists and turns that I was hooked and I continued on reading every book in the Hollows series, enjoying each one. This is definitely one of the series' I recommend to friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"AAAAAAAAAAA+++++++++++++++","review":"have read all her books & each one is great.

From the reviews I concluded I would probably like this one a lot. The 1st book of the series was pretty good, but it started off really slow. The first 150 pgs dragged with endless descriptives and plot set up, then it took off after that and petered to sluggish finish. I don't know, maybe the writer was experimenting on writing styles while drafting her first book. I bought the whole series so that is what I'm going to read, but I hope it gets better. Not a bad book by any means, just a little inconsistent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story","review":"I guess this is just a 'me too' post, but I really enjoyed the story. I thought it was very original, the characters had well defined personalities that developed through the series along with interesting flaws that made them likable.Overall a great series."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated","review":"I am not really sure why there are so many good reviews about this serie.I was excited to read this book because many said that it is like the good old days of Anita Blake from LKH but please beleive me it is NOT.The heroine is stupid but THINKS that she is brilliant and tough.The plot had potential but then we are left with so many unanswered questions like Ivy's motives.The whole \\"potential\\" lesbian thing could have been intersting if the author actually done SOMETHING with it but she just chicken's out.The writing style was stale and I just had to really push myself to finish the book.If you are looking for another good author other than LKH and Charlaine Harris then try Kelley Armstrong and her Women of the Otherworld series. I have read 4 books in that series and enjoyed them (Dime store magic was so so, but is sort of necessary to open up her world to more supernatural races)She is also Canadian so I am happy to promote a fellow country woman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Idea was more interesting than the execution","review":"I had high expectation for an alternative world...but what I got was a kind of rehashed detective novel. \\"Down these mean streets a man must go...\\" except the man was a woman, and a witch. Her partner, a vampire. From there, it was more of an \\"insert fantasy horror type here\\" exercise. Vampires fill in for the Mafia, Were-types are doing their own thing, too. I hacked my way through two books...gave up on the third and gave them all away."},{"rating":"1","title":"No desire to read the rest","review":"What a goody two shoes book. Usually I don't notice that kind of thing because most of the time in books, it's a pretty seemless affair depending on the audience and story but MAN this was so lame sometimes.The first half of the book was very boring, fortunately it picked up after the whole rat thing. Up until them the only interesting thing was the almost vampire lesbian instances. Too little too late though. I would probably never read the rest in the series. I didn't care for the supernatural world that was created, nothing left me wanting to know more about these characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Idea, Great Title, Poorly Written","review":"I really wanted to like this book, and went back to it a number of times, but my irritation with the writing outweighed any enjoyment I got. This is one of my favorite genres, but mainly because I love to be immersed in another reality. However the writing of this book is so amateurish that I was constantly jerked out of my immersion. I think that if a really good writer of this genre (Glen Cook, Fritz Leiber, James Blaylock, etc.) could have mentored the author, it might have had a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"a bit of fun brain candy","review":"Kim Harrison delights with an entertaining story of a witch, a vampire and a passle of pixies who strike out on their own after leaving the evil corporate empire.Harrison's writing style is easy to read and engaging. Her characters are well developed and her alternate reality universe is believable, even with trolls and leprechauns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Female Harry Dresden","review":"I cant believe Kim Harrison wasnt sued by Jim Butcher. This book is pretty much a carbon copy of Harry Dresden, but with a female lead character instead!Lets see now...Wizard investigator. Check.Finds clues from a faerie/pixie who loves honey. Check.Attacked by a demon. Check.Traps demon in a circle of magic. Check.Wise cracking main character. Check.Tough as nails partner like Ivy and Murphy. Check.There are literally tons more similarities between the two books.So while i did enjoy Dead Witch Walking somewhat, i cant give it any more stars because of how many ideas were stolen from Harry Dresden. So if you enjoyed this book then you MUST do yourself a favor and pick up the Dresden files by Jim Butcher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconsistent plot, disappointing ending","review":"I am not particular nor a snob. I read all sci/fantasy from Bradbury to Harry Potter. I am very surprised at the good reviews for this book. It is Junior High level writing and plot. I have never written a review but I wanted to warn people about this book. There are three major issues in the plot that are never answered, but they are not interesting enough to be cliff hangers for the next book. The character makes stupid decisions that truly should lead to her demise. I began cheering for the bad guy. The main character was often confused and uninformed both about the magical world and the human world. It is as if she has lived in a bubble her whole life. A lot of the book was borrowed from Jim Butcher's series. It is easy for me to suspend disbelief, but even in this magical world, the events were not believable and the characters were not consistent. The end was woefully disappointing. Please do not waste your time like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe it's me...","review":"...but I really didn't get it. I wanted so badly to like this book because I'm mourning over the turn that the Anita Blake Vampire Hunter series has taken. However, I just couldn't get into the book at all. It's not necessarily fair to expect something as good as the beginning of Hamilton's series, but I saw that many other Hamilton fans suggested this series as an alternative. I'll put my copy on e-bay and hope for the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brainless Fun","review":"It's just what I needed. A little brainless fantasy to keep my brain busy while I rested. I laughed, I rolled my eyes... I wouldn't go so far as to say that this was a genious piece of writing, or that the plot was that interesting. What I love was the masterful interaction between the characters that can take even the most epic story down. A very good piece to pass the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good/Bad opinion","review":"Well, lets see, I have mixed feelings about this first book. At the begining it was VERY slow. It was boring and I was lost because the author confused me with too much information, yet noe enough to explain what the heck was going on. I forced myself to read more and once I hit 200--something pages, it got interesting. I really wanted to give up but then it got better and better. At the beginging, I didn't even want to bother to read it, but after I finished it, I think I am curious to read the second book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Once you read one, you just can't stop................","review":"This series and the introduction of the characters and their world is very refreshing and actually downright intriguing.

It was a frustrating experience to say the least...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still got no idea what this book was about","review":"That simply summarizes how I felt when I somehow ended the book. It was boring. You don't know what are the moitivations of the chracters, they are so plain. Why does the withc want to leave the IS? Because sh'e getting crappy jobs? And then.,.. what does she plan to do? What are they investigating? Why? When? Where? This book is not only boring, but a completly loss of time. At least, in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should I give it the sixth chance?","review":"I started reading this book five times. I really tried. The characters were ok, but the amount of fantasy world explaining that the author has to do to introduce you into this world makes reading laborious and not really fun. After the fifth time I decided that I don't really have to struggle. I just want a fun fantasy read. Maybe if this book was in a movie form and some artists already put all the explanation into the visual, then I could get the story and not be stuck in trying to get the details. I read some review that said that the first chapter is too slow. Maybe I should give it a sixth chance? Start from the second chapter? I don't know. Meanwhile I am looking into the option of deleting it off my Kindle entirely."},{"rating":"2","title":"A definite winner!!","review":"Well, I'm not finished with it yet but I'm very happy with her book so far.

Plus she paints a wonderful backdrop of characters I can't wait to get more into the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, but lacking.","review":"An OK first novel. I definately would NOT compare it to the Dresden Files as others have done. The feel is completely different, a few elements are similar, but overall it is very different.I'm kind of luke warm on this book. It was good enough to finish, but not what I'd consider a page turner. The premise is kooky and quirky (which I generally like), but the story takes itself too seriously to really be comedic. And the premise is too kooky to take it seriously.The villians are also kind of in between. Not really stock, but not really unique. Even the main villian is rather ambiguous, so you don't really have any idea of what kind of charecter they are. I also had a hard time really getting into the heroine's head.I doubt I will read any more of this series, but if I saw it at the used books store for the right price..."},{"rating":"2","title":"New favorite!","review":"What a cool world the author created! I was taken on a trip with witches, vampires and pixies! I can't wait to read all the others! Amazing job!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hang in there...it gets better","review":"When Rachel Morgan, a Inderland Security employee, decides to quit her job as a runner and go into business for herself, she finds herself on the wrong side of the law.I'll admit that I wasn't thrilled with the first few chapters of this book. I didn't care for the main character (too snarky) or the setting (way too complicated). However, by the third chapter, I was hooked. The hard-boiled detective voice of the novel won me. Rachel turned out to have a soft spot (several, actually), and her sidekick Jinx the pixie was one of my favorite characters.The book is pretty grim in spots, and Rachel takes her share of abuse at the hands of the bad guys, but she's tough and has plenty of back up to help her through. I enjoyed the fact that, although there was a bit of a romance, it didn't overpower the story. Also, there were plenty of action scenes that made me want to read on.I'm definitely looking forward to reading the next book in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dead Witch Walking by Kim Harrison","review":"Great book Find it hard to put my kindle down and stop reading.

Rachel Morgan kicks arse!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good book","review":"This book was recommended to me by my step-mother. I have read all of Charlaine Harris' Sookie Stackhouse series and thoroughly enjoyed them, but was looking for another series to fill my reading time with. I began this book skeptical, however it proved to be worth my time. I will say that this book is nowhere near as good as the sequels..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"This was my first urban fantasy, so it's possible I was more entertained than readers who are more familiar with the genre. Although I generally prefer multiple viewpoints, I ended up enjoying the first-person telling in spite of being initially frustrated with the heroine's distrust and general negativity. It took me awhile to get into the story, but a third of the way in, I was hooked. The ending was satisfying and my only bone is knit-picky: I understand this is the first of the series, but I would have liked the Ivy question answered. The pacing was somewhat uneven, but that's not really a big deal as I was never bored. What won me over was the growth and development of the characters and the gradual alternate-reality world building. I was rewarded for my patience with Rachel, too, as she slowly learned to trust. She was kick-ass, but vulnerable too. I will definitely be reading the next book in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than average paranormal sic-fi character","review":"Really entertaining series with interesting developed characters. Sometimes the relationship with the main character and her room mate is a little weird,but if you continue to follow, it looks like the Author is laying a foundation.I love the action. Less graphic romance, and more sci-fi action is always better.This is a series worth downloading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different, but good . . .","review":"I enjoyed Dead Witch Walking, because I really like fantasy that takes place in our world along side regular human beings, and I liked that it wasn't predictable - I didn't expect what was coming next each time something happened. I liked the characters, but I would like to get to know them better and hope that they are more deep in the next book. I didn't give it 5 stars, because it didn't engross me to the level that Laurell Hamilton's books do, but I'm looking forward to reading The Good, The Bad, and The Undead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dead Witch Walking","review":"Loved it! It told a good story without all the sex that writers like Laurel Hamilton rely on. It gave us just enough naughty to wet your whistle."},{"rating":"2","title":"An awesome blend of anita blake & shadowrun","review":"This is a book that once you start you can't set it down. At no time was there a dull moment. We had the world knowledge of the supernatural and the use of magic as contraband. The characters were real in this book. Harrison actually made me care about them. Being a vampire in Harrison's 'verse is not a good thing. Rachel, the main character, was a heroine, yet she had her own flaws that made her human. The supporting cast was excellent as well. I really liked Ivy and I hope to see more of her and her story! Great job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dead Witch Walking","review":"Okay, ive gotta be honest. I initially picked up this book based on the cover, you know hot chick on it.But as i started reading i was jerked into this amazing world that i just couldnt escape.As a long time reader of Stephen King, i thought that no other author could keep me enthralled in their world like he did. I was wrong!!!! Kim Harrison is an excellent author,whom given time, may rival the King himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be a new series","review":"Thoroughly enjoyed this walk through a parallel universe.

Great twists and turns - Rachel was very relatable.You gotta read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dead Witch Walking","review":"I read this book shortly after it hit the shelves and I have to admit that I fell in love with the characters and the storyline. Rachel leaving her job and going on her own is great, but going through Trents offices and trying to figure out what he is, gets to be a bit tedious. However, the plot is very well done and Kim Harrison leaves you wanting more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Enjoyable Despite Flaws","review":"I don't normally read these types of horror novels sticking mainly to horror anthologies, but I found Dead Witch Walking to be highly entertaining and refreshing. You don't have to think too hard to read it and enjoy it. Plus, it was different and never boring.Even the numerous flaws didn't detract from my enjoyment in reading this book. What was the proofreader doing instead of proofreading this book for publication? For example, \\"Jenks\\", the pixie, became \\"Jinks\\" on more than one occasion. Three quarters of the way through the book, Rachel's lavender cologne suddenly turned into lilac and certain individuals were described as \\"heroine addicts\\" rather than \\"heroin addicts\\". Star-struck, I suppose.Anyway, like I said, these little flaws still do not detract from the enjoyment of the book and I recommend it. I look forward to reading the next book in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"a fun adventure","review":"I got this book when it was promoted as a freebie. I finally decided to give it a read while between preferred writers. I really enjoyed it! I found the adventure, the characters and the \\"new world\\" an inventive perspective. I haven't read other writers in this genre but I very much enjoyed this book. I am thrilled its a series as I will be back for more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun read","review":"I enjoyed this book alot. It is fun and keeps you guessing. It is a great summer book. Not as dense, twisty and gripping as Butcher's Dresden series which I consider the best in the genre, but in the same arena. Love th mix of characters. Can't wait to read the rest of the series.

There was also way too much inner dialogue, which distracted from the flow of the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I love reading, just about anything, so when I pick up a bad book and can't return it, I'm definitely not happy about it, so I can't be nice with my review. I can't believe I spent $8.44 on this book; I'm forcing myself to read it just because I spent so much on it. I was fooled by it's 4 star rating, because I'm already on chapter 7 but it's so ridiculously boring, and there has yet to be an interesting plot to be revealed. The book seems to be struggling pretty badly with it's hidden cliched lines and desperate attempt at humor, and there are too much mundane details that make the book even more boring than it already is. Sorry to say, but the author's attempt at creating a fantasy world of the supernatural has failed to excite me in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't believe this got published","review":"I don't know how the story ends. I couldn't finish this book (and I read 2-4 books a week). I got to chapter five and just couldn't take it anymore. There were so many editing problems with this book - so many sentences that just weren't sentences, so many hanging phrases - that I couldn't get past the gaping problems of poor editing. Kim owes me 8 bucks, and I want it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"If you love witches and vampires this book is great. Its definitely different then the others. This is a must read. Look for the rest of her books in the series!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like it","review":"Some books are hard to put down, this one was hard to pick up. I usually read a book this size and this same genre in one or two days, but it took me several weeks. When I finally made it to the end, I was totally let down. I felt there were a lot of questions left unanswered. I guess they want you to read the next book, but I will not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead Witch Walking","review":"I read a lot of books, and when I started reading this after seeing all the books by this author, I was very disappointed and just ended up clearing it off of my Kindle after the first 2-3 chapters. Not worth investing my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book tests your patience!","review":"I'd hoped this would be a great book, but alas it was not. It plodded along...and I kept reading in the hope it was going to get better, but it never did. Rachel takes at least a third of the book to figure out that people are really trying to kill her, then another third to figure out what she's going to do about it, and the last third getting to an anticlimactic resolution. The only saving grace of this book is Jenks, her pixie. The world that Kim Harrison creates is definitely unique, but this book just didn't work. Sorry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"too many details, not enough character development, a shameless imitation","review":"I confess I got bored with this after page 50. Before that, really, but I wanted to give it a try, so I kept going. The story is an obvious attempt to cash in on the LK Hamilton thing. Too much urban tough-chick talk (which, if you've ever known any genuine tough chicks, comes off really weak and wannabe)and WAY too many little details that just get in the way of the story. Atmosphere is great, but you do need characters to give it meaning. I returned the book after page 100 or so. I just didn't give a damn about any of it, and I will read (and enjoy) just about any book with paranormal elements. I found it boring in the extreme, not worth the time or the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow start, but finally got going...","review":"It took me about half the book to really get invested in the story, but once I did, I ended up enjoying it. The author made up for the slow beginning by building a unique world, with an interesting plot and quirky characters. I enjoyed the way she slowly built the relationships and trust between the characters (although I still don't understand Rachel's and Ivy's relationship as much as I do the others... hopefully that'll become clearer in the next book). Overall, a good beginning. I'm looking forward to the next in the series since the author seemed to hit her stride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great New Series","review":"Well I just finished Dead Witch Walking and enjoyed it. \\"How much?\\" you ask. Enough so that I went to Amazon and bought the Adobe Reader download version so that I can keep a copy of DWW on my Palm. Next step is to give my paperback version to my cousin and get him hooked the same way I did with the Dresden series.While Rach and Ivy are the stars of the book it was Jenks that seemed to bring life to the book and the characters of Rach and Ivy. Many of the stories that I enjoy seem to have banter between the characters and Jenks provides that while not overpowering or taking away from Rach or Ivy.What drew me into the book was the People whether they be Witch,Vamp,Ware or Pixy did not matter, that they be interesting and well written did.I rate DWW 5 stars and hope this series last a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rachel Morgan is simply ANNOYING!","review":"I didn't finish the book because I simply cannot stand the main character Rachel Morgan. A dim-witted witch with no talents (oh no, she is talented at blaming others for her mistakes! urgghh!) If you like paranormal beings living side by side with humans, I suggest Patricia Brigg's books. The characters are much better developed and actually likable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snore, bore, bad","review":"I have tried to read this book three different times, oh it is boring, as much as i tried to give it the benefit of the doubt I want to pull my hair out.

I love to keep a smattering of novels produced by writers like Charlaine Harris, Janet Evanovich, or Lisa Lutz. They prevent my reading list from getting too serious! While this novel certainly fits that express requirement, it didn't regale me with, well, anything really. It wasn't particularly funny, exciting, well-written, or clever. I finished it without forcing my way through it but I didn't log right on to buy the second installment of the series.

Ever the epic story teller, his songs can't be heard just once. He wasn't always politically correct (YAHOO) and never seemed to care whether his songs got serious airplay as long as he could tell just one more story. They always were riveting. Though he shone the brightest in a live setting along with brothers Tom & Steve, John Wallace, and a core of other great players, it was Harry who got down deep inside one's heart with his lyrics and unforgettable voice.Portrait Gallery rises above some other of his albums in my opinion just because it has more of what he did best. The Rock and Bummer are hard to find or impossible to find elsewhere. If a \\"today\\" radio station aired Bummer something other than air might hit the fan though Harry never meant it to be more controversial than the next story, I think. Want my advice? Buy this album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"true Harry!","review":"Seriously, if you are a Harry Chapin fan, is there anything that isn't good? It was just what I excepted and hoped for.

I read a few of the other reviews, and they really don't do this film justice. I might be going a little far in saying this, but I think this may be one of the greatest rock films of all-time. It spent a lot of time examining the psyches of the band members, and thus put you in touch with the fact that this wasn't just any old tour for them: this was a significant turning-point in their lives.

Polished and predictable writing by a very good author. Good winter cabin read or long airline flight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing to this Furst Fan","review":"I have previously read two of Furst's novels (Kingdom of Shadows and Spies of Warsaw), and enjoyed both. I am 1/5 through this one and don't plan to finish it.Furst's writing here is self-consciously literary and allusive, and the book suffers for it. All Furst's books are atmospheric, but here one feels he is simply trying too hard to be dark and romantic. Frequent brief flashbacks, with little significance, make the story choppy and hard to follow. The lead character, an expatriate Russian poet, is far less interesting, and less believable, than in the two other books I'd read.I can still recommend Furst, but suggest you skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"My first Furst book: hope the second is better","review":"This is the first Furst book I have read. He has a lot of fans, and many acknowledge in these reviews that it is not his best book. I hope it is his worst, and so I will give him a second chance. The positive element in the book is the detailed historical setting. The characters, plot and much of the writing are weak. Unlike more literary authors, like John Le Carre, Furst attempts to give his characters substance by making them as exotic as possible. Thus Serebin and the rest are sophisticated caricatures, not people. This is good in airport paperbacks, but sits uneasily with the thoroughly intellectual tone of the novel. Hope for better next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blood of Victory is pretty anemic.","review":"I have read all of Alan Furst's books earlier books in order, and usually within a day! I can't finish this one: the characters lack personality, the plot is impenetrable and I found myself just plain bored with it. I was VERY disappointed. I sure hope Furst isn't running out of steam. His other books (especially the two with the French movie maker) are the very best books in the espionage genre I've ever read. Let's hope this book is just a bump in the road."},{"rating":"1","title":"first and may be my last","review":"I occasionally enjoy reading historical fiction to give some flavor and background to history that is my prefferred read. The only reason it received 2 stars from me was that it did provide that.

I may give him a second chance at some point, but probably won't."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst one from A.Furst","review":"I do like A.Furst novels, but this one should be avoided. The main character is completely unbelievable, there are tons of errors in historic environment, and the story is unbelievable too. In addition to this it is boring and predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Thin Stuff","review":"I really wanted to like this book and this writer. After all he is prolific, with many more books in the same vein. But, alas, it was not to be. This is pretty thin gruel. Yes it is heavily atmospheric, but it is also superficial, contrived and predictible. Hungarian counts, delicate, seductive, married French women with understanding husbands; exotic locations such as Istanbul and Odessa; lots of journeys by train and freighter. It all merges together into one dark, over-written rainy night. I longed for the sun to rise and put an end to it all. I closed the book for good around page 100 because I could not get myself to care about what might happen next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow Running Blood","review":"This was not my kind of WWII novel.Very, very slow paced and somewhat disjointed.The final blow was that it just ended without any fanfare or flourish or reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Alan Furst victory","review":"Even though I love Alan Furst's books, I had not bought Blood of Victory because of its bad reviews on Amazon.This was a big mistake, since nobody writes books like Alan Furst.If you like Alan Furst, you will like this book and all his other books. It may not be your favorite Alan Furst, but as usual it's a great story with great details about its setting and in depth historical information about the lead up to WWII."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best of Furst","review":"This was the first Furst novel I read. I was disappointed with the characters and the plot that never really captured my interest. I got to the end of the book and found that I didn't care at all what happened to the characters or the outcome of the plot. Not a good sign for a novel.The characterization felt very shallow and it was difficult to get into the book.I am now reading \\"Night Soldiers\\" and am loving it--so don't judge Furst solely by \\"Blood of Victory\\" if you don't like it either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored to tears","review":"This book is so boring it was painful.

I am completely happy and satisfied with it.The ergonomics of the knife was perfect for skinning and cleaning (it's intended role I'm assuming). Even though my hands were covered in hog gore, I was easily able to maintain a good grip and control. This has become my primary skinning/cleaning knife.

The second part deals with the author's experience working overseas in the Peace Corps.At the time I read this book, I wasn't interested in the Black ghetto, but was interested in the Peace Corps. Consequently, I wasn't interested in the first part but was interested in the second part. The author contends that both experiences contributed to his evolving from a national citizen to a world citizen. But I wasn't interested in that; I was interested in the Peace Corps.Nevertheless, I highly recommend this book for a person interested in foreign service."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best finger-picker around","review":"I've listened to guitar playing all my life, and on this album, Mike shows his excellence at finger picking, and song writing.

There length is good for judging rotation and there weight helps them penetrate targets at distance. I was able to get five inches of penetration at thirty plus feet and split several other in two. These knives greatly increase a throwers ability when compared to other smaller, lighter and differently shaped knives. With practice being able to stick these knives into a target quickly becomes second to accuracy and then to distance. I have been able to regularly hit targets at over thirty feet. I have owned and used many throwing knives, but before these I would not of believed that possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great throwing knives","review":"I purchase these after being familiar with Gil Hibben knives and their quality. I was not dissapionted when I got them. They were not too sharp on the edges which lends them to throwing by the blade or handle, but they do have a sharp and durable tip. the case is nice too. Easy to spin throw or no-spin throw. Very pleased with the price from United Cutlery and Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"A novel of great character development.","review":"Although I agree with the Kirkus Review I think one has to take the time to look beyond what is actually written and read the implied. It took me awhile to understand the character and his obnoxiuos behavior. He has a great deal of maturing to do and needs to become a MAN. I believe that Gear has succeeded and I look forward to the sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all time favorites","review":"This, and it's companion \\"Coyote Summer\\" are about my most favorite books of all time. I've read them both, every summer, for the past 8 years.Mr. and Mrs. Gear are not authors; they are wordsmiths. They craft words into imagery and take you into the story. That they include historical accuracy just improves it all to a level of excellence few others can come close to."},{"rating":"2","title":"A surprisingly good book - better than expected","review":"Picked this book up on a whim at the Atlanta airport and was pleasantly surprised. This is really a good book. Though the story of a mountain man taking a Yankee 'Doodle' under his wing may sound trite, Mr. Gear manages to pull it off - along with some thought-provoking references to works I recall from Philosophy 101 - without losing the sense of the time he is writing about. Although I usually stay away from sequels and series I intend to definitely pick up \\"Coyote Summer\\" . I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"ACROSS THE WIDE MISSOURI\\"","review":"LIVING HISTORY, BEAUTIFULLY AND ACCURATELY PRESENTED IN A STORY OF A MAN,S INNER AND OUTER SEARCH FOR HIMSELF, HIS OWN MANHOOD IN THE TIMES HE LIVED, AND HIS SEARCH FOR FOR THE TRUTH OF HIS SOUL(S).THE AUTHOR REVEALS HIS OWN SEARCH AND HIS OWN INNER BEAUTY TO US AS HE UNWINDS A TALE OF A WILD RIVER AND THE MULTI-FACETED CIVILIZATIONS THAT LIVED, FLOURISHED, STRUGGLED, AND DIED ALONG ITS COURSE.

I don't recommend this CD by Lisa Kelly."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is great","review":"I recommend this book for anyone feeling down on themselves, or just in love with the idea of love. It's a story of two people who fall in love despite of their outward appearances. It focuses on true beauty, inner beauty, and the fact that love conquers all. I think teenage people especially should read this, as teen years are an awkward time. Besides, I've known the author of this book for 16 years, and I think she's beautiful. Way to go girl.

The characters are depicted in such detail that you grin in their success and cry in their failure. A must read!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe two stars is too many","review":"I found this book, or these two books to be very poorly written. There is no depth to these stories. At one point the heroine stumbles into a cabin in the middle of the woods and eats for two days straight. Where did the food come from?The characters in this book seem completely unphased by the totally unbelievable things that happen to them. Character development is below average and each event seems like a bridge from one lifleless coincindence to the next.Oh, and the endings are boring... . For good fantasy of the female genre try JV Jones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"Some books I hate, others I love. I think it has to do with characters and what authors do to them. So many try to force the character to do something that they want, and when you read the passage, it just doesn't feel right. Not with this book, I like the fact that the author let the character be who she was. It was believable; she had faults as well as perfections. So for those who are looking for a story about a hero, but what a true hero that they can relate to, I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good reading","review":"I would have rated this 5 stars except I was a little disappointed in the ending. However, the rest of the book is delightful and has much to recommend it. I'm a Tanya Huff fantasy fan. She can make me laugh and make me cry. Check out her other books if you like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adventure awaits in this video","review":"Like the previous reviewer, I too am hooked on this wonderful film and had to buy a copy. It is about four men, 30ish, who set out to build a huge raft and guide it down the Yukon River until the winter hits. At that point they take the raft apart, build a super-cool log cabin to live in until the river freezes solid, then take dog sleds across the frozen river to the remote Eskimo village of Marshall, Alaska. It is a tad dated, being shot in 1977, but is still well worth watching. All the guys are extremely intelligent and gregarious, and the scenery and action are fantastic. This one shines; buy a copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contains Offensive Material","review":"It's unbelievable that this video is labeled \\"Young Explorers.\\" First of all, what exactly did they accomplish? They went down a river that countless people did over a hundred years ago during the gold rush. More importantly, what is the message to young explorers? They explained it as the video began winding up: that 4 hairy slackers can do whatever they want, not account to anyone, have women to share in the small part of their life that they're willing to give them (which by the way was included in the video at their pit stop), drink, curse, and then with the far away look in their eye, tell about the peace and happiness that came from getting to know the river. I would not recommend this video to anyone who wants more for their children. My copy went in the trash after one viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN CAN NOT BE OUTDONE!!!!!!!","review":"Go ahead, spend the money, you won't be sorry. Bruce's music brings tears to me eyes, lifts me up and makes me wanna seriously party!!!!!!!!!! I would love to see him in concert after hearing this great box set, but he's already sold out!! I think he only keeps getting better. I also like a lot of his newer music.(Tunnel of Love!) Bruce, you might never read this, but - you are one of the best at what you do and deserve all your success!!!!!! (By the way, i live at the Jersey Shore)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good But Not Great","review":"Lots of cool Boss songs on this box set and definitely worth buying. Only gave it 4 stars as some of the live versions are kind of flat. \\"Promised Land\\" especially sounds like Bruce going through the motions. Too many songs from 84-85. Bruce and E Street Band had more improv and fire in the belly during Darkness and River tours. \\"Prove It All Night\\" from 1978 Winterland with long jamming intro and other songs with more jamming would've been better. Maybe some of the old 70's radio broadcasts will get released in near future."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic For Sure","review":"When this package came out, nearly 25 years ago, it was an absolute treasure; Springsteen at the height of his powers, in a place that brings out his very best. That place of course is the stage. From the opening moments of a beautifully scaled down version of Thunderoad, you know you're in for a mythical musical treat.As a avid Springsteen fan, I had the 5-LP set on vinyl the day it came out. Somehow I had never got the CD version until recently. My only complaint; sound quality. As strong as the musical content is, the sonic quality is weak, lacking bottom end and overall beef. Be prepared to turn up the bass and the overall volume. This helps a bit, but this wonderful set should be remastered so that the audio presentation matches the musical presentation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Covering the best","review":"Is this the best live CD? I don't know, but sure is one of the best. Absolutely not to be missed.\\"Cover Me\\" - live in Los Angeles, is one of the best live tracks I have ever heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"An awesome collection of Live Boss at his best. The Promised Land, Darlington County, Bobby Jean, BTR, Racing, Darkness. The covers on this album are awesome as well: Jersey Girl, This land is your land, War. Also on this album are hits Bruce penned for others such as Because the night( Patti Smyth) and Fire( Pointer Sisters).Buy this, you won't be dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I have been a long standing fan of Springsteens, and old enough to have bought Born to Run when it was first released. I also had the pleasure of seeing Springsteen live at the Madison Square Garden the year after The River was released, and it was absolutely amazing.So I was very diassapointed to hear the collection of lifeless, uninspired performances on this album.This album is actually boring, which I didn't think I would ever be able to say about live Springsteen. Who ever chose the material for this album did a very poor job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome & everlasting collection...Springsteen is REAL.","review":"It's such a great collection....and has been hard to find.

Some rarer tracks that you don't here very often. Definitely worth having."},{"rating":"2","title":"The boss!","review":"As an Englishman, I haven't grown up on The Boss as an American my age would have, but he still has an effect on me! I love his music, and own several CD's, but what gets me most, is he is a musician storyteller. He lets you into his Jersey upbringing, and his life also.Some very personal information about him is shared on these reocrdings, and not just in the lyrics. There are a few long sections of speech, on disc 3 especially, in where he pours his heart out to the listening public.If you are a fan, you already own this, if you are not, buy it anyway and you will soon be a fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST HAVE","review":"In my opinion, this is a must have for any CD collection... If you're a Bruce fan and you don't have this: WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? This is absolutely the best live recordings of the best songs ever recorded. Need I say more?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Marathon Man","review":"Do you remember the good old days when Bruce's concerts seemed to go on forever and you loved every second of it? This is a good representation of that time. I would have put in a little more from earlier in his career and a little less from the USA period. Also, he used to play Twist & Shout and Honky Tonk Women way back when. Does anyone at Sony still have those tapes?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Now I Want You All to Cast Your Minds Back...","review":"Nineteen-eighty-seven was a heck of a year in the music industry.CD players were finally selling for reasonable real-world prices; things were as likely to turn up on CD as on LP for first release, and the record companies were *finally* starting to turn out some catalog CDs.And then they announced this set... and that was when my wife and i decided that we actually *needed* a CD player.And the next day we bought a CD player and this set.In the years since, i have not regretted either purchase. While this is hardly all of Springsteen's output from the years covered, nor is it necessarily, by some objective standard, the \\"best\\" -- but what it *is*, is the equivalent of a really good concert performance by Springsteen at the peak of his art.And everybody needs that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Live Set by the Boss","review":"In my humble opinion, this is the by far the best live set put out by the Boss. It still holds up after almost 30 years. I wish it was available in DVD format. There is everything here from \\"Growing Up\\" to \\" Born in the USA\\". A must have for any Bruce Springsteen fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy then, lousy now","review":"This live compilation was a big disappointment (and pricey!) when it came out in 1986. Bruce went way downhill from The River on (Cadillac Ranch, anyone??), and this compilation album has way too much of that material. Where are the classic early live epics like New York City Serenade, Jungleland, and especially his live masterpiece Kitty's Back?? If you want good live Bruce, get Hammersmith Odeon, London '75 or find a bootleg of the 1978 tour (like the Capitol Theatre, NJ show).I thought this compilation was lame back in '86, and it certainly hasn't improved with time."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO WORDS !","review":"ITEM NEVER RECEIVED.

I read this book and then passed it around from friend to friend. It made us all feel validated and comforted. The most usual aspect was to see the effects on ourselves, (in a admittedly sketchy way) and why we interact as we do with other people. It also helped me see why my own children sometimes back off. It's definitely worth reading for the validation. By the way, there is a wonderful review already posted by \\"Sister Renee\\" which is worth reading for its own merits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent, but it needs to be supplimented","review":"This book has some good concepts, but I would recommend supplementing it with another book. Tends to repeat itself and isn't as clear as other books on the subject. I would recommend The Narcissistic Family: Diagnosis and Treatment, by Pressman & Pressman (1994)."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED THIS BOOK!","review":"If you have a controlling parent that always expected too much from you, this is quite a revealing book. If you dread trips out to Mom's house because you know that you'll get comments about your kids, or what you are wearing, etc. this book will give you a lot of insight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-written with a lot of good information","review":"This book is very well-written and does a very good job of addressing the special needs and concerns of adult children of narcissists. I recognized my family and myself in this book, and feel confident that by applying the strategies in this book, I can break the chain of narcissism before damaging my own child. This is NOT a blame-the-parents book. It helps the reader to understand why the parents behaved the way that they did, and that they will not understand that they did anything wrong. The Destructive Narcissist Parent did the best he or she could, and now it is time for the adult child to break free of the destructive pattern."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly written","review":"In my opinion, this was frustrating. It seemed like it was written in such a way that you could not come away with workable ideas. I found it to be confusing. I loved the \\"Wizard of Oz and other Narcissists.I think that it would be a better buy for someone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who's the narcissist?","review":"I found this book poorly written and poorly edited (many typographical errors). Some of the suggestions/recommendations were childish in the extreme. There were a few (very few) nuggets of information but generally I felt like I was wasting my time. Too much of the book was spent on unhelpful generalizations about problem parents and techniques to control and/or manage parental behavior. The title led me to believe that the content would focus more on managing onself and establishing other satisfying relationships. I think Dr. Brown may still be too absorbed in the self-absorbed parents she writes about!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There's NO excuse for such a poorly written book","review":"If psychologist Nina Brown is not exactly on speaking terms with Standard English, then New Harbinger Books should get its editorial staff off its collective backside to make authors look like they've completed high school ... at the very least. Brown offers some valuable insight into the narcissistic personality but unfortunately, readers must sift through pages of poor writing (awkward phrasing, ghastly grammar, and and an utter lack of attention to a logical sequence of problems, examples, and explanations) to find it.This book MAY seem like it's well written to those who are familiar only with the most colloquial levels of speech and writing, but experts -- especially Ph.Ds -- owe their general readership much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so good","review":"Not the best advice, it is too hollow, merely scratches the surface, not worth reading if you want to see real cause and effect difinative analysis on the subject. I got nothing from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"During my own course of therapy, I discovered that my mother was most likely a narcisstistic parent. I picked up this book and my mom fit the descriptions to a 'T.' The information is presented extrememly well, very organized - much better than other books on the topic. And it validated some of the issues I'm dealing with personally in therapy. The tone is gentle and reassuring, but not coddling. I felt like finally, somebody understood what I had been dealing with all my life. There are exercises to help you deal with overcoming issues - I've done a couple and shown them to my therapist. If you have a parent like this, wow, it's very difficult to handle the repercussions. But this book really will help."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sel Help Book","review":"I enjoyed this book very much - although a Self help book, it is informative and fosters growth through treatment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick Read - Very Useful","review":"Great book. Very easy to read. Had some surveys to take - helpful that it kept everything very black and white. I was dealing with a NPD Mother in Law (does it get any worse??!!) and I found this very helpful. My husband did too. Won't bog you down, if you are ordering this, you have enough on your mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"My mother has narcisstistic-histrionic personality disorder, an intensely pathological condition far more destructive than the type of narcissists this book addresses. I already knew much of what was in the book, in terms of identifying a narcissist (no doubt in her case, as she had been diagnosed by multiple therpists). The impacts of having a parent with Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) are similar to what is described in the book (again, no news for me) but the suggestions for recovery are too basic and simplistic for someone with a parent with NPD. I did not find at all the relief I hoped for in reading about others who had experienced what I had gone through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Book!!!","review":"This is a very helpful book, with specific facts and ideas that open your eyes to what a narcisstic parent really is, and how to handle this situation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking depth","review":"I was disappointed in this book. It lacked depth in the sense of helping those of us with narcisstic parents understand how it affects us in our current lives in order to understand ourselves better. It has a variety of \\"exercises\\" to overcome and deal with narcissistic parents but again, does not explore the intrapsychic affects of living with this type person."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can't fix them, but you can help yourself!","review":"Children of the Self-Absorbed is a well constructed manual for dealing with one of the touchiest people in the world: the Perfectly Perfect Parent. It's organized in a very usuable fashion: first, you find out if your Problem Parent fits the category; next, you find out how to dodge the bullets; and finally, you find out how to fix the old wounds. Useful for therapists as well as progeny, it practically maps out the treatment, step by step. A gem!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Big sounds from the big box","review":"A great cd! Man and acoustic bass (period) It is a regular listen of mine, and I figured I'd check out whether he'd done any others. It is a great sounding cd, filled with dynamic energy and panache. The range of sound that comes out of his fiddle is a joyous surprise. It will give you a new perspective on the possible range of emotion that can be accomplished with the bass, both plucked and bowed. A tasty treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"steady Terry Lewis & Jimmy Jam Production","review":"It's a steady steady Terry Lewis & Jimmy Jam Production with cool beats and nice tunes.

They have added a bit of rock and roll to several traditional Christmas favorites without detracting from the originals.In addition to the well known songs here, there is also one MercyMe original, 'Joseph's Lullaby', which is very good.If you like quality Christmas music with a modern twist, this would be a good collection to get. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Christmas CD of 2005","review":"It's familiar in song choice, but they've done such an amazing job with this CD - I haven't taken it out of my player since we bought it. God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen has an incredible sound - almost old Metallica. My other favorites are Silent Night (with Amy Grant) and Drummer Boy. It's just fantastic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good performance","review":"The singing style is rude and crude in some extent. The recording style is somewhat old-fashioned; on-mic with the large diaphragm microphones, maybe. But these 'faults' contribute to present powerfulness and exoticism that the work has intrinsically. There is another recording of Brahms' Zigeunerlieder available from CHANDOS. If you like nowadays beautiful chorus, you would prefer that one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Chorus Works on Gypsy Lifes, Well Done","review":"Main items of this CD are: Brahms: Zigeunerlieder, op.103 and Schumann: Zigeunerleben, op.29,3. Chorus is Gächinger Kantorei, conducted by Helmut Rilling (accompaneid by Martin Galling, piano). These works represent Romatic exotic feelings in German music. Wonderfully performed and well recorded (1968: a little too old, though). I wonder why this important compilation shoud appear under such an obscure label.

This set includes the final episodes of Dragon Ball and officially begins the Dragon Ball Z story line. I recommend these episodes to any DB or DBZ fan.

Then finally the brace broke which if the thing would have worked I could have used the replacement brace I bought because of the combined three items suggestion. YOU DON'T NEED THE BRACE because one comes with it. And if the brace breaks it means the item is faulty. By the way I am a carpenter with over 20 years of experience. This is not a good product.

The songwriting here is almost uniformly lackluster, save for \\"Life of Illusion,\\" a catchy single that can be had on many of his anthology albums. The song \\"Things\\" typifies the kind of stuff that Walsh was writing at the time.

This album (and band) are brutal, at some points technical, interesting and unique. I've been looking for something like this for a while and finally found it. Believe it or not, I actually found out about these guys on Headbangers Ball a couple of weeks back. I never really payed much attention to Dino's involvement in side projects since Brujeria and RR United. I didnt even KNOW he had formed this band WAY back in 2002! What a pleasant surprise. Its nice to see guys from respected Metal bands such as Sepultura, Brujeria, Static-X and (although not Metal) Hatebreed come together and form something so awesome! I cant wait until their release of \\"Cristo Satanico\\" on the 13th of this month!Buy this album if you like bands like Cannibal Corpse, Skinless, Dying Fetus, Pig Destroyer, and The Red Chord (especially their \\"Fused Together in Revolving Doors\\" album)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure extreme metal","review":"This band is in the line of brujeria but with more brutal vocals and sound.There's no much things of hardcore here is just pure extreme metal.if you like death/grind with shure this is one of the best release of the style in the year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't get better than this","review":"With Tony Campos of Static-X on vocals and bass, Raymond Herrera of Fear Factory on drums, and Dino Cazares ex-Fear Factory on guitar, you know it'll be good.It's way better than what you expect.

I missed out totally on Joni Mitchell. I hear people, artists talk about her work and all I conjured up was Big Yellow Taxi. Then I got into Shadows and Light because I became a Pat Metheny and Jaco Pastorius nut. Well, when I got around to Court and Spark I was a fan. Now I am a die hard fanatic. This album is amazing. The musical ideas, the lyrical turning of phrases, the melodic turns. I am listening to it right now and I am learning new things every time I hear it. This is a metamorphic type of experience.

Over the previous six years, she'd tried everything from basic acoustic folk to art songs, but here she presents herself as a California rock artist informed by jazz.

Holy smokes, I'm hooked. The drama of every song on this album, a woman adventurer throwing herself headlong into love and finding that nothing is more binding than freedom, well, Joni puts it across with some of the most beguiling melodies to ever hit the Top 40. This is not a coffee house folk singer hippie Madonna (no, not Ciccone, I'm talking center-parted hair, peasant blouse, acoustic guitar), this is one tough,clear-eyed woman with a way with words and a rhythmic sense gleaned from her recent discovery of mid-'60's Miles Davis, put over on the really odd but just right chord progressions she strums. Her only pop music peer for words that actually scan well is Lou Reed, except Joni can sing. Lush, deep, and I'll say it again, for a Laurel Canyon millionaire, tough as death and taxes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must own masterpiece","review":"Every single song on this CD is GREAT!!.Joni Mitchell did something special on this CD, creating a blend of songs that have already and will continue to stand the test of time.

Without question.","review":"There are few albums (CDs, sorry) that have ever grabbed me, from the first notes, so completely as this one.From the whimsical (\\"Twisted\\") to the lyrical (\\"Just Like This Train\\"), and even the downright sassy (\\"Raised On Robbery\\"), Mitchell dishes up sonic magic. There are even side trips to that rarest of territories, the intelligent, literate top-40 hit (\\"Free Man In Paris\\" and \\"Help Me).Ah, and then there's the title cut... a wistful telling of a romance that almost was.Sad to say, Joni peaked with this one. Oh, sure, she's knocked a few out of the park since; but she has yet to hold a candle to this bonfire.One of my all-time top five."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where oh where did my Joni go ?","review":"I'm sorry but....no. BIG BIG Joni Mitchell fan as I am, COURT AND SPARK and I had a tough time. I guess I was looking for the Joni I came to know in BLUE and LADIES OF THE CANYON. Sure artists mature and evolve, playing with styles and composition, but sometimes it didn't even sound like Joni at all. The songs on C&S felt foreign and almost too radio friendly to me. I just feel that if you have to listen to Joni seeking difference, try Hejira. She did it much better there. Just my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some Atmospheric Tones","review":"Joni Mitchell will always be known as a premiere singer/songwriter from the sixties/early seventies. On Court And Spark, her songs have many intriguing folk and jazz elements. Like the bopping beat to Twisted and the subtle drive to Raised On Robbery. Thats an interesting combination.The vocals are kind of airy and soothing. Just listen to Free Man In Paris and Help Me. The lyrics are fairly captivating. A genius at three? Maybe not but certainly quite catchy.Whereas I am not a huge fan of this style, I respect the creativity and unique tones. A rounded four star rating since 3 1/2 is not an option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eddie Fisher, Just OK","review":"The excellent sound from this CD only accentuates Fisher's unease in his forced banter from this live performance. There are a lot of Jolson songs which I would rather hear Jolson singing (in sound this good), in particular \\"That Wonderful Girl of Mine,\\" which seems to be unavailable in all the Jolson collections.

Those are still his best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Book - Avoid At All Cost","review":"I was considering using this book for an optics course I teach and had a good look through it. The book is terrible, one of the worst I have ever read. It simply has very little useful information.

The plot was far too convoluted. Too many characters in and out with nothing to lock on to them by.

It is divided into 4 sections, following the seasons, and gives recipes for the 8 Wiccan Sabbats. Each section begins with a bit of Goddess lore. There is a magic to the book that anyone can appreciate - whether you love the Goddess, food, or both!I like the recipes because they are mostly vegetable, bean, and pasta based. There is some dairy - mostly for the desserts - and a little tofu.

Many books tend to be full of recipes which may seem to complicated for the everyday cook, but Ms. Allrich has mastered the ability to share down-to-earth recipes which a cook with any ability can easily create.The list of ingredients to keep in one's pantry was very helpful. The separation by Season is very logical. Various produce comes available at different times. As a gardener, I am already planning for meals with ingredients which are not yet harvested."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tragically neglected classic","review":"Rhys is best-known for \\"Wide Sargasso Sea,\\" which is a wonderful book but the least important of her novels. I recommend picking up all four of Rhys' early novels but this is my personal favorite. Rhys is a brilliant writer who can say more in a sentence than many authors can say in a chapter--and she makes you feel more in a word than many authors achieve in a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"After Reading this Book","review":"Sorry to burst everyone else's bubble. I thought the first 1/3 or so of the book was excellent. Rhys was able to develop the characters, although writing in a 'minimilist' style. However - the rest just went on, and on, granted, she created a great sense of this woman's life; but that's all she did. It was so drab - life was so bad - there was SO much more the author could have done. Like 'flesh out' the relationship she had had with her Mom; explain WHY Julia couldn't stand people, etc. Even if she had Julia moving even MORE away from people, and created that more deeply 'untrustworthy' feeling she had - but no. Also - why was the man, Mr. Horstworthy(?) attracted to her. She should have developed that character - did he fight in the war and it changed him to help those in need? Did he have a sister who was depressed all the time? Rhys just kept 'repeating' herself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Playbook","review":"I loved the book. It is essentialy the playbook of the Conservatives. She basically says that the redistribution of wealth starting in the Roosevelt era and with the Unions, has allowed the middle and lower classes more free time and money. There existence is no longer dependant on prayer and have fallen into moral disolution. Her solution is to redistribute the wealth back to the rich, let religon have a larger role in government, and allow big business to buy back governemnt.

She also cuts references' contexts, so that her point is made (even if the reference is not quite on the same line of thinking).After completing the book, I must admit that it's a wonderful thing to always be right.

Try Mora's Modern Rhythimists for a more exciting 30's recreation band."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE END OF MUSIC AS WE KNOW IT!","review":"I mean that in the best possible way. Zeni Geva will be sorely missed, and this is my favorite of their many records. Seriously BRUTAL interplay between free-jazz drums and tweo guitars: one washed-out psychedelic guitar and one brittle Steve Albini-ish \\"ching ching\\" type. The vocals consist mainly of shouted/grunted/whispered chants, some in English and some in Japanese, and the combined result is sort of like a mix of the Swans, Godflesh, Big Black, Slayer, Cop Shoot Cop, Sepultura, as well as Os Mutantes, Goblin, Naked City, and the Ruins...NOBODY sounds like Zeni Geva, and NOBODY who loves the sort of metal that bludgeons you (when it isn't caressing you) should be without this record.Download the sample of \\"Dead Sun Rising\\" and you will see exactly why I am gushing over this obscure Japanese noiserock band.

He had never told me this before, and I was pleasantly surprised. I pin-pointed him as more of a early Tom Waits music kind of guy, so I bought him Heart of Saturday Night. It's a beautiful, fun, jazzy album that never goes out of style. We all had a great time listening to it together as background music.

Two songs are enough to say it a masterpiece \\"San Diego Serenade\\" and \\"drunk on the moon\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as \\"Closing Time\\"","review":"This record is dominated by the slightly derivative style that Waits spent about half of \\"Closing Time\\" working on -- the 40s' jazzy pop tune. Lyrically, this record is less about love and more about the poetic description of the nightlife, but there are still no narratives and little musical innovation. The songs themselves are often sketchy and soundalike -- in fact, very little sticks with you afterwards with a few exceptions: the spoken \\"Diamonds On My Windshield\\" and \\"the Ghosts of Saturday Night,\\" the simple, moving \\"Heart of Saturday Night\\" and the sweet \\"San Diego Serenade.\\" This isn't to say that the album isn't enjoyable, it's just that Waits hadn't found his groove yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the Tom formula","review":"Great backup! Tom, of course careens through every tune skillfully. One might even think this guy is for real, but alas, it's an act. He's \\"in character\\" (i.e.acting out the part of leering wino/poet) and he's REALLY believable, but it's an illusion. A talented illusionist. Did somebody call me liar? I remember when Tom was a folksinger...seriously, I even saw him a few times in and around L.A., he switched routines and this one brought in the coin, so he stuck with it.His backup band is pure gold...and Tom's dusky, whiskey and tobacco vocals would cut through any mud. These were great LP's (remember those) to drink beer to on those long cold Alaskan nights...long ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tom Wait's Best Work","review":"I give a full 5 stars here.

Waits's beatnik schtick could get old, and he developed into a much more musically adventurous songwriter in later years, but his second album contains some of his best early work, including the sweet romantic blues of \\"New Coat of Paint\\" (\\"You wear a dress baby, I'll wear a tie\\"), and his best hipster recitation, \\"Diamonds on My Windshield.\\" Two songs are enduring classics: the doleful, dirge-like \\"San Diego Serenade\\" (\\"Never saw the morning till I stayed up all night\\") and the touchingly sweet \\"(Looking for) The Heart of Saturday Night\\" (\\"Stoppin' on the red, goin' on the green, \`cause tonight'll be like nothin' that you've ever seen\\"). --John Milward"},{"rating":"2","title":"classic early tom!","review":"Although \\"Swordfishtrombone\\" and \\"Bone Machine\\" are superior artistic statements, this is a sentimental favorite of mine.

Waits'voice is at once familiar and comforting and his jazz-tinged blues sound is rich and vibrant. His use of horns is tasteful and hypnotic. This is late night, early morning music when you can't get to sleep and you can't stop thinking about that special someone and what it feels like to have her arms wrapped around you on a cold night."},{"rating":"2","title":"His best!","review":"This is a superb follow-up to \\"Closing Time\\". His best collections of songs by a country mile. There is so much variety here, beautiful ballads and jazz-inflected swingers.

It's not just the episodes that are great but the DVD has 4 EPISODES!!!!!!! They are Joey VS. Bandit Keith(Part 1-2) and Yugi VS.Joey(1-2). The special features include Monster info and a Duelist bio for Bandit Keith. The episodes and special features get 5 stars.

So I find it hard to believe that I am the first one to review this book! It is exquisitely written, and the various threads will keep you fascinated trying to figure out how they'll fit together at the end. It's a weird premise for a popular novel, granted - \\"...an explosive novel of wolves, ecopolitics, oil, and murder\\" says the cover - but it doesn't require an ecological bent to appreciate this masterful work. Well, I'm off to find MORE David Poyer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Between the Spaces...","review":"I picked up this book with some interest as I grew curious after hearing Rose Mary Salum in the launching of her new magazine called \\"Visible Magazine\\". I thought \\"Entre los Espacios\\" is an excellent book containing various short stories that intertwine dreams with reality and poetic prose with fiction. These stories are about people from the streets, godesses and reflect a measureless imagination. I definitely recommend this book to everyone.

It is made better by the fact that it is almost impossible to get lost on the Everest or Gokyo treks. The author is in love with himself and spends lots of time describing things that have nothing to do with you finding the trail. The maps are hand written and not to scale. If it weren't obvious you might get lost. Unfortunately books like lonely planet focus on all of the Nepal treks and therefore are not as in depth."},{"rating":"2","title":"superb","review":"This is a great performance of Bach's lovely secular cantata, made before Period Instrument mania set in. Here are modern instruments played with a good sense of Bach style, and excellent, light solo voices using vibrato but fully suited to the music. The gentlemen men are fine and the ladies are superb: the incomparable Helen Donath at the beginning of her career, and Elisabeth Speiser, a Swiss soprano who should have been better-known. Speiser, who reminds me of Arleen Auger, almost steals the show with the most beautiful rendition of \\"Sheep May Safely Graze\\" that I've heard. A warning to aficionados of 'period' style: the singers use almost no ornamentation. Rilling is at his best and the solo instruments are characterful, including that delightfully quacky oboe. An enjoyable bonus is the concerto, BWV 1053, in a rendition for oboe and strings. This is one of my favorite records; it never ceases to give pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sexy","review":"I like this one, but it would have been better on it's own with another character. Less than one chapter of this book has anything to do with the series. I also didn't like the ending. The bad guys should have had more punishment imo. Sexiness carries this book. This might be the sexiest book under the V.C. name. Others have better romance, but this one carries more appeal. Possible releationships spring out from a boyfriend, and the foster mother as you try and figure her out. For me the wierd foster mother stole the show.

Well this book barely touches on the life of Celeste- she is only in one scene of the book, and she is locked away in a mental institution. Baby Celeste is nothing of the pragmatic youth we see in Black Cat. She seems to be an ordinary girl(which is a breath of fresh air) but the story has very little plot, the resolution is so calcualted it is insulting and the ending......well there is very little I can say about the ending without seeming crude, angry and snobbish. All and all I believe Black Cat is a pulitzer winning book in comparison to this novel. The ghost writer doesnt even try to caputre the essence of V.C. Andrews. Dont even waste your time on such nonsense. Dont even read it for free in a bookstore- pick up another V.C. Andrews book. This one is by far the worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a piece of trash!","review":"Thank God I didn't buy this book, I borrowed it from a friend. As soon as I started reading it, its slow pace just made me gag, especially with Baby Celeste's idiocy showing up every time, what an annoying naive little twit. The beginning was kind of decent, explaining her early life and such, but there come the adoptive parents, the rich house, and other things that may make this like yet another \\"Laguna Beach\\" episode.And what the ph*ck is it with rape now? First there were brothers and even random strangers in past series, now a Grandpa, to make it even more gross?Also, the ending was so rushed. The only character I cared about (Celeste Sr.) only appears in like a couple of lines, and her story isn't even clear.Seriously, GW needs to stop.

My favorite take-away is that Schein made an abstract concept much more concrete. He creates a nice framework to view org. culture, gives examples continuously and provides many nuggets of knowledge. Plenty of useful references are given as well.Perhaps because of my specific research, I unfortunately found myself with sporadic tabs through the book to catch the aforementioned nuggets. My unfulfilled hope was to find a more meaningful figure in which to place all the various interactions and cultural process (but perhaps that's for us other researchers to do). More up-to-date examples would also be useful.In the end, a great read and even better reference book (but you'll have to do the organizing)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shein on organizational culture","review":"This book is the text for a course in leadership I am taking in graduate school at Northeastern University.

Up to this point, I had suspended my judgment on the pernicious poet, but now I no longer straddle the fence on this issue. The title poem promises insight and melancholy, but quickly strays into a graphic erotic narrative involving his last several pets (all of which died mysterious deaths). The associative peregrinations he offers attempt to travel the road between the heart and the mind but never make it past his throbbing libido. I understand that he is a \\"surrealist,\\" but this slab of perversions is much too real for me. Tate is an unholy cross between Neitzche and Andy Griffith, and frankly, the only way you may possibly glean something from this tour de FARCE is if you don your standard issue goth trenchcoat and hit the local coffee house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Menthol Rocks Hard!!!!","review":"Menthol is one of the best bands going.

Interested in the the building, its neighborhood, and its original milieu, I began to read. To my dismay, I found that Roiphe's book is primarily a recounting of a series of embarrassing and painful episodes from the author's privileged past: foolish and unlikable people hurting themselves and each other, again and again. Except perhaps as catharsis for the author, the point of the exercise is unclear: there are no insights to be found here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and cloying!","review":"Anne Roiphe has been boring us for years in her columns in the NY Observer and her books. This new book is no exception. Her style, if that is what you call her way of writing, is so precious and overblown that you want to scream after reading a sentence.Besides, she has little nice to say about her parents or her brother, and a kind soul would keep all that to herself. She justifies her writing by claiming that as a writer, she needs to express herself in her book. What nonsense! My suggestion is to remember that she \\"ain't\\" no Virginia Woolf nor even Patty Bosworth, and we could all live happily enough without knowing what went on at some upper middle class apartment on Park Avenue. I suggest she write something challenging for once, that is about something which does not include Anne Roiphe as the center of the universe.

Again she offers personal and political gossip (social history, if you will) against a background of local and world history. But here there is more: a cry from the heart. Father is savage and physically absent. Mother is self centered and incompetent. Treachery and betrayal abound. Attended by an army of maids, governesses, nurses, doctors, and psychoanalysts, she, her younger Brother and the others survive for a while but at a price. In the end, only she remains.

I havent given it my full attention yet, but seeing how much it has helped me in just the little time i used it, i am excited to put my heart completely into it.My one complaint is that there are time that it is a little hard to follow. I had to take a single lesson with a local SLS teacher to help me with one aspect of the program. Otherwise, it is entertaining and fun.

Don't be fooled by this. The only way this program will help you dramatically is if you are a complete beginner or have never sang before. The lip rolls and tongue trills are great for warming up, but who needs a $200 warm up? I never increased my range one bit and I worked at this program religiously 5-6 days a week. He puts no emphasis on breathing or resonance, or rib expansion, which is singing 101. I'm not saying that the program is all bad, but I'm saying that Brett Manning is not half of what he claims to be, and you will NOT be singing like any of those people in his DVD. Every one of these people were born singers and for taking credit for their talents that makes him a phony.

A couple weeks after receiving Singing Success, I decided this product was not what was expected and returned the set in perfect condition. This was over 2 months ago (return-receipt confirmed).

I ended up buying it because the little tips just weren't enough! I learned how my voice worked, the simple and silly-sounding exercises gave me more knowledge than anything.

In this book, as always, her characters are wonderful. The hero and heroine belong together as much as Matty attempts to deny it. How in the world can she resist the gorgeous and brilliant and charming Dave? He had me when he ordered her bouquet. Ms. McLinn takes us to lovely Knighton, Wyoming and dumps the reader into a prairie of wonderful people. I love the dialogue. I love Ms. McLinn's clever and humourous phrases. She is a talented writer. I highly recommend this book.Jane Myers Perrine"},{"rating":"2","title":"almost a bride","review":"this book is farely fast to read . the action is good. this is a story about some times we see only one way to solve a problem"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book for relaxing","review":"I enjoyed this story. I found it to be somewhat predictible, yet still fun to read. The two main characters have known each other all of their lives. Their young romance ends and they don't see much of each other for almost six years. During that time they both grow up and change, yet the attraction is still there. I like watching them reconnect. I can't award this one five stars as I feel that jumping into marriage for the reason they do is a little on the unbelievable side. I also probably won't remember this book beyond today although I did enjoy it. I would not recommend this book for any young adult readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awww.

People change, but when the love is suppose to be, neither time or distance can change that attraction. Dave let Matty go because people basically told him it was the right thing to do if he loved her. Being a responsible person who loved Marty he did, thinking you let someone go and if the really love you, they\`'ll come back. The problem being Matty ends up going wings and being independent but still pining for her true love. Cute romantic story, and of course with everyone giving an opinion. Small town interference, but out of love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed this book","review":"This is a lovely story with plenty of relationships twists.

I couldn't put it down. I read a lot and enjoy many different genres, and this is a fantastic example of a contemporary romance that really gets it right. Amazing chemistry between the main characters, well-drawn secondary characters, swift moving (but not rushed!) plot, satisfactory ending. I felt very connected to and invested in the characters, which doesn't happen often to me when reading romances.The only reason this review isn't five stars is because sometimes the writing was over the top cheesy.

It seems like she should have had a pretty good idea after running away for 6 years before she came back.The end of the book is so sappy it will make you sick.I am so sorry I have to give this low of a review.

Diminishing Quality . . .","review":"First, I must state that the Sarah Jane Adventures are all superb and may many more be produced . . . The concern I have is that with each new release, the number of discs have diminished. Season one had 4 discs, season two had 3 discs and season three has only 2 discs. It seems that the production company has elected to produce lower quality long playing discs as well as eliminate most of the extras. (I purchased the BBC UK version and my review is based upon the same. The forthcoming USA version appears to have been produced similarly and potential consumers may wish to evaluate whether or not it will be worth your investment considering that the video has been significantly compressed to fit on only two discs compared to the first series' four and the second series' three discs.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wrong Season but possibly better","review":"Funny, in reference to Season 4, when I downloaded Season Three from Amazon on March 12 and 13.

The mangas were based ON the anime, so they should come first. The information in the books, in the form of flashbacks, really only make sense after viewing those anime episodes. Otherwise it may not make senseThe artwork is good, the story is smooth but the action is sometimes hard to follow. The fight scenes can get right down confusing.

It is up to Yumiko to protect her.R.O.D. Read or Die has an interesting concept (people who love something so intensely that they control it), but the story isn't all that interesting. There's a lot of sexual tension and \\"fan service\\", but the art style is not unique and the action scenes are too much.

As for the next R.O.D. volume, I'll skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"completely different","review":"The storyline in the manga pre-dates the orginal anime release and the television production. It involves a few of the character in the original but only a couple. The manga leaves the orginal fan base and delves into new territoy, leaving a bad taste in my mouth.

So what I did was wrap a rubber band around the little metal piece, and that holds it close to the body of the unit.

The brass at times overplays and is very blatty. The vocalists quite often sound very forced ( either the part is at the edge of their range and trying to force it out, or they are just shouting to try and sound louder ) At times the chorus parts are off just a smidgen ( both in notes and in timing ) which really stick out to a more trained ear.

But to be really honest, if you watch the English version, then go back and watch the Japanese, it doesn't make a lot of difference ^_^The final round, the fight between Team Urameshi and Team Tugoro, is finally beginning, and the battle between Karasu and Kurama is the most beautiful fight in the world, so this is still definately worth buying. Don't miss out on this great action in Yu Yu Hakusho!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Battle in YYH Series","review":"I am a big Kurama fangirl, and this dvd is definetly for those who are a fan of the red-headed plant master or his sly kitsune side. This dvd contains both parts of the Kurama vs. Karasu battle, and lemme tell you- wow. Karasu's mind games, Kurama's plants, Yoko coming out for a chance at Karasu, bombs, and lotsa blood. Definetly for us action-addicted YYH fans. Dvd contains 3 episodes, but they don't tell you the result of the battle- they leave that for the next dvd. Although the result is quite a shocker... but I won't ruin it for those who haven't seen it yet. You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Yu Yu DVD EVER!!!!!!!!!!","review":"First let me say, Yusuke, Hiei(he's hecka cool) and mainly Kuwabara have NOTHING! NOTHING! Compared to Kurama. He is SO awesome in this DVD! Karasu is such a jerk blowing him up like that!(did that make you want to see more?) Anyway, I am a huge,huge,HUGE fan of Kurama and if you are also I ask you one question: WHY HAVEN'T YOU GOTTEN THIS YET!? Youko is so cut throat it sent shivers down my spine!

I would much rather listen to \\"Grimm and Bear It\\".Of all the Sunn recordings, I believe this to be their best. \\"Flight of the Behemoth\\" is huge, as is \\"00 Void\\" but this is the one currently on heavy rotation. Lately I can't get enough of this genre, whatever it is we call it. earth2, Boris \\"Absolutego\\" and all the Sunn stuff has taken me down the path of spiritual awakening.

The same applies to \\"The Grimmrobe Demos\\". If your first exposure to Sunn O))) was listening to \\"Black One\\" and you're looking for more of the same music, don't look here. This is Sunn O))) at their most primitive. No vocals, no black metal type overtones, just dark, heavy drone."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Sunn, but I couldn't stand this","review":"I love Sunn and Earth. But this cd bored me so much that I had to sell it. Simply put, this was missing the subtlety and maturity that are behind Sunn's other stuff that makes it interesting. It really did feel like they were just playing riffs (or whatever you'd call it) without the sensibility that keeps it from being trite and makes it profoundly affecting and absorbing. I still come back to the beginning to The Flight of the Behemoth with a lump in my throat ( you know where it sort of \\"kicks in\\"? ), but Grimmrobe had no moments like this. But at the same time, I could see someone digging this, because it isn't BAD: it is heavy after all."},{"rating":"2","title":"DRONE","review":"This album is huge and better than anything your band will ever make, hail Anderson and O'Mally.

Not only that the rest of this album is also amazing. Definately one of the funnest albums I've ever listened to. To me Tsu Shi Ma Mi Re sounds kinda like a mix between Shonen Knife and Ex-girl.

Great song to PoGo too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Album Badly Recorded","review":"This is an album I loved on LP back in the Eighties. I bought it with great anticipation, but beware the \\"Bargain Series\\" sticker on the front. \\"Bargain\\", in this context, appears to mean, \\"We saved money by not doing any re-mastering and pass the savings on to you!\\"This is an AAD disk, which means that the original analog master was simply digitized. A better process is ADD, whereby the analog tracks undergo a final digital mix before the digital master is put on disk. Regardless, there is a noticeable lack of high frequency energy on this CD. It sounds a lot better than the LP does but not nearly as good as it could have.

However, I find a random orbit sander difficult to use on the edge of boards and in corners.The Makita sander fills in where my Dewalt is lacking. Don't get me wrong the Makita is a wonderful finishing sander for the face of boards too but I am not a gifted woodworker and enjoy the forgiveness of the random orbit sander.The only problem I have had is the plastic frame for the dust bag. The frame broke as I was replacing the dust bag. I don't know if it was cracked from the manufacturer or if I broke it. I am going to contact Makita and will let you know if their customer service is good or lacking.Very slow on the update!!Contacted Makita and had a new frame shipped to the local Makita service center.

But if I had to buy only one for general purpose use, this is the one I would choose. It has amazing power and can really remove wood when you want to, it is very light which makes it versatile and the price is super for what you get.Loading new paper is a little tricky at first and the design could be improved, but once you get the knack of it there is no problem. Also, the dust bag must be Makita's little joke since nobody would take the time to make it work.

This book is a constant source of 'factual' information, dates, names, places and people and though my issue runs to three hundred and sixty pages and two hundred and thirty seven illustrations it is still a handy portable size. John Hale has edited a long list of Ren. scholars contributions into an easy, succinct style of writing with each entry in the Encyclopaedia having references to source material and further reading.

The movie was lovely and the soundtrack was equally enjoyable. I watched the movie with my daughter (now a junior in college) and listening to the soundtrack brings back many of the fellings from the film. My favorite track has to be \\"Dance With Us\\"; after all, it doesn't get much better than dancing Baboons and the Wedgie Dance at the same time. For the complete experience, you may want to look at \\"The Wild Thornberrys Movie: Original Motion Picture Score\\". The ASIN is B00008OM6P for those who are interested. It includes the actual movie opening theme, \\"Bridge To The Stars\\". Keep in mind it doesn't contain the contemporary music but rather, the film score.

Unlike far too many soundtracks which often have one or two memorable songs, this one has at least a good handful. Paul Simon starts it off with \\"Father and Daughter\\", his first soundtrack contribution in almost a decade. The remix of Peter Gabriel's \\"Shaking the Tree\\" is decent, though not as good as the original or even the 1997 remix from the film Jungle 2 Jungle. Wes' \\"Awa Awa\\" is a touching African tune which would fit right in The Lion King. Also appearing on this diverse soundtrack are new songs featuring artists such as P. Diddy, Sting, and the Baha Men. My favorite track by far is Peter Gabriel's \\"Animal Nation\\", a fascinating, atmospheric song inspired by Gabriel's studies of bonobo apes and their intelligence.

She was a wonder, from Clouds, Song to a Seagull through For the Roses and Blue....some good bits on Hissing, Court and Spark, and Hejira. I try not to be closed-minded about artistic evolution (all my favorite artists do it); but here is little discernible effort at the craft of songwriting as I understand it. No rhythm, no melody, mainly just sadness and a sense of hystrionics. When I bought this decades ago, I feared Los Angeles had finally destroyed her. I have heard a few tracks of her work since this album, and it seems true.Now, for all the people that give this such great reviews, I wonder if they really find it likable enough to play often and return to. If so, that's great. My ears can't imagine it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I have never heard joni before this... well, i know she is usually singing slow songs where the focus is all on her voice... but i decided to try this album out and really like it alot... the music is very interesting and the melodies and words are quite good. i listen to it with astral weeks, blonde on blonde, grace, and sketches of spain... it holds up to that company very well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just doesn't do it for me","review":"I was such a huge fan of Joni's in the 1970s; 'Hejira' remains on my top ten all-time favorite album list (by anyone). 'Don Juan' really sank things for me back in 1978, and I hadn't listened to it probably 20 years. But I've been going through a Joni renaissance lately so I got the CD and figured I must have written it off too early. Sad to say, I think I was right the first time. It rambles and preaches and is almost completely lacking in melody. It has much more to do with 'Mingus' than 'Hejira' or 'Hissing.' I can see the ambition in 'Paprika Plains,' but it commits a cardinal sin in my book - it's just boring. I never cared much for her Geffen stuff, and unfortunately this is really the first salvo - a lot of it is formless and self-indulgent. I'm all for an artist evolving - Joni is the great example of that - but this one is going to the used CD store, and I am going to forget about it all over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Joni didn't get around to writing any tunes","review":"Apparently, she went into the studio with an acoustic guitar & Jaco Pastorius & not much else. There's one great track called OFF NIGHT BACKSTREET, which includes a fun recurring appearance of Jaco's high-register bass-pings. The title track is a mediocrity that uses a glissando bass-pulse. At the end of the title track, Joni threw in some background singing. Too little too late. The title track would've been a lot more interesting if it had contained her background singing all the way thru it. TALK TO ME is a pretty good song lyric. Unfortunately there's no tune attached to it. Which raises the obvious question: is TALK TO ME deliberately tuneless for the purpose of expressing the desperation of the narrator?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Failed Experiment","review":"AS a avid Joni Mitchell fan I always looked forward to every album she released. For me, the lady could do no wrong. After all, she created such masterworks as, \\" Blue\\" and \\"Court & Spark\\". But, this album left me confused and cold. There was no passion, only failed musical experiments. The songs go nowhere. Their messages are unclear and esoteric. Joni was, I suppose, trying to expand her muse, but in the process created a artistic mess. The title cut is the only saving grace on this double album. Double album? A little indulgent of the lady I must say. This album foreshadowed her 80s and 90s failures."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great pimp","review":"I really can't get into this album, but the cover is the best. Joni makes a very convincing pimp, and has all the moves. She can protect me anytime."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ultimate Feel Good Party Album","review":"This album is so light and accessible, perfect music to be listening to as you cruise along the beach, with the top down on your car. I promise you with one listen, you'll be humming along with a big smile on your face, marvelling at Joni's brevity and economy as a composer and wordsmith, in awe of how she can resist the temptation to create pretensious and longwinded songs that one could listen to a million times, but still never truly understand and enjoy. Thank you so much Joni, you've created the ultimate party record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Madness!","review":"I love this album. Joni Mitchell seems to have followed her instincts into some strange, dark, obsessive place and I am, sometimes, willing to follow her there. Yes, this album can be hard to digest, but there are times when the title track is stuck in my head and only a sledgehammer could dislodge it. I think Joni Mitchell would be a difficult but fascinating friend. For the record, we are not friends. I am difficult, too, but less talented."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliance times Two","review":"The spectacular collaboration of singer-songwriter Joni and mega-bassist Jaco shines as brightly here as on the landmark Hejira. The fusion of folk, jazz and orchestration holds up three decades later because of Joni's lyrics and Jaco's licks. Don't miss Shadows and Light on CD and DVD, which also features Pat Metheny."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hit or miss? It's a HIT!","review":"Joni Mitchell's Don Juan's Reckless Daughter is a masterpiece. That being said, for most this album seems to miss. First the cons, Paprika Plains goes on too long. I like the track, but it grows rather tiresome, the same goes for The Tenth World, which is fun for awhile but follows down the same road. Now the pros, the remaining seven tracks, all terrific! Off Night Back Street sounds like everything a hit-single sould sound like, and it sould have been one. I love Dreamland, one people like to piss on, for reasons unknown to me. Talk To Me is great, love Jericho. The opening-track Overture/Cotton Avenue, like a lot of Joni's songs, paints vivid pictures in your mind. This is a great album, one I hope you will give a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"High concept","review":"I read this after Severance Package and The Blonde, so it has a much different pace and style than I was expecting. I enjoyed it, but it wasn't the fast read that the others are. I appreciated the innovative concept of the book, and the fact that the author didn't try to make you understand every detail of how things happened. The characters multiplied too quickly for me, though - this often happens with suspense novels - by the end of it, I had to keep reminding myself who was who in order to keep up with the action!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product!","review":"Carters Yellow Giraffe Snuggle Buddy is my 5 1/2 month old daughter's favorite toy.

The story is of a team of Ghost Hunters who take a job with one very haunted house. The movie is done on a tight budget but they make it work for them. The story works on two levels of horror which is nice and adds to the realistic feel of the film. There are one or two of the actors that are not very convincing but overall it still works. If you are tired of Hollywood horror and gore and ready for something legitimately creepy, check this one out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost creepy, but not quite","review":"REality like the Blair Witch Project, purports to be based on the final journal entries of a ghost hunter investigating a haunted house. The premise could have been fun, but there were a couple of problems. First the audio was really lousy - volume turned all the way up and could still barely hear the dialogue in many of the scenes. Second, the acting was pretty horrific, I've seen high school drama delivered more convincingly. Third (okay, more than a couple), the reveal of the truth behind the haunting wasn't handled all that well. It really seemed like, \\"okay, we have to tell the audience what really happened now, because there is now way we could have shown them that prior to this.\\" The ultimate destination of a the ghost hunter was kind of fun, though. One warning, although not anti-christian (at least I wouldn't consider it so), it does not deal kindly with a certain kind of fundamentalist view point, and could be considered offensive to some."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti Christian Crap!","review":"Anti Christian propaganda of the worst kind!!Did not appreciate this. I like creepy movies but this was just unnecessary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepy film! As good as Paranormal Activity","review":"I don't get the average 3-star rating here of this creepy haunted house thriller. For me, this was as interesting and every bit as entertaining as \\"Paranormal Activity\\" so I also don't get why the movie isn't known about by most horror fans. The only negative I could find with this film is that the acting was not so great and in a few scenes it felt like actors reciting lines. Nonetheless, that didn't keep the film from creeping me out and if you want to see a modern day haunted house/ghost investigator semi-\\"reality-based\\" film that delivers the chills, be sure to check this out. I'm hoping that the film will pick up some notoriety in the future as an under-rated gem of a haunted house movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Anti-Christian Movie.","review":"Don't waste your time watching this movie. I can break it down in two sentences.1) Christians are bad.2) Ghosts are bad too, but not as bad as Christians.Bad acting (except for Carter) and no thrills or scares. The \\"twist\\" was so pedestrian and obvious it might as well not have been included. If you want a good 'hand held camera' thriller, tryThe Blair Witch Project,CloverfieldorGeorge A.

The police would've ripped that house apart after the \\"murder/suicide\\" trying to find anything in the families history that would have led to the \\"crime\\". It would have been dragged into the media to show the facade that the \\"good\\" family had. No \\"creepy\\" moments for me at all. It could have been an interesting story if done right. This however, was so wrong in every way. The \\"actors\\" were just horrible! Overacting to the point of comedy.

Well recommended and easy to read"},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Fagan's 'Rape of the Nile'","review":"Fagan is a solid writer, as I said elsewhere. I love his conversational style : it does well to capture the diaries he uses as source material for his histories. His writing recalls all the best aspect of travel literature--adventure--but he also offers a rigorous, critical attitude. I consider Fagan a historian of bad history.

After all, her Elmo toothbrush got her to brush her teeth, maybe Elmo could work some magic here too?I guess it's ok. She likes it ok, but she has never asked to watch it or anything. However, I was really disturbed by it, mostly because Elmo's dad sounds exactly like \\"Chef\\" from South Park (Isaac Hayes). It is uncanny, so much so that I had to check the credits to see who did the voice. As a result (and especially because of the subject matter), I spent the entire time watching it expecting Elmo's dad to say something really inappropriate.Of course, I know this is my problem and not my kid's. But, I know other parents that had the same reaction and were similarly disturbed. And there are probably better potty training DVD's out there anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Movie Smells Like Going to the Potty","review":"This film is horrible.

She would always go potty when we put her on it and were starting to get discouraged. She loves Elmo videos and I ordered this one not knowing it would keep her attention so much. She wanted to watch it 5-6 times a day and all of the sudden, she ran to the bathroom about a week later and we haven't had any accidents since. We had tried everything, including keeping her naked which kind of helped. I fully believe this video pushed her over the edge and made her want to be like Elmo and use the potty. I don't think dookie is such a bad term as I am sure my daughter will learn much worse at school in a few years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elmo scores with Potty Time!!!","review":"As a whole I was satisfied with this video! We have just started training our twin 23 month old boys and I needed something to motivate them. Elmo has truly helped by filling them in with ALL the details. They cover everything from making sure you go when you feel the urge to clean up afterwards. There are also many musical numbers which are catchy and fun! A few of them have a real bluesy feel and my husband and I laugh when they are stuck in our heads and we can't get them out. It is true that there are fillers in there, but my boys and I find them clean and entertaining. I am even glad to see that some of them have the old school Sesame Street feel. I really screen what they watch and they have been exposed to VERY little so I feel that the comments about this video being inappropriate are going to vary from viewer to viewer. To top it all of my sons definitely showed more motivation and improvement with the potty after viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Instructive","review":"My son enjoys watching and reading about Elmo but this DVD could not keep him interested. If you are looking for a DVD that goes through detailed steps about using the potty and toilet training this isn't the one for you. It is not straight forward which is what I think younger toddlers need in order to understand how the potty works. The program, for the most part, beats around the bush, dealing with matters such as everybody needs to use the bathroom, showing metaphors to keep trying even though it seems difficult and how other people use different words in reference to \\"pee\\" and \\"poo\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"no more diapers!","review":"I bought this DVD for my two year daughter. She had already loved Elmo, so I thought that this would be a great help in potty training. I think that is entertaining more than teaching. So, overall I didn't find it really helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"not helpful, my kid wasn't interested in watching more than 20 seconds","review":"This video doesn't seem like normal Sesame Street quality entertainment, and that's what it needs to be in order for kids to watch. Entertaining and informing. Sadly, this video falls short of both. I've tried 2x to get my kid to watch this video and it doesn't last beyond 20 seconds and he gets up and does something else. I can see why: there's probably about 10-15% of the video actually showing potty time, and the remainder of the video is not evening interesting. I was hoping for a fun video that just shows Sesame Street characters doing \\"stuff\\" with or around the potty to help my child realize that the potty's not a bad thing. I wasn't looking for instructions. But people/puppets talking to each other without even a potty chair in the picture is meaningless. As is the kids or animals in a park. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cute!","review":"This DVD is really cute and helpful for little ones learning how to potty. My kids love it and will watch it over and over.

She finds it interesting and enjoys watching it and I like that they explain that everyone calls going to the bathroom different things. After watching this twice she was not afraid to use the 'big girl toilet' (with kiddie seat attached) to go number 2. I bought it because someone at the DMV told me their child watched it once and immediately started using the potty, well I didn't have such great results, but every child is different, and I don't expect her to switch right away. Plus kids always love Elmo."},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong age group","review":"I think this video is aimed more for 3 - 4 year olds. My youngest is a little over 2 1/2 and loves Elmo. He's showing signs for potty learning (and has used his little potty a few times) so I thought this video and a bright new RED potty would be fun this Christmas, but we didn't even get through this video. It *talks* about using the potty but doesn't really show anything... unless it's all near the end (don't know cuz we put on Curious George).I guess we'll try it again in a few days or weeks but it's pretty lame for Elmo. Nothing like how informative Elmo's World episodes are. Just a lot of talking and some silly songs. I recommend making this video like Elmo's World.

While she has not started using her potty chair regularly yet. this video keeps her trying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally worthless","review":"As another reviewer mentioned, this DVD is absolutely worthless: out of the 45 minutes of singing and talking, less than 10 sec of potty footage is being shown (which, for a toddler, is what is needed to encourage potty training). My daughter got bored after 5 minutes of watching this DVD. Why are they so shy of showing Elmo sitting on the toilet?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a lot of potty training content.","review":"This is a cute Elmo video w/ lots of singing and dancing about the potty, but there is no real instruction on how to use the potty, so it's not very instructional. My daughter likes the video, but it did not help us to potty train at all.One part of the video that really bothers me is during the segment where Elmo and his friends discuss all the different words for pee and poop. They use a word for poop (dookie) that really bothers me personally, and after my daughter said it a few times, I decided to get rid of the video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice, but with negative side effects","review":"If you watch Sesame Street regularly, you are probably familiar with Baby Bear and his ridiculously put-on speech impediment. Be warned - he is almost as prominent in this video as Elmo. My primary disappointment was that, by the end of our second viewing, my 3yr old (who speaks quite well) started pronouncing his \\"r\\"s just like Baby Bear! VERY FRUSTRATING! Add to that - the video has very few actual examples of pottying. Also, it doesn't hold my children's attention beyond the first half. We will be returning this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOOOO Potty Training HERE!!!!","review":"First of all, the video itself is okay, and probably entertaining to most children. Older children, would probably actually \\"understand\\" the video. But, as for POTTY TRAINING content... it would have received \\"0\\" Stars, if I was basing it on that alone. I agree with another reviewer who suggested having Elmo and the other puppets actually ON a potty more frequently."},{"rating":"2","title":"omg","review":"me and my husband listened to this dvd play in our car so much we still to this day walk around casually singing potty time songs. addictive and possibly productive"},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't believe how effective Elmo is!!!!","review":"We recently purchased Elmo's -Potty Time- about a week ago. We started the potty training process by letting her watch the movie a few times a day (Morning, Lunch & in the Evening) I can't believe it, our little girl just got up during the movie and sat on her little potty and went!!! YEAH. I'm sure all your parents out there can relate and understand the amazing feeling of your childs accomplishments.Good Luck :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"This dvd did not interest our 2 1/2 year old. she wouldn't even sit and watch it.

My kid asks to watch her \\"Elmo potty movie,\\" so I can't give this one star, but it's so saccharine and doesn't really delve into the issues. Rather it talks about hand washing and two Muppets have an argument about whether wiping, flushing the toilet and washing/drying hand is three things or four."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomprehensible singing spoils good idea.","review":"Our daughter loves Elmo and we have a number of his DVDs. Regrettably this particular episode is let down by poorly pronounced English; making it good for entertainment but poor as a potty training tool. The word pronunciation is reminiscent of the 1980s Fat Albert cartoons.The possible fault is that the makers already knew the song lyrics before the lyrics were recorded in song. For we adults who do not already know the lyrics, they are almost incomprehensible - making it fully incomprehensible to a toddler.The most effective potty training video we have seen is \\"Potty Power\\" also available on Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"No longer afraid","review":"My nephew was afraid of the toliet sound whenever someone flushed so he didn't want anything to do with it.

We started potty training and my little boy got the concept almost right away. We watched our god son one night and because he is 6 months younger than my son I think that it hurt the process a little bit, so I bought this movie as an extra motivator for him. He loves it. It was that extra push to get him into telling me when he had to go instead of me asking. All I had to say was \\"see Elmo uses to potty\\" and he was fully on board. I would not recommend it for anyone who have very little tolerance for Elmo. But if you will walk through fire for your child then a little help from Elmo, and maybe some headache medicine for you, potty training is a little easier."},{"rating":"1","title":"SESAME STREET-ELMOS POTTY TIME","review":"TOO MUCH TALKING AND NOT ENOUGH \\"DOING\\"....IN FACT, NO SHOWING ANYONE ON THE POTTY...HARD TO GET THE CONCEPT W/O BEING ABLE TO SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING FOR A 2 YEAR OLD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Elmo Potty Time","review":"DVD works fine. i hate to put this in writting.The only concern was that the case had a stain on it that was unpleasant to see when the title of the video is potty time.

He requests to watch it...I don't even have to encourage him..he just comes up to me and says \\"watch Elmo potty training dvd\\". He loves it.Sure there is content that isn't quite related to potty training on it but for a kid who knows what to do but just needs an extra encouraging push from characters he knows, this is a great dvd.

He kept watching it over and over and is trying to use the potty more often."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK, but far from perfect","review":"I am slightly disappointed in the content of this video, it is a little corny, and uncomfortable to watch at times for adults. My daughter (2 1/2) gave it more positive feedback, as she does actually watch and talk about what she is seeing, but in the end, it hasn't really helped with potty training other than the fact that she LOVES Elmo, and she does at least watch it. Hopefully, she will eventually be interested in acting out what Elmo talks about doing on the video, instead of just watching and listening to it. We will see...."},{"rating":"1","title":"May have Elmo but... it's for older kids","review":"my daugher is adhd and is a visual learner and this put her to sleep. Yes it shows elmo on the potty in the beginning of the movie but then talks about using the potty for the rest of the movie. My daughter really enjoyed \\"go potty go\\" and \\" once upon a potty\\" with those two movies and one afternoon she's finally using the potty all by herself! word to the wise.. rent this from your local library and make sure it's right for your child... if it is then buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Accompaniment to Potty Training","review":"This is a great DVD! Potty training takes time and committment, but this DVD really helps to get children into the correct midnset. If you are looking for the DVD to do your job for you, then you may want to consider getting yourself into the right mindset as well. It seems like some reviewers don't realize that this DVD does, in fact, show Elmo on the potty! The very first song shows Elmo on the potty through the whole song! This DVD is produced in classic Sesame Street style, and it's highly reccommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"This DVD is a waste of time and money. Your kid will get the hang of it without watching this. I bought it and my boy may have watched it once.We all became potty-trained without videos telling us how to do it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"My daughter loves Elmo and I am very pro-Sesame Street so I thought this would be great. Not so! There is no instruction whatsoever about actual potty training except for a bit on washing hands at the end. They just dance around and talk about how great using the potty is (and that it's ok to have accidents) for 45 minutes! They also use many different words for pee and poo when what a kid needs is consistency. I think even my daughter could tell there was no content because normally she is mesmerized by Sesame Street and she really didn't care about this. Major disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids Love Elmo","review":"This video worked very well for my daughter who is 20 months and almost completly potty trained. We started potty training and she did ok but everytime she watches elmo, she wants to be like him and go pee pee poo poo in the big girl toilet. So it gives the kids some one to look up and he is good role model. So for the parent your kid learns to go potty which makes you proud and you save money on diapers. And for the kids it is a fun video to watch and the go potty on the big kid toilet which makes them feel good! It is a win win product for everyone a must have for potty training."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elmo at age 3 would have made more sense...","review":"I have two girls, 3 and almost 2, and they are both using the potty. They request this dvd occasionally when given a choice between all their Sesame Street and Elmo videos. I read some of the reviews and although after watching this many times I still have yet to see the scene with Elmo's Daddy without pants! For one reviewer this was a concern. But most of the time \\"monsters\\" do not wear any clothes so I am a bit confused on that one.I gave this four stars because since I missed the whole Muppet babies era it would have made more sense to me to have Elmo using the potty at his current age, which I believe is roughly 3 or 3 1/2, rather than a \\"baby\\" Elmo. Also, I think Elmo should have been seen on the potty more often as I think that would have been a big motivator. For them to see their beloved Elmo using the potty too!Overall the point is good and it is fun to watch. Having grown up with Sesame Street myself I have a renewed appreciation for the show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informational for my toddler","review":"I have a toddler girl who is not quite ready to train. This dvd is a wonderful introduction for her. I read the criticisms that the dvd introduces different names for pee pee and poo poo. That's wonderful! My child needs to know all the information she can get in order to understand the world! I want an educated child, not a child so protected that she is not comfortable with her body and the names for its functions. Let's face it, the body has basic functions and we all have to use the bathroom, so let's know what dookie means, what wee wee means, etc. Another criticism is that Elmo is only seen on the potty one time. My child is very observant, as all toddlers are, and she \\"gets\\" it from only one scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sesame Street - Elmo's Potty Time","review":"Potty training in our house has proven to be more labor than love. I bought this video upon the recommendation of several different friends. We are discriminatory with the TV and video watching that goes on in our house and I purchased this at a moment of desperation. That being said, this video was worth EVERY PENNY! It has helped my 2 1/2 year old daughter to understand a lot of the potty related concepts. She's kind of on the independent side [my nice way of saying stubborn] and willfully ignores me on all things potty training. I have a library of toddler parenting books that haven't helped me nearly as much as these puppets have."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is good if your kid likes Elmo","review":"My 18-month daughter likes Elmo, but she never finish the DVD. She loses her attention in the middle of the DVD. I am not sure if she is too young for the DVD. However, she started to know the concept of Poop-Pee. When she says Poop-pee, she will run to the bath room; eventhough, she doesn't feel like she wants to go. I haven't found any DVD that is better than this DVD for my daughter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Program even amusing for adults","review":"We have loved this video as well as our daughter. She was 19 months old when we ordered it and her interest peaked about potty training. It has been a big help."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAVE YOUR MONEY","review":"I agree with the other reviewers. THERE IS LITTLE IF ANY POTTY TRAINING CONTENT. Elmo and friends just chants \\"potty is good\\", \\"potty is cool\\", etc. throughout the overly long video. Can you really convince a toddler who has always been in diapers that just because \\"potty is cool\\" to go pee/poop in the toilet? I think not.The video is also overly long, close to an hour. My son who LOVES Elmo got bored after about 20 minutes. I am glad that I borrowed it from the library and didn't waste any money buying this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was hoping.....","review":"When I saw Elmo had a potty training video, I thought that would be the answer to all of our potty training woes. Not so. It didn't focus on the actual act of going to the potty very much at all. Hardly any bathroom scenes. Too much singing and superfluous fillers. My daughter lost interest almost immediately (as did I) and kept asking for a \\"different Elmo\\". This was not effective for us at all and I thought a very poor attempt at getting kids interested in the potty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope","review":"Daughter was completely bored and was doing everything else besides watching this DVD. So we were annoyed. Totally waste of money"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Inspiration for Using the Potty","review":"My 18-month old adores Elmo, so when we started potty training we got this video. She loves it! Especially helpful for us has been the segment where different kids say what they call \\"pee\\" and \\"poo.\\". It gets her talking about urine and BMs. Sometimes I think she doesn't want to admit that she does pee and poo, but when she sees the kids and Curly Bear talk about it, she feels it's OK. We also quote Grover a lot, \\"I've got that got to go feeling. I've got to go!\\". We watched the video multiple times as a family and it gave us a common, family vocab for talking about all that goes into using the potty. And I learned more than I knew before about bow toilet paper is made from the \\"Visit to the Factory\\" segment."},{"rating":"2","title":"good educational DVD","review":"Fun to watch and good educational source.

It did just what I needed it to do...get my son to use the potty! Thanks, Elmo :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Potty Training DVD","review":"DVD was in excellent condition, but the video is a little strange. I really do not feel that this video helped to potty train my child at all. He just liked to watch it so he could laugh when they said wee wee or woo woo. I believe that all children are different and and learn when they are ready. Having said that, this video may work for some kids, but did not work for mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Avery Loves Elmo","review":"My granddaughter is in love with Elmo so this certaintly was a good choice for her. What a fun companion to potty train with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really helpful for the potty training process","review":"Don't get me wrong, if your kids love Elmo, this is an entertaining show. But unfortunately, if you're using it to help and instruct your little ones on actually HOW to do it, and the PROCESS itself...this is NOT the show for them. I was most disappointed with the abstract song sequences. The point that these sequences are often trying to get across were totally lost on both my kids. I wish more direct methods were used to talk about hand washing, accidents, stopping to try to go potty, etc. Disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Son enjoys it","review":"My 2 yoear old loves this one, especially the kitty climbing the steps.

The songs are catchy. The TP rap is really good with some funny lines about the \\"Master roll\\" being too big to bring home. But \\"Accidents Happen\\" with Grover is the real gem here. We sing it all the time when we want to take the edge off of some whoopsie that may or may not be potty related.The physical DVD got scratched so we bought it from the Instant Video Store and watch it on our Roku now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just talk and talk","review":"The video is nice but not very useful the characters just try to talk the kid into using the potty, not clear instructions or examples.

She is very energetic and upbeat but yells the cues the whole time. It was really irritating.I also didn't like the set too much - was really flashy, literally. Not recommended for anyone who has problems with flashing lights, etc. The walking segment wasn't really walking, it was just another lower impact routine, so that was a disappointment. In the same section there is one song with hardly any beat to move to so it is very awkward. I didn't care for the resistance band section because each segment was too short and didn't really jive well with the lower impact it was combined with. At $17.99 I really didn't feel it was worth the money at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite","review":"I had the Buns of Steel series with Donna and really liked her. I now have her new Body Gospel series, which is great. This one I bought, used once, and sold.

You may think I'm just being picky, but the set design left a lot to be desired. Most exercise videos take place either in a space that looks like an aerobics classroom at a gym or on location somewhere at the beach. This set was just a large black studio. It sounds like a random thing to critique, but it took away from my ability to enjoy the video, partly because it made it seem just thrown together. I also don't think that the live music worked well with an exercise video, as the singers are distracting. The sound quality is also not that great. Overall I think the idea of Christian work out videos is a good one, but this one just wasn't made very well, and the routines themselves were a little too low impact for me. And that's coming from someone who never exercises, and was looking for a fun way to stay active."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sweating in the Spirit 2","review":"I didn't care for this video at all.

It's on display here, of course, but the book's design, assembly instructions superimposed next to, behind and even over the photos, distracts from his work.

There is little metaphorical or linguistic frisson in this poetry; nowhere can one find the rich use of language that marks contemporary Indian fiction writers writing in English. Vazirani is no Arundhati Roy or Kiran Desai, to name two women of her generation. Her poetry too often falls flat, with little sense of rhythm or lineation. She does indeed have a keen eye for detail and a sense of narrative line. Exotic details and stories set in foreign lands are fine,of course, but what makes a poem worth reading is its use of language. Perhaps her second book will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Being Indian Isn't Good Enough","review":"Prediction: Vazirani will go far. Why? She is \\"exotic.\\" She can throw in details from her Indian heritage and editors of journals and presses will salivate. That she has little real talent as a writer matters not at all. Her poetry is slack and self-indulgent. Perhaps she will mature into a better writer. In the meantime, her literary star will shine brighter and brighter, thanks to our current mania for anything even remotely exotic. That doesn't mean you have to buy her book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Good Story Might Not Be Poetry","review":"Vazirani does a good job of opening a story in bursts and fragments, but I'm not sure it amounts to poetry. The flavor of the exotic seems often to be the real reason for these poems to exist, but they seem to be more about cultural migration than about language. The narrators of her poems seem such thoroughgoing materialists, it's hard to give them the sympathy the author requests."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost in the 70's","review":"This recording gets a little bogged down in the psychedelic impulse of the 1970's, but Harry still shines in his stories of relationship and love.

Give them some time and they could be a real force in the industry. They mix some industrial elements in with their basic hard rock sound and it is very different sounding.

The story, like so many have said, is refreshing but the poor cinematography, trying too hard acting, and the badly paced plot just really killed it for me; by the end of the movie all of the characters and plot just seem convoluted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I found the moving excellent. The main character speaking from his narrative was superb and really set that eerie film you'd expect to find from a Rocky Horro Show Picture. It wasn't as gruesome as I thought it to be but it did the job. The Incestuous moments were by far my favorite, showing the degeneration of the family and how they really aren't just like other families. But a family nonethless, one that will stick by each other even when against the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd recommend instead...","review":"Not sure why so many people are giving high ratings on this one. The acting was sub-par, the lighting design was heinous, and the production was more horrifying than the story. If you want to see a truly creepy indie horror film, check outBaby Blues. I was lucky enough to attend a private screening and was thoroughly creeped out. The acting is better than expected as is the production value. It had some truly unexpected twists. Check it out instead, it comes out on DVD in August."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice new spin on an old and tired sub-genre","review":"One of the best entries in the After Dark Horror Fest, The Hamiltons puts a nice new spin on an old and tired genre. Without giving too much away (though it doesn't really matter considering how many reviewers have spoiled the twist already), The Hamiltons revolves around a murderous family that enjoy kidnapping, imprisoning, and eventually killing their victims. Teenager Francis (Cory Knauf) is tired and disgusted of what his family is doing, all the while he tries to supress his own urges. Written and directed by newcomers the Butcher Brothers, The Hamiltons injects new life into the genre while throwing on generous amounts of blood, sex, incest, and more that even the most jaded horror fans will enjoy on some level or other. Look for hottie Brittany Daniel (Joe Dirt, Club Dread) in an unlucky semi-cameo role as the film opens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously?","review":"I can't believe how many people fawn over this movie. It has as much tension in it as a bag of wonder bread. This movie isn't very memorable. In fact I forgot that I had even seen it until I saw a preview for it on the Unrest disc. Then I remembered this drivel.The whole story about a family of psychopaths who are psychos \\"just because\\" doesn't really work. The acting was decent, it had to be to hold the weak, slow, plodding story together. The story just meanders along taking its sweet time to get to an unsatisfying conclusion. Weak production quality. Looks like someone shot it on their camera phone.Waste of a rental."},{"rating":"1","title":"one word...","review":"yawn...zzzzzzzzzzzzz....finally rented the movie to see what it was all about and like other reviewers said, it was boring...i guess for an indie flick, i shouldn't expect much but it was suppse to be a horror movie...right? i hope the second batch of after horror fest movies are better than theis first batch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth a look.","review":"I saw this movie with a couple of others when Horrorfest came to town. This movie was not \\"to die for\\" as promised. This movie is a low budget B-movie at best. It did not deliver. I can say that it was the better of all the movies I saw @ Horrorfest.

I had to force myself to stay awake. NO THRILLS."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Family Knows How To Kill An Evening","review":"I loved this movie. Sure, there was gore, but not overdone. The story took prescedence. The angst of the younger brother was familiar to every family. His angst happen to be about fitting in a family of monsters, but the audiance could relate by subbing that with anything. The wilder, older siblings painted a picture of rebellion and sewing wild oats that almost everyone in that age group goes through. Everytime the audiance relates to regular family attributes, the monster part of the movie reminds us that this is a horror film.This is a very good, entertaining movie. It is a fresh horror movie with a mostly original twist.I was never bored or felt that the killing was overkill. I would recommend this movie to every true horror fan, especially those who are tired of slasher movies with no story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid, not horror","review":"I saw this movie at horrorfest a while back and saw a link for it while looking at another movie. When I saw the number of good reviews, I felt I had to comment. This is a pseudo-horror flick. It's more like some weird dark-drama. The \\"scares\\" that aren't scary are few and far between. I guess the reason that people like it is the twist at the end, but it wasn't worth an hour of being bored. If you want a horror, skip it, if you want a boring mystery (kinda) then rent it immediately...but don't buy it til you see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low Rent Hostel","review":"In this movie, a series of young women suffer terrible torment at the hands of the creepily incestuous Hamilton Family. But when the movie finally explains the siblings' motives, it's clear their methods were not necessary to achieve their ends. So this film just ends up being an excuse to show girls being caged and tortured.There is a touch of humanity in a tentative romance that develops in this film and that partially redeems it. But on the whole, the acting tends to be a bit amateurish and the film has rather cheesy production values. So this ends up being a low-rent \\"Hostel.\\"If you liked \\"Hostel,\\" you might not mind. But if you prefer more classic, character and plot driven chills, this film will probably just leave you feeling wasted. You'd do better to check out some of the other movies in the \\"After Dark\\" series - such as \\"Penny Dreadful.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring with a capital BORE","review":"Amaturish acting, lame dialouge and worst of all, NOT SCARY!

It's not even worth the time to try again really."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing","review":"So I was very excited for horrorfest, buying into the idea that these movies really were too scary to show to get past normal ratings, etc. Obviously I was extremely dissapointed by almost every single horrorfest movie, EXCEPT this one. I found it unique and interesting. I liked the quirks of the actors. So, most of the horrorfest movies are pretty crappy, but this one is worth see-ing, and for me, worth buying!

The one with the biggest hype was THE HAMILTONS. I don't know why - the audience I saw this with was walking out in droves (much more than they did for WICKED LITTLE THINGS and THE ABANDONED) once they realized that this was a no-budget slacker whiner fest with some horror movie dressing. The big, \\"surprise\\" ending is supposed to knock us out of our seats, but doesn't. The two star rating is because it didn't suck as bad as WICKED LITTLE THINGS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Story Line","review":"I am new to the Jim Butcher series but really enjoyed this one. This is book three in the series and I didn't read the others first and it was very easy to understand and keep up. The author takes the time to explain things so that someone who is new to the series can easily get into the story. It ends so that you will want to read the next in the series, which isn't surprising. It has vampires and ghosts and magic but it is an interesting twist on them so you don't feel like you have heard this story before. I recommend this book even without the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta love Harry Dresden, the wizard . . . . .","review":"Harry Dresden is wizard in Chicago and he could not be in a more awkward position. His talents are made fun of and ridiculed but his talents are also needed.

Not quite fantasy. Not quite sci fi and not quite supernatural. But what ever it is, it works!A bit of sorcery, a bit of magic, a bit of wizardry and lots of action make this a worthwhile read.

In Grave Peril, Butcher was still learning the craft, and it shows."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Rule: Random Rules Suck","review":"I had to walk away from this book about half way through. Butcher's writing is kinda rough, his women are cliched, and Harry getting the snot beat out of him before rallying to save the day was predictable. All of that was to be expected from book 1 and 2. Where I lost it was the endless introduction of arbitrary magic rules. Apparently, an evil witch is allowed to steal a holy sword if the previous wielder attempted to use the sword in a betrayal. Also, ghosts do not like water. Who knew? I just couldn't take it any more... there's probably some fancy literary word for making up random stuff in order to drive a plot... whatever it is, it sucks. I read the synopsis for book 3 and it looks like the arbitrary magic rules continued through the whole book. I'm glad I set it down!Since my friend is pushing the book series so hard, I must press on to book 4. Wish me luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another terrific addition to this wonderful series!!!","review":"\\"Grave Peril\\", book three of the Dresden Files, is the best of the three books. Wizard Harry Dresden's world is never boring, but this book,(complete with tortured ghosts, evil god-mothers, rampaging vampires, and old enemies bent on revenge)is SO MUCH FUN!!! The three books that make up this series have some common characters, but each will pretty much stand alone, and you won't be lost if this is the first \\"Dresden\\" book you read. (Trust me, you will be combing the shelves for \\"Storm Front\\" and \\"Fool Moon\\" if you read this latest offering).Great imagination, plotting, character development, and yes - (Thank you Jesus)- the man can write. Good Luck, Jim Butcher!! I hope this book catches fire, and you can continue to supply us with your wonderful tales for a long time to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Butcher Hits His Stride","review":"The first was a great introduction, the second was an enjoyable read, but with Book 3 Butcher's Dresden Files really take off. Characters interact in a more meaningful way, events have greater consequences, and they aren't (nor can there be) any tidy endings.The first two are well worth reading, but aren't completely necessary--if you want to jump in when the going starts geting good, this is the book to begin with.Note: a 3 star ranking from me is actually pretty good; I reserve 4 stars for tremendously good works, and 5 only for the rare few that are or ought to be classic; unfortunately most books published are 2 or less."},{"rating":"1","title":"unimaginative story","review":"I am an avid reader and this series is one of the worst I have ever read. I ordered the first three books together and will not be ordering any more of the series. The story is choppy and slow and boring.

Unfortunately Butcher fell into the same trap so many authors have done. The reviewers compare this series to that of Laurell Hamilton, and it does do the same pattern only faster. It only took three books for Butcher to change what was a good urban fantasy/mystery about a private investigator/wizard into an attempt at a modern fantasy epic in which the main character is the pivotal element in a worldwide war between wizards and vampires.I don't understand why so many of the fantasy writers seem determined that any character they create has to become Frodo. I was looking for a nice urban fantasy/mystery like Mercedes Lackey or Tanya Huff do so well.Buy the first book, skip the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Last Encounter for Dresden and I","review":"This is really it for Harry and I (unless I still have another installment on my shelf...). This is number three and I still am not compelled by the character lineup. I heard an interview with Mr. Butcher about this book and he mentioned how many fans feel that Grave Peril is when the series really gets started. I didn't have that reaction to this book. Just when I begin to get into the story I am annoyed by Harry's constant guilt trip. The dashing, duster-clad hero is always obligating himself to everyone else and then goes on a guilt trip, reader in tow, when something goes awry.

Oswald was a succesful composer during his lifetime, and became chamber composer to George III. The selection, whih includes ten of the twelve songs entitled \\"Colin's Kisses\\", is played by Concerto Caledonia. The instruments used are those that would have been played in Oswald's time: the musicians, led by David McGuinness, play with spirit and precision. The soloists, Catherine Bott and Iain Paton, are both wonderful. Bott's clear soprano is almost inhumanly beautiful, and Paton's sweet yet erotic tenor reveals an enjoyment of the music that gives the already exciting tunes an extra lift. Oswald's music contains romance, sex, pathos and humour; it is joyous, moving and unmissable."},{"rating":"1","title":"HDMI SPLITTER","review":"WARNING! THIS IS NOT A SPLITTER!

Especially passive splitters which rely on the individual devices ability to negotiate a 3 way handshake. The problem is not all devices are programmed to deal with this properly and will sometimes default to a HDCP error state. To put it simply, some devices will consider the splitting of a signal to be a copyright violation, which could result in only one display being shown at a time or the blocking of content altogether. This type of situation is considered to be a device compatibility issue and can not be fixed short of a firmware update by the individual device manufacturers. Before purchasing this splitter, please be advised that we have no control over nor are we responsible for compatibility issues (including HDCP issues)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snow with 720p/1080i sources and no video on 1080p","review":"Not sure if the other reviewer \\"Nando\\" actually tried using this particular splitter??This splitter is useless.

If you only have one book on Florida gardening, you can't beat this one for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated","review":"This book is way too general and most definitely outdated. Many plants one might consider for Florida are missing; for those interested in North Florida gardening, many plants are discouraged that have, in the last ten years, been bred to withstand a cooler climate. For example, he excludes gardenias for North Florida, but I've grown them quite successfully as far north as Charlotte, NC. Where is info on Sago Palms (I know they're Cycads), but they are popular in Florida - why no info? The \\"Annual\\" section reads like a northeast primer.In the last 10 years Elephant Ears have exploded in variety, in this book, just a vague short paragraph addresses this exotic foliage. Definitely need something more up to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful","review":"Fewer pages than I expected, but nice quailty book with plenty of photographs and useful charts.

One of the reasons I have a problem with a lot of the DBZ movies is that they follow the same pattern, Goku kills the main \\"bad guy\\" while the others are left weak and powerless. This movie in particular seemed slow on the action. Lastly, without bias, I can say that Vegeta was out of character as he said phrases like \\"Im going to be killed, were all going to be killed, he's the legenedary super saiyan.\\" It bothers me when someone is out of character this much. To improve the DBZ movies, the creators must realize there are characters other than Goku, a few entire movies without him would be nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most exciting DBZ movies since Cooler's revenge..","review":"Everytime They come out with a DBZ movie it leaves you wonder-ing \\"what timeline is this in?\\" My guess is that Dragonball Z: Broly was set during the cell saga in an alternate universe. The movie is only 60 minutes long but in my opinion this has to be the longest 60 minute movie I've ever watched. But other than that is was great, the action was good the dialogue as well.The beginning starts off with a humorous tune to it, but as the movie goes on it becomes more serious and action-packed with a story behind the character Broly and litte bit more on Goku slightly (naturally). If you're a fan of DBZ, then watch this movie: Its'a good one that shouldn't be overlooked!---- [a 5 out 5]"},{"rating":"2","title":"another review","review":"I saw this movie in Japanese, and i think its one of the best of the DBZ series.

I just wished Vegeta would actually beat up somebody in these DBZ movies!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun DBZ movie but not for every fan","review":"This movie was better than most of the DBZ movies because of superior length and depth. However, a major turn-off to this movie is the dissapointing end to it where Broly is owned by one lousy punch. Nevertheless the film mainly shows Broly kicking everyone's tail and for most of the film the fight is in his favor. This movie caters to fans of the villan rather than that of the protaganist. I hear all the time boasts about about how powerful Broly \\"really\\" is and I think that was a goal of the movie. It's not a film for someone who only enjoys the solid, in between the lines story and plot but for someone who wants a new twist to their saiyan fandom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Broly will open up a can of whoop nevermind..","review":"This is a very good movie. This is the first time you see Broly in DBZ. I don't think Broly is evil, just misunderstood. After all, what would YOU do with all that power??? JK JK. He is most definately evil. Cool, but evil."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst i've seen in dragon ball z","review":"Worst movie. I think this one is not near as good as the earlier movies. Broly whoops everybody, but goku at the end beats him with a regular punch? what happened to ending them with a spirit bomb or kamehameha? the music is actually really good. not worth $20. First 3 movies are the best. but, it is dragonball z. but this movie is long and boring, and that is why i give it a 2 out of five."},{"rating":"2","title":"Legendary Super Saiyan","review":"This is the best DBZ movie ever made. If I'm not mistaken, Broly's power is far greater than 5 Super Saiyans combined. Did I forget to mention Broly is hard? If you want to see more of him, he's also featured on the new DBZ game for GBA called Dragon Ball Z Taiketsu which releases in November 18, 2003! Anyways, Broly and Goku have troubled pasts which triggered this all out war between to two and the other Z fighters. I never thought I Say this, but Vegeta is a punk when it comes to fighting Broly. He completely chickened out when all the others had the guts to fight the Legendary Super Saiyan, even though they didn't have a snowball's chance in hell of beting him. Something tells me that Broly will return in more DBZ movies coming later next year. P.S. What's up with Gohan not going SS2? That's what was really wrong with the whole picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broly (...)","review":"I noticed that Goku fans really liked this movie while Vegeta fans (like me) didn't. The movie got Vegeta's character totally wrong. I mean Vegeta may not be more powerful than Goku, but he's way meaner - but in the movie he gets all paralyzed with fear and crap. And to give credit where it's due, Goku kicks some serious (...)... but what's his finishing move? No spirit bomb, no dragon fist, no fireworks... just a stupid white-belt punch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Broly Looks Awesome","review":"This movie was pretty decent for me actually. Its about a saiyan and his son coming to earth to tell vegeta that he has found a new planet for them to restart the saiyan race. Trunks tells Vegeta not to go, but of course Vegeta doesn't listen. Vegeta is told he just has to stop a legendary super saiyan, which is the son. Goku, Gohan, Vegeta, Trunks, and Piccolo all end up having to try and stop this monster with such incredible power and the fight scenes are pretty cool. The way they drew Broly was pretty awesome, hes very bulky with crazy golden hair and hes covered in medallions. The only thing i didn't really care for in this movie is the way they portrayed Vegeta; they made him out to be a coward, Vegeta is very tough and fearless and very arrogant, just wish they wouldn't have done that as Vegeta is one of my favorite characters and they got him all wrong in this movie. But other than that, 5 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's great for any true DBZ fan","review":"The movie was incredable as far dbz movies go. Every character is portraid well. Even Vegeta who alot of people complain about, But the truth is he only fights battles he is sure he can win with the expetion of the battle with Cell and that because his son died. But Broly is awsome he just kicks everyones butt, but he is quite insane. Goku,Trunks,and Gohan do their share of fighting and falling. Its just a fun movie to watch espically if your in the mood to watch the heroes get slamed around."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie was great but it just followed the same old routine.","review":"I liked this alot.The action and comedy was great and alla dat but the only problem is it follows the same routine as almost all of the DbZ movies.Villian comes, everybody gets their asses whooped, Goku needs them to donate their energy, then he makes a big-ass spirit bomb only this time he punched Broly in the gut.It's just that using the same way to get rid of enemies just gets, gets plain \\"Old\\".This was good but like i said doing they're same old thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hunting and Non-Hunting Perspectives","review":"This documentary is a boy's story about his African Safari. It provides an excellent insight into hunting, particularly African hunting and how it relates to the preservation of game.

The games were decent, but nothing special. Then came a horrible TV show starring an annoying, whiny-voiced kid (Ash) and a little yellow electric rat(pikachu). My brother owns this movie. I have seen it a few times. I was not impressed, but then again, I wasn't too happy with the... TV show on which it is based. The message in the movie-it's what's inside that matters-has been overused in other children's movies. Fans of the TV show (like my brother) will enjoy it, but the movie(and the show) are too inconsistent with the Game Boy games. Hearing the annoying voice of Ash and watching him make stupid decisions detracts even more from the movie. The worst part is, there's not one but TWO sequels.

I mean, it's like any other movie: Something or someone trying to have world domination just because some Pokemon thinks that the human race is evil. Puh-lease! The only thing I like about it is Mew, but the Pokemon don't even use their powers when their fighting like they do in Pokemon battles. And they don't even know why they're fighting! It's like being racist. And they're trying to teach kids a \\"valuable\\" lesson, don't fight. We hear that from everyone quite enough. Besides, Pokemon are a bad influence on kids. Some kids are so desperate they STEAL Pokemon cards. The movie's trying to get you to spend your money on some movie. It's just a movie. You're bound to see it some other time.

I even like them. (The episodes, that is. I love my boys - for this reason, we saw the movie in the theater.)The \\"feature\\" portion of this movie is too long - the plot would have been fine in a shorter episode. As it was, it was padded out and I just kept wishing it was over. Plus, Ash gets turned to stone (and comes back to life.) This didn't seem to traumatize my kids - but watch out for anybody that takes this too seriously.The cartoon \\"short\\" at the beginning is entertaining assuming you can tolerate the lack of dialog. Several times the short is padded with images of dancing pokemon - my kids loved this, I found it nearly pointless. Still, if you like silent films, this might be for you. I liked it better than the feature.If you haven't taken your kids to see this already, you dodged the bullet - don't bother getting your own copy - I'm sure they can watch it at their neighbor's house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not all that bad..","review":"The DVD's got a cute little menu screen, and it looks pretty good on the computer screen. However, if you don't have surround, MewTwo's telepathy will sound a bit.. odd to the ears. But you'll adjust to it. BTW, the directors viewing of the movie is a nice touch. :) I haven't seen anything like that since the Lion King CAV Deluxe Laserdisc where the directors and producers did the same thing.I haven't seen the Japanese version, but I know there were subtle script differences. How could there not be? With the lip flap at all.A good buy, all-in-all.

Despite these faults it's a \\"BLAST!\\" for kids.On a scale of one star to five I gave this a two. For the collector's eye the card is also a waste, unless you really love Mewtwo.

It's sad that a movie like this makes 50 million in one weekend when something as good as \\"The Iron Giant\\" bombs at the box office.The animation is horrendous. Mouths moving consits of 2 frames repeated over and over (one with the mouth open, one with it closed), that is a blatent example of lazyness on the animators part. Plus the sound is never in sync.I have nothing against anime. If anything this IS THE MOVIE that gives anime a bad name in America.

You have all those Pokémon sudddenly flashing over the screen, colorful backgrounds. No dialoge or story whatsoever. If you're under drugs, this might have the same effect like the lightrays-orgy at the end of '2001' had on some Hippies back in 1968. To sum up: If you like Pokémon, you'll like this movie.

I do not recomend this movie to anyone. And to all Pokemon fans out there: Buy the other movies, not this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I saw this movie when it was in the theatres when I liked Pokemon. I think this is what put me off. The first part, Pikachu's vacation dragged on and I couldn't wait untill the actual thing. It was even worse. I was going to leave half-way through, but I decided not to because I wanted to see if Mew or Mewtwo won. It was a draw. That was a huge disapointment. They also ran out of the special cards you were meant to get. I used to be a Pokemon Fanatic, but now it's my worst nightmare, especially the TV Show, but the game is ok untill you beat it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Really Bad Movie","review":"This was the singular most poorly made movie I have ever seen in my entire life. My younger brother wanted to go see it, and so I brought one of my friends who likes Pokemon to come and check it out with the rest of us. Before the actual movie there is a shorter one, Pikachu's Vacation, and that was alright. It did rather drag on, though, and even my friend got bored half-way through, and he's not one to have a short attention span. The actual movie, when it started, was the most sacrany, goody-goody, we-should-all-love-each-other children's flick I've ever had the misfortune to encounter. All children's movies have an undertone of such, but to come right out and preach a sermon about it as this movie did made me want to leave the theater, and I probably would have if my friend hadn't been there to make fun of it's stupidity. It does have it's audiance, which is kids up to about the age of ten, but anybody over that age will not enjoy this movie at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie stinks","review":"I woke up one day and checked the newspapper for the movies. Pokemon: the first movie. I went to see it with my friends. We were 5. One of my friends loved it but the rest of us hated it. So I decided to recommend everyone not to buy the tape or go see it.It's not a good movie, alright?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A VERYYYYY STRONG DISSAPOINTMENT","review":"Let's start with the whole story before, during, and after the Pokemon realese, it was announced on the first days of October, it looked preety cool, like if it was going to be one of the best anime film of all time, well, then i go too see it, and oh boy!, what a dissapointment, the plot is horrible, horrible, \\"Fue horrible, horrible\\" as a mexican comedian called Eugenio Derbez says in his show, the animation regular, the humor, horrible, there was nothing of humor!, everything was bad, except the message, it's terrible, you rather watch the cartoon, it's the kind of film that i would say,\\"AHH!, YA CALLATE, CALLATE QUE ME DESESPERAS!\\" a character called Quico, in Chespirito a mexican comedy show says."},{"rating":"1","title":"very harsh","review":"Okay firstthings first. They advertised that in the movie you would see all 150 pokemon Not true.And the stupid little movie at the begining pitiful. The movie seemed to be going on and on but not actually going any where. And at the end it to them so long to prove the very basic moral of the story. I have to admit i was abit surprised by the begining when mewtwo escapes that was the only part in the movie where something almost unpredictable hapended. Despite this movie earning 80 million amang the highest for cartoons the movie was HORRIBLE. Many pokemon fans where disapointed with the outcome of this movie.Just a cheap way for billion dollar companies to squeeze all the money they can out of hardworking people.The bottom line is don't even rent this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pokemon their first film","review":"This movie offers no explanation on what Pokemon are to non-fans.It also uses the characters from a violent show to promote non-violence.Hypocrisy with a captial \\"H\\".Worst of all,after all is said and done MewTwo wipes the cast's memory away so they forget about what they learned and continue fighting.By the way,I'm I the only one who thinks Mewtwo is a lame name for a clone for another pokemon named Mew.Talk about lazy!The characters in the show have little to no personality what so ever.The only good thing about this film is the animation itself but it's still not worth it. I give this film a 2 out of 10."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Up to Par","review":"One pf the disapointing movies of the Fall. Pokemon is only for pre- teens and younger the movie was REALLY BAD!

But after this movie Poke'mon did not seem so great after. The plot was really weird, having a Poke'mon who trains Poke'mon and clones Poke'mon too. Sure, other people liked it but I wasn't that too much in to it. It was kind of stupid. Brought Poke'mon down so much that they even made another game which helps you learn how to play the card game. Talk about low. People were really excited when they saw the commercial for this movie, I was too. But after I saw it, I slowly started to lose the passion I had for Poke'mon. If you want to hate Poke'mon, this movie is your one small step toward it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame!","review":"I never liked Pokemon.And i don't think the movies are that entertaining.I think that people that made Pokemon are imbeciles.And no i do not recommend this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too little","review":"This video is more or less only for Pokemon fanatics. I tried watching the film, but by the time Pikachu's Vacation rolled around, and those annoying pokemon appearing in the most annoying places (an entire screen is dedicated to a dancing Pysduck, or Farfetched). It has practily no plot, and the original focus about the Togepi now shifts to this idiot Charizard who gets his head stuck in a tube. Now, on to the actual movie. 55 minutes? Warner, try and do better. Try 1 hour, 30 minutes at least. Mewtwo sounds like an American Businessman, the C-G-I dosen't blend together with the animation like it should, and the much-vaunted \\"The Story of Mewtwo's origins\\" is like 30 seconds long, with this guy saying: \\"We are in the woods\\" for the whole time. My favorite part of the movie actually is the teaser for the next movie. Not a good sign."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic! Much better then the show!","review":"Iam going to be truefull here, and tell you I did not see it in the theaters.I did, however read both books,(Mewtwo strikes Back and Pikachu's Vacation).I also bought the movie soundtrack.Both were awsome!I'm getting the video the moment it comes out! This is a must-see for all Pok'e fans!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I've never walked out on a movie...","review":"I just saw this movie on Cartoon Network and was reminded how much I hated watching this movie in theaters.Although I am a huge Pokemon fan, I was disgusted by this translation. I say translation because I have seen the Japanese version of this movie; it is much different, more entertaining (and coherent), and not embarrassing to watch. I'd say it is at least three times better than this WB produced garbage.If you've only seen the English translation, you've been duped. The Japanese original version has surprising depth, a striking soundtrack, and decent voice overs, all of which the English translation does not have.See it, believe it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Lousiest Movie on Earth","review":"If you are planning to buy this DVD, don't! It's a total waste of money. This was obviously just to make more money. In fact, Pokemon the Movie is a pathetic flop. Even Mission Impossible 2, which is also bad, would be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite of all the Pokemon Movies so far!!!","review":"I did take a star off for the oddly funny Pikachu's Vacation, which is ok to watch when I'm depressed, but hardly any other time. I love Mewtwo! One of my very favorite Pokemon!... And I heard the Japanese version was even more violent that the Americanized version, but I say you do not need to have much violence to have a great movie. (ex: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, I rest my case) I highly recommend this movie.Signed, A 21 year old Pokemon crazed girl."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a good movie in 21 century.","review":"This is a nice movie you can not miss in the first part---Pikachu Vacation. It's kind of funny that I can laugh with my family.

However, you may want to wait on the actual movie until they are a little bit older, my 6 year old son found it a little bit scarey when the Mewtwo story line started."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pokemon: Mewtwo Strikes Back","review":"All in all, a great movie, although there are a few flaws. I will first name the few drawbacks that kept this movie from a five star rating: Shallow plot in the most part, little dialogue, and childish theme. However, for those true pokefanatics out there, the many pokemon battles are astounding and exciting. If I were Siskel or Ebert, I would certainly give this movie 2 thumbs up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"The first of many this is the best Pokemon movie that they have made thus far.

It's The One Movie That Started It All.I Used To Own It. And I Was Just Blown Away By It. My Favorite Part In The Movie Was In \\"Pikachu's Vaction\\" When Charizard Got It's Head Stuck In A Pipe. And Pikachu And The Others (Onyx, Geodude, Psyduck, And A Whole Host Of Others) Tried To Get Charizard Out Of The Pipe. Then They Got It Out. And They Were Happy.

It's A Must Have For Anyone Who Like's Pokemon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why this is a good movie","review":"When I sat in the red, damp seat to see this movie when it came out, I knew it would be a ride. And then the open theme came in... There is something about this that seems to generate excitement and hope, because besides seeing the look in the eyes of kids and adults alike, I felt it. It is all about being your best, never giving up and fighting for what is right. This is in the show, yes, but this scale is... Well, great. Buy this if you like anime, are looking for something to bost your spirit, or if you are alive. This is VERY good stuff. I am a BIG critic of anime, but this has it all. Buy it. Trust me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Topo -- not useful for hikers","review":"I was severely disappointed in this product. Contrary to it's billing it is almost entirely useless for planning hikes.

There is a tremendous amount of data here that is packaged and marketed in about the least useful way possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Work on New Systems","review":"I bought an earlier version of Topo on DVD. I was satisfied with it but then I upgraded to Windows XP and my DVD will no longer work. Delorme doesn't support the older version and suggests I buy a new one at full price.

It may not work with Microsoft's next OS upgrade!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Delorme Topo Products","review":"I purchased Topo USA 3 and was very disappointed with the maps and the features. Delorme does not use maps that are even close to USGS topos. I would not recommend any of their mapping products. For the best in real USGS maps get MapTech's Terrain Navigator. It does all the things Delorme products do and it uses REAL USGS 1:24000 Topos."},{"rating":"2","title":"powerful program for the money","review":"I found this software to be a great buy. I had no problems with the 3D features. I was worried because I installed it on a computer that was about 2yrs old but it worked fine. I did have to read the manual that comes on the disc to get to know all the features and how to use them to full advantage. (it would have been nice if it came with a hard copy but you can print it out). This program is very powerful for the money. For a quick example, by just clicking on the screen you can get distances or even acreage computed. Considering the cost and features of this program I would give it 5 stars. To get better software you would have to spend many times the cost of this program."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good old software but it doesn't work with 64 bit Windows 7","review":"This is very useful software for planning hikes. In addition to nice topographic maps covering the entire USA, it allows one to plot a route and see a graphical chart showing elevation gains etc. The price is a steal, but please be aware that version 4.0 is old. The copyright is 2002. I've used this same software for years on my old XP computer and 32 bit windows 7 but I bought a new copy for my new 64 bit machine and it doesn't work.

It has decent detail but is not a substitute for a detailed map of where you are going. I also use this software for making maps of local trails which it does a good job at.I did not have any of the problems listed by other reviewers - after I downloaded the patch from delorme.Also - Delorme will sell USGS maps and satellite pictures compatible with this software. I think the USGS was about .../state. I downloaded free samples of both and they were pretty good (the USGS map looked a little like it had been scanned in but it was still very legible).It does leave you a little bit on your own on how to figure out how to use it but I was able to figure most things out fairly easy on my own and the help topics covered the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Initially I thought this was some great software, but once I started trying to do more advanced things I quickly saw the limitations of this software.

In fact, he was my first (and current) favorite artist. This album is a bit of a dissapointment. Although he has had many songs I just haven't enjoyed, as a whole, every one of his albums has been very enjoyable... until now. In fact, I really only liked one song on this whole album. The music was just a little hard and loud and just didn't have that musical, \\"operaetic\\" feel that most of his great song do. It was hard to even hear him sing on several songs due to the instraments being way too loud. I just pray he doesn't retire on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alternate title: BAD Out Of Hell!","review":"\\"Clever\\" song titles do NOT translate to a great album.

I am a huge fan of Jim Steinman and his music and the way Meatloaf gets the messages across. Meatloaf's amazing voice and stage presence are un-Paralleled. I usually enjoy Meat's non Steinman albums (such as this one is), because they try and are usually very good imitations of the Steinman albums (Bat I & II, Dead Ringer) but he totally missed here. James Michael who wrote the main tracks, is off the mark as is the Production. The songs have no climax no catchy refrains and seem to go nowhere. His last non-Steinman album was \\"Welcome To The Neighborhood\\"... not a masterpiece but enjoyable tracks like \\"Where The Rubber Meets The Road\\", \\"I'd Lie for You...\\" & \\"Martha\\". Sadly there are very few if any songs on here that you would even want to listen to twice. Upsetting that I have to write this but true... But not to worry, it appears Steinman is ready to work with the big guy again, and Bat III could be out as soon as 2005!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of Meat Loaf tape","review":"I got the tape very quickly.

Fool me twice...","review":"First, there was \\"Midnight at the Lost & Found\\". Meat makes an album without Steinman, and I buy it only to find it s*cks. Later, out comes \\"There Goes the Neighborhood\\". A couple of songs by Steinman, maybe it's worth the money... NOPE!! The rest of the album was a waste of time. Once again, there is only ONE winning formula. Meat Loaf & Steinman. There is no Steinman on \\"Couldn't Have Said It Better\\". You have been forewarned. To the reviewers who said that it is better than other new releases - Just because the standards for modern music have lowered immeasurably, doesn't mean Meat Loaf should lower his!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I'm also a big fan of Steinman music and if you are also, this album misses the mark. A few are close, but the production seems weak. Some of the vocals and tracks need redone and some of Meat's singing is just out of tempo with the music. I'd skip this entry. Go back and buy Bat II or Welcome to the Neighborhood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very different","review":"To the person that mentioned Jim Steinman's lack of involvement with the album, I agree. Without the genius' magic touch, Meat loaf has come out with an awfully shabby album. The title song \\"Couldn't have said it betterr myself\\" offers a slight zing to the album. But when listening to the rest of the album, it is very disappointing. Steinman and Meat Loaf are the ultimate duo. But when one is taken away, it is noticeable. I would not reccommend this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great album.","review":"More great music from the mighty Meat Loaf, this cd is up there with the Bat trilogy.

The analysis surrounding the rather obviously chosen ads in the book is largely regurgitated from Twitchell's otherwise superb Adcult USA. Sadly, despite the Wired-esque fluorescent pink and yellow dust jacket, Mr. Twitchell also manages to completely miss the Internet and its effect on advertising.Readers interested in the collision commercialism and society should opt for Twitchell's earlier \\"Adcult USA,\\" while students of advertising can find deeper insights about what makes ads tick in Judith Williamson's \\"Deconstructing Advertisements.\\"Has Twitchell become, as David Ogilvy would put it, an extinct volcano?

This DVD is recommended expecially for the songs not in his other live shows, especially the Jam & Style Council oldies. Weller really plays his best in medium-sized halls like this one, rather than massive outdoor fests. The DVD format could be better used if the lyrics had been provided in subtitles - Weller's lyrics are a strong point and should be provided!Good as this is, I still think his best live show on video is Royal Albert Hall 2000. To date this has not been released in Region One format."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turn your back and its great!","review":"I like everything about Paul Weller's music and the way he performs live, but his DVD has a problem I wouldn't expect from such a together performer. The editing appears to be done by a computer programmed to cut randomly to any camera every 2 or 3 seconds. Not only are they cutting fast, but they are moving in and out, up and down, so its just vertigo. I'm not the first one to mention this, but it really ruins the presentation. This is not Maroon 5 for heaven's sake. For those of us not lucky enough to be able to see Paul live, this is a major disappointment. I had to close my eyes to be able relax and enjoy the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Modfather at his very best!","review":"This is two hours plus of Paul and his mates doing what they love to do. Playing with absolute passion and expansive creativity. Capturing many of the \\"new songs\\" from his latest Illumination (2002), Weller meets every expectation of the thrilled Glasgow crowd with song after song that never disappoints. Yes, the editor could have slowed the cutting from shot to shot a wee bit but such trivialities cannot diminish the strength of what Paul, Steve, Whitey, Damon and Seamus deliver with every note. This may be the best concert film that Paul Weller has ever recorded.

I hope the book of Isaiah is in the new sets. If not, I will just use one of the blank tabs to mark it.

The book itself reads as though you're watching the story unfold on a movie screen. I enjoyed it. True, it wasn't scary enough to make me lose a night of sleep (hence the 4 star and not 5 star rating - sick, huh? *laugh) but I did have to peek over my shoulder from time to time. *laugh I have to agree with one reader that the story seemed to just - end - but then I think that was the purpose of the ending...to kind of leave the readers hanging. Hanging for what? A sequel? Who knows? All in all, this book is definitely worth getting. A few graphic but not over the top horror scenes and an interesting plot. Like I said, I'd be the first in line if the story were turned into a movie. Speaking of movies, if you liked \\"House on Haunted Hill\\", \\"13 Ghosts\\", or \\"Ghost Ship\\" - grab this book because it's pretty much based on the same theme of greed and such."},{"rating":"2","title":"Death To Reality...Finally","review":"I zipped through this book in a day and had a blast. It's not particularly scary, but it moves at a rapid click and kept me wanting to turn the pages. Exactly what I hope for in a thriller. The premise is simple -- reality show contestants spend a night in a haunted house to earn money and a role in a feature film and end up getting more than they bargained for. The characters are entertaining, although not very likable. But the best part was Van Belkom slamming the door shut on the world of reality television. The filmmaking brother team in this book is priceless. They reminded me of an even sleazier version of the producer and director from the brilliant film \\"The Making Of...And God Spoke.\\" EVB gets in some good laughs, some nice jabs at Hollywood, a few decent scares, and several \\"wet\\" scenes. The ending does drop off instantly but it can't be any worse than a manufactured tropical island set during a \\"Survivor\\" season finale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, Predictable, and Nothing Original","review":"Wow! Was this book bad. Not only am I in the film industry, but I'm a huge fan of horror. So I thought this book would be perfect for me. Unfortunately, with little to no character development or atmosphere, this book is dead on arrival. I have to say, Scream Queen is the most predictable horror novel I've ever read. Every single scene I've seen done before. The author also makes quite a few mistakes when describing positions on a film crew. It's no wonder Mr. Van Belkom got his technical information about filmmaking from Ron Oliver -- the director of Prom Night III ! I also found it funny to learn that this author has written books on how to write horror and erotica when this book contains neither! Scream Queen is a total flop and a complete waste of time. Stay away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Results!","review":"I have been using this product for about 2 weeks now, and it is outstanding. Immediately after putting it on, my face felt hydrated and lost the uncomfortable tightness I have after removing my makeup at night.

In as little as two weeks, I have noticed the disappearance of some of the fine lines around my eyes.

Martin plays in a variety of styles, has great tone and feeling in his playing and songs that will emotionally move you. I highly recommend this CD to any fan of acoustic guitar music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Martin Paris Turning Point Deluxe Edition","review":"Finger-style guitarist Martin Paris, has a very lyrical style of composition, song is king in his world. His tunes are hook-laden ventures into the consciousness of a man who grew up on the Beatles and Elton John, but learned to play like Laurence Juber and Peppino d'Agostino. The material takes one on a trip through many moods and energies but is always centered in playing what's right for the song. The cd has warm but singing quality that gets even better with repeated listenings. The three bonus tracks are a glimpse into Martin's early recordings and reflect the quality he continues to hold himself to as he matures as a musician. I'd advise anyone who enjoys finger-style guitar playing, as well as fans of well written songs, to give a listen to the world Martin Paris creates."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pocket knife","review":"As a hunter this pocket knife comes in handy not just for hunting but for everyday use.

The text offers a brief survey of the creation, evolution, and use of nutcrackers, yet the majority of The Art And Character Of Nutcrackers is devoted to full-color photography of the nutcrackers themselves. Each photo bears a caption that lists the nutcracker's name, origin, composition, and approximate dimensions. The Art And Character Of Nutcrackers is not a price guide, yet it is a truly gorgeous resource for collectors and casual browsers alike, and a wonderful way to visually experience an artistic marriage of practical function and aesthetic value."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great disk!","review":"I love this disk!

I ran the software on a 1.6 Ghz machine with 60 GB harddrive, so the performance issue clearly was not on my side. As far as the simplistic design, in the multiple choice select-a-picture section, for example, the answer would be in the same quadrant for a series of questions. This issue persisted throughout, leading to a lazy learning/teaching experience. Continuing with the shortcuts taken by this manufacturer, the photos designed to promote Italian language learning were not of Italian subjects. What a crime to charge $165 for this software!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An epic experience.","review":"Originally, I had this copy only a first issue, autographed, it was stolen by a friend of mine, I had the entire collection of books, and after 3 years of it missing I decided to buy it again, because I like to re-read this series over and over again every year or two. I love this story above all others, it is epic and superior to anything in print anywhere. Stephen King does not even come close to getting enough credit for this genius work, a complete masterpiece that I treasure. I live in apartment #19, funny because before I moved here, I was such a fan of 19 because my life is so strange. Now all I need is to re-read this artistic life-work again while sipping a noteworthy scotch and enjoying the drama of the most noteworthy author of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Gunslinger Revisited","review":"This was an intriguing beginning to the Dark Tower series. Though King's revision seems an improvement on the original version, it still seems unnecessary."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent start to a good series","review":"Presently, I am half way through the Dark Tower series having just finished up Wizard and Glass. Out of the four books of the series I have read thus far, book one: The Gunslinger remains my favorite. Stephen King does a fine job in laying out the chase between the Gunslinger and the Man in Black. After reading the book I wanted to know much more about the Man in Black (and four books in I still don't know a whole lot), I was a fan of the Gunslinger (and remain so four books later), but I was confused by just what the purpose of the boy Jake was other than to create a sympathetic character (he turns out to be very important in the coming books).The book is a quick read, not overly complex but not simplistic either. A solid thumbs up book. By the end of it you will know whether or not you want to continue the series. I couldn't wait for the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good story.","review":"I just finished this. It is great. I have both versions of this book at my house now. King's writting style keeps you going. I will read the next three sequel books next and then I will review those too. Recomended."},{"rating":"2","title":"must read","review":"Just pick it up and start on page one. It pulls a world over your eyes that you fall into and have no chance of waking up from. It has modern humor,action of a western, elements of fantasy and interdimentional travel, all wrapped together in an epic haunting romance that none other than Stephen king can tell. If you have never read KIng start here; If you aren't really in to his usual books- this is no typical series. Take a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why it works......","review":"I read this sometime after it came out, back in the day when word of mouth was probably the best way to find a good read. This qualified immediately.There's a reason that this book worked for me. I think every American my age (40's) was exposed to the cowboy myth while growing up. This book expanded the myth into a legend. It was the first (and to date only) \\"western fantasy/supernatural\\" novel, though it was predated by \\"High Planes Drifter\\" which has the same tone.Roland struck me as a fully developed character. The author knew who he was, but exposed him almost miserly. This kept the interest and tension high through out the book.I would highly recommend this for anyone who is looking to blend the cowboy myth and fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland and overrated on its own merits","review":"Don't get me wrong, this book is an easy read and you will be turning the pages trying to get the story to develop. But it doesn't in this book. As I've been told, taken as a part of the whole series, the book may be good. But I believe that even in a series, each of the books should stand on its own merits. Dune, for example, was a great book individually and as part of the greater Dune series. Gunslinger is rather inadequate in this regard. There is a thin veneer of a story and it frankly doesn't progress any more than a one sentence summary couldn't have sufficed.So, if you are willing to consider this book a 300pg preface to the series, you may enjoy it (I haven't gotten to 2 and not sure if I want to after this). If you think a series should consist of reasonably self-contained stories with an overall plot arc that runs through each \\"episode\\", you most likely will be disappointed with Book 1.To each their own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Start for an Epic Series","review":"This review is based on the original version. In my mind this is a very weak book. I found it very difficult to get through and disjointed. Having said that if you can make it to the second one you will be rewarded for the time invested in this one. The series just keeps getting better and better. King does a great job in making you care about Roland and his Ka-Tet. I have loved this series from the 2nd book to finish. You just have to make it through the first one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top-Notch King!","review":"Excellent kick-off to this great series, with wonderful artwork. The only other guy as scary as King these days is John Robert Marlow (author of NANO). If you haven't yet read the Dark Tower Series, start now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Young Stephen King fumbles his way into an epic","review":"This was a disappointing book. Although people complain about Stephen King's need for an editor, I think he works best with 800-page novels. This one is too short. Roland the gunslinger is interesting, but his backstory isn't. I enjoyed reading about his adventures in the town of Tull, but I laughed reading about being trained by a tough old Yoda-guy in a castle. And why does Roland love the boy? There's no explanation. He just DOES. Surprisingly, the story picks up at the end. The train in the mountain and the mutants are good. So is the conversation with the man in black. It ends suddenly, but with a promise that the next installment in the series will be much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very slow read...Never even made it all the way through.","review":"This book was very boring. Most of the time you couldn't even tell what was going on or where the characters were. The time period was jumping all over the place and made the story confusing. The only reason people rate this book high is because of the author. If it was anybody else this book would have bombed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What the???","review":"When your done reading it in an hour, wake me up, please dont read it out loud I might get dizzy from the butt-backwards story line. Start with the second book. I have only finished forty pages of that one, and let me tell you, it explains alot more, and a lot more happens in that one then the whole three hundred page version does all at once."},{"rating":"1","title":"A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"I enjoyed EYES OF THE DRAGON, ON WRITING & several of his horror/thrillers.But this novel didn't work for me: I believe the beginning of a story should pack some punch in the first 40 pages or it will lose people, who have better choices.Such was the choice with DARK TOWER; talk of grits and the cowboyand gateways only held my interest for so long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get into the series before you judge it....","review":"This is a necessary introduction to the Dark Tower series, arguably Stephen King's greatest contribution to fantasy.It's not truly a stand alone book. Therefore, you're not going to have complete understanding of where this is going until you get there. Therefore, the best way to read it is to just experience it.Roland in this book is best pictured as a western gunslinger, but we do learn that isn't his origin. Nor do we know for sure exactly where all this is occuring. A significant scene has Roland asking Mr. Brown whether he believes in an afterlife, and Mr. Brown answers that he thinks this is it.This opening volume takes us with Roland in his pursuit of the Man In Black. Don't expect to find out just who this personage is. Just go with the trip and then grab the next volume.Trust me, you'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Amazing","review":"After reading many of King's books throughout high school and later into college, I readily tired of the visual allegory attempted by a writing style that I associated more with script writing. The Gunslinger, however, completely changed my expectations of all science fiction and fantasy authors. The unusual writing style, the changing mental patterns and awareness of the characters is stunning and creates a challenge to read and understand.For those tiring of the Forgotten Realms style drivel, immerse yourself in a book that has the power to change your perceptions of the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second Time was the Charm","review":"my 1st attempt at The Gunslinger was on audio-tape @ work. I promptly began to nod off before the 1st tape was finished. I swore off the book.months went by, and desparation for ANY listening material led me back. i don't proclaim to know what had changed for me, but suddenly I found myself trudging the desert with Roland, eager to see where each step would take us.the entire Dark Tower series is a part of my world. i re-read it as a whole about every 1 1/2 years (and a part of me still thinks that maybe he will catch the boy after all.....).I recommend that king fans (and any avid readers) who may have struggled getting into the story to be patient. Put it away for a few weeks or so & then try it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bluegrass and Jazz find common ground","review":"This is one of my favorite Tony Rice albums. The song COMMON GROUND is one of the main songs I point \\"new\\" people to when they are curious and want to hear what Tony means by the term \\"spacegrass\\". It's not just Tony that makes this album great though. Bassist Todd Phillips is one of the best players in this genre and the thick, woody tone of his bass is captured in full force on this recording. And check out the Civil War feel on the song BACKWATERS when Todd bows his bass!I've heard several guitarist-centered bands play MY FAVORITE THINGS and for my tastes, this is the definitive recorded \\"guitar version\\" of this song. MY FAVORITE THINGS belongs to Coltrane and Rice, although a few others try it.OH! And since people reading this may not be too familiar with it, this is one of Tony's all instrumental albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"A musical landmark and a spiritual journey","review":"This album has the ability to take the listener to another place, and is some of the best of jazz I have heard.An amazing mix of jazz and bluegrass, the artists have wonderful precision and depth, making this not only a musical and spiritual landmark, but a technical feat.Definately well worth the money; no music lover should be without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent game but difficult to play","review":"I have played this game for a couple of weeks now and it is still enjoyable. I understood how to play with the excellent manual but it is too large to print and only comes in the Adobe Acrobat Reader. There is no tutorial, but the game was easy to get the hang of. It takes awhile to build the city that you were hoping to build but when you finish the project, it is fun to keep your city going for many years. You can select many different disasters that can happen to your city so that you're not always bored waiting for the money to rack up. Overall, this is the best game I have played for the pocket pc; seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memories of my youth.","review":"This is a gift for my Father who played trombone with the Frankie Carle Orchestra for a short period of time when he was first getting started.

If only he'd included the rest of it this CD would be auditory Nirvanna. Many other wonderful things too including some electronically prepared keyboard pieces, some classical piecies (including a lovely Bach), and some splendidly played Grateful Dead tunes (Tom's is one of my favorite recordings of 'Dark Star'). But the treasures are Tom's own compositions including 'Encodex Punctilious'. And is piano chops are close to unbelievable. Some of these pieces are technically unplayable for most earthling pianists.You'll never know how much you need this CD 'till you get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, until...","review":"I threw the book away when the pastor in the book started talking about \\"Spiritual Israel\\". I realize this is a piece of fiction but I got offended at the suggestion that Christians (the Church) replaced Israel. When God was making \\"everlasting\\" promises to Israel, it was to Abraham's seed through Isaac and Jacob. Period. Not once did the O.T. say \\"Spiritual Israel\\". Why anyone would believe this nonsense is beyond me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indiana Jones and the Search for Noah's Ark","review":"This is a fun book. I would not go so far as to call it a masterpiece by any means, but the topic is fascinating, the characters are mostly well developed and the story is engaging and hard to put down. Essentially, it is a story about an archeologist who discovers Noah's Ark. The discovery and excavation of the Ark is presented in a realistic way, as is the press reaction. The truly intriguing aspect of the book is the impact this discovery has on the world. Since the Ark is discovered exactly as it was depicted in the Bible, what does this mean from a theological standpoint? The main characters are certainly impacted by this premise. This would make a great Indiana Jones movie, and as I read the book I kept envisioning the lead character as Harrison Ford. In summary, I recommend the book, have fun and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Noah and the Clone","review":"Ummm . . . how does someone discover Noah's Ark but still deny that God had a role in it's existence? Oh, well. Though logically flawed in a number of areas, \\"A RIFT in Time\\" was a fun and interesting read. If you've already read \\"Rift\\" (or even if you haven't), I highly recommend you check out \\"The Christ Clone Trilogy\\" by James BeauSeigneur."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-So","review":"I found it hard to stay interested in this book. I think the only reason I stayed with it was to see if the hero and the heroine ever got together. I found the theology badly flawed, which would probably not bother many people, but it quite ruined the book for me. I much prefer Peretti and LeHay, and wish there were more like these."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting read","review":"This book was one of those that you really need a little Bible knowledge to make it as intriguing as it is meant to be. I found the theories mind-boggling. I've never really stopped to ask the questions \\" Is the arc still there?\\" and \\"Where is it located? \\". If you are one of those \\"seeing is believing\\" type of people maybe this book would provoke your curiosities enough to seek out THE TRUTH. Phillips did a wonderful job of exploring some incredible possibilities of our Biblical pasts. I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to the believer and non-believer alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT SOUND FOR THE SOUL","review":"This is an excellent buy. Well worth the money.

This is a great story about heroism and Chinese culture. And the story is exciting: intrigue, subplots, deception, fighting, and a little love thrown in to balance it all out. The art is exceptional, my only complaint is the blatant un-feminine appearance of the female monks-they look just like the men, and it's confusing to people that aren't aware of the story.All in all, it's a great introduction to Chinese culture, and an exciting comic book for those that aren't that interested in it. For a true taste of Jin Yong's (née Louis Cha) writing make sure to check out John Minford's translation of \\"The Deer and the Cauldron\\" also here on Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh insights into the unknown.","review":"If you like your mysteries with one foot firmly entrenched in reality, than this book is for you. No wild speculation here but merely reporting the stories as the author uncovers them with no embellishments. For those of you who gravitate towards cryptozoological mysteries you will not be disappointed as there is fresh new information found nowhere else and for the novice there is a fine section explaining what cryptozoology means and how to go about doing your own research. For those who like more of the paranormal, there is plenty here also that will arouse curiousity and questions.

The acting is horrendous. The main actor is so wooden and boring.The plot, which could have been great, spirals towards a soap opera of drama for characters that are to boring to care about.Special effects and make up are cheesy at best.On flaw is one of the characters is slashed in the neck from side to side, blood spurting everywhere, but when the other characters pick her up off the floor, there is no blood on the floor."},{"rating":"2","title":"really a fun horror movie!","review":"Ok, so I am going to ignore the ending, and otherwise it was a great horror movie. I watched it in the middle of the day and it did creep me out. It was subtle and scary. Interesting plot (if a little predictable). So-so acting.

But heck, if you just take it for what it is, a fun horror movie, its great and I would recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"The movie was very weak in my opinion.

(WIthout too much of a spoiler:) The end should have gone in a different and much more effective direction and satisfactorily concluded them film, but no! the audience gets cheated with an ending that has almost nothing to do with the rest of the film. Did the producers re-shoot the ending? Give the company some extra bucks to pay for CGI, regardless of whether or not it was needed? If you hated the HAUNTING because of the bad CGI resolution, then stay away from this film"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Film didn't look that great.","review":"OK, I've only seen a few bits and pieces of this film. But from what I saw this movie didn't really look that good. It looked like it was a boring movie about the College crowd that dragged allot.

This was not a very good movie, nor was it very bad. The actors did their job, as did the director, the writers, well? I will say this:it is better than \\"Penny Dreadful\\", in the long haul, although PD had a more exciting ending.This is kind of original,in that the plot will not be recognizable to most horror fans, so I would like to give it a 2.75.There isn't much to say about this film except do not buy it, rent it when the rental store is out of stock of them movie you really wanted to see. And rent it when you have a pocket ful ofmoney , otherwise, you will bevery angry that you spent your last on a movie like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good in comparison","review":"Compared to the other Horrorfest movies this one is the best in my opinion.

To this day, I turn into a blubbering mess every time I hear it. It may just have been too sad for radio to play!From the sad realization in Bonhoffs lyrics, to the beyond-extreme emotional delivery of this tune from the lovely Linda, it's one track that breaks me every time.The production values are also superb.

Her take on the classic Patsy Cline song, \\"Crazy\\" , is wistful as well as woeful, and the entire album would be my first choice if I were spending a rainy night remembering old, lost loves.

I was appalled by the heavy-handed way the arguments were framed, which seemed to me to be dishonest. For example, in the section on Noah's Ark, the arguments are set up as a very one-sided debate, with the anti-deluge side presented as rude, vulgar and stupid. The author's answers sound reasonable, but many arguments are never answered in a credible way.

Well, having poor eyesight is better than no eyesight at all and offers an survival advantage to those creatures. Many animals in natural acutally have \\"Half an eye\\", poorly devolped vision, light sensitive cells and other things.

It contains some valid critique of the evolutionary theory. Critique of a theory DOES NOT mean validation of another, considerably more farfetched theory. If there is critique to be found in the theory, the model changes, it is not destroyed. Once creationism is able to destroy the central tenets of the theory, I will buy it.In the current case, it is simply redundant. Peer-reviewed critiques change the model already; creationism introduces NOTHING new to the debate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, don't waste your money on this trash.","review":"Nothing more than a Bible thumper regurgitating creationist babble.

It's bad science...or actually, pseudo-science, meaning it's not even science. It's filled to the brim with fallacies that ANYONE who has a working brain cell can counter.The only people who are going to think this book is remotely intelligent, are people who are already die-hard creationists, who are just looking for something to back up their pre-conceived notions.

The only \\"relentless myth\\" is creationism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great single book on creationism.","review":"If you want a great first book on scientific creationism, or an all inclusive book, this is it. The \\"groovy dude\\" tone of some of the book toggles between being a little distracting and being a little funny. A couple of topics were covered in too shallow a manner, but 90% of the topics were terrific, in-depth studies and the overall message is sound and trustworthy. This author does an outstanding, I mean outstanding, job of quoting scientists on each and every point made. Very logical outline. Great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Survival of the Fittest","review":"It's always puzzled me how non-living matter became living matter. How can a \\"survival of the fittest\\" theory account for - say a carbon molecule combining with other elements to form organic matter - because neither are alive in the first place - they don't 'need' to survive to exist.Well, this book may give you some help in debunking other evolutionary notions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Here we go again.","review":"Although I can empathize with the trepidation that some (including Perloff) may feel when scientific evidence contradicts a deeply held personal belief. This book is a poor attempt to refute a fact supported by a tremendous amount of evidence. The book is based entirely on a need to ensure that nothing contradict a Biblically literalist Christian interpretation of natural history. The book's scientific evidence is unfounded and it uses the fallacious practice of appealing to authority, e.g., stating that Issac Newton was a creationist. (Of course Newton was a creationist, evolutionary ideas had not yet been coherently proposed when Newton lived.) Read Finding Darwin's God by Kenneth Miller for a sympathetic, Christian (though certainly not Biblically literalist) and well reasoned discussion of these issues. Miller also carefully shows the unfoudedness of Perloff's supposedly scientific refutation of evolution."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"A WISH COME TRUE?\\"","review":"a friend of mine has this disc and i plan on ordering it for myself. if sounds great. we are curious to know if you have any plans on releasing carmen mcrae's \\"AT THE GREAT AMERICAN MUSIC HALL\\" also. if you read the reviews of the lp on amazon, there are people who would love to own this recording. please take this into consideration. thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD you will play over and over again","review":"While in Austin, Tx on a business trip, I happen to see Darryl Dodd live and bought this CD then.

However, the copy I just bought, there is no such thing. Instead, kickboxing was on one dvd and hip hop was on a separte DVD, and with this there was no such thing as a \\"blender\\" to mix and match these workouts, because they were on two totally separte discs. Has anyone else run into this problem when purchasing this workout DVD? Maybe I just happened to get a \\"bad\\" one in the bunch.

Wicked Little Things is told through a series of horror movie cliches so old you may not remember the first time they were used in a movie.

The charger operates on timed charge for AA, AAA, C, and D cells rather than operating on the batteries actual state of charge. This can dramatically shorten the life of batteries that are not deeply discharged before recharging. The charger is almost unusable for 9V rechargable batteries, as there is not even a timer function that shuts off the charge voltage.

One of the great things I hear here is that although his lyrics started head and shoulders above so many his craft got better and better, right to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let the sun shine - it's easier than dealing with this thing!!!","review":"What a horrible product. The clips that attach to the top of the window are a fine idea, however they are completely worthless for windows that have any curve (and I believe almost all vehicles have curved windows in the rear seats). Because of this problem, we closed the window and the thing totally bent in half, making it useless when trying to roll the shade down. It's cheaply made and even with the window closed completely, the clips allow air to blow into the vehicle (so it's obviously not a great choice for winter when snow-glare makes shades necessary). I would recommend the white hot sun shades by Munchkin instead. Even though they use suction cups instead of clips, I'm very impressed with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy","review":"These shades do not work well in our SUV. Luckily the windows are already tinted so the sun does not get in our daughter's eyes. The Amer. Acad. of Ped. does not suggest using these since they can fly off and hurt your baby. If you have to use them, use the kind that you can apply directly to the window (like a sticker, but it is removable)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Super","review":"Even with its 17 inch width, the difference between this and other standard roller shades was minimal. I bought this thinking that it will cover most of the side window in my minivan, but it did not. Thinking I can tip it side ways, the roller was too long for the height of the window. I would have been better off buying two standard size ones and use them together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Help !","review":"This shade is a big help with my daughter.

On this DVD, Ben and his solid band The Innocent Criminals deliver an impressive set of rock/blues/reggae/funk/folk/R&B, and make it clear that they refuse to be put in a box or labelled in any way. Their range of musical stylings takes the audience on a roller coaster ride of soulful tunes, soaked in the honest emotion only roots music can offer. Whether the tunes are inspired by Hendrix, Marley, Dylan, Marvin Gaye, or Mississippi John Hurt, their energy is contagious. Ben showcases his talents as a vocalist, guitarist (lap slide and standard styles, electric and acoustic!), percussionist, songwriter, social activist, and even as a surfer. This DVD truly captures the power and excitement of their live shows, and leaves no questions as to why this talented band has such a loyal following."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pass the Soul","review":"This dude rocks. His music meshes reggae beats with the soul of Mowtown combined with blues from deep within. Even if you've never heard his music, it only takes seconds to understand Ben's genuine musical talent. He displays incredible slide guitar style, with unique fingerpicking riffs that can be heard in a cocktail of electric and acoustic songs. From start to finish Ben puts forth passionate energy, that simply \\"brings down the house\\" Its refreshing to know that ben sings with a love for music heard in his passionate tones. You will feel like your a long time friend of Ben's by the end of this dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad camera work...","review":"Imagine you have the best bass player in the world in your band.Imagine you have a song, that was ok in studio, but has a really funky groove kick a$$ bass live, much better than the studio version.Imagine your bass player, the best out there, is playing his incredible solo in this very song.Question: at this particular moment, what footage would you expect fram a live show recording?Answer: some girl in the audience doing a breakdance!Smart choice, don't you agree?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"This DVD is well recorded, good sound and plenty of content but:Ben Harper has been losing his magic with time. His last cd's are not even close to his first cd's, in sound and in mysticism. This show is full of new songs and also full of production, which gives the show a feel of lack of freedom. You dont see him much usingthe weisenborn, one he used so much on his early cd's. He's not much of a showman either, which hurts his songs. This dvd is ok but the bad thing is that Ben has lost his mojo with time, and you can feel it here."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE SOUND IS HORRIBLE!!!!!","review":"I Think!My friends of the others commentary about this dvd don'tunderstanding of sound ,because i agree the performances in allmusics are cool but the sound is horrible,i don't known man, i think the principal engineer sound of virgin was busy with lenny kravitz.I have a vcd of bercy show and the sound is better than Hollywood Bowl;the bootlegs of pleasure and pain is better than Hollywood Bowl,i have a audio show of Bowery Ballroom is muchbetter than Hollywood Bowl,so i don't entering in sound details.This show is not good unfortunately.I don't read in dvd the names of engineer sounds ,but i will read,because in the next dvd or live cd audio the enginner sounds are the same of this dvd i will see and lesson before buy,I wrote this with deep sorrow in my heart ,i'm huge fan of Ben Harper and The Innocent Crimnals; but sorry, this dvd is not good.I Love the musics of Ben Harper and The Innocent Crimnals ,buti appreciate excellent sounds too.Rodrigo Assinger. 22/11/2003"},{"rating":"2","title":"O2 sensor","review":"Product arrived sooner than thought, installed it myself was easy with only problem was the connector did not match my car's connector even thou the website confirmed it.

After a long search to find the name artist, I quickly ordered this double CD set from Amazon. After listening to both, I was astonished that I had never before heard of this talented artist. It boggles the mind how fast her fingers move on the piano. The CD's are lively and great for a long drive or to keep your energy level up at home. Just two songs, \\"Swinging the Boogie\\" and her jazzy rendition of \\"Rhapsody in Blue\\" are well worth the purchase price. The instrumental CD is my favorite as her vocals are not as strong as her astounding skills at the piano. I continue to be surprised that this lady never achieved the great popularity her musicianship deserved even despite performing with the likes of Louis Armstrong. This set is definitely recommended for any fan of swing, ragtime, jump blues, or honky-tonk piano."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful Desk Reference","review":"Since buying this book, I have referred to it many times.

(Funny, how all these albums came out around the same time) I know fans will argue that Rain Dogs, Nighthawks, or Mule Variations is better. However, even those albums have songs that are hard to listen to sometimes. There isn't a song on this album that isn't great! From the opening Waltzing Sound of Tom Trumpert's Blues, the salesman of Step Right Up, The personification gone wild Piano Has Been Drinking, to the final plea to see his girl after work on the final song this album is magical and timeless. If you're looking for the piano man on top of his game, look no further."},{"rating":"2","title":"brialliant, perfect","review":"With Small Change, Tom Waits has shown that he is THE heavyweight romantic poet of the latter twentieth century. So eloquent, so moving are these songs that the listener becomes infused with a warm glow. And the more you play it, the more you hear. His sly, deep blues vocal style has the power to knock you over every time. And then there is his musicianship- these are GREAT SONGS.

Its hard to take anything they say seriously.There are many stupid moments they call \\"unexplained instances\\", these include Bores' camera shutting off for no reason or Alan tripping over a staircase believing an invisible force pushed him.

I have read about Andy Carpenter from the very first and feel that if I walked into Charlies there would be a seat waiting at his table for me along with Kevin, Pete and Vince.Each character has his own very special and distinct personality and I love them all.It is an entertaining book but although Andy has a clever wit, he is dead serious when he takes a case and goes after justice like Tara, the ever-faithful golden retriever goes after her biscuits.Rosenfelt has a 'feel' for the courtroom ... and his writing is so fluid ... just carries you along from page 1 on a sea of words.

While this film shares Dickens' sentiments and causes, it cannot at all approach his greatness as a writer and is poor by comparison. Dickens characters are alive with bright, unique personalities; those in this film are flat. There are wonderful Dickens books on video (many multiple times).

Seeing that it was compared to \\"Like Water for Chocolate\\" is what really made me want to read it. The only similarity it has to \\"Like Water for Chocolate\\" is that it includes recipes. \\"Like Water for Chocolate\\" is a great example of magic realism. This book is pure and utter chick lit that is actually somewhat shallow.I very rarely give up on books, but I almost did on this one. I could not get into the book. The main characters were like the popular girls in school that were rather superficial.

I really tried to get into to it-- i did, but aside from the recipes, I agree it will probably appeal to the high school crowd and not the 20-something real college grads.The J.Lo and Ben Affleck thing will obviously date the book--- that is a real first rule of things, don't date yourself by listing to many current events and too many in the moment name brands....

The authors really suspect their readers to not get things--talk about a book that \\"dumbs it down\\". I agree with the reviewer that said it was like reading a NY version of Saved by the Bell only the characters were all \\"women\\" in NY. Check out \\"Pick Me Up\\" by Zoe Rice if you want to read about real Manhattanites with genuinely clever characters. These authors are just jumping on the Chick lit bandwagon and trying to cash in with unoriginal characters and poor plot development. Sounds like they're just trying to pitch whatever they can to HBO. Read Zoe Rice's bio, then her book--you won't we disappointed! Also, I just finished Something Blue by Emily Giffen---wonderful read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't even finish","review":"I love cooking and chick lit but this was the worst book ever! I was really looking forward to it too. The recipes were ok.... i'll probably even use some, but the story itself makes you lose your appetite. The writing is juvenile and trite and having lived in NYC, I feel a little insulted that college grads in NYC are protrayed as air heads. I like characters to be cute and flawed but the sad part about this story is that I think the authors intended us to believe their characters were cool acting like mindless bimbos. Not one of them was clever in the cute and flawed way. This is a truly boring and high schoolish read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nashville??","review":"So do the authors have relatives in Nashville?

At least write an original review. Quit saying \\"great summer beach read\\" ...Does this mean it sucks every other season?? And believe me, it won't be a book that will be dragged along all summer, and if its full of stains its because it was used for anything but a summer beach read--to wipe off excess tanning lotion perhaps? I know they think all the readers of this book are too dumb to realize--but self promotion is sickening, take constructive feed back with dignity.If you want good chick lit check out Sophie Kinsella or the Something Borrowed series...Its interesting that all these so called \\"reviewers\\" just happen to know there is a sequeal on the way...

I, too, am wondering how this book was published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"Do not be deceived! Skip this book unless you want to get totally frustrated and you like boring, borrowed characters who machinate to boring, borrowed plots. The good gal is whiny and stupid. The other characters are all unoriginal caricatures (and not in the clever way). Disjointed, mottled, and, worst of all, self-unaware, this book is a waste of time.

The author had the nerve to talk about mullets and Robert Frost on the same page, as if one could possibly compare to the other.One of the Divas even managed to say, \\"We have to have some skill in the kitchen so that we have something to register at Williams-Sonoma when we get married.\\" Yes, that is the reason to learn to cook. Let me tell ya.It was a little bit more palatable towards the end, but still no cigar.Seriously, there is a whole genre of appealing Chick Lit. out there.

The energy he brings to the stage and into his music will live on in this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A memorable album which can change lives","review":"I still remember the first time I heard this album almost twenty years ago (and back then it still was an album). I was just blown away by a range of emotions I thought I was too mature to experience through music - joy, love, sadness, heartbreak, happiness. To listen to Harry put his heart and soul into \\"A Better Place To Be\\" still sends shivers up and down my spine. There is nothing better than cruising down a highway with the windows down and bellowing along to Harry Chapin at the very top of your voice. If you do not have this one buy it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent album","review":"Very enjoyable album.

There have been different songwriters, but there has been none better than the late Mr Chapin. It has long been a foible of humanity to glorify the dead, but, this man could write a song like no-one else. I really wish he were still with us. Not because of what he could have written, but simply because the world desperately needs men like Mr Chapin. Listen and enjoy. Listen to life. If this does not affect your pulse, call a doctor.

This album presents the man in concert (and at his peak, he was doing some 200 of them a year, most for charitable causes), where his warmth and humor come shining through.Laugh along with the different endings of \\"30,000 Pounds of Bannanas\\" and enjoy the revised opening of \\"I Wanna Learn a Love Song.\\" Chapin's best songs are his bittersweet ones of missed opportunities, though, and this album has 'em in spades: W.O.L.D, Taxi, Cat's in the Cradle, Mr. Tanner (one of the most heartwrenching songs in the canon), and A Better Place to Be. A fine collection of material from a beloved performer."},{"rating":"2","title":"memories!","review":"Admittedly, this CD makes me cry!

Our church, is finishing up The Story as a program, and the only thing I like about it is, the fact they have the scripture references in it, so I can look them up in a real Bible.The book chops, slices, and dices, the Bible up, so bad, I can hardly keep track, of what's going on. The antique white pages, with brown type, don't help in physicaly being able to read it, either.Another note: many in my Church, were upset that this book, claims to be an alternative to the Bible, in the Preface.

A great way to get an overview of what the Bible is about, though not a substitute for the Canon of Scripture.

I was sorely disappointed. In the preface, it says that they've omitted portions of the Bible and that they've included \\"transitions\\" in italics to summarize what was left out. I'm continuously reminded of the verse in Revelations 22:18-1918 For I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds to these things, God will add to him the plagues that are written in this book; 19 and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from the Book of Life, from the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.In my opinion, The Story, which claims to be a Bible, is misleading, incomplete, and not the true word of God. It has been added to and taken away from, and isn't worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Story Opinion","review":"I found it helpful to read and digest the stories of The Bible in this format. Hopefully readers will not assume that this compilation in any way takes the place of reading or referencing The Bible; it is merely a companion to the original verses. I enjoyed being able to form a better mental picture of the characters and story line, presentation was easily digested as an ongoing tale.

The XXX music videos were also more than entertaining. What I didn't like was how unorganized the DVD was. Music videos were cut short and a poor scene selection. what also pissed me off was how the in between of a group of druggies dissing Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg. It just totally disappointed me and made me regret buying it.

Let me tell you all what happens in the video: POSITIVES: A few Tupac concert performences that are cut short anyway. Some good X-rated stuff. Behind the scenes pac material. NEGATIVES: Only about 3-4 of the videos are finished properly. The unrealesed Pac videos are exactly the same but with a few scenes changed. Nothing really exciting. Dissing Snopp and Dre. Bunch of mark A$$ tricks who sit in a car that think they know what death row was all about. AND THE CUTTING OUT OF THE VIDEOS.

First of all, all of the videos advertised on the DVD package are not there. You cannot navigate this DVD like a normal DVD.

What irks me the most is some of the promised videos just aren't there dude. This is plain old false advertsing. Maybe they are there and I just couldn't find them because I have never seen a DVD in my life where scenes repeat-I am not lying, you watch a video and a life performance in one point of the DVD and then it starts over to the same live Dogg Pound performance.

I have been playing guitar since I was 10. I started working on writing my own songs right around the time that I first heard this album. The lyrics were so sublime, honest, intimate, powerful and articulate that it sets the bar so high for what songwriting should be that for many years I found myself lyrically mute, feeling like the standard for what truly great songwriting should be was now set almost impossibly high.At the same time the simple paired-down beauty of the music itself reveals that it isn't over-the-top production that make a song great, it's the passion with which it is written."},{"rating":"2","title":"jackson browne's 1972 debut.","review":"a fine first outting from the artist that epitomizes the sensitive singer-songwriter genre. \\"doctor my eyes,\\" \\"something fine,\\" and \\"rock me on the water,\\" are fantastic, and the other seven tracks are excellent to boot. mr browne has a very pleasing voice that is warm and expressive, tinged with a heartfelt sense of melancholy which permeates his ballads. if you are new to jackson browne, i would recommend the \\"late for the sky\\" album as your first purchase. after that, \\"the pretender,\\" or \\"running on empty,\\" or this one (his debut), are all fine choices. good stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Everyone In Sales!!!!!","review":"If you sell services to individuals, and do not sell directly to large corporations - this book is not for you!!!!This book was misrepresented as being for everyone - regardless of the target to which/whom you sell.

This book caters more to those in need of cutting through the beaurocracy that affects sales to major corporations.Be careful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Written by a greedy salesman.","review":"What gives salespeople a bad rap? They focus on personal gain. This book is all about tricking prospects into doing business with you. The author boasts about figuring out how to get a special badge so that he can roam freely about the organization. He claims that it gave him special status, but it sounds more like he was suddenly able to randomly annoy people.In once section, entitled \\"Focus on the prospect,\\" the author actually says, \\"the more you can get her to talk, the faster you'll figure out the best way to sell to her.\\" Nearly half of this book focuses on pricing, bidding and RFP's, when in today's sales climate, a focus on knowing their business so thoroughly that you can actually make improvements is more ethical and effective.The days of fooling gatekeepers, telling jokes before meetings and taking prospects golfing in lieu of being a huge asset are OVER. But apparently, Steve Kaplan didn't get the memo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very little of real value","review":"Nice paper, full color printing, a catchy title ... When readers say these things it usually means there is nothing else worth raving about, and in this case they would be correct.

The author is condescending at best and downright insulting at worst. I think it's safe to assume that anyone buying a cookbook can um - cook! She also uses butter in every other recipe, but according to the book her kids are allergic to dairy. I don't get it. She's also a little off the deep end, she basically goes off on the entire food industry as if they are trying to kill her little darlings on purpose. Then there is a section where she goes off on a tangent about the dangers of using a grill - then she actually has the audacity to provide a recipe for grilling hotdogs and hamburgers! As if I need a cookbook for that. The other problem that I have with the book is that nearly every recipe centers around a sauce made with dijon mustard, olive oil and copious amounts of lemon juice. I'm very allergic to lemon juice, so in all honesty my ability to use this cookbook is almost non-existant."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money","review":"this book is virtually useless....it just gives a very cursory once over to the various parts of office 97. when you need to know the specifics of how to do something, it is not there. most questions i had had to be dug out of the help files of office 97. when i found real reference manuals, the answers were there in the appropriate sections. in short, buy another manual or seperate manuals for each program"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE SCENT OF SUMMER FLOWERS","review":"Chanel No.5 has, of course, become an icon in the world of perfume. Whether it be song, book or film if a desirable, highly sought after scent is mentioned it is most often Chanel No. 5. However, we'd be hard pressed to choose between Chance and Chanel No.5. Let's just say it's a tie. Both are beguiling, memorable fragrances.Chance, for us, is a happy daytime fragrance as it is a rich bouquet of fresh floral sensations. There are notes of Hyacinth, White Musk, Citron, Punk Pepper, Jasmine, Fresh Vetiver, Oris Absolute and Amber of Patchouli - a magical mixture.Chance comes in a rounded bottle, almost a perfect circle presented in a pink box.It's been a favorite for some time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"I used to be obsessed with Spanish music. However, recently, I have found new passions in music. Kinky was my all-time favorite Spanish artist. I bought their album and COULDN'T stop listening to it!! The first album's catchy beats and striking lyrics left me bringing my Walkman everywhere. When I heard they were coming out with a new album, I was quite excited. I previewed a couple of clips on numerous websites, and was pleased overall. However, I must admit this album is not quite as impressive as their self-titled debut. The songs are simply not as devolped, and the beats are not as catchy. None of the songs on the new album can compare to \\"Ejercicio #16\\" or \\"Great Spot,\\" the two Kinky songs I still listen to frequently. I must say, Atlas seems like an intriguing buy, but definitely buy the first album before this one, to get a true idea of what Kinky was like before they were somewhat Americanized."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"Loved the last album.

I rarely, almost never post negative reviews, only in special circumstances, if I am passionate about the badness. This time I am. Spoken started out as a band with a sound similar to Rage Against the Machine, and were filled with cool lyrics and head banging arrangements. Now, I hear the lead singer sound like a cat being harpooned by Captain Ahab. The music has sunk into the everyday monotonous grind agenda. All around... WHAT HAPPENED? Come on guys, return to your roots. You have given your current fans enough of this style, its time to return to your base. Until then I will be awaiting patiently for another album like \\"On your Feet.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Spoken perfectly","review":"What a great disc from a virtually unknown, underrated band! It is different from past offerings. The breaks aren't quite as busy and complex. The vocals have much less screaming. But the result is a beautiful mix of emotion driven rock and roll with profound lyrics and solid musical chops! Spoken has a live show that rcks your socks off. I am looking forward to seeing them perform these new tracks and seeing how well they pull them off with their endless energy. Very solid offering from start to finish!"},{"rating":"2","title":"sounds EMO, but it's not a BAD thing *wink*","review":"*I heard about Spoken a few years ago on Christianrock.net and I think they're AWESOME.

These guys have always put their heart & soul into their material and it truly shows. I love their hardcore sound, but this album definitely shows a different side to them.

A person dies, well just another day sort of feel. Music is used to create tension instead of actual happenings. This can be annoying when mundane activities are masked with music filled anticipation which then falls flat. You know these kind of movies.*****Spoilers**************Spoilers*********May help youHeres an example of one occurrence in the movie....After a few minutes, a guy finds his fiancee dead in a large puddle of blood. She bled out they say. It is later found that something ruptured inside her heart. OK, why all the blood outside her body within minutes?The creepiest thing in the movie is a vat where cadavers are kept in the lab, no its not that bad.No you don't see any zombie action either, its only suggested and leaves you waiting for it.I say stay away from this one, but thats my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls Way Short !","review":"In the very beginning of \\"UNREST\\" you can almost feel the potential creeping it's way up your spine, but as the movie progresses to the halfway mark the plot regresses and just plain old falls short and takes a detour into the \\"already been done before\\" catagory. To me the only sub-genre of horror that can get away with that is the SLASHER flick. Supernatural films must stay fresh to stay alive. With that said, there are a handful of creepy moments as well as natural gross-out's but not even close to enough to save this flop. I myself was not fulfilled."},{"rating":"1","title":"They could have done so much more with this idea.","review":"This movie could have been way freakier if they changed the story a little.First of all, when you first see the \\"HELP\\" in blood drenched on the towel that Alison finds, you know right then that the antagonist is not dangerous, but is looking for help instead?Lame.The illusion collapses right here folks.The blood message on the towel should have said \\"You're all dead\\", and the cadaver should come to life and run around killing people.Instead, the \\"spirit\\" that possessed the cadaver just goes around possessing everyone else, and everyone commits suicide.Not fready at all.A psychotic zombie cadaver would have been so much scarier."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNscary and UNinteresting","review":"The cover for this DVD is the scariest thing about it. It's also one of those covers that has nothing to do with the movie. No cold corpse crawls out from a morgue's holding container. Wish one did. Then maybe it might have contained something scary. Yet another one of Afterdark Horrorfest's lame excuses for horror. Yet to see one that was good the whole way through. BORING. AVOID like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break","review":"This movie was terrible. Even for an indie it was pretty dull. The acting is lousy, and the story is boring. Just about the whole movie is about this med student who is obsessed with a cadaver. The script is almost laughable and I actually considered turning it off a couple times. It was a good effort, but I wouldn't waste my time on this stinker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrorfest, et tu horrorfest? Unrest is not a horror film.","review":"Ok,again. Not the best movie or scariest movie i have ever seen, in fact probably the least scary horror movie i've seen in years claiming to be one.This is about how you should not screw around with dead bodies, the spirit may require revenge. but it was done in a Degrassi Junior High way.Much too much moral hesitation and never really delivers any scares at all.More drama than horror.Thanks Lion's Gate, can't wait for the next Horrorfest!Maybe we'll get more comedies and musicals for the next installation of HORRORFEST FILMS!!!(insert evil laugh here)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unrest","review":"I am a horror movie fan. Unrest is what I call a B horror film. If you find the right ones, there are good-to-great B movies. Unrest is one. The cast is unknowns.

It appears these movies have some really well written descriptions and creepy looking covers to draw you in, but in no way deliver as far as the movie itself is concerned.This one follows a group of pre-med students who do a little autopsy on a cadaver that somehow decides it was disrespected and needs to get revenge. One by one they start to go down until the mystery of the cadaver is solved, but by that point it doesn't matter. Again this one had potential but became so boring I barely stayed awake through it.Don't bother with this one either, total waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"can I give it zero stars please????????","review":"This was horrible. My God, this movie is so slow, it's like waiting for water to come to a boil. The idea of using real bodies sounded so cool. But this was a REAL stinker. Please, please, stay away from this bore.

I'm not sure what the director was going for."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Horror Movie Out Of The 8 Films To Die For","review":"Okay this has got to be one of the scariest movies of all time, I think it's really fun for the ways people create horror movies and I think this was the best idea from what happened. The ending was terrific and shocking. This film uses real human bodies which is a very good idea from most horror movies. If you want a brutal shocking scary movie to die for this would be it. Great movie that questions every single second of what comes next. I totally recommend this movie for true horror fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't find this scary, nor shocking","review":"If a movie is considered \\"Too shocking for general release\\" then there had damned well better be some shocking content in it. I don't just mean blood and gore. I mean something that makes it worthy of the marketing. Unrest doesn't have it. It's not a terrible movie, but it's like ordering a pizza and getting raw veggies instead. Both are food, both are tasty, but only one of them is what you ordered.Maybe I just don't see what is so shocking?

At first, the discussion seemed to be somewhat lengthy but if you can get yourself into the author's style, you will enjoy it. True, it's not a book for those who want a well-structured proof but that won't matter much considering this book is intended to a beginner who take his/her 1st algebra course.Lots of examples to test your understanding and lots of problems with increasing difficulty. Most of the problems are very stimulating.Even after I took my second class in Algebra (i used diff book), i often go back to this book to see some additional information. What I like best about this book though is that the author likes to explain things in terms of mappings and, of course, lots of diagram to help you better understand the concept!If you're a beginning student and considering to buy this book, then go for it - it worths the money!

There are also some errors and some of the proofs are flawed. While the verbosity is no doubt intended to make the material more accessible it has the opposite effect since it tends to obscure the intuition behind the material even if it is easier to follow the individual steps. The book seems to often try to avoid the central ideas for fear that they will be too hard for the student.The parts of the book on groups and rings are ok (though not great) but once the book gets into extension fields, Sylow theory and Galois theory things start to go downhill quickly. Artin's algebra book is much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"No where to fit in","review":"This book is not deep enough for math, and not applied enough for physics.

Too much is unanswered or left as an exercise. The student is left blind and unsteady the whole way through because of insufficient reinforcement of the material.

Jackie's own \\"Minor March\\", Monk's \\"'Round Midnight\\", and Jackie's \\"Five\\" complete the set.

Apart from the civil actions that Grace has confronted in the past 50 years(which you will not read about in this book), the company and its fascinating founder, William R. Grace, hold a rich history and an incredible story of rags to riches.As a young Irish boy, W.R. Grace came to America with a dream of wealth and commerce tied with a honest and sound approach to business. At a time when America's industrial revolution was booming and business pratices were not as regulated as they are today, Grace came forward with a honest and upfront approach that would change the face of America Commerce and would launch Grace into the spotlight, good and bad, for years to come. A must read for anyone in business!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Book","review":"Judge is an idiot. The Jesuits at Prep at the time he was there were shining exemplars for the students who went there. Judge's problem is that he, like most neocons, likes \\"easy Christianity\\" - the kind served up by the Pat Robertsons and James Dobsons of the world who willfully forget that Jesus preached a lot of tough talk about the rich and everyone's duty to the poor and the requirement to turn the other cheek.The neocons love their taxcuts for the rich and budget cuts for the poor and their wars of choice. Idiots like Judge didn't like the Jesuits at Prep because they preached the actual teachings of Jesus and not the watered down pap that neocons like Judge would rather hear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Careful....I was sent a Region 2 video even though this ad states that it is for the US/Canada","review":"Be careful!

The character development and antics of Allan A Dale along with Marian's role as a physical heroine instead of a maiden in distress make this series especially refreshing and appealing. After watching the entire series, I immediately made my husband watch it all over again with me. He enjoyed it, though he didn't think he would. I highly recommend watching it as opposed to all of the weak and pitiful garbage they are showing on television these days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silly, ludicrous, but I love it!","review":"This show is so crazy. Everything is ridiculous, but it is so entertaining. I've see all of the episodes and it is a great escape for adults and kids. It is violent, but there is never any blood or gore.

It is a little off from the Robin Hood i grew up knowing but they do a wonderful job of drawing you in. My Husband and kids complained when I watched the first episode but halfway through the first season, they got mad if I watched it without them!! You get to see lots of action and the seasons build to be more exciting than the previous one. I was disappointed when it was over. I wanted more of this show. The actors are wonderful and really make you feel like that is who the are. You grow to love the characters and end up rooting for the least likely of people. I recommend it to anyone who loves action and adventure shows, it far surpasses most, and any history lovers. The kids enjoyed it and it wasn't to bad in what would be appropriate for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of Average","review":"Lovely scenery. There is a great deal of average script to wade through between meaningful story telling moments. While I am a large fan of period pieces and BBC productions, the best scenes and acting moments can be seen on utube without spending so much time waiting for those \\"moments\\" of excellence in season 1 and 2.The final season is the best of the 3, but it's a long journey to season 3.

I instantly fell in love with the characters and \\"hated\\" the villians, and was caught up with the stories each episode would bring. It had drama, comedy, action, and compelling stories each week. The episodes stand on their own, but also had a continuing story throughout the series.

Warburton doesn't even attempt an accent and thus he seems very much like a 20th-century American wearing clothes from a costume rental shop. Co-stars Oliver Reed and Eartha Kitt fare a bit better but neither one will ever include \\"Dragonard\\" on a career resume. The movie does have one distinction, however. At one point Warburton is sentenced to receive 100 lashes and he receives all 100 of them. No editing. no montages.

Purpose seems to be to get the reader started in the right direction with the correct mindset and then seek more knowledge thru other resources....mainly by actually practicing and doing because success in this arena is not to be found solely in a book. It must be practiced beforehand so that it becomes second nature. The book is a bit outdated because as of 2013 there literally is nowhere you can go and not be discovered (except maybe the bottom of the ocean or a volcano) due to cameras on every road, every intersection, in every building, outside buildings and mass transit areas, drone surveillance, satellites, Google maps, border patrol etc...You get the point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage save your money","review":"I purchased this book to assist in trailng tracking and trailing dogs and it ends up telling how to kill the animal This author should find another job and quit writing junk \\"Can I get a refund\\" If there was any way to rate this below 1 star I would have"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Introduction to the Game, Ever.","review":"Still the best introduction to the game of Bridge, ever, hands down.

This is a cheap, low-budget attempt to cash in on the film Gods & Generals & Civil War buffs will be largely disappointed. The same reenactment footage is shown again & again & looks like it came from a home movie! For those who want a quality documentary about Gen.

When Wanda Jackson sings the line \\"Like the walls of Jericho\\" one senses the walls collapsing.It's hard to play favourites on this album, there is so much good material."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Stellar Compilation by the Queen!","review":"When you consider that Rock and Roll was only a part of Wanda Jackson's musical output, finding a good retrospective of her work in that genre is a challenge. This CD meets and exceeds this challenge with a 30-song roundup that is simply outstanding. Those who are looking more for Jackson's country music recordings should look elsewhere, but those who want just the rock and roll should be very happy with this collection. I easily rate this one 5 stars for the music, but I would have liked to see a track listing that included the musical personnel."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT","review":"I had this CD previously....someone else must have loved it as much as I do...I could not live without it so I ordered it again....

I just respect and love true music that comes from the heart.The first time I heard Wanda Jackson, it sent chills down my spine. She is such a great vocalist and guitar player that's gone virtually unoticed for many years. Overshadowed by Elvis and the male dominated rockabilly. Many music lovers have never heard of her. She deserves so much more recognition.Simply put, if you are reading this, you have somehow heard of Wanda Jackson. Don't think you can just walk into a music store and find this album anywhere. It is virtually impossible. You can't even special order. I know, I tried.

I brought the telephoto lens to an Opening Day Red Sox game so I could get some closer-up shots, but when I put all of the images on my computer that night there was a blur around EVERY single one of the pictures. This blur was caused by the telephoto lens. I did not use any digital zoom either. The Wide Angle lens is pretty good, as is the little tripod (tiny thing, but good for low shots; is adjustable). The filters are not the greatest. They work to an extent, but they are more or less plastic tinted circles. I've seen much better quality filters for the same price.In all, this is a GOOD beginner set for learning how each type of lens/filter/adapter works. If you are into anything advanced or want to use these for actual production shots, go with something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the Wilton 63302 instead","review":"I purchased the Wilton 676 and as soon as I removed it from the box, I put it back in the box for return. I was not going to drill holes in my workbench for this low-quality unit. I was very disappointed with the quality of construction given the Wilton reputation. The 676 is extremely \\"sloppy\\" (the front or mobile jaw had a great amount of lateral play). It has only ONE lockdown which I didn't realize until I received it (my dumb mistake). It leans greatly toward the lockdown (on the right side of the base) when the lockdown is loose. It almost appears as though you could give it a lateral push and separate it from its base. Maybe it's supposed to do this??? I own the Wilton 63302 as well, and it is a much better vise by ten-fold. The 63302 has tighter construction, better finish, double lockdowns, thicker bolt receptacles on the base, better pipe clamp teeth, etc. I am going to order my 2nd 63302 right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything Eames","review":"This is a wonderful addition to any coffee table!

Kalen Hughes has such a wonderful sense of the period that you'll feel like you've been dropped right into Georgian England.

The historical world Kalen Hughes creates for us is one many historical writers have a tendency to gloss over. Lord Sin has amazing depth and intelligence all around. Her characters are beautifully flawed, which sets up for a realistic, hot story I didn't want to put down. Wonderful, wonderful debut!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Where's the dialogue??","review":"I liked this book quite a bit. The only problem I had was with the dialogue between the hero/heroine. Where was it??? the author spent most of the time going on about what was going on in their heads.

I can assure you after reading thousands of romances over twenty years this is the worst piece of work that I have ever read.The thought of the heroine was provoking but I never really got to like or know her. The main characters never spoke to each other and when they did there was no substance to any of it. I was tired of reading about lust in the characters heads and not hear them speak the words to each other. There was no romance, no real emotion. I never really understood how they could have possibly fallen in love, it just made no sense.Where the heck did the title come from.........This book will be a fire starter in my Chimenea......"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was hoping...","review":"I bought Lord Sin after reading the reviews posted below, and I must say that I wish I hadn't! This is VERY far from being \\"historical romance at its best\\" (although it's a great example of why romance novels have gotten a bad rap).In the first chapter alone I thought I was going to scream if Kalen Hughes used the word \\"humanity\\" once more to describe a crowd. She's also fond of throwing in what appear to me to be random vocab words of yore in order to validate the historical time frame, but it fails miserably (and I have no idea what she's talking about). Furthermore, there are little details that don't line up that drive me nuts. For example, the heroine and the hero share a steamy kiss on the stairs as she's heading to her rooms. Shortly thereafter, bathed and dress, she come down the hallway from her room (which is on the first floor)...um....OK.As a lover of romance, I have to say that this one is weak. There's simply not enough backstory and not enough depth."},{"rating":"1","title":"A weak plot","review":"The story was set in 1788; however, the author uses modern day slang and expressions,shaky character development and no romance.

I bought it with great anticipation, but beware the \\"Bargain Series\\" sticker on the front. \\"Bargain\\", in this context, appears to mean, \\"We saved money by not doing any re-mastering and pass the savings on to you!\\"This is an AAD disk, which means that the original analog master was simply digitized. A better process is ADD, whereby the analog tracks undergo a final digital mix before the digital master is put on disk. Regardless, there is a noticeable lack of high frequency energy on this CD.

I can't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Forgotten Classic","review":"I listened to this set for the first time and was taken aback by the quality and variety of songs on it. I had heard many of the songs before on the radio down through the years, but I didn't realize that they all came from the same CD. This is one of Linda's more laid back and mellow works with beautiful melodies and sweet harmonies. Emmy Lou Harris helps out on several tunes. The songs that didn't make the radio are as good, or better, than the ones that everyone has heard. Extremely high quality throughout, among Linda's many good albums, this is one of her best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Linda Covers Great Artists","review":"This is a great Linda Ronstadt CD, and one that I think appeals most to those of us Linda fans who prefer when she sings Pop-Rock with a West Coast feel. There isn't a bad track on this album, but my favorites are \\"Love Is A Rose\\", \\"Many Rivers To Cross\\", \\"Prisoner in Disguise\\" and of course her lovely and simple cover of Dolly Parton's \\"I Will Always Love You.\\"I particularly like the sound of her strong belt on \\"Heat Wave\\" although rythmically something is missing. But any glitches are totally redeemed by her performance on the stunning \\"Silver Blue\\".Although occasionally Linda seems unable to connect emotionally to her material, tracks like \\"Silver Blue\\" and \\"Many Rivers To Cross\\" prove she has the ability to inject feeling into her amazingly strong vocals when needed, she just uses them sparingly on this album.Not as emotionally winning, but still a respectable follow up to HEART LIKE A WHEEL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Linda Ronstadt Prisoner In Disguise Mobile Fidelity Gold CD","review":"Very disappointed with the sound of this reputed \\"audiophile\\" quality CD.

The majority of the tracks actually do sound like the beginners section of a poorly taught middle school band. The few redeeming factors to be found are track 7 - \\"the wendigo myth\\", which is chanted in a native language; and a later track called \\"the cave\\", for its haunting rythyms. Beyond the short-lived interest to be found in these two tracks, this soundtrack has very little to offer, and for $14.99 you could find a much better soundtrack to spend your money on.

But with \\"Alright Again,\\" he returned from the wilderness and exploded right back to the very top. This album won the Grammy Award for Best Blues Album. It sent him and his super-talented, super-tight band \\"Gates Express\\" on world tours and earned him the type of recognition he had long deserved. It showcases not only his brilliant guitar playing, but also his music arranging talent for enabling a six or seven piece band to deliver complex arrangements usually only attempted by much bigger bands.

The reason I thought was great as it actually had Kesley Grammer(Voice of Sideshow Bob)and David Hyde Pierce(Voice of Cecil)who played brothers on the hit show Frasier and to hear them do the same on the Simpsons episode was hilarious. You also had the memorable episode of when after Bart gets accidentally drunk Prohibition is enforced in Springfield forcing Homer to after a while commit bootlegging as well as matching wits with the new federal agent.

Rather than go into a review of the book, let me offer up a few suggestions if you decide to pick up this gem.1) Give it some time to get into it. It took me about 50-75 pages to really get my mind around the time travel aspect of the story. Once you figure it out, you'll be hooked.2) Related to #1, I would not try and start reading this book unless you can take the time to get into it and not read it in small doses. This may have been my problem at first, I started reading the book 10-20 pages at a time and that probably caused me to take a bit longer to \\"get\\" it.3) Plan on having a hard time putting it down in the end.

At least not the way the friend who recommended it to me loved it.The premise was fascinating (spoiler alert: the husband can travel through time) and there were some really well-conceived a-ha moments in the book. It was these moments that made me enjoy the book overall and made it worthwhile in the end. However, there was too much down time in between where not much seemed to happen.However, this is one of those books that I find myself still thinking about weeks after turning the last page. And that may just be the ultimate compliment. Unfortunately, I find myself thinking not only how good it was, but also how much better it could have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted to like it, but didn't","review":"This book certainly came highly recommended and I think the author is definitely very talented and organized the book in a unique way. This is what kept me reading until the end. However, I came away from reading it feeling depressed. Some of the hardships faced by the main characters even brought me to tears, but not in a way I could enjoy. I had other issues with the book, too. The time traveler is severely flawed to the point that I found it hard to imagine any woman falling in love with him, let alone waiting around for him. I had to re-imagine an ending that would show the heroine moving on and living the full life she deserved. This book also rubbed against my personal sensitivity to the overuse of profanity, loveless sex and violence. Those who share these feelings may not like this book. Perhaps this is one of those books that one either loves or hates.

And, of course, there is no one to help with the kids or housework. That's nothing compared to Clare's situation in The Time Traveler's Wife. She's waiting for her husband for the great majority of her life.I got frustrated with the first 75 pages because I was too caught up in figuring out the ages and dates for Henry and Clare. After a while, the dates didn't matter all that much and all I needed to know was whether Henry was time traveling or not. The book was more enjoyable after that point. I was so caught up Henry and Clare's life that I absolutely hate the ending. I wanted to put the book down and not pick it up again when the author even hinted at the ending. =( I won't read this book again because of the way it ends, but I will remember it for a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Distasteful characters, distasteful story","review":"Gave this a couple stars for sheer creativity and an interestsing concept, butI almost didn't make it through this book as I felt it was incredibly stupid. I'm not a fan of science fiction, but love a good love story -- and this wasn't it. Henry and Claire had little chemistry for me and they both seemed more like sex partners than true lovers. All kinds of details were mishmashed together illogically. The scene in Gomez's kitchen at the very end was the epitome of ridiculous and only reinforced for me the idiocy of these characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time and money on this book. Please !!!","review":"It is the worst book that I have ever read. Whole story and characters are very shallow, fake and no consistancy at all. Henry sometimes remembers what he has done during his travel and sometimes clueless, just for the convenience of the author.

Otherwise, it wastes my hard-earn money too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique and mind-boggling ......","review":"The Time Traveer's Wife was an entertaining and intriguing story.

I picked this up as a book on CD since I spend a bit of considerable time in my car commuting. I was hooked from the first chapter. Another review wrote how they could not hang on long enough to find a sympthy for the main charater Henry, too bad. Henry does grow on you. Claire grows on you. Soon I found myself sitting in parking lots, or driveways or garages just listening to their story unfold. While it is a bit unnerving the way Henry jumps from time to time, you will learn the insights behind his relationship with wife. It is touching when he visits her as a young girl, a young woman, and as his wife. You will cry with them as they suffer from horrible circumstances in life, and laugh and cheer when they over come others. Take the time to read (or listen) to this wonderful book.

Unfortunately nothing much of interest happens during Henry's comings and goings. Five hundred pages of this stuff (Claire is 13, Henry is 43; Claire is 23, Henry is 31) is way too much. It might have worked at half the length, if -- and it's a big if -- a compelling story was also being told. Life is too short to read boring 500 page books. If time travel interests you, read Slaughterhouse-Five by Kurt Vonnegut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written - no moral sense - sex isn't always romantic","review":"Sadly I was unable to read this book through. The writing style was good and I found the premise attractive. I even liked the setup at the start of the novel, but before you even get to chapter two you have an out-of-wedlock sex scene (granted it isn't as bad as the average modern romantic novel, but still unacceptable for a practicing Christian). Why should we think it's romantic when Henry takes Clare home, having just met her, and fornicates with her? He's just getting what he can while he can. I flipped through the novel and easily found more of that type of content. If authors can actually convey a sense of romance between two people, why do they need tittilation to keep people's interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book and worth reading","review":"It's not as good as \\"The Mirror\\" but its got it where it counts.

I completely came to enjoy and love Henry and appreciate the \\"gifts\\" he gave Clare throughout their life. The book never got dull, and I felt their loss towards the end as if it were my own.

Although curious about the plotting, by the time I was halfway through it felt contrived, and I cared very little for the characters. I fear the author opted for cleverness rather than insight into the longing of the heart. I don't know how old the author is, but if she is young perhaps she will mature into human understanding.

The love of Henry and Clare is so heartwrenching and so touching. Many times, thoughout the book, I would stop and just think to myself - what if something like this were to really happen - can you imagine?! Beginning, middle and end - the entire novel was just unbelievable. I will be recommending this to everyone!! Definitely a permenant bookshelf book! For those unsure of the idea of reading a time traveling book - do not hesitate on this one! I was unsure if I would enjoy this book, before I read it, just because I am not one to really get into the whole genre/idea of time travel.

I was so moved by this book that I was compelled to write a review.I finished reading this book a week ago and am still finding myself contemplating the characters and relating the story to my life and the lives of those around me.

Unfortunately, I bought this one--what a waste of money! Essentially a grown man, Henry DeTamble is constantly traveling through time--there is no rhyme or reason to when or why he travels. Where he traveled to the majority of time is what made me so weary. He was constantly visiting a young girl (6 years-old) who was always eagerly awaiting this love of her life.I LOVE time travel books; the OUTLANDER series are among the best ever written but this one didn't have much of a story.

I read so many outstanding things about it. Lies all lies!!! I hated this book. The characters are immature, shallow, self-involved, pseudo-intellectuals with superiority complexes. To top it off, none of the characters are happy with their lives or add anything of value to the world. They have no morals or ethics and they are hypocritical. I wonder if the author has much contact with people - the characters were that unrealistic. It was offensive on many different levels and disturbing - not in the \\"it makes you step back and think\\" way. The obvious theme of the novel is the concept of entrapment and that was exactly how I felt as I read it - trapped. Don't make the mistake I made and bring it to your book club - they may never trust your judgement again."},{"rating":"1","title":"How is it even possible....","review":"that over 1,000 people have given this book 5 stars. I cannot even go into how much I disliked this book because it is not worth any more of my time. I have spent enough valuable precious moments on this book. Romance???? HA! Where?! I will give you that it is a \\"novel\\" idea but my idea of a good book is not reading about a man performing \\"favors\\" on himself...a woman \\"sleeping\\" with her husband as an older version sleeps next to her...I can go on and on...but I wont!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only order if you like Tragedies","review":"This book had one of the most unsatisfying endings I've ever read. The book overall is well written and kept me turning the pages, but an ending makes or breaks a book. SPOILER: I didn't view the book as a Tragedy until the last page. Henry encounters Clare as an old woman, and before she sees him, he describes her as appearing sad. When she sees him, he describes her as joyful. The implication is that Clare wasted the rest of her life waiting for Henry. That is a tragedy. It means that their love was nothing more than a codependent chain between them. If their love surpassed them to become something larger than themselves, then she could have moved on and lived a life filled with love. I would not recommend this book, and I won't be seeing the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the movie","review":"Henry Detamble has problems with time - without warning he is dragged through time and is dropped into different decades regardless of what he happens to be doing! With paradoxes that are sure to twist the mind, Henry often encounters himself and will help himself out of a problem - huh?! Clare has seen Henry pop into her life since he first arrived in a meadow naked but for his smile. The inevitable love story is sweet and wonderful and with a brand new movie, interest in this book is at its height.While the movie is good, it really doesn't do a good job of exploring the feelings of the main characters especially when Henry disappears. I'd suggest reading the book first before seeing the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn ...","review":"With all of the hundreds and hundreds of rave reviews, it took awhile for me to figure out just what it was about this book that rubbed me the wrong way, then it hit me: every few pages (sometimes several times on the same page) it was like starting a new short story. Now, I do read short story collections, but for me they miss that build that you only get from a long novel. In this book, it's like starting over hundreds of times, kind of like Groundhog day, only that was more interesting. And if the cohesive whole of the story would have been enhanced by this gimmick, I would have been happy with it, but it wasn't. It was just too disjointed. And I can't believe that a first time author was allowed to ramble on, giving page after page of detail that did not further the story in any way, shape or form. Are we back to the days of authors getting paid by the word?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic love story","review":"This is the first book review I've ever been compelled to write, and that's only because this is truly a fantastic book and it would be a shame not to share my joy of finding it.The writing is addictive, the story compelling. You just can't stop reading, and at the same time you just don't want it to end, because when it does - you'll cry. Audrey Niffenegger has written a homage to love that transcend the time, and I'm humbled by the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to love this but...","review":"I was excited about the premise of this book and wanted to love it, but found it unequivocally terrible. The character are flat and underdeveloped. The author constantly tells and never shows. She tells us these characters are soul mates, but I never saw it, or believed it. She tells us they're beautiful and interesting, but they take on no life of their own. I don't know what they loved about each other. Their dreams are small and their interests are each other and that's about it. After spending 10 years whining about wanting a baby, we never see any bond between them and their child. The supporting characters are mere skeletons and everyone's parents are reduced to overdone stereotypes. this book never came alive for me. You want a love story with some power, read Jane Eyre. Skip this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, cloying and poorly written","review":"It's obvious that a lot of people enjoyed this book, judging from the number of gushing reader reviews here. But with over 500 pages of repetitive, plotless vignettes, how can so many people claim they \\"didn't want it to end\\"? Consider me one reader who wished it had ended much, much sooner. I would not even have bothered to finish it if someone hadn't ordered it for me as a gift.There are so many problems with this novel: a gimmicky set-up, main characters that never feel more than two-dimensional, and choppy vignettes that are less than the sum of their parts. Some of the minority characters seem stereotypically depicted, right down to their speech patterns, which comes off as patronizing on the author's part.In the end, despite the author's own admiration for her hipster creations Henry and Clare, I never cared about them myself. While I wish I could say otherwise, this book is long, dull and annoying. I'm astounded it's as popular as it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Time Travellers Wife","review":"Not a read for those looking for a feel good sci fi/romance. When telling a friend about some of the details of this lengthy, complex tale I realised what a tormenting experience it was. It is a new spin on the time travel idea, cleverly crafted and compelling. I felt flat and drained at the conclusion and am looking for something uplifting to shift the grey cloud of emotional pain this read deposited upon me.There a times where The Man Who Folded Himself is closely shaved but this is the nature of the genre, a strong read that will give those seeking a bit of dementure an avenue to churn upon."},{"rating":"2","title":"too long, but mostly enjoyable","review":"Stories about time travel are not new, I believe H. G. Wells was the first to tackle this premise with \\"The Time Machine\\". However, Audrey Niffenegger goes a fine job of making this idea fresh and new in the story of Henry who is a \\"time traveler\\" who, because of a strange medical condition, is able to \\"re-visit\\" his and his wife Clare's past and future. Odd, over-lengthy, but very enjoyable tale.David Rehakauthor of \\"Love and Madness\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!!","review":"I just loved this book. I wanted it to go on and on. I felt as if I was time traveling right along with Henry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Script Sold To You as a Book","review":"Let me warn you -- you're in for pages and pages of one line dialogue like \\"I munched my toast.\\" \\"What things never should have been invented?\\" Blah blah blah. Somebody at the publishing house paid somebody at the Today Show a lot of money for this endorsement. A time travel romance is an old cliched idea and this one just rambles on for 500 plus pages. People who have raved about this book are probably HUGE Harlequin Romance fans. Grocery Store Junk. Save your money. Check it out at the library if you think you must read it, but don't say I didn't warn you. P.S. Definately a nominee for the BAD SEX WRITING AWARD. BLEEECH."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creepy","review":"I still am amazed at the popularity of this book. To be honest, I didn't read it all the way through because it creeped me out so much when the main character \\"visited\\" himself in youth. I attempted to keep reading, but it just kept getting more & more bizarre. Finally, I just put it down and didn't ever think twice about picking it back up. Good books make you want to continue reading... this book made me want to stop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't relate to the book","review":"I love science fiction and fantasy, but I'm picky about what I read. Even so, I can count on one hand the books that I've never been able to finish. This book is one of them.The reviews I read here made me look forward to seeing what this author had to share. After 2/3 of the book I got sick of the disfunctional characters and their sorry lives.The main concept is interesting, and the journal like presentation gives the book a nice style. Unfortunately, the male hero of the story is portrayed as such a jerk that I was never able to understand or care about him.While I can see that the author is trying to show us a couples struggles in life, I got so tired of reading about the guys sex life that I couldn't hang on for any future emotional payoff.In short, it's a guy you don't care about who is stuck in a fantastic yet depressing (and sometimes creepy) relationship. Major downer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Love Story","review":"Great story, reads very well. Very hard to put down. It's also a very different concept from most books i've read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, But Confusing Book","review":"I found this book to be very well written. I enjoyed reading it, but there were times that I had to stop and take a break from reading it because it got confusing.At the heart of the story is the love of Henry and his wife Clare. Henry has the ability to transport himself in time. He can go back and often sees his parents when they were newly married as well as going to visit Clare as she is growing up. He can also go forward in time and makes several trips into the future, but they are not as clear as the past. Overall a very well writen book, but beware it takes a while to get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Which came first?","review":"This is an amazing book. I fell in love with it from page one. I read it about two months ago, and I still reflect back on how great it was. This is such a unique book, and was not what I expected at all. A question I keep pondering is how is it possible?? How can these two people meet but already know each other. It is very \\"Which came first the chicken or the egg?\\" This was just a page turner that kept you interested and guessing till the very end. I also enjoyed the shifting of the point of views between the two main characters. I also agree with the person who wrote the comment that there is definately room for a sequel cause of the daughter's abilities. I highly recomend this book to anyone, whether they are into sci-fi or any other genre, since it does not fit in just one catergory!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This book was recommended to me by someone who I thought might know a good book, and I've heard so many raves about it. I couldn't believe I was reading the same book. At first I thought I just had to give it time, that I'd \\"get\\" it after awhile. I never did. I could care less about the characters and I really just didn't care what happened to them.I will never blindly take some one else's recommendation again.BORING."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just okay.","review":"The premise is fascinating, but the characters are unpleasant and flat. What could be a terrific story, with elements of suspense, romance, mystery, drama, and comedy, actually comes off as a shoddily pieced together attempt that lacks a real story. The author's attempt at depth and meaning is wimpy and the characters are irritating pseudo-intellectuals with a total lack of common sense. It's impossible to sympathize with either of them. I'd say this might be entertaining, but it is definitely not what some of these reviews make it out to be. Try \\"The Dive From Clausen's Pier\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uug","review":"I really wanted to like this book, but as it went on I found myself really disliking Henry. I really had to force myself to read on...and I never did enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let Down","review":"I was really excited to read this book after I saw the movie trailer for it.It's a good idea and could have been much more creative and easier to follow, if it had been written better. Sometimes it's very confusing and I found myself having to go back and re-read the sentance/paragraph to figure it out. I nearly threw the book away, but gave it one more chance to see where it was leading and how it ended. It was challenging to keep going.There is a lot of crudeness, un-needed mentioned sex, and profanity which totally could have been left out. It was difficult to really get close to the characters due to lack of real emotional description.I was disappointed and hope the movie is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpected","review":"After the first chapter, I almost put this book down. I was so confused! I'm not by any means a numbers girl, and I thought figuring it out was going to be similar to reverting to the hell of Algebra. Not so. This is an incredible novel with characters that blew me away. I totally believe, even though I know it's impossible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Enjoyable","review":"I love anything to do with time travel whether in books or movies. I would have given this book five stars for the excellent story. The reason for the four star rating is the use of the \\"C\\" word to describe genitalia...both Clair's and Henry's. While I'm definately NOT a prude, I could have lived without having them in the book. Other than that, a great read that I couldn't put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"A CHORE .......","review":"I really don't review books often, but this one has to be stopped. It's just awful. Everything about it is just awful. Laughable and awful. It is a book intended to be discussed at painfully chic parties by painfully hip people dressed in absurdly expensive black clothing. From the start the author wants you to understand that she is the product of an extremly expensive private education, that she has an extremly sucessful, satisfying career and that she wrote this book to add one more fascinating line to an already impressive resume. I'm about one third of the way through it and I hate the main characters,the story is slow and the premis is nothing new. Give me a break!!! It's that old TV show \\"Quantum Leap\\" without any of the fun. If you must read it borrow it from the library because it's not worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"i wish i would have known","review":"this story is polluted with cursing and crude gratuitous sexual content.there is no real plot line to this book, you can turn to any page and follow the story as well as if you read it in chronological page order.there is nothing to keep me reading. i felt no pull to know more about the characters or what they were experiencing. the story was told and not felt.the narration is poor. the story is told in first person from the views of clare and henry, neither of which has a voice of their own. on several occasions i had to look back to see which one of them was speaking.i feel like the characters were shallow with nothing but sex driving their love or lives.overall i am disappointed and left this book feeling dirty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time--it deserves 0 stars","review":"The writing is pretentious, the story is pointless, there is no character development and the ending is sappy. The readers on the audio are irritating and listening to them confirmed why I have not wanted to read this overrated book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like it","review":"the story is all over the place. Not organized which makes it really hard to follow.After 150 pgs, the author still didnt get to the point."},{"rating":"1","title":"needs serious editing!!","review":"Ugh. This book needs some serious editing. There may be an interesting story in there and the concept is good, but it's painful to get through it. A good editor could easily cut out half the pages. There's so many times where the book reads like someone's daily account of activities - got up, took a shower, got dressed, doorbell rang, etc. Stuff that adds nothing what so ever to the story. As a result, the characters are pretty flat. If you need something to help you pass a lot of time or you like crappy chik-lit, then read it. Otherwise - leave this one on the shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"After reading the reviews I picked this book up after Christmas and finished it in 3 days. A great book that you won't want to put down. While reading it on the train, I often had people ask me how I liked it and remark that they loved it themselves. I highly recommend!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why all the Hype?","review":"I just couldn't get into this book, even though I'm a huge time travel fan, maybe because I saw the movie first. Actually preferred the movie. At least it moved the story along, whereas the book was long winded and dull. Couldn't finish it since i already knew how the story ended.Overall the idea was great, with a different take on time traavel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype ...","review":"Was hoping for a romantic time travel story. Plenty of time travel but no romance. The characters had no depth and the writing did not convey any passion between these two. The underdeveloped characters are the fatal flaw in what otherwise may have been a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"It weighs a ton, but it's worth it!","review":"This is the first review I have ever written. But this book moved me and I felt compelled to tell others about it. As I neared the end of this story I was a little dissapointed. I thought there were some story lines that didn't really have a point. I wanted every little detail to come together to culminate in some kind of big ending. But as I continued reading, the tears poured. And that's when I realized what this book was really all about. I felt for these characters and how they felt about each other. I didn't want it to end. And everything in life doesn't always have a neat bow to wrap around it.If you want a \\"gimmick\\" this book isn't for you. But if you want to bear witness to a love story, then read this."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not good science fiction and it's not good literature","review":"After seeing the glowing reviews on Amazon.com, I hoped for a compelling read. Unfortunately, it is not. Although arguably more literary than a pulp science fiction book, \\"The Time Traveler's Wife\\" is neither well-written or engaging. Characters are underdeveloped and the story is plodding. I made it about a third of the way through before I realized that it really wasn't going to get any better. I know this review makes me sound cranky, but it's simply not a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Jack Finney Instead","review":"I, too, wanted to like this book, but in the end, just didn't. My main problem is the complete failure of Claire's internal logic regarding subjecting a child to the same dreadful existence as her husband's. They show up naked in strange places, for God's sake! The novel is an oddly amateurish effort, and I can't recommend it (very weak dialog, plotting, all those pretentious references to punk bands, and the unforgivable \\"beamish boy\\"...who talks like that?) For really good time travel, buy Jack Finney's Time and Again and From Time to Time. For weird genetic anomalies, try Max Tivoli - great story and utterly lyrical. Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A flinger of a book","review":"There were so many times while I was reading this book that I wanted to fling it across the room, hoping it would travel to another time and never come back. This book was insipid and irritating, and I read the whole thing so I could say that this is the case, from the beginning to the end (well, for me starting on about page 20). Without his ability to time travel, Henry would just be a tedious character, and Clare is lucky to have found him because her character is equally dull. I must say, though, that there were more than a few times in the book where it was so full of itself and obnoxious that I laughed out loud. Thoreau said to read all the good books first. If you follow his advice, you must definitely skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"When the writing technique drowns a story..","review":"Then you are focusing on the whys and wheres and not the characters. I give her a one star for being creative about the time travel idea..but as a novel..this is horrible. The story is lost in craft..and after a while the reader could care less."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smug, Shallow and Gratuitously Dramatic","review":"This terrible book is an incredibly frustrating waste of time! I finished it only because it is my book club's selection this month. When I was done I threw it across the room. 500 + pages and you never get to know anything that matters about the main characters -- just page after page after page of disconnected dramatic happenings and ridiculous situations. I was more than willing to go with a \\"time traveling\\" story line, but even science fiction needs some substance to make a story interesting. Don't believe the hype -- SKIP IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"An interesting premise, and a story I wanted to like.....","review":"All time travelling books require a complete suspension of disbelief, but this one just became too weird for me. Whenever I'm reading about a 40 year old time travelling man appearing naked before his six year old \\"future wife\\" I can't help but be creeped out! Plus the author seemed to make glaring factual errors that grated on me (eg. A Bellini cocktail is made with peach juice not pear, and since when did most cars in the late fifties/early sixties even have seat belts let alone ones that were actually used?)I found the dialogue cliched, the writing mediocre, and the characters just plain dull. I hate to take the \\"unpopular\\" road here, but this one came across as overhyped drivel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Draws you in, makes you immediately comfortable","review":"You would think it would be confusing, but it all makes sense inthe authors skilled hands. I'm looking forward to future booksfrom her as well. This is one of those books that you arepleased is so long. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreary and over-rated","review":"I was mistaken; I thought this was a literary work. I didn't realize it was basically a girly airplane read until I was through the first chapter, at which point I realized I'd had an entirely different idea about it. I would probably see the film, especially because Eric Bana and Rachel McAdams are so gorgeous and charismatic, but the characters in the book were completely generic and reeled off the most pedestrian dialogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"romance novel... enough said","review":"This book is probably great for those that like romance novels. My problem is that I thought it was an adventure book based on the time machine movie with Mr. Depp. Unfortunately I couldn't finish the book because it was too slow of a read for me. I should have researched the book category. My bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time Traveler's Wire","review":"I am not enjoying this book at all. I am very disappointed. I have stopped reading it due to lack of interest,and wish I could get a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why isn't there a website that rates books content?","review":"I read the first few chapters of this book and then returned it to the library. I found the explicit sexual language and situations were unnessary and I hate reading them. I wish there was a website out there that would offer reviews of books based on there sexual, violent and language content. I don't mind the illusion of sex or romance but I just hate to verbal pornography. I wanted to read the book because of all the high reviews. Stay away from this book if you don't like explicit sex."},{"rating":"1","title":"great idea, just not a good book","review":"well, here is another book for the \\"great idea, just not a great book\\" file! ms. niffenegger had an original idea, however, she became too wrapped up in writing about punk rock, sex and anarchy. if i had to read another preachy passage about any of the above mentioned topics, i was close to wishing i could travel to the future (just to be done with the book). i didn't care about the characters or what happened to them. i understand ms. niffenegger is an artist... she should stick with art."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want to travel back in time to when i didn't read this book","review":"This book is simply awful.

Maybe I just didn't care for the characters enough to put the energy into figuring it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"intrigued, but just got bored...","review":"this was a book club pick for our book club and no one really loved it. Only 2 gals actually finished it - it is VERY VERY long. I read about one half and just couldn't bring myself to finish it. Had to jump around a few times to remember how old everyone was. Maybe I just missed the boat, since a LOT of folks obviously liked it. But no one in our group really loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"more of a lust story than a love story","review":"While I really liked the whole time-travel, meeting your spouse ahead of time, etc. story line, and the way the author presented it, a major problem for me was that this book came off as more of a lust story instead of a love story. The author's overuse of the f- word was what did this for me. The time traveler and his wife didn't make love, they f-----. Both characters continually referred to it in those terms both after the fact and in asking each other for it. \\"Why don't you f--- me\\", \\"please f---\\" me\\", \\"let's f---\\", over and over. The overuse of such crude/juvenile terminology for what should have been beautiful moments in this couple's life ruined the relationship of the two and the entire book for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME; STRANGE!","review":"I purchased this book when I saw the previews for the movie and I thought I'd read the book first. I received it very fast from Amazon but when I started reading it I realized the book was going nowhere! It was very confusing to read; jumped all over the place with dates, etc. and the characters were not developed throughout this dry story. I felt weird even reading it and I definitely will not go to see the movie. There are descriptions of love scenes that are completely out of place and tasteless. I'm sorry to say that I would not recommend this book; it was a complete disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"couldn't get through it","review":"This book came highly recommended so I really was excited when I bought it and first started to read it. I kept waiting for it to get better. It didn't. I abandoned it about 1/2 way through..maybe if I get really bored I'll try to plow through and hope it improves. Nothing seems to happen. Henry disappears, reappears at various times, but nothing really happens. BORRRRING... And I really wanted to like it. :-("},{"rating":"1","title":"I really tried to like it...","review":"I wanted to like this book, really I did...especially after seeing the movie trailer. The premise is intriguing. However, I found the book to be a bit confusing since the \\"time traveler\\" appeared as child & adult at the same time and different ages while other characters remained the same age in the current year. Are you confused yet? I tried looking past that, but just couldn't get past the laborious, unnecessary details regarding mundane events. Okay, I'll just say it - BORING! I found myself skimming through the monotony and finally gave up on the book altogether -- something I never do. I'm really disappointed and hope, for once, that the movie is better than the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This book was a good read, very original. It also covered great music bands from the 80's, of which i can relate.I have no doubt that it will eventually be made into a movie.-Jon"},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling, Different and Well-Written","review":"The Time Traveler's Wife is different from anything else I have ever read. This book is written with style, originality and it is also incredibly compelling. I couldn't put the book down until I was finished - and even then, I didn't want to let it go. It made me laugh, cry and feel all warm and cozy inside.I am not usually a fan of books that aren't written with strict reality in mind but this book is the exception. I kept questioning the ending. For example: Were they trying to describe some type of psychological disorder or was this life for the main character real?This is an exceptional read. If you haven't read the Time Traveler's Wife, you are missing out on an amazing story."},{"rating":"2","title":"READ THIS BOOK!","review":"Yes, this is a romance novel, but it is also the most unique time-travel story I've ever read (and I'm a big sci-fi fan). It makes your head spin to try and keep up with Henry and Clare, and their amazing lives together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Letdown","review":"This book has absolutely the most disappointing ending for a book of its depth and length and not because of the character's fate but because it was just plain ridiculous. I think the author fell victim to writer's block, slacked on some primary character development and robbed me of the several hours it took to complete the book only to reach an end with no substance whatsoever. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"I like time travel books if they are somewhat realistic (as realistic as time travel can get!). This one is superb. Gets a little confusing but is well written and funny. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow and Zero Plot!","review":"Really, I don't know how anyone could give this book a good rating. Obviously it's a love story, but it's so boring. The characters are shallow. There is more intrigue in reading a dictionary. The book is a series of events that have no impact on the characters. It's like a diary that niether impacts or shapes the plot of the story. There are no twists or tense moments. It's just plain dull and pointless reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing","review":"Although I found the plot of Time Traveler's Wife compelling, I found the crude and graphic sex scene between an 18 year old girl and 40 something year old man revolting. The frequent use of the \\"F bomb\\" was another turn off. This book could have been so much better if the characters had more virtue and if their sex lives weren't described over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking","review":"I am absolutely in love with this book. I heard it was amazing but figured in would just be like any other love story. I ended up seeing the movie first and thought it was pretty good but nothing spectacular. I decided to read the book and I must say I am glad I did because the movie does not does this exquisite story justice. I don't often read books more than once, but I will definitely reread this story for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"World enough and time ..","review":"This has become one of my favorite books of all time, I think I've read it five or six times now. It truly has something for everyone, drama, romance, comedy, amazing characters. An incredibly moving story, I get something new out of it with each reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't understand what all the fuss is about","review":"I love the idea of this book, and know so many people who loved it. However, I could not finish it. I tried so many times and it just felt endless to me... I just didn't care! I had trouble even watching the movie even though it was well acted and had beautiful people starring in it. I guess I just didn't really like the characters and didn't feel their romance at all. I like the logic of the plot line and think the story has potential to be wildly romantic or even just more emotional. However, it just wasn't. Read the synopsis, see the movie, spare yourself some time."},{"rating":"2","title":"COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN","review":"I LOVED THIS BOOK!!! It had everything. I think what drew me in the most was knowing how Henry was going to die but not knowing when. Also, the love Henry had for Claire was breathtaking and the way their relationship progressed even throughout the hard times in their relationship."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Example of the Crafted Writer","review":"I read this book after it first came out, and there were not many other people to discuss it with. It takes about the first 50 pages to get your mind fully around the concept of a man being able to travel through time, to visit himself in his past, to watch himself grow up, to know in advance his future, and have no control. Within this amazing premise, there is a love story that is so tender and heart-wrenching because while you know it will turn into a marriage and temporarily happy life, you have the imminent sense that just as Henry lives a volatile \\"time life,\\" so too will this story take volatile turns. The book moved me to tears at the end, despite anticipating the end from the get-go.Niffenberger not only crafts an engaging and unique love story, but her prose is smooth, witty, and gripping. I couldn't put the book down, and I was sad to read the last page, but I carry with me the memory of the passion of reading this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"was very surprised","review":"Put off buying because it sounded like a difficult concept and would be confusing to read. It was a great book! Very well written, engrossing, I thoroughly enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oddly charming","review":"The Time Traveler's Wife could have easily been a serious flop: it moves constantly between dates, each segment told from either Clare's or Henry's point of view- conveying information from two narrators at different stages of life. It could have easily been a failed attempt at technique, or gimmick- but in some strange way- Audrey Niffenegger makes it work- and beautifully so.Niffenegger weaves the storyline gently between the two characters, telling us their story- a journey through two different worlds, connected only by what we don't see- an anchored time and place where Henry and Clare can finally exist together. Time and space, as Niffenegger so skillfully shows, are illusions. Waiting for the perfect moment, for the right time, or the right place are equations easily disturbed. It's our ability to feel, experience, and love that makes a moment in time move- not time itself. Lovely work of human experience and time theories."},{"rating":"2","title":"COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN","review":"I did not want this book to end. It is the story of Henry, the time traveler and his wife, Clare and many other wonderful characters. Henry meets his future wife through his involuntary travels back in time starting when she is six.(Although, he does at times end up in the future)It is a romance but, it is not mushy; it is science fiction, but not technological. There is somewhat of a coming of age element to it but, it keeps going far past that. I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Books I've Ever Read","review":"Whoever said this book is not worth reading is WRONG. I think everyone should read it, as it has special messages for both genders and all ages. The author incorporates the often overdone theme of love into a storyline that enraptures the reader. Once you start, you can't stop, and quite frankly, you never want to. There is great character development, suspense, love, sadness, and happiness. The book is timeless and stays with you long after reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"Realy enjoyed this book - despite the fact that it defies logic, the characters became so real & the story so poignant. Loved it! Also would recommend the seller of the book, as it was used, but in very good condition. I'm one of these folks who feels that if I'm going to buy a book, I want it in hard cover. I'd also rate the seller 5 stars; thank you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"good idea; bad book","review":"I'm in the minority I see. However entralling the idea of time travel is this book missed the mark. First it was disjointed. So much so in fact, that I'm still not even sure how Henry died. Secondly, the characters were not likable - none of them. I just didn't care about any of the characters - main or subplot. They were vulgar, disgusting people who used others when they wished and used alcohol, drugs, and profanity to excess. Thirdly, the overuse of profanity was pointless. People I know do not talk like these people (especially in front of their children). Fourth, the sex talk was uncalled for; it was too graphic. Fifth, this has been hyped as a love story. I say it's no where near a love story. And if this is what the author thinks is love then no wonder she missed the mark. A sad tale that could have been very interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good premise, verbose execution","review":"At first this book was a real page-turner. The premise is preposterous but one can easily accept it as the driver for an interesting and innovative story. And it could have been such a novel, if it was 300 pages shorter. In reality, the relentless pretentiousness and verbosity of the prose gradually wore me down. Endless descriptions of the protagonist's daily lives, laced with a comical amount of literary, artistic and musical name-dropping mentioned by other reviewers.It's the archetypal first novel, and for all that, is a decent effort, but it needs an awful lot of editing.I made it to page 337 before I gave up and read the plot synopsis on Wikipedia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"The only thing original about this typical love story was the fact that the guy could time travel. In my opinion, the book was confusing and not well written. If you are going to spend any money on this story, go see the movie and save yourself hours of agony trying to read the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe it's just me...","review":"Maybe it's just me, but I was very disappointed in this book. I read a review for the movie that said to forget the movie, but get the book. I checked our local library - 49 copies, I was 238th in line to get one. I ordered the book online, and luckily only paid $8, because I really didn't like it at all. I avidly read all types of books and this one irritated me as I was reading it. It wasn't the hopping back and forth between time - lots of books do that. It was the actual story itself. To me, it was more about selfishness than love, and I never developed a caring feeling about Henry. Clare seemed to me to be more of an abused woman than a cherished wife. I love to read, pass along books that I like to others, keep the ones I love to read again and again over the years. I gave this one to our public library, so at least they'll have 50 to hand out to those 237 people waiting to read it. Maybe it will make it into the hands of someone who will appreciate it - I didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious and annoying.","review":"What is up with the lists of punk rock bands?? and all this 'let's get our kit off and have a romp' business?? we GET IT. Clare and Henry have alot of sex. can we talk about something else now. I hated their friends -- Gomez and his girlfriend (i can't even remember her name now. she was THAT superfluous as a character.) -- pseudointellectual yuppie types with no real depth or purpose. And then the untranslated German and French quotations and poems..why?? Okay okay you work in a library and read alot. Your wife makes paper. UGHHH. Book was also unnecessarily looong and plodding..did we really need to describe things in such painfully unbearable detail? The ending was also a bit of a let-down.In short, an interesting concept (i obviously bought into the hype) but i would be quite happy to sell this to someone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was unable to finish this book","review":"I love the time traveling idea, but, after trying to read this on three separate occasions, I have given up.

I was captivated by the characters - and I am not typically drawn to science fiction or love stories. This story weaved together beautifully, a huge feat considering the complex story line. It touched me deeply and many times I had to simply pause to absorb the analogies. I finished the book last week and I find myself thinking of Henry and Clare during my work meetings - it's had an impact on my spirit. It touched on the human experience - don't miss this one, folks."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Time Traveler's Wife reviewed by The Book Vixen","review":"Wow! And this is Audrey Niffenegger's debut book? I am amazed. This is a fabulous read! The concept of the storyline seems complex but Audrey puts it together nicely and makes it easy for the reader to follow the time line. Have the tissues ready!I saw the movie before I read the book, not something I would have normally done but I'm glad it worked out that way. Seeing the movie first allowed me to have a visual of the time line; you get to see everything fall together in place. I wish they would have incorporated the last scene from the book into the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful story, way better than the movie","review":"I'm not long-winded. This is one of my favorites. I borrowed this book at the library and loved it so much I put it on my wish list for Christmas. Really looking forward to reading it over and over.Great sci-fi, love story, mystery.Other favorites include anything by Isabel Allende, Sara Naslund."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite books of all time...","review":"I cannot believe this is the first book by this author, and I look forward to reading more of her works in the future. This book is one of those one-of-a-kind, can't wait to read the ending but sad to get to the end books. I bought the hardcover and never touched it so that it can sit on my bookshelf next to all my other favorites. Love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"creative and touching story","review":"fantastic novel, highly reccomended to those who love fiction with a bit of a twist. i loved the uniqueness of this book, and the tangle between time rifts (although a friend disliked this book for the same reason and found it confusing). i liked watching the evolving perspective of the characters throughout the decades as their priorities and settings change as they age."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Time Traveler's Wife","review":"Often, novels, using time travel as a plot device, become torturously convoluted; so, I approached this read accordingly. In fact, Niffenegger provides a comfortable, chronological experience. Each of the main characters develops according to his or her first person perspective. Time flows logically, if not smoothly.Through a series of initially uncomfortable meetings, husband and wife interact at various maturity levels. While age does not necessarily dictate experience and wisdom, the two develop a relationship of temporal symbiosis.One cannot help but become emotionally and intellectually invested."},{"rating":"2","title":"so good!!!!!","review":"So good!!!!Also going to be a movie.highly reccomended, beautifully written, great plot, incredible characters"},{"rating":"2","title":"recommended this book","review":"What an idea for a romance! I don't know how she came up with it but I thought it was masterfully done."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't understand why this book is so popular","review":"I heard so many good things about this book from different people and even when I checked it out at the library the librarian said it was one of her all-time favorite books. I had a hard time getting into the book. The characters were flat and the book was not very exciting in my opinion; it was too random. I just kept waiting for something to happen to justify all the praise it received. It ended kind of sweet but it was also very sad. I'm glad I'm not the only one that thought it was not a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trisha's Book Blog Review","review":"I really enjoyed this book. When I wasn't reading it I was thinking about it. I was quit confused the first half of the book, my mind just would not wrap around the whole time traveling thing. But after I got half way through the book it started to kick in and I enjoyed the book even more. I still enjoyed the book at the beginning, I loved how it went back and fourth between Clare and Henry, and it went from different time periods. It kept you guessing and kept you wanting to read to see what was going to happen next.I was sad at the end. I was hoping that it would be different than what it was. But not all endings are happy endings, or what you want them to be. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it twice","review":"I don't normally read books twice; however, I read this book last year and came back to it again recently. A previous reviewer correctly said that this book was well written and clever.A good friend recommended this book and I'm still thankful for her suggestion. I know recommend it to my friends. The plot is ingenious and the writing is strong and evocative. I found myself reading passages and stopping to re-read them and process the images or moments that the author shared. I do think this was the best book I read in 2005 and I can't wait to read more from AN."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clare and Henry Will Touch Your Heart and Soul","review":"Why did I keep this one on my shelf for so long? I'm so glad I got it down and read it! The Time Traverler's Wife is a wonderful, well written story. I was a little confused at the beginning as to what in the world was going on, but soon got wrapped up in the story of Henry and Clare. Henry time travels; Clare waits for him to come back. The story is so touching as they go through the years of heartbreak, adventure, and a tremendous love for each other. I don't want to give away any of the storyline, but do want to say if you have this one on your shelf as I did, don't hesitate to take it down and read it. You won't regret it. It's a wonderful book and one of the best I've ever read. I think Clare and Henry's story will stay with me for a long time to come. An endruing love story (and so much more) for the ages!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The main points that bothered me about this book were the forced profanity as well as the sexuality between a child and grown man. The crude language spoken by both Claire and Henry made these characters less believable to me. It didn't jive with the character development. Claire using the 'c' word regularly and both Claire and Henry throwing around the 'f' word caused me a great deal of discomfort. It added to my feeling of dislike for the whole bunch of them. Secondly, the sexuality developing between Henry as a 40 year old man and Claire as a child was plain wrong.I loved the idea of time travel and thought about what it would be like to meet 'myself' as a teen. Neat thought, thus the 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good entertainment, bad writing","review":"I gave this book two stars because the topic of the book was a great idea. Also I applaud the author for getting her first book published. But... The characters have no depth to their personalities, they are not flawed or personable which makes the book quite hard to get through. There was nothing about the book that made me want more, which saddens me because I was quite looking forward to reading it. I would honestly compare the writing style to that of the Twilight series, (which yes, I admit I did read). This book would be better geared to younger readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"dull, dull, dull","review":"I expected more, after hearing so many people say they had really enjoyed this book. I found it to be dull and weak. I guess if I had related at all to either main character, I might have been more into it. But as it was, I just didn't care enough and I didn't buy this lifelong love affair. By the end, I was ready for it to be over. And I hate to say this, being a woman and all, but the writing is unbearably feminine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time Travel Should Have Been More Believable.","review":"There are many scientific hypotheses dealing with the manipulation of time. However, the \\"Chrono Displacement Disorder\\" invented by the author is too infantile for romantic and sci-fi readers to accept.The story could have been more \\"realistic\\" had the author employed other forms of time management. Perhaps the teleportation of body and soul as claimed by spiritualistic mediums worldwide would have made much more sense to those who read to transport themselves into new dimensions.Andrew J. RodriguezAuthor: \\"The Teleportation of an American Teenager\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much work","review":"Reading this book, I felt like I was reading a thesis on the cause and effects of macular degeneration or some other medical condition. It's too smart for it's own good ... the following back and forth through time got very boring after about the fourth chapter. Perhaps it was just the story line that didn't really hold my interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and thought provoking","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It was highly entertaining with a thought provoking concept. Basicly it is about the relationship between a woman and a man who, for unknown medical reasons, involuntarily time travels to different periods in his life, past and future. Even after finishing this book, you will keep thinking about it for some time. I reccomend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I kept reading to get to the point...","review":"...but I gave up 2/3 through the book. I seldom give up on a book, but this one just rambled on and on."},{"rating":"1","title":"(yawn) borrrrring...","review":"I've read many many books in my day, some great, some not. Unfortunately this book goes directly into the \\"not\\" category. There were some scenes that were beyond akward and questionable. Besides that, it simply could not hold my interest. I like that you get both perspectives from Henry and Clare but the constant going back and forth is annoying to me. But in all fairness, I'm not a fan of reading books told in the male perspective. This book is extremely slow and I could not force myself to waste my time finishing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"This book was written in such a way that draws you into it. The description that was used is esquisite. The story is truly a test through time. It can be hard to follow since it is being told by two different characters. I hope you enjoy it like I did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK","review":"This book is a difficult read. Time going back and forth for one of the characters, a lot of lulls in the story and an OK ending. Not realistic and a little to far out there for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"More romance than sci-fi, but that's okay...","review":"I bought this book bundled with An Audience for Einstein, under the assumption this was mainly a science fiction time-travel story. While time travel is the plot device that moves the story forward (and backward,) this is really a romance novel, and a very good one at that. The time travel also serves to make the book a tragedy, but with moments of humor and irony. The ending in particular is a real tearjerker. So, I hadn't bought the book I thought I was buying, but still liked it a lot for what it was.Sometimes it's nice to be surprised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't finish this book","review":"I know everyone loves this book, but I've forced myself to get 60% of the way through it and can't go on. I love the time travel idea, but the love story is so contrived I want to gag. Oh, they're so in love, so good-looking, and have so much sex...everything would be perfect if only Henry didn't keep time-traveling all the time. Barf!There's really just not enough character development to make the characters believable. We're supposed to buy that they're incredibly in love without seeing much development of the romance...they were fated to be together and that's apparently supposed to be enough.When reading this book, I feel extremely aware that I am reading a book. It just feels forced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tricky Concept Disguishing Poor Writing","review":"The time-traveling concept isn't used to enrich the love story but rather to disguise poor writing (disconnected bits and pieces), a lack of character development, the absence of real emotions, and anything resembling a plot.There's an underlying creepiness to the relationships, reflected in age disparities between the main characters, the sexual crudity, and Clare's passivity."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Wanted to Like It...","review":"I really wanted to like this book. A friend lent it to me, so I could read it before seeing the movie with her. I agree that it's an interesting premise. I enjoyed some of the beginning, but, as some reviewers have said, it lost me towards the middle. The reason may be that once you figure out what's going to happen, the books slogs towards the inevitable. The worldview of this book is that you can't change what's going to happen. No matter what you know beforehand, or what actions you take, our fate is sealed and we are merely puppets acting out a play that's already been written. No one in this story had a choice in what would happen to them. That does not make for interesting fiction, or a vibrant life. I want to think that the decisions I make have consequences, that what I do has meaning. I felt Henry and Clare were just going through the motions, and I didn't care what happened to them and no interest in seeing the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't pull me in","review":"To me, the definition of a good book is one that sucks you in to their world and that you can identify or sympathize with the characters. In my opinion, this is not a good book. Spoiler alert! There are so many holes in the premise that it's impossible to suspend disbelief. Earlier reviews mentioned a lack of the outside world, that it's like they're in a cocoon- that's exactly it. Forget all the questions of \\"couldn't more people have seen him disappear\\", \\"why didn't his time travel skills make headline news\\", etc.- because you'll be disappointed. The characters are detestable and selfish. And if you buy the whole premise of the book and do get sucked in to this world- it's incredibly sad if you think about it. The creative writing was the only redeeming quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big build up . . . . small pay off","review":"I wanted to love this book and, if a few things had been different, I would have. Niffenegger comes up with a very clever premise and she's skilled at creating good characters. The non-linear plot took some getting used to, but after a while I was very much enjoying the time shifts and seeing the many pieces of the puzzle start to fall into place.The problem with The Time Traveler's Wife is the last quarter. After hundreds of pages of build up this book just sort of peters out. I've been disappointed with a number of books lately for this reason (Forever and Everything Is Illuminated are two that spring to mind). Good premise, decent writing, but an ending that just renders the whole thing a waste of time.Niffenegger is talented, there's no question. But it almost seems as though she got fed up with her own book and just hastily threw together an ending. Poorly executed and extremely disappointing for the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"offensively poor writing","review":"I was embarrassed when this book arrived and I realized that I had just purchased a dressed up romance novel. The premise sounded great, but it is only a front. Niffenegger is painfully self indulgent. This would be great as a guilty pleasure for someone who can stomach it, but the write-ups are misleading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really just a cliche love story","review":"I thought the premise seemed interesting and was excited to read this book, but after about 40 pages I realized that the inclusion of time travel is the only clever element in an otherwise cliche love story. Really this book is merely about two people who meet, fall in love without really knowing each other, get married, and want to have babies. The unique part of the book--the time travel mentioned in the title--is there in structure only, and plays a very small, not at all believable role in the story. The logic and effects of the time travel are inconsistent and raise questions that are never answered. The resulting flaws are glaring--yet I continued reading, hoping there would be a redeeming payoff at the end. Instead, I was deeply disappointed to find that the novel's originality was only an illusion. Throwing in a \\"twist\\" like time travel without following through with it does not make your trite story compelling--instead, it results in frustrated readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this really our best this year?","review":"No doubt it's an orginal storyline, but the syrupy and static love-story is hampered by underdeveloped characters, overwritten description and unbelievable dialogue. As an advocate for literary fiction I have to ask: is this really the best we're going to read this year?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever and thought provoking","review":"I had high expectations for this book based on its reviews. I thought it was a slow start. I kept putting it down and picking it up every few day. I'm glad I persevered. Midway through it became interesting and I started getting into the story and thinking about Henry's timetravelling and its impact on people. I wondered how it was possible for Henry to be talking to himself. How could they be friends with Gomez? What happens to Alba? I agree with another reviewer that the story was a bit creepy too. Clare's devotion to Henry was romantic yet odd to me. I mean, she first meets him at age 6 and Henry appears in his mid thirties (I think). Each time she sees him he's aged differently. Clare's childhood and adolesence are so screwed up because of him. This would be a great book to discuss at a book club because there are so many questions one could talk about."},{"rating":"1","title":"536 pages of really bad writing","review":"I had high hopes: attractive green jacket, \\"national bestseller\\", intriguing description, photo of author with flowing hair, looking wistful. Warning: reading this book is like reading exerpts from the diaries of the two most boring people you know. this is a writer who insists on overwriting with aimless details. if you read this book and think that it is torture it is NOT because you are too stupid to follow the \\"time traveling\\" chronology. The characters are cardboard, the dialogue is grating at best and you start hating everything about this book about a third of the way through, especially the fact that you spent $15 on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something must be wrong with me...","review":"I finished this book last night, almost racing to the end wanting so much for it to be great. Not so. I picked this book up mainly because the reviews were so great here. I tried to keep an open mind, but it was just too confusing for me, particularly the way that Henry dies...or did he?? I would love to say that I loved this book, but in reality I wish that I could go back in time and not buy it in the first place. A better book, in my opinion, would be \\"Middlesex\\" by Jeffrey Eugenides -- where you go back and forth in time and it makes sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This book was not at all what I expected. I found it confusing and I have a hard time understanding why it has been on the best seller list for l56 days. Perhaps the fact that I have just finished reading a wonderful book, SOMEONE KNOWS MY NAME, by Lawrence Hill, caused me to expect more from a best seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Godawful","review":"I suspect that time will eventually forget Niffenegger's debut, _The Time Traveler's Wife_ in the same way that it has forgotten the stacks of Jackie Collins and Jilly Cooper novels currently weighing down the shelves at my local Village Thrift. To be fair to a first novel, one might overlook the sloppy writing, slapdash editing, undercooked characters and total disregard for setting and place, but the painfully bad grammar and immature rhetoric made this novel a fairly uncomfortable read.Though the storyline is a cracking one and the plot moves fairly quickly, _The Time Traveler's Wife_ is a thoroughly amateur effort, and I am only grateful that it took so little time to read. Perhaps Niffenegger should stick to printmaking and leave the real writing to professionals. Looking forward to seeing this one in the discount bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit creepy","review":"Not really my 'cuppa' at all. I was somewhat enjoying it until I got to a really creepy part in the book about being with 'himself' which I found, I don't know, strange. The rest of it seemed slow and just wasn't what I thought it was going to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh...hated this overhyped book...skip it. .","review":"I tried, honestly I did to like this book but the story is boring and repititious and goes nowhere. I know I'm in a minority but, if you like books that have plot, skip this one. Sorry. There must be someone out there who feels as I do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"This book got so much hype and yet I found it ridiculous. Unfortunately I saved this book for a vacation and would have stopped reading it in the beginning if I could have found any other books in English. The concept is so un-realistic and the characters aren't even likeable. Every single chapter is the same exact thing just a different time frame - and this goes on for what feels like millions of pages. Why would I want to read about someone who can time travel and uses this \\"gift\\" to steal, fight and cheat at winning the lottery? It's too long, too shallow, and too simple of a story that could have had more potential to be interesting on this topic. I only wish I could travel back in time and brought a different book with me on vacation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Trust Your Friends","review":"I bought this book because my friend called it \\"quality literary fiction.\\" However, the characters are very dry, one-dimensional, and their personalities don't seem to fit their age. The writing jumps around (part of the Sci-Fi technique and time travel) but there's nothing said or done that distinguishes it from the next. Every so often I try to give a best-seller a shot but I'm usually left disappointed, as is the case here. I can only recommend it to readers looking for a quick fix of entertainment or a drek love story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ewwww.","review":"I thought this book had a lot of potential--the concept was well developed and the over all chronology immaculately organized. The circular meetings were both confusing and perfectly clear. And yet... I found the book to be over the top with sexual description. It wasn't romantic, it was vulgar. Moreover, the author takes the most sensitive and pure character in the book (Clare, although I suppose Alba really is) and makes her pathetic and weak (and somewhat slutty) in the end. The affair with Gomez? Sure, it was brief, but it was disgustingly graphic, a moment of pure weakness on Clare's part, and incredibly self centered (isn't Charisse Clare's friend??). I think I might have overcome the other vulgarity if it weren't for the decimation of Clare's character in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wild, eccentric, beautiful","review":"I got this book 24 hours ago, and I couldn't put it down. It is by far one of the most impressive pieces of contemporary fiction I have ever read. The whole idea behind the story turned me off at first, seeming too much like science fiction.....but it was the perfect setting. The author combined so many elements within the pages - I laughed with the characters, I cried with them, it was a truly amazing work. I was sad to see it end. I hope to see more from this author because I believe she has a rare gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Love Story, too Graphic for me","review":"I liked the idea behind this story. It was a great idea of Love enduring through time. I really like the character emotion expressed. What i didn't like was all the graphic sex scenes. I don't want to read that. I know everyone thinks I'm a prude but it seemed to me that as a new author she did not know what to do with the story so enter another sex scene. We can get the idea of enduring great love with out all the details. So I would not recommend this book to other readers who don't want to read a story that should have been a harlequin romance novel. And I hope the author will grow in her story telling ability for her next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not moving at all","review":"I'm a cryer. I always cry at sappy love stories whether they be books or movies. This can barely be described as a love story and it didn't move me at all. I never really understood why Henry and Claire were in love in the first place. I wasn't convinced that they felt anything deeply for each other besides the sex they had all the time. Even when they were trying to have a baby, I kept thinking \\"why?\\". It was all so shallow and unbelievable. I am really disappointed with this one.Like another reviewer mentioned, I was also disappointed with the lack of character development especially with Claire. She did nothing with her life accept wait for Henry. I mean, did she even finish college? Was she a good mother to Alba? Who knows? The author never goes beneath the surface with any of the relationships in the book, including the main characters.I would not buy this book again."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book made me angry","review":"The positive: The story is amazing, the time travel is handled well, it's romantic.The negative:In the last chapter, huge, HUGE betrayal. To the point I almost stopped reading right before the end. I hated it. Now I feel like I've wasted my time. Also, does this author have a clue about romance? Sex is not romance. Her descriptions of sex are not romantic. They actually detract from all the romance. The lurid descriptions throughout the book just cheapen it. It would have been better to hint and leave it up to the imagination.I am actually angry this author did this story. I wish someone else had done it and treated it with more of the respect it deserved."},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrible disappointment","review":"I bought this book about six months ago and wanted to finish before the movie. I have been avoiding trailers like the plague and finally got motivated to finish reading it. What a waste of time. There is no development in plot and there is no advancement to most of Henry's time traveling. The language was crude and sexual content was completely random and not conducive to the story line. I literally skipped four chapters and still hadn't missed anything. (Yes I went back and read them, but I wanted to see if I would miss anything) As a woman who has suffered multiple miscarriages, I was unimpressed with all the lost children in this book. It served no purpose. It was just plain disturbing. Overall, this was a terribly written book. See the movie first, then if you are still interested, venture at your own risk. I DO NOT recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Absolute MUST","review":"Truly one of the best books I've ever experienced- intense and addictive, I even read it as I brushed my teeth! Henry and Clare were so real to me that after I recognized the book in a stranger's hand on an airplane, when she started to cry, I became teary just remembering the story. First and foremost, it's a gorgeous and rich love story that will encourage you to appreciate all relationships on a different level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"This was a wonderful story with likable characters and a heckuva premise. I loved the time travel aspect of this book as well as the romance.This is a great one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique plot, exquisite prose, great love story!","review":"THE TIME TRAVELER'S WIFE would make an excellent book club selection. after I finished I wished that I had read it as a part of a book club, because the plot involves so many issues that are worth discussing and with a thoughtful group of people. For example, what does it mean to wait? Has everything already happened? Can we really change anything? Does time mean \\"nothing\\" as Henry says, or everything?My sister recommended the book to me, and I had to call her immediately to thank her, and then I recommended the book to 10 other people. A great read, but my favorite thing is that despite the time travel element, it is not a work of science fiction, but of literature.I could not give it a five because I did not like the ending. I could even read it again, but I'd like to forget the ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfying read","review":"A very romantic story. Somewhat graphic with quite of bit of swearing but in a low-key way. I read it and then read it again a few days later. Too long to read in one sitting. It made me cry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the read","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It is well writen and the timeline is easy to follow. I haven't seen the movie yet, but I am interested. This book was funny, sad, sweet, and interesting. Even though the outcome was apparent, the journey was not transparent. I really liked this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Book review","review":"Great book. Very well written and a good read for anyone who's looking for a good story line along with a lifetime romance. It arrived to me in great condition.

I absolutely fell in love with Henry. This book had me laughing one moment, and it tears the next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little Miss Contrarian","review":"I think I am the only person in the world who didn't like this book. I wish Niffenegger had written it as straight up scifi and skipped the loooong passages about going to the doctor, trying to cure it, explain it, etc. The writing was mediocre at best- Niffenegger indulges in the lazy chick-lit habit of using pop culture references to define her characters' personalities instead of um like what they do and say. Who cares what music they like? I found Clare and Henry to be narcissistic and unlikeable. I also thought Claire was a fool to spend the rest of her life the way she did. It was just good enough to keep me reading, mostly for the suspense, but overall I thought it was pretty awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crude rubbish.","review":"A great premise gone wrong! A guy has \\"fits\\" that cause him to suddenly leap in time, dropping him naked and helpless into awkward situations...this should have been a very good book. Unfortunately, Niffenegger simply isn't a good enough writer to pull it off. Too many crude details give it a pulp fiction tone, and the uneven pacing and rough prose are equally offputting. The characters not worth caring about. Too many details are left unexplained. I hated it. Oddly, my husband picked it up and loved it. Found it to be a touching love story. Go figure (the man likes Bruce Willis movies, too).If you want a time travel story, go read Connie Willis -- particularly To Say Nothing of the Dog. Now there is a woman who can write!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A realistic time travel story. And it's not lame!","review":"\\"The Time Traveler's Wife\\" is the best book I've read this year.Niffenegger masterfully weaves together a time travel story with a romance. Her two lead characters, Henry and Clare are two of the most beautiful, realistic HUMAN characters I have ever read. They show the reader the true definition of unconditional love. They're accepting of eachother and their relationship is loving and complex. Their romance is moving in the same way as the two lovers is \\"The Notebook\\" (the movie, not the book).Despite the unchronological ordering of the scenes throughout the novel, The Time Traveler's Wife is a continous mystery and it unravels sensibly and beautifully.Read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Breath of Fresh Air","review":"As it turns out, almost every adult I know has both read and loved this book. I purchased it looking for a creative summer read that would take my mind away from the remnants of a rather stressful school year (I am a teacher), and I was not disappointed. As a matter of fact, I often found myself smiling while reading it, despite the fact that when I bought it I had preconceived notions about it being a little on the cheesy side (I'm not a big time-travel gal). There's simply nothing cheesy about it, as Audrey Niffenegger provides a completely original plot with likeable characters and imaginitive details that fit together seamlessly. The Time Traveller's Wife is an easy-to-read, yet unconventional romance story that will leave you searching Amazon.com's pages for other Niffenegger works."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"This book is definitely worth buying. I was reluctant to read it at first because of bad reviews, but when I got through several pages, I could hardly put it down. The story is about a librarian who travels back through time spontaneously, and meets his wife as she grows up. I was kind of freaked out by a couple things, such as Henry sleeping with himself naked, and Henry in his 40s sleeping with Claire in her teens. Overall, I thought the book was great. I find it weird that Brad Pitt and Jennifer Anniston bought the movie rights to this book. I only hope that they don't star in the movie because that would really ruin the story for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surrealistic and beatiful love story","review":"Beatifully written, moving and very original love story - with additional twists of philosophy and time traveling. For me, the most interesting part of the book was its alternative approach to time travel - something like living many lives simultaneosly, rather than traditional \\"what if\\" approach. Made me wonder - and think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!","review":"I loved reading this book! With the complex time traveling aspect it was very easy to follow along and keep up with the characters. The characters draw you in and I just couldn't put the book down.I also watched the movie and it doesn't do the book justice. I did like the movie for what it was... but I loved the book! Just like many movie adaptations of a book there is so much that has to be changed to make it a movie. This book has so many important characters and moments in that I recommend reading the book if you watched the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read...","review":"I really liked this book, in fact, so much I've read it twice so far. It's a powerful love story with a bit of fantasy and sci-fi. I laughed, cried and felt like a voyager throughout Henry and Clare's relationship. I loved both characters with all their flaws and sparks of perfection, their love and loyalty to each other is so endearing and beautiful. I also felt I could relate to their punk scenerio, having been a regular at CBGB's and Gildersleeves during the Richard Hell, Iggy, Patty Smith days. I even purchased this book on audio to listen while on road trips."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I've read in long while","review":"A compelling plot, a beautiful love story, combined with an outstanding writing style make this one of the few books I've read that I would (as an avid reader, and freelance writer) give 5 stars to. Some other reviewers have criticized plot holes regarding time travel. I find this a very nit-picky, absurd, excuse to give a lower rating to a wonderful book. This isn't Star Trek afterall.I hope to see a lot more from this author!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What... no hover cars?","review":"OK, so from the cover it LOOKS like a bit of a chick book, and it IS a love story, BUT this book is superb (and just maybe I'm a bit \\"metro\\"?).When chaps write about time travel we normally include space ships and laser guns and hover cars. This has none of that, and it still managed to keep my boyish attention.Brilliant from cover to cover.PS As is normally the case ignore the god-awful movie adaptation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow start...but a gripping read!","review":"I actually purchased the audio version of this book. I have to admit, I thought about discontinuing listening to the thing because the start was so slow. However, once I got about 30% through it, it became a very moving novel. I cried at least 3 times during certain points of the book. The ins and outs of the time travelling portion can be a little difficult to understand at first, but the read is well worth it in the end. I finished the book a few days ago and I'm going back and listening to the first few chapters again which will hopefully clarify a few things. All in all, this book is very well written and very creative. You will fall in love with the characters and feel the pain they do. Stick with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It kept my attention","review":"I received this book as a gift and was looking forward to reading. It was a quick read - I read it on a road trip. I agree with some of the reviews that the characters could have been more rich, but I have to admit, the book did keep my attention and I was compelled to finish it. I think if the author focuses more on fleshing out her characters, the next one will be even better. She obviously has no problem with an elaborate/complex storyline (meaning how she juggled the times/ages and still made it understandable). Look folks, I don't want to have to be a rocket scientist to understand a book. It's fiction, and marketed as such. Those looking for the actual secret/mechanics behind time travel should look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"i read every day","review":"fiction, non-fiction, classics etc. This is my favorite contemporary fiction book. I really fell for these characters and as a big fan of chicago i could relate to that aspect! nice handling of the time travel issue. unfortunately, you knew it had to end badly. i plan to read this book once a year."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Time Traveler's Wife","review":"Henry DeTamble is a time traveler in love with a woman named Clare that he met when he was 28. Clare has known Henry all of her life, as he often time travels back to her childhood or teenage years. Over the years they have a complex and changing relationship depending on their ages at the time of meeting as well as the abandonment Clare has to deal with and the inherent dangers of time travel.This is an excellent book, but not what I expected. I was expecting a more traditional romance, but instead this was a book of great intensity with themes of regret, morality, death, and love. Clare and Henry are both realistic and flawed characters who the reader really gets to know during the novel. A great read when you have a few days to read it straight through!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slightly amusing","review":"The idea original. The end unexpected. But eventually I was just fed up with it. I guess is a good airport, beach, distracting reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear your schedule before starting this book","review":"I stayed up all night reading this book. Then I gave it to my roomate, who did the same thing. I have to say, usually I hate every book through page thirty, but with this one I was hooked by page seven. The only other book I felt that way about is A Secret History by Donna Tartt, which is completely different from The Time Traveler's Wife but equally engrossing and well-written. If you plan on reading it, I'd suggest clearing your schedule for the next ten hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"(PLOT SPOILER ALERT) Really surprised that this book was such a best seller. The writing is fine, but hardly spectacular, and the characters are pretty superficial with the same scene repeating over and over. The plot doesn't go anywhere, and even the time travel gets boring. It gets absurd when Henry's young daughter starts time traveling, and honestly I felt this aspect was the most incongruous. Clare INSISTS that she wants henry's baby even though she knows the kinds of danger, risk and misery she'd be exposing her to. Makes Clare a very unlikeable mother. Also, the real world aspects of how other people in society would take advantage of this (ridiculously explained) \\"chromosomal trait\\" is not even addressed. Henry keeps his time travel a well-guarded secret whereas his daughter tells her classmates and teacher, as if it's no big deal. I found this book to be a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"give it a chance","review":"It is confusing for the first few chapters, and I occasionally had to stop and think about the time schemes... but it is incredibly worth it in the end. This is a wonderful love story with, for once, an original concept. It's very well written... I'm surprised this is the author's first book - many of the passages are just so beautifully constructed. Sure, there might be a few plot holes, but they are not important. If the reader does not understand some things, it is because the characters don't either; any confusion simply further conveys the essense of Henry's feeling that he has little control over his life, and Clare's fear that she will lose him."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great idea decently executed","review":"I really liked parts of this book. The concept is great, the first section of the book was really good, and there were some really nice moments through out.I also disliked some parts of this book. Its really sad, probably too sad. I actually almost stopped reading the book after the first part because I could tell that it was going to become really depressing. I put it down for a day but decided it would be worth finishing. I didn't regret my decision until the end, which was not at all pleasing. I was really not happy with the end. Two minor problems were ethnic stereotyping (it doesn't come off as racist but is sort of comical in a bad way) and an overabundance of sex.I would probably recommend this book to others because I was really grabbed by it emotionally BUT I would be wary of doing so because there is a real possibility that a person wouldn't like this book at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth","review":"This is a book of parts. Tasty parts that spread nougat goodness across my tongue and tender parts that swell in my chest.This isn't a book about love, though it couldn't have been written without it. It's a book about abiding and about seeing the truth of things when even the best truth is another lie.It's a very, very good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Love Story","review":"This was a wonderful book. It was a page turner throughout the entire book. I enjoyed the characters and the plot all the way through. I highly recommend this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original And Compelling","review":"I've heard complaints that this book is a difficult read. In ways I can understand. This is not a book you read casually when you have nothing else better to do. In the tradition of Issac Asimov, Audrey Niffenegger weaves a detailed, complex and interesting tapestry that requires close attention. But the end result is well worth the extra effort. Not for everyone, Traveler will appeal to casual fans of sci-fi and romantic buffs alike who are willing to invest the time this book requires. I prefer my sci-fi in small doses, as plot elements rather than being the central plot, as evidenced in my own work. Niffenegger comes through with an original, compelling work.BJ NeblettElysian Dreams: Where the Past Meets the Present"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sigh","review":"Oh how I thoroughly loved and enjoyed this book! I loved every moment, every word, every character... up until the end, haha.

I would recommend this book as a book club read for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gratuitous sex & foul language - A disappointer","review":"The book has an interesting premise, but it includes much foul language, especially referencing Clare and Henry's sexual relationship. The scene with Henry's 15 year old self and his older 15 year old self is completely unnecessary and puzzling. Further, there is a scene towards the end where Clare is together with Gomez that is very strange and gratuitous. The author attempts to \\"spice\\" things up with sexual descriptions that simply detract from the book. It makes it seem as if Clare and Henry's relationship is only based on sex.

This book is a Hillary Duff movie, paint-by-numbers cliches( the mourning virtuoso ruined by the shakes) racist(Black maids and Asian neighbors who say cute things and always pop over with ethnic dishes) stereotypes hiding behind a \\"love makes the family\\" veneer. This book was Barbara Cartland hiding behind Chip Kidd style cover art. No doubt Anne Hathaway will star in the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Have to agree with another writer- unneccessary use of crude language and gratuitous sexually explicit scenes that did not add to the story and were offensive to me.Couldn't get past that from the start."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Time Traveler's Wife","review":"This book was very confusing. It goes from 1991 to 1968 to 1988 so on and so forth. I couldn't make sense of it.The story is about Henry DeTamble. He has Chrono-Displacement Disorder. It causes his genetic clock to reset. \\"He finds himself misplaced in time, pulled to moments of emotional gravity from his life, past and future.\\" He'll just disappear without warning.Then, there's Clare.

Even the main characters are underdeveloped cliches; the supporting characters are worse. It's predictable. Niffenegger relies on quotes to relay what her writing apparently can't. The name-dropping that occurs throughout the book gets old fast, and it fails to paint the picture of Chicago which was presumably the intention, instead just getting cumbersome. Frankly it was misogynistic, which is depressing considering a woman wrote it. The fact that it's a love story doesn't save it from its gaping holes in logic, its bad and inconsistent diction, and its poor, poor character development. I think that a person could find much, much better cute love stories than this one to read if that's what someone's looking for (and everybody wants one occasionally).

I am sure teenage girls love this book but the lack of character depth and sophisticated plot truly makes this one big bore of a read. Hmm...can everyone think \\"Harlequin\\"?. The time travel gimmick works well and is interesting for about 75 pages, then the book meanders. Henry is too boring to even be an anti-hero. The rest of the cast is a collection of ethnic stereotypes out of a tired TV series--Kimy's dialog is right out of Charlie Chan and Celia is like a hooker from any CSI show. Whew...the obsessed with sex naked man with the adolescent girl will draw in some readers but this embarassing element is even more absurd when you see this on screen in the new movie...one of the dogs of the year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just couldn't get into it!","review":"So many people I know read this book and said they liked it so much so I thought I would too. I tried to read it before the film was released but I just couldn't get into it.

I never got past the second chapter.I'm sorry I actually bought it (good thing I didn't get the hardcover edition) and now it'll sit on my bookself until I donate it to my local library bookstore.As far as \\"time travel\\" books, The Outlander series is by far much better and IMO, nothing compares to those books."},{"rating":"1","title":"dull, dull, dull","review":"Others before me have expressed my opinion very well, so I'll just summarize:Boring, flat, uninteresting characters.

Okay, but really cheesy.","review":"I think the concept of this book is really clever, and I enjoyed some of the scenes between the main characters, Henry and Claire. But the idea of LOVE! is so overblown and extreme, it brings the whole book crashing down into a pile of silliness. Henry's father is a completely debilitated alcoholic for 30+ years after his wife dies; Henry's ex-girlfriend commits suicide because she can't bear to live without him; and Henry and Claire think about nothing else in their lives, apparently, except the love and passion they feel for each other. I know it's a romance, but the all-or-nothing importance of LOVE! and lack of detail or consideration of anything else leaves me feeling manipulated as a reader. And by the end, I'm laughing, not crying, at Henry's overblown goodbye to LOVE!.Worth a read for the interesting narrative structure, but the LOVE! story is a pile of mushy cotton candy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't stay with it, even though it was a book club read","review":"Although the general concept of the book was intriguing. I found myself laboring to continue on with the audio book. And very grateful that the children where in the other room, because almost as they meet, we get a rather crude intimate scene with too much information. The focus on the physical, narcissistic kind of love portrayed here, quite frankly dissappointed and bored me.At about track 20, I found myself thinking \\"Life is too short to listen to this book any further\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Long and Boring","review":"This is our book club's selection of the month, so I purchased the audio CD to listen to on a road trip. This book is too long (16 CDs and 17 hours of play time). Although the premise sounds interesting, the book is boring!

The premise is intersting and it started off promising , but then it all fell flat. The characters were incredibly one dimensional and for the life of me I couldn't figure out what it was that made these two main characters fall in love with each other. I ended up not liking them very much, not believing in their feelings for each other and not really feeling anything when I finished the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is not a sci-fi book","review":"I just finished reading this and LOVED LOVED LOVED it. I recommended it to a friend and she said she didn't like sci-fi. So I'm writing here to let you know that this is not really a sci-fi book. Yes, there is time travel involved, but to me it's more of a love story. It's imaginative, fascinating and completely feels real. I was sucked into this story so fast and I was sad when it ended. I did not want to read it too fast because I wanted to draw out every page to it's last letter.Henry de Tamble is a good-looking librarian with one small catch - he can travel through time. He doesn't have too much control over it, but on one of his travels he meets Clare (his future wife). I don't want to get into to much detail as I knew nothing about it (other than the back cover) and loved being surprised by each twist and turn.So, if you were recommended this and think it might be more sci-fi than you like, don't despair. It's a great book and so much fun to read. Enjoy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book of the decade","review":"This book was amazing. After reading it, I have bought copies for at least 2 other friends and recommended it to many others. I loved the book and really related to the characters. I highly recommend it!

I have listened to it over and over, I think 5 times. Everytime the beautifully crafted story line, with its intricately woven series of events, captures my imagination and emotions. Seeing the same point in time from the vantage of both Henry and Clare when they are at different ages, and at different chronologic positions in the novel seems to heighten its interest, importance, and splendor.I have read a few of the negative reviews for this book and am amazed. Of course there is a lot that the author has left out - but that just means the topic is rich and deep. Fantasy always has things that need to be overlooked and physics that needs to be bent. If it didn't then it wouldn't be fantasy.I greatly enjoyed this book and can't wait for her next book. I hope you enjoy it too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A time travel story for the mature crowd...","review":"I looked at some of the other reviews here and saw that the main objection to Niffenegger's novel seems to be its language and very adult situations. Well, believe it or not, adult situations are often what adults find themselves in, and the words the characters spoke are ones adults speak. Instead of offensive, I found the characters to be believable as a result, which helped to make the unusual premise believable too. In other words, since the characters are so well grounded in reality, the peculiar time-travel elements are accepted with little or no hesitation. This is a clever book that adults will enjoy, although I will agree with the reviewers who say it shouldn't be shared with anyone underage, since Niffenegger's intended audience is clearly mature adults who can appeciate the realism she creates."},{"rating":"2","title":"I just loved it!","review":"I have to admit that in the beginning I was confused.

All this said, I thoroughly enjoyed it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic","review":"This book was severely good. It seeped into my soul and nourished me from the inside out. I loved it. I literally sat down, began reading, and did not move until I was finished (about six hours)Audrey Niffenegger did a fantastic job, this book literally pulls you into it, you can't help but want to re-read it once you've finished. And the story and it's character's linger in your mind for days to come. Wonderful.I'd suggest listening to a great cd (low volume) in the background while reading, for me at least. (I listening to the new Coldplay cd)"},{"rating":"2","title":"a very interesting love story!","review":"This is the first audiobook I've ever purchased, and I will be purchasing more! This was a very interesting story and the readers of the story were very entertaining. There are a few bad spots - swears, sexual content, etc. - but nothing I would consider over the top. Most of the books I have read have way more questionable content than this book had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book; too bad the movie failed to live up to it","review":"This was a great story. It was very intriging, an exciting plot. I cared about Henry and Clare and hoped that they would find happiness in whatever situations life threw at them. I started reading the book the day I received it and barely put it down until I finished it the next day.The only complaint about the book is that it's rated R. I wasn't expecting some of the graphic sex and violence and was a bit offended. I didn't realize when I started reading the story that I would find such graphic situations but it was too late because I was already hooked and had to finish the story.Too bad the movie failed to deliver. :( I was hoping for so much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely & Original","review":"Just finished this book during my vacation. I didn't expect to like it and it took about 3 chapters to get drawn in. But drawn in I was. This is a beautiful, creative, emotional and thought-provoking book. Very sad ending. I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addictive!","review":"I have always loved the concepts of time travel, but this brought a depth into it that I'd never imagined. The most important thing for me when reading a book (watching a movie, etc.) is that I care about the characters and the author very effectively caused me to do so! I highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ponderous","review":"This book is awful. First of all, she needs a better editor because it shouldn't have been longer than 300 pages. She's pleasuring herself with her own prose instead of furthering the story. It's ponderous, self absorbed and off point. It doesn't matter at what point you start or stop reading it...so I started skimming it. And I NEVER skim books! The dialogue is ridiculous. I know it's fiction but the characters aren't having real conversations. I don't know anybody who speaks the way they do to each other and talk about the subjects they talk about it. No characters can be that self-actualized. Honestly, it's insulting. If you want to read a good book about time travel, read \\"Sirens of Titan\\". If you want to read a good book about relationships, read \\"Gone With The Wind\\". Don't waste your time on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book should time travel somewhere else","review":"This book was recommended to me by numerous people on an AOL book message board. They all pronounced it \\"fantastic\\"! Is it because I really don't understand time travel? Or was it because I couldn't sit down and read it all at one sitting? Maybe it would've made more sense then. But the constant going back and forth between time periods and a character talking to themselves in a different time just didn't make sense to me. And I didn't think the \\"romance\\" that it was sort of wrapped around was anything to write home to mom about either. Maybe I just don't \\"get\\" time travel. I think I'll stick with Jodi Picoult!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book to Appreciate","review":"Going in, I had my expectations of the usual time travelling sci-fi story, but after I read the first page I knew I wass in for much more. This novel had me so captivated that I read it in 2 days, all 500 plus pages, and I have a toddler!! It really handed me the notion that other people in this world have the same concept of love that I do...something I wasn't so sure about. Her word choice is brilliant and completely grabs you in a way that few other authors can. The relationship between Henry and Claire is believable, and makes you forget that time travel is impossible. It simply becomes a metaphor for any other obstacles that keep two lovers apart. I loved this book and would highly recommend it to all people who are inspired by love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good enough but...","review":"**SOME SPOILERS**This book did not fulfill my expectations, especially with all the critical acclaim it has received. I don't feel the love between Henry and Clare and I got a bit tired of how the author felt the need to describe every minority in the book with stereotypes. I also didn't like the sexual encounter of 18 year Clare with a much older Henry. I was hoping she would also shed more light on Henry's phenomenon. I am well aware that I am in the minority given all the wonderful reviews people have given this book, but I would truly be lying if I said it was a pleasure reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witty, thought provoking, stellar dialogue","review":"I just finished this lovely book. It's about Henry DeTamble. Something is wrong with him and he pops in and out of time, involuntarily. The author doesn't paint a pretty picture about this, either. He does all the things you'd imagine you would have to do, were you yanked about as he is: he steals what he needs to survive, as he arrives in his new time sans clothing of any kind.Henry meets his future wife when she'd just a child, and she finally meets him in their present when she's grown. It's told from both their viewpoints. Hers is decidedly feminine. His is guy, all the way. There is a sharp delineation between the characters, and after 540 pages I feel like I know all of them.I haven't seen the movie, but I've read a LOT of fiction. The author does dialogue better than any I've ever read. It's snappy. It's witty. It sounds like the way people really talk.\\\\Highly, highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I've ever read","review":"Amazing, beautiful love story. I just finished reading this book today and I can't stop thinking about it. I fell in love with Henry and Clare. It did take me a bit to get into and to understand ( the time traveling and dates were confusing at first ) but I'm so glad I stuck with it. By the 3rd chapter I was hooked! Love love LOVE this book! I can't wait to watch the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intellectually stimulating unique story of enduring love","review":"5 out of 5. I read this book over 18 months ago, so I need to refresh my memory. But, if you can get over the time traveler's visits to his current self, and perhaps the older man spending time with a young girl, then you will find it a rare book that leaves you wanting a love like that. Imagine meeting your true love -- and being able to share in that love before that shared love existed. A story that will evoke laughter as well as tears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Wait Until this Book was over","review":"It's hard to believe so many people liked this book. I just don't understand why. The plot never took off in my opinion. I was extremely bored throughout. I took this on vacation and luckily had the time to get it read during the vacation, otherwise I simply would've put it aside.I wanted to read it because it was recommended on the Today Show & my sister had liked it as well.Too many loose ends in my opinion ~ the relationship between Clair and Gomez ~ where did that fit in?Henry waking up all bloody & beat up ~ what was that all about?I got bored with the same scenerios surrounding so many miscarriages.Confused with how he died ~ without his feet after the New Years Eve party or found in the meadow, shot by someone he knew?The daughter's time traveling experiences ~ wierd.In summary, I just couldn't recommend this book and was relieved when it was finally over."},{"rating":"1","title":"no depth","review":"This is one of those books you try to finish because of good reviews but in the end you wonder why they got such good reviews. Too simplistic, no depth at all. The story itself is not intense enough to keep the reader focused. I lost interest after reading 1/3 of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I gave it away and it wouldn't stay gone!","review":"I applaud all of you who gave this one star. I think, hands down, this is the worst book I've ever read. I was given this book by three different people. Each time, I passed it on, another copy was gifted to me.I forget where it's located but there is a blog that states, \\"It was so bad, I threw it at the wall.\\" Well, personally, I think the copy should be burned and the ashes mailed back to the author.I thought the characters were flat and uninteresting. I also found the guy slightly creepy.Please, don't waste your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst written book I've ever read","review":"I hated every minute of reading this book. If I hadn't been reading it for my book club, I would have thrown it away after about 10 pages. And I'm not saying that for any \\"political\\" reason, as one reviewer said. I'm saying it because the book sucks! The characters were not endearing, or even interesting. The long, unnecessary and out-of-place details were distracting and annoying, and bogged down the flow of reading. Some of the things the writer has these characters saying are ridiculously unrealistic. The premise is interesting and original, but that's the only positive thing about the book. Save your money and time...skip this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"slow read","review":"Although this book was interesting at times, overall I don't recommend it. The format - jumping back and forth between points of view - was dull and slowed down the pace of the book. I forced myself to finish it finally just so I could move on to a new book and enjoy reading again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"This book was so creepy I had to stop reading halfway through. An older man travels back in time to manipulate a young girl and mold her into his future wife, bleh!! Talk about your creepy pedo vibes. He is sociopathic and cares nothing if his actions (stealing for instance) hurt other people, as long as he gets his bride. Then he gets her and it's all sex sex sex pop culture hipster references and more sex. This made me roll my eyes.I give the book a couple stars for the interesting side characters only."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the Point?","review":"I enjoy the style of writing. I enjoyed the time travel aspect. Other than these two things, I just don't get it. Two not-so-special personalities 'fall in love', have a kid, and the ending just seems as though it is slapped on for the sake of a deadline, perhaps. The problem is, it seems to go nowhere. There was no development of the concept of changing things when you go back in time or perhaps, the essential being, consistant throughout time transcending time eventually. It seemed to just leave you dead, which is what happened to the characters eventually. Perhaps I am just too much of a romantic, but I do like a neatly tied up ending, esp in this type of novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch the movie. Skip the book.","review":"As a book-lover, I can't believe I'm actually saying this: Watch the movie and skip the book.The book isn't romantic at all. The two main characters never make love; instead their intimacy is always referenced with the more vulgar term that doesn't require love. The characters are pretentious and not likable by any means. The ending was just horrifying, not only because she's betraying her married, best friend but because she seems to have quickly forgotten the \\"love of her life.\\"The movie is all the good and none of the bad. It is romantic, the characters are likable and they don't sleep with their best friend's husband while their own husband is still warm in his grave.The Time Traveler's Wife"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great premise, uninteresting execution","review":"The author flirts with some really interesting ideas, but doesn't know what to do with them once she engages them. So, unfortunately, this ends up being nothing more than a pretentious, trashy romance novel. Silly girl.Please, people. No more heartbreakingly beautiful heroines earing minimal makeup and coppery hair braided with seed pearls on their doomed wedding days. 'Mkay?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic story, even for those not into the genre.","review":"I nervously cracked open the pages of The Time Traveler's Wife because it is held in such high regard by so many... it happens often, but I'm not a big fan of disliking books others seem to love. I really did think this would be the case with Niffenegger's début: at it's core it's a romance novel about a man who can time travel. It sounds ridiculous, and I don't like love stories.I needn't have worried. After the first page I was entranced with the story and the characters and couldn't tear myself away from the story.A warning, though: don't read reviews of this book as even an innocuous-sounding comment could ruin an important moment in the book. For that reason, I'll end this 'review' now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smartly written, unique story, but not for me","review":"I did not enjoy this book at all because it was writen in a very distracting fashion. While it was unique, it was too hard to get into. I also really hated the story, it was also too confusing to follow, to strange to enjoy, and to boring to care. I totally hated this book and it was near torture and a waste of time to read. The only reason that I read this was because it was for my book club. The reivews, by the way, in the club were 50/50. Some loved it, the rest of us hated it. There was no in-between. I would only recommend this book to someone who is into odd literature or to English majors, I'm not sure who else would like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE TIME TRAVELER'S WIFE","review":"Pretentious, irritating, self-indulgent. Dull characters and total absence of 1970s/80s period atmosphere. By p.90 I was nearly shredding it to pieces in despair. I would rather eat my feet than have to finish it. It's a dreadful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The time Travelers Wife","review":"I was recommended this book by a friend who stated it was the best book she had ever read.Well, I was tortured to even try to finish it,which I did.I thought it was very poorly written,the story had no depth.Before I had read it I had recommended it to another friend who went out and bought 3 copies,one for herself and the other 2 to give away.After she finished the book she returned the 2 gift copies to the store,disappointed herself, by the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing read","review":"When I began reading this book, I absolutely loved it. It is a very interesting story, and has very beautiful writing. I enjoyed it right up until the Henry met Clare for the first time. From that point on, the story became increasingly pretentious and unbelievable. But my biggest disappointment was the jarring language and constant sex. Niffenegger has real talent, and it is disappointing that she wastes it turning a potentially classic book into a cheap sex novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can we say \\"gimic\\"? Very over-rated book.","review":"I don't want to give the story away, but if plot-hopping is your idea of a good read, this is for you. (Actually, it's still not for you. Try the Jasper Fford books---they're much better.) If you prefer a story that's actually cohesive, with characters that are actually well-developed, pick up something else. The only reason this is on the NYTimes list is because someone at the Today show picked it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea turns boring and empty","review":"The first 30 pages were good, but by page 50, the structure of the book became tedious and boring. All of the energy is used up with the intricacy of the plot, but leaves no room for depth in the characters and no real intimacy or connection between them. Being whimsical can only go so far. I made it to page 100, then gave up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"A really engaging book about the ramifications of time travel and its affect on the future, with a love story to boot. I enjoyed reading this book and would recommend it highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of The Time Traveler's Wife","review":"I was not very impressed with this read - I listened to all 12 audio CDs and was bemused to find that this version was blissfully abridged....Time travel never seemed so ... meaningless. Not a good time spent for those of us looking for a more existential meaning to life. Better to time travel to the next book on your list!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A gem of a love story...","review":"There is both humor and heartbreak in this gem of a love story. \`The Time Traveler's Wife' has stood the test of time for memorability for this reader. Although, I read this moving story many months ago, I recall the plotline clearly as well as all the intensity of feelings it evoked. The book has become extremely popular since I read it, and ironically I had selected it as an impulse purchase.The reading audience must be captivated as I was by Ms. Niffenegger's ability to create a loving relationship between the two main characters that reaches the extreme of poignancy. The notion of time travel is what allows the author to explore the various elements of the relationship between Henry and Clare. If time travel intrigues you, also try \`Time and Again' by Jack Finney.\`The Time Traveler's Wife' is one of the best novels of the past few years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated It","review":"I suppose I would have found the story in this book mildly interesting (but not compelling) if the book wouldn't have contained so many graphic descriptions of the physical aspect of \\"love.\\" I also was put off by all the profanity. \\"Real\\" people don't use that much profanity and I couldn't buy into the fact that these characters would.I didn't see hide nor hare or \\"love\\" between Henry and Clare and even if I had, it would have been destroyed by the scene on the kitchen table with Gomez.This book left an overwhelming \\"bad taste\\" in my mouth (and mind). The prose was okay, and that's what the one star is for. If I were you, I'd do myself a favor and skip it, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is Longer Than It Looks","review":"This book is long and boring. It also contains more than a little sexual dialogue and mental imagery, which ruins what few good parts there are. The few parts that are touching or humorous are not enough to sustain the reader through the rest of the book. The first half was very hard to get into, and even though it does pick up a bit later, this does not make it worth ones time. I do not deny the writer her due, the writing is good, but this is one of those books I could have gone without reading and be none the worse. The only catch is, I had wondered about this book for a while so I guess I would still be wondering if I hadn't read it, which leaves me wishing I had never wondered at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"close , but no cigar","review":"What promises to be a highly original novel soon turns out to be nothing more than just another love story. Sure , the love between the two main characters is complicated by the fact that one of them suffers from Chrono Displacement Disorder (He is epileptically transported to the past or future , against his will) but this original idea is not fully exploited and worse , ends up in Contradiction City. Add to this the fact that Niffenegger's writing skills are mediocre to say the least (someone must have convinced her that she could do anything) and you are left with just another movie script."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, poor execution","review":"This book's plot idea was good, but the execution left much to be desired. Each time trip is just like the last. The shift in point-of-view is well done, but the characters' voices are identical. The hero, a man, talks like a woman."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed!!!!","review":"I honestly thought this was going to be a good book since I heard the movie was good. It's such a slow read that by the time I got one-fourth of the way, I thought it was going to get better....but it never did. Sooooo many people gave this book so much credit and that's why I decided to read it. I put it on hold at my local library and got it three months after!!!! Now, I can honestly (to my disappointment) say 'what a waste of waiting.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"I was very dissapointed to read this book. Not only was it not gripping, it was poorly constructed with weak character building, and too much disconnected detail. Perhaps if re-edited, it could be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I bought the book because of the early reviews and the fact it was on the bestseller list. It turned out to be one of the few books I never finished reading because I thought it was horrible. Very confusing and not at all what I expected. The time traveling was hard to follow, especially when Henry runs into himself at an earlier age and the earlier self also time traveled to that moment. I then decided to watch the movie first to make reading the book easier. Well, I found the movie was just as bad, so I gave up on the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"so disappointed","review":"I'm so glad that I borrowed this book from the library instead of purchasing it. I was hoping to read a really great love story - What a disappointment! The concept of this book is interesting, but the author's writing style was very annoying (totally agree with other reviewers who describe her writing as pretentious). I simply could not get myself to care about what happened to Clare or Henry. I kept wanting the story to end, but it just drags on and on. I can usually get through a good book in 2 or 3 days, but it took me 3 weeks to finish this one--and I forced myself. Very surprised that so many gave this book good reviews. I gave it 2 stars, simply because I've read worse. Based on my feelings about the book, I definitely won't be seeing the movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like being beaten up repeatedly","review":"The first half of this book is great and fun. The second half is like being run over by a truck repeatedly. Very depressing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read","review":"I loved this book and have lent it to many friends. If your considering it you wont be sorry with your purchase"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book, ever.","review":"Hands down. The most romantic thing I have ever read...but not in that romance-novel kind of way. I've been waiting and waiting for another novel by Niffenegger, but I'm sure this type of thing can't be done twice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Story","review":"I started this book against my will at the urging of a friend. THe beginning was very sci-fi like and I was ready to put it down, but as the story became clearer, I quickly grew addicted. This is one of the best books I've read in a long time - I've bought it as agift for two more people since reading it. LOVE it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A keeper","review":"Like most time-travel stories, this is a meditation on destiny and free will, with a plot driven by paradox dilemmas. I've rarely read such a fresh and moving treatment, however. The author wisely avoids too much investigation into the explanation for the time travel and concentrates instead on the impact on lives and characters; it's not science fiction but a traditional novel. I found this a very, very appealing book. I'm looking forward to the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Time Traveler's Wife","review":"Loved this book. The title doesn't do it justice. I thought it might be a bit sci fi-ish, but it truly is a love story that is so well written and thought out. A wonderful surprise!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good book, tough read","review":"This is a great read but not an easy one. The chapters are long and it is difficult to find your place once you have set it down. It jumps around chronologically and requires much attention to follow along.All of that being said, I love the story line. It was intriguing for me to read and explore the notion of time travel in more of a down to earth approach rather than something that turns sci-fi \\"ish\\". I would give this book as a gift to someone who really enjoys reading. Not for a casual reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Technically brilliant, otherwise a yawn","review":"I really labored to get through this book. While the author does an outstanding job of weaving the details of past and present events as the characters transition from one time to another, the story itself is not very compelling. It is also somewhat tiresome to continue keeping track of who's speaking (Henry or Clare), and who's what age. As other reviewers have said, the character development is weak, and it's not easy to develop a lot of empathy for either of them. I mostly hung with this book and finished it so I could guilt-free write a review here, and warn other would-be readers to avoid this popular novel. There are so many better books out there so spend your time on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute bore","review":"For all the hype I finally broke down and read the book, although I suspected it's target demographic to be the stereotypical middle aged woman... disappointingly I was right. Time Traveler's Wife managed to take something so mysterious and intriguing as time travel and turn it into a mediocre bore. This book is less about the possibilities time travel presents and more about sentimental dreams, memories and the love between two incredibly average uninteresting people. If you want to read something good about time travel I suggest you stick to H.G. Wells."},{"rating":"1","title":"creative, kitchy, but no koo.....","review":"after reading the Da Vinci Code, and Pillars of the Earth, I was ready for something altogether different.I was very disappointed in the content,and rather mudane flowof this book. Having each character (Claire and Henry) take turns in speaking what they are experiencing was a creative touch at first,but then it became an effort, no continuum of threading of the fabric of the story, whatever that was, and actually creepy to think that a young child would be enamoured by such a mysterious character who would disappear. Henry would remember the future or the past, but never knew why he would disappear, and appear in hostile situations when he time traveled. Save your money!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Take it away","review":"I cannot believe the reviews this book got! I agree with the assessment above: this is a real stinker. Do not waste your time! The two main characters are so shallow and poorly drawn that you just can't care. The device of time travel and the idea of a genetic illness (called chronodisplacement)in the main time traveler character is clever, but is so clumsily applied that it just makes the reading a hassle, full of artificial cutesy stumbling blocks. I read a lot of literary fiction, and was in the mood for a good summer romance, but this wasn't it. I had to force myself to finish this. The \\"prose\\" is pedestrian and at times crude and ugly. If you would like an absorbing summer read, replete with a gripping plot line, romance and deeply drawn characters, return to the classics and try Anthony Trollope."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting premise, poorly written","review":"\\"The Time Traveler's Wife\\" has an interesting premise, but the potential of the story is lost in awful narrative. The book is written in the first-person points of view of Henry and Clare.In general, I am a fan of 1st person POV, but this quickly became \\"I did this, then I did that, then this is how I felt...\\" The writing style was so grating to my nerves to read that I couldn't even finish the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it","review":"It took a lot of pages to tell a relatively thin story. I found the characters a bit unbelievable. I would have liked some evidence as to why they loved each other so deeply rather than just a repetition of the fact that they did. And, as a librarian, I found Henry totally unbelievable. It felt a bit like a harlequin romance with time travel as the twist."},{"rating":"1","title":"spare yourself","review":"This book left me feeling dirty. I felt like a witness to a sick romance between a 40-something year old naked man and a child. The characters never felt real to me-even if I could have gotten past the time-travelling (which I couldn't)--but even if I could have...I was still left with this romance that seemed totally unrealistic. and I can not even begin to describe my disgust for Gomez -- actually, I didn't like any of the characters. Nymphomaniacs, Liars, Cheating, Alcoholics...even Kimy got on my nerves--do old Korean women use the word \\"buddy\\"? The final straw was after Clare delivered the baby she'd almost died for--she used the \\"C\\"-word to describe post-partum pains. First of all--no one uses that word. Its disgusting. and I have never heard it used by a new mother--what was the point? to be raw. edgy. fresh?It felt odd and forced on me. I know I'm on my own out here since everyone else seems to have loved the book. oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and depressing","review":"I don't understand how anyone could enjoy this book. The main character is always depressed and pathetic. The \\"action\\" is the same old thing time after time (no pun intended) the only difference being that it happens to a younger or older version of the Traveler's self. I quickly found myself skimming through the book just to see how it ends and even the ending was a let down. The writer had a chance to redeem the book but ended it just short of the \\"pay off\\".I give it negative 10 stars. Awful, just awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like it at all","review":"I bought this book because of it's positive reviews. I made myself finish it, just hoping it would get better! I do not understand how someone could rave about this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An awesome read!","review":"I had heard some good things about this book so I decided to pre-order it when it came out in paperback. As soon as I started reading, I couldn't put it down. The characters are so engaging and interesting. At the end of the story, you feel as if you have known them your whole life. Henry DeTamble has Chrono-Displacement Disorder and can travel through time. He meets his wife when she is 6 and he is in his 30s. Even through all his time traveling, he and his wife are able to stay together. I think this particular book is a good study in human nature, in how people think and act and especially love overcoming all. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was intrigued by the topic and reserved the book at the library. I waited weeks for it. Boasting a topic that was new and unique, it SHOULD have been really exciting reading. The first few chapters were interesting, but it soon became trite and boring. It wasn't that it was poorly written but frankly, I didn't like the cast of characters, their attitudes, etc. There was too much detail about unimportant activities, too much drinking. I'd pass on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The movie is better!","review":"Yeah, the book can get a little confusing. The movie really lets you feel what it is like to be in Henry's shoes. I have not finished the book yet, just to be fair."},{"rating":"2","title":"surprised","review":"I started reading this book when it first came out and had trouble getting started. It was confusing with their ages and the dates. But my daughter said that I shoudn't pay so much attention to that and just go with the story. I followed her advise and LOVED the book! One of my favorite time travel stories was the \\"Two Worlds of Jennie Logan\\" which was with Lindsay Wagner, on television.

We said it was \\"lovely and kind of sad\\" and \\"a sweet love story.\\" We delighted in the unconditional love of Clare, and her fidelity. \\"It's the very ordinariness of Clare and Henry, their real-ness, that makes them heroic, rising beyond the problem of not knowing what the future holds for them.\\" Yet two of us, single, said the characters were flat and the plot was thin. Their comments notwithstanding, XX Libris Book Club liked how love persisted through time. We also learned that our friend Fay has shared the experience: \\"My husband sleeps during arguments. That's when he does his time travel.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Best $10.00 you could ever spend","review":"I have never invested so much time, emotion or thought in a book during one sitting as I have with Time Traveler's wife. It makes you question the idea of fate, destiny, and the possibility of knowing the person you love through all stages of life. While the first pages may be a bit hard to get involved in due to the jumpiness of time travel, within pages you will immerse yourself in the journey. This book is beautifully written with passages that are poetic and profound without ever going overboard or creating fluffy sap true of many love stories. The characters were genuine, the story believable, and the romance wonderfully deep. By the end, the story, style, and language pulled me in and opened my mind to the possibilities about life, love, and the future. What a wonderful gift!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite lacking at the end","review":"I initially liked the first part of this book- very clever storyline and fun for me to try figuring out the time line for both characters. After Henry and Clare are married though it went down hill fast for me. From that point on I found the story got more and more depressing with each page turn. Not a good kind of sadness (like the Notebook) either... like a dull \\"why do I keep reading this- it's torture!\\" kind of sadness. In my opinion there was no need for the tragic ending... it would have been a much better book all around had there been some hope and optimism in the end...happy endings work for a reason! I'm hoping for once they WILL stray from the actual storyline when it comes to making the movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buuu!","review":"False like one chocolate coin (with too much sugar).

But as I read about its plot, I just have to ask: hasn't anyone read Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut? It seems like this book is a total rip-off of his original idea: a man who becomes 'unstuck' from time and flips back and forth in his life. Honestly, it makes me sick to read this remarks like \\"Wow, this is such an amazing new idea!\\". Slaughterhouse 5 is a classic, and they even made a pretty good movie out of it, back in the day. C'mon, people, let's give credit where credit is due. Or, perhaps, Ms. Niffenegger is herself detached from time, and gave the idea to Mr. Vonnegut?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Soap Opera of a Novel","review":"Yawn!!!!What do others see in this book!

I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting concept but not well developed...","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book because I had heard such excellent praise for it. While I found the concept of the time travelling Henry fascinating, I thought the book really lacked in everything else. The characters were rather flat, not as well-developed as they could have been. Also, while I thought that in most places the author did a good job of keeping the story flowing, there were several times where the plot became extremely confusing and unable to follow.Finally, I thought the use of profanity and explicit descriptions of sexual encounters were entirely gratuitous in most portions of the book. It was quite jarring and further disrupted the flow of the story, which was not the easiest to follow to begin with. I gave the book two stars instead of one because I did enjoy the unique concept of the book....had the plot and characters been richer, I would have given it three stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read something different","review":"I really loved this book and passed it on to others to read.

It was a disappointment.The author fails to logically address the awkwardness and distastefulness of a six-year old girl meeting her future husband, and vice versa. Although the audience knows from the start that they are to be lovers ultimately, no concrete reasons are given as to what exactly makes Clare and Henry fall in love with each other. The love story is simply too one-dimensional, and full of sex, more than anything else.It's a popular theme, but could have been much more interesting. Spend your money on something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"DIRTY!","review":"You should know before purchasing this book how dirty it is. If you're fine with that then cool. The overall story line is good. But there is so much indepth explanation of sexual acts. If your like under 21 this book should come with a warning label on it because I had no idea what I was getting into. If your a mother who doesn't want your daughter to know the intricate details of a strangers sexual experience past and present then this might not be the best book to buy. I'm seventeen and was absolutely shocked. Most people say by the time your twelve you've heard it all but this was horrifically shocking. Most of the time teen girls read books they wouldn't be comfortable with their grandma knowing their reading. But I think this book would make my hooker friends blush. The F word also seems to be a favorite of this authors so if your offended by that kind of thing then do NOT buy the book. Though I must admit, if it wasn't morally degrading I would have loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"After reading the reviews I was looking forward to a good escapism read.

I don't care for the library. I will not buy a book to clutter up my shelves again as I had books everywhere before Kindle.

It reads like it's written by a man--despite the mushy love story. The author uses crude language when it's not necessary and has the main character sleep with another man (twice) when she is most likely not to do so - unless written by a man.To top it off, the ending is decididely unsatisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Time Traveler's Wife","review":"The Time Traveler's Wife, By Audrey Niffenegger was a book that I had not initially intended reading, but became curious about due to the conversations others were having. I had mixed opinions about this book at first because I really struggled to become invested in the plot and characters for the first half, but then absolutely loved the second half so I am glad I persevered! Overall, a beautiful love story with a unique time travel/sci-fi twist which will ultimately tug at your heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast Read, Leaves Enough to YOUR Imagination","review":"I read this book in a weekend - having both the luxury of time and finding it to be very engaging. I passed on this book several times at different stores - and then decided to pick it up and was glad I did! I am a big fan of time travel concepts - and found this one to be very fun to work out and confess I did have a sense of what was going to happen (without reading the end!) ... haven't yet seen the movie, but from the movie reviews think that it is probably better to first read the book else the conditions might seem rather implausible."},{"rating":"2","title":"My all-time favorite book!","review":"I have never written a review on anything before. But this book is so incredible, that I am moved to tell people about it. Audrey Niffenegger pulls off an extremely tight story that answers all of your questions. She is able to write a complex, non-linear novel that appeals to many aspects of human existence. While it is primarily a deep and beautiful love story, there is also science, humor, suspense and even a touch of violence. I have read and re-read this book many times. It is the best book I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Restores your faith in book club books","review":"I don't trust bestsellers that became that way by being promoted on a TV book club. I've had my fair share of Oprah Book Club selections that were so dull I wondered how many of those that actually purchased them on her advice actually waded all the way through them. This one is a Today Show selection --- which made me skeptical about the good reviews from the start. I read books by the bag full --- and this is one of the best I've read this year! It's a love story with enough intrigue to keep the pages turning as fast as any thriller.

I picked it up last weekend and found I was immediately sucked into the story. Very enjoyable. The story jumps around in time - but in a very easy to follow manner. I commend the author on her handling of this - as it would have been easy to muddle the story. The characters are believable - and likeable. I was sorry the book ended and will probably pick it up and re-read it again in the next few months."},{"rating":"1","title":"a depressing exercise in futility","review":"For the record, I read ALL of this book, and the only reason I finished it was because it was a selection in my book club. My overall feeling is one of depression. If this is what people think love is, then I'm sorry. Henry and Clare are two of the most shallow, self-absorbed, crude people I've read about. And I admit to being offended by the gutteral sexual word usage. Everyone in this, including Gomez and Ingrid, are hollowed human beings. There's no real redemption, no hope, no beauty...just a series of mundane passages about what they ate, how drunk Henry got, and how they assumed they had better sex than anyone on the planet. Sorry, not interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"After reading many good reviews about this book I'm surprised it's so incredibly boring, it really had a good premise but the author just didn't know how to explore it. The characters are so shallow it's impossible to believe in any of them, there are very detailed countless scenes about their daily lives yet all this adds nothing to them, because the whole thing always seems hollow somehow, since the very first page we're told about this incredible romance that never really happens. One day they meet, have sex and that's it, they have nothing in common besides their taste in music or literature. I'm glad I didn't buy this and can only imagine people who liked it so much never read many good books and are comparing it to something like Da Vinci Code."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too slow.","review":"This book was too slow an boring right from the beginning I just couldn't get into it and it went on my bookshelf probably never to be picked up again.

Thank goodness I didn't purchase it. It was simply one of the worst books I have ever read, and I only finished it because she said the end was \\"amazing.\\"The plot, while an interesting idea, was contrived and fragmented (even for a \\"time traveller\\"). Subplots were non-existent unless you want to consider Henry's escapades gathering clothes and picking locks something of a storyline.The writing meandered through the most mundane and boring details chapter after chapter. I found myself one-third of the way through the book skimming pages just to find some substance. The main characters, Clare and Henry, are reasonably developed; however, the rest of the characters are so non-descript, I could hardly remember who was who.The end was as predictable and similarly shallow as the entire book. What a waste of time......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't lay the book down!","review":"At five o'clock this morning I finally was able to close the book and go to sleep. Taking breaks from the reading seemed to confuse me so I tried to hang in there so as to keep all the time-lines and subplots in some kind of order in my mind. It is a lovely story of love and devotion. I wish there was more. Is there a sequel in the future... or was that the past?I borrowed the book from the library and listened to the Audible version. The actors/narrators were excellent! They kept me interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"could not finish","review":"Don't know what all the hype is about this book. I found it to be very confusing. refused to waste valuable time reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A haunting love story","review":"The Time Traveler's Wife is not for the faint of heart. That's for certain! Sure, the story of Henry, a man with a genetic disorder that causes him to time-travel involuntarily, and his wife, the gifted artist Clare, is certainly a love story. But it is also a story of pain, suffering and... more pain. It made me smile, it made me frown, and at times, it almost made me cry. It's quite gruesome, and at the same time a bit unrealistic - Clare and Henry are true soulmates and love each other wholly and unconditionally. A very good read, but not entirely credible, I'd say. But by all means do read it. It won't leave you cold."},{"rating":"2","title":"e in the midwest","review":"I enjoyed this book considerably- it made me cry at the end. Definately a recomended read."},{"rating":"2","title":"New-Age Romanticism at Its Best","review":"I was sucked into this novel, not only for its thorough character development, but also reluctantly for its unique sci-fi-esque plot. I thought Niffenegger did a great job of designing an offbeat physical condition in Henry's \\"chrono-displacement.\\" It was unique and well thought-out enough not to cause the rolling of the reader's eyes in disbelief or disgust. Never being a science fiction reader, I was pleasantly surprised to see how well it functioned for the purposes' of this book.Another seemingly odd but effective pairing was the aspect of romanticism that incorporated the downfalls of Henry's time travelling. I will deeply moved by Henry and Clare's relationship and was pleased to find a novel that didn't use hackneyed cliches to describe their love.Watch out for more releases by this author. She exudes a unique writing style that comes off as \\"sexless\\" in a good way; appealing to both men and women."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing for a first work.","review":"So many good reviews have done a great job of saying more than I ever could. My husband picked this book off the stacks of a summer book sale for me, and I didn't get around to cracking it until just recently. While quite busy, I longed to steal away for a moment or two so I could consume a few more pages.Perhaps most telling of the book's power was that somewhere near the end, everything yet to go became clear, yet that didn't dampen the desire to go through it. Very touching, at times heart rending, account of life--and our lack of control within it--, love and art.Well written, well edited and well produced, it was a pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"What an amazing story!","review":"Quite simply, I adore this book! I bought The Time Traveler's Wife on a whim because of the time traveling element and what I found is a very touching and captivating love story. The element of time travel to shape the love that Henry and Clare develop is used very well and after a very short while, starts to seem natural. Very rarely do I find myself disappointed to reach the end of a book, but with this novel, I was so disappointed to reach the end that I started to read it over again.The author is so good at describing a scene that there were several times where I felt like I was actually there with Henry and Clare; witnessing their story instead of reading it. This is such a great book that I will be recommending it to several people who I know will love it as much as I do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting premise, full of promise, plop- went nowhere.","review":"This book is in love with itself... such pretentious writing. Disappointing. I was excited when I began the book. It had the promise of a fulfilling tale. But it fell flat. Nothing there after about one-third to one-halfway through. The plot just flatlined and became sad and wallowing. There was nothing doing, nothing going on.And very DEPRESSING.Another chief complaint was Clare essentially has no life after Henry.There are a thousand time-travel stories out there that are much better, and more engaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring, shallow","review":"I am amazed that so many people liked this boring, clunky, and adolescent tale. The time travel device fails on many levels, and it is never clear what telling the story in this way adds. The characters do not develop as believable people; they don't grow in psychological depth. The detailed descriptions of the routines of every day--do we need to know so much about every meal they eat or the clothes they put on?--are boring and easily skipped. As the characters never seem real, the end is not touching but predictable. I actually felt relieved that the book was finally over."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I've read","review":"this is one of the most original yet intriguing and spell-binding books I've ever read. I actually read it twice which I never do and was as intrigued the second time as the first - looking for clues and finding a few jewels.

I would recommend it for those who like the science fiction angle but for anyone who thoroughly enjoys fantastic prose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Odd man out","review":"I know that I am well outside the praise choir here. I know that the idea of this book is original, and I went into this reading experience expecting a quirky and brilliant ride. And perhaps this novel is both of those things, but sadly, its magic passed me over, and I found myself closing the book forever midway through. Something I have done only twice in my long reading life.The plot felt contrived and characters sharp edged. Here \\"The Clever Idea\\" was everthing to the detriment of the whole. I did find out how the book ended. I wasn't surprised, nor was I sorry that I put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"She waits....","review":"I really enjoyed this book though the beginning is slow. It's about a woman who spends her ENTIRE life waiting for this guy (her husband). He can time travel so she spends her first 20 some years waiting for him to appear...finally, he appears in her life, becomes a part of it and she spends the rest of her life alone because he's time travelling. It's a pretty cool book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very enjoyable read with one reservation.","review":"The author did an excellent job with this subject. Because of the time traveling by two of the characters, keeping the continuity flow in proper flow was obviously quite difficuly but was well handled by the author.I believe the book would have benifited from a brief explanation, at some appropriate point by Henry, as to the problem that would be created by trying to go back in time and bringing about a change in some traumatic event. Instead, there is only a weak statement that nothing that has happened can be changed.My only real dissapointment in the book was the unfortunate repetitive use cheap vulger language which had no real purpose and only raised a sence of disappointment in the reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"A definite page-turner","review":"I enjoyed this book immensely and absolutely could not put it down. Audrey Niffenegger's writing style is different and fresh. She alternates between the viewpoints of her two main characters, and although it initially can be confusing it brought out a richness in the two characters that one point of view could not. This book reminds us to cherish the time we have with those we love.If you enjoy well-written fiction, and if you enjoy reading heartfelt stories about love, family, and the complex relationships people have within a tangled web of time- you will LOVE this book. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An immensely beautiful book","review":"If you are human, you will weep. Your heart may be broken, but once you have lifted your eyes from the final page, you will find that it's stronger for being cracked open; more able to love, to see poetry in the moment, to remember deeply, to hope powerfully, and most of all, to be gratefully present."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Hack It","review":"I was really looking forward to this book. When I finally got it and started reading I was disappointed. I kept waiting for it to pick up. Perhaps it does in the last 14 pages. I didn't get that far. I found it boring. I did not like either of the main characters (though I wanted to). They just didn't come alive for me.

It wasn't needed that graphically. In the book the main character needed to have sex to not time travel.

Henry Detamble has a real problem: he's stuck in the loop of a time warm, a veritable prisoner of the past who is swept from one era to another with absolutely no sense to the timing of his travels. He's married to Clare, works in a library - but swoops into different eras, usually somehow managing to lose all his clothes during the trip, and sometimes even runs into himself in passing, so to speak. The central problem is that, as time passes, Clare ages along the expected continuum while Henry's age shifts forward and backward, depending on where he is at any given time. Watching how this unique couple cope with the difficulties this produces in their tender and often passionate marriage is what makes this an unusual urban love story.Don't miss it; all the hoopla is well-deserved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sci-Fi meets Romance","review":"This book appeared more like a chronilogical narration of 2 lives that meet occasionally.

The characters were loveable because if the way that it was written. I wanted them to all be ok and be happy.3. The storyline was really good and I've never read a romantic novel written in such a way, the plotline is very different and very addictive, I couldn't put the book down.Just read it, I've never cried over a book as much as I did The Time Traveller's Wife.

That has always been myposition, that is, until I ran into \\"The Time Traveler's Wife\\".My own thinking is that this is more of a science fiction novelthan a romance, but I can see the opposite argument. The relationship of the lead characters leads the reader to a literary acceptance of the weird propositon that a person can move in and out of time. How fun, one thinks, and yet that is the entire twist of missery, fear, and sadness. Now, my task is to convince my wife to read this, because it certainly will bea topic of conversation which should involved our own 36 yearrelationship.

Reminiscent of William Faulkner in that non-linear fashion of writing; this novel jumps around... a lot! The story is overall interesting and meaningful. I agree that it is primarily a love story supported with strange ideals of the impact of time travel. However, I most highly suggest this to writers.

You will laugh, you will cry, you will appreciate the people in your life, as well as the time you have with them...however long that may be. \\"The Time Traveler's Wife\\" is worth reading in this lifetime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not enjoy this book","review":"I did not enjoy this book and did not see any value it offered. I will not read any more books by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like the F word, you'll like this book","review":"The story was interesting and fun to read, thinking about how a time traveler would have a relationship with a \\"normal\\" person, but I found the foul language irritating and the language used to describe love scenes to be crude and offensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing and hard to follow","review":"Normally I try to read a book I end up not liking at least half way through before I give up. I stopped reading about 25 pages into the novel. I just could not grasp the concept of this man's time travel. The author jumped around too much without much point to the story. I still do not understand why this man was time traveling and why his wife put up with it. She would even tell him about how she met him when she was six sand he was an adult.Then she would meet him after that at different ages. He would always end up being naked when he arrived after time traveling. If I saw a nude man when I was a young girl or an adult I would run and fast.The characters were flat and never developed enough for me to get interested in them or care what happened to them. It just was not beleivable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dirty enough not to read","review":"I'll be honest and say I didn't make it very far in this book. Let me just tell you up front that after the fourth dirty section I lost interest. The author should stick to story telling (...). Instead of writing about love making she gets caught up in the dirty details of explicit sex (...); and all this in the first 100 pages. If you want a wholesome feel good book, this is not for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"No thank you!","review":"This book starts out really interesting then for whatever reason the author gets gross. I do not recommend it, in fact I wish I had never read as much as I did. I threw my copy away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying","review":"This book annoyed me. There's simply no other way to put it. Henry is a time traveler, and he basically brings up his future wife when he travels back to the past, and then at some point, he dies.I couldn't have cared less.An insult to the time travel genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended for young readers","review":"This book was marveoulouly written, it contained great emotion and depth. However, it also contained a great deal of language, and situations I wouldn't want my child under 16 to deal with yet. Also my one grip with the story. What man would knowingly have a best friend who lusts after his wife?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Time Traveler's Wife","review":"Do not waste your money buying this book. There is something inherently false about it. It pretends to be something that it isn't. This book disturbed me...it was hard to put my finger on it at first. It's a fake."},{"rating":"2","title":"extremely clever and original","review":"audrey niffenegger's record breaking debut novel is a clever piece of story writing, using a unique pretense the novel shifts its hero back and forth in time to meet the love of his life.the story is fabulously well paced and, albeit a trifle too long, audrey keeps the surprises coming all the time inthis roller-coaster ride. considering this is a sci-fi romance (for want of a better classification) the author invokes an amazing degree of believabiliy and induces dep empathy for hte plight of her characters.the story is warm and tender and is bound to be a big hit with lovers of intelligent romance novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reall great until the end!","review":"I read this book at the request of my friend who had already read it in her Book Club. She insisted I read it before going to see the movie. I'm glad I did even though I have not seen the movie yet. It's a neat book and written well. Just look out for the end. It leaves you saying, is that all? Is this what happens? So I was pretty let down at the end , not crying for days like alot of people I heard about. I guess it just depends on where you are in your relationships."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensitive Readers Beware","review":"The Time Traveler's Wife is a totally absorbing journey. I loved this book, and was grateful to have such a wonderful story I could escape into. I read for hours at a time, not wanting to put the book down. I looked forward to my time alone with Henry and Clare. I thought the author did a fabulous job of getting inside Henry's and Clare's feelings, and revealed their thoughts in a believable and authentic way. Their love for each other was most real and believable. I was totally convinced of time travel soon after I started the story. My main comment here is that because this became so real to me, I feel somewhat terrorized by some of the things that happened. The reality of what Henry faced became almost too much for this reader. The last part of the book kept me awake the whole night after I finished it, and I still feel pretty freaked out by it. I really think the plot goes a bit too far at one point. Brace yourself for a not so gentle ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal!","review":"This book is a gem. I fell in love with both Clare and Henry. The bond that these two share is strong and Niffennager's writing expresses it. The storyline is of an average couple that have to undergo many of life's events; first dates, looking for apartments, marriages, children and getting older. There is one catch. Henry isn't always in the 'present'. Henry's past present and future is one big pretzel which make both Clare and Henry's life a bit hectic at times. Regardless, this story is of love at first .... twice over. (You'll see)HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a terrific read...","review":"When I first started to read this novel, I almost put it down, because of the format. She jumps through time evey other page or so, but it really is coherently written. The format, which is multiple first person, seems very difficult to write and I have to give kudos for making it work. We all dream about time travelling as children, but very few of us think of the ramifcations and consequences, this book brings it all home, in sometimes graphic detail. Beware the first couple hundred pages are mild to the heavy sexual references toward the end. I love the sequences with father/ daughter. Can't help but think that they continue to meet throughout time. How interesting... very thought provoking and entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to finish","review":"Other reviews summarize the plot so I won't repeat everything here. Essentially, this is a story about a time travelling man and the various people in his life and how he comes in and goes out of \\"meeting\\" with them - at least that's how I felt about it. I kept reading it to see how everything would end but even that was disappointing. At times, the story and characters were really annoying. Yet when I gave this to a friend, she loved it! So much for opinions!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully written","review":"Although confusing and unrealistic at times ,this book was good,well written and powerful,I loved the story between Henry and Clare. those who havent finished reading the book missed the best part of it :The end.I dont easily cry while i m reading a book,this one had me weeping.I feel the author should ve focused more on the carachters feelings rather than their physical needs ,however, the book is not filled with \\"detailed steamy scenes\\"as some other reviewers stated .this is a romantic love story that goes beyond time."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great, great book","review":"It's not often you find a book like this- original, a plot that pulls you in and won't let you go, great characters...I had a brief fear when I picked it up that it might turn out to be \\"chick lit\\"... but a book that mixes time travel and its ethics with observations on life as well as a great love story truly has something for everyone.Pick it up- it's head and shoulders above most of the disposable books sitting on bookstore shelves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Inventive is the best word I have heard used for this book. Audrey Niffenegger needs to go to the head of the class. The story is fresh and never lags,even though it is a long read. It's a story that can be read and enjoyed more than once. I am usually a paperback buyer, but this book is a hardback that I don't regret for a moment shelling out the big bucks for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrifyingly Empty of Love","review":"If the author intended this to be a love story then this is a one star book. This is not a love story; it is a story of destitution. Henry and Claire seek each other, not with the desire to give (as authentic love does), but in a voracious attempt to fill themselves. The word choice and images in the book are ones of emptiness and consumption and not a fullness of love eager to give. Even after a life of \\"love\\" together, Henry is a naked man in a cage with nothing to give. Clare, after Henry's death, continues to shows her continuing emptiness by using her friend's husband as a new partner with whom to grope for filling. This book is really \\"A Treatise on Longing\\" but not on love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous","review":"This is the first time I have written a review for a book, because this book is the first and only in all my reading years (over 50..) that I started reading again the moment I finished it.I am not good at words, so I leave the rest to more capable readers..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is there no Kindle Edition>>>> D:","review":"Where is the Kindle Edition for this book? I've searched in the Kindle Dept and there is no trace of THe Time Traveller's Wife for Kindle!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"This was very, very different. I love time travel and this was definitely unique. Took awhile to get used to the bouncing around the various years and ages, but overall, I highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"fabulous!","review":"Great book, unlike anything I've ever read. The author took a familiar topic, love, and wrote about it in a way that kept the reader interested and excited. I began reading this book thinking I would hate it, as I assumed it would be science-fiction, but I was very pleasantly surprised and could not put it down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Story","review":"I don't usually read these types of books. But I'm glad that Amazon recommended it. Really good story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful, excellently-written love story","review":"Wow. Forget the themes, motifs, symbolism, etc. What I love is a great story. This one just barely manages to avoid being too sweet, thus instead becoming a powerful, heart-wrenching love story. The characters came to life so strongly that, even though they all know how the story will end because it has been foreordained, I kept hoping desperately with them for a miracle. Again, wow. If this is Niffenegger's first book, I can't wait to read her second. Make sure you don't have to be at work early, in case you end up staying up all night to finish the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"a weird book with lots of typos.","review":"This was a strange book...frankly, there were so many typos that I lost concentration. It wastotally surprising considering the author teaches writing...she came to speak to our bookclub and I asked her how the book got into print after it left her hands. I don't think sheunderstood what I was diplomatically trying to unravel-- how she let this book get into printwith so many errors. Well, she laughed and said that it had been optioned for a movie with BradPitt and that she hesitated to contract it for a movie but in the end money talked. Dreadfulbook--total waste of time!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed I read the whole book","review":"The characters aren't likeable. Even with subtitles the story line is inconsistent. Easily top 5 worst books I have ever read. Save your money and buy anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, Horrible, Horrible!!!!!","review":"After reading the reviews and seeing movie clips I was very excited to read this book. I wish I could time travel back and never open this book. It is weird, depressing, scattered plot (not just the back and forth time travel)no character development, I could go on and on. I can't believe so many people like this book. There were so many holes in the story too, not sure what the point of the whole book was, a love story...too creepy for that. Mad at myself for following the hype on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too explicit and too much bad language","review":"The story is gripping and visceral, but I was made very uncomfortable by the explicit sex scenes (anatomically correct in every detail) and the multitude of f-words. I would not recommend reading this book if you are sensitive to those things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow","review":"Shallow and confusing. Waste of my time. It is just a narration of the common life of two people, the one happens to be a time-traveller."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing & boring","review":"After looking forward to this book, I was very disappointed, I found it confusing at times with the age change every time the main character traveled, there wasn't an interesting story, only going back and forth in Chicago in a 40yr.time span, sometimes for only a few hours. I am afraid after reading Diana Gabaldon, Outlander novels,I have been spoiled,as her time travel novels are the best.I.M.J."},{"rating":"1","title":"I may have been jinxed...","review":"After everyone I spoke to regarding this book absolutely extolling it for its wonderful qualities, I must say that I found this book quite lacking. It had such potential, and I was really expecting a good read, but as I got further into the story, my opinion of it subsequently decreased. I especially didn't like the end. You can check out my complete review here: [..]and read why exaclty I didn't like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrateed","review":"Although this book is receiving good reviews, I found it a disappointment. The plot,itself, is quite inventive. However, the format of narration is complicated and difficult to follow. The author does an excellent job developing the characters as the story progesses. However, the beginning of the story is confusing and difficult to grasp. Once you catch on to the author's style of writing, it is actually a good story. Not on the top of my list, but not on the bottom, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too weird to even finish","review":"Selected through my book club. Could barely get to page 100. Too weird for me and difficult to follow. What was the author on when she wrote this? It didn't seem to be so much about the ultimate love as it was about voyeurism, obsession and a severe psychiatric disorder. No thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned it to the library unfinished.","review":"Lost my interest around the middle. I kept reading in hopes it would get better and it never \\"did it\\" for me. Glad I did not pay for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Random?","review":"Great title, gifted writer, great concept - but somehow so depressing. Every time I read a chapter, I just felt wiped out afterwards. It had me in the beginning, but the page count could have been cut in half overall without losing any essentials. The plot was very creative in parts, but overall felt patternless. The ending didn't satisfy or make much sense - why did he visit her one last time at an old age? Was it symbolic (a resurrection of sorts), or a subconscious nod to the (admittedly tearjerking) end of \\"Forever Young?\\" A more logical ending would be him perpetually re-visiting her at age 18 when they got to have sex for the first time. (Not that I totally dug that scene, either - it lacked soul and beauty.)Maybe I'm just weary of the \\"intelligent people write dark books\\" box, but there seems to be something Emperor's New Clothes-ish about all the raves here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sci-fi/love story novel!","review":"The Time Traveler's Wife is an interesting conglomeration of science fiction and romance. It is an easy read for such a hefty book. I personally enjoyed the realistic portrayal of both Clare and Henry. They are both lovely characters who love each other despite the test of time and unusual circumstances. Clare, with her everlasting patience, and Henry despite his brooding troubles, with his loyalty to his one and only.The time traveling portion of the novel is hard to follow at first, but comes together beautifully because the author is able to intricately weave together the threads that seem loose at first. This is a clever story and will move you ultimately, to tears. I enjoyed it because I was able to see Clare and Henry's love, their love that was timeless. I highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I have a new favorite book!","review":"Despite the holes in the plot that my logical mind found, and the fact that it does take a few pages to get used to the costantly changing age of Henry it's a great book!Like I said, it did take me a while to get the chronology straight. However, once you have it set, the book becomes bittersweet and moving.I loved every minute of it.I can't wait for the movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quantum Leap","review":"This is an excellent book. At first, the story reminded me a bit of the tv series Quantum Leap, except Henry is not out to solve problems/mysteries...he is just trying to survive. The love story is great and real. Henry and Claire are disappointed in each other sometimes, as all married people are, but still, and always, they love each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"difficult to get into....but....","review":"After you understood the flow of Ms Nifenegger's writing, it was almost addictive. However, in reading this book, I found it sad and more than a little disturbing. To me it had a sense of a purposeless life where people were travering time to find and keep that one final love in that life. With no real conclusion or closure. They just keep moving thru the same life. I think a story on finding loves in reincarned lives would be better. GM 2:11am 03-07-04"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful love story!","review":"Really a great book- even though some people have ragged on this- I really enjoyed this book. Wouldn't it be great to meet up with yourself at different ages and times of your life....and maybe make things change. The story was very original and a real delight. I have reccommended this book to many people, and if you are looking for a book to cozy up with someone on a rainy day in front of fireplace- this would be it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"two stars for effort","review":"This is not an easy story to develop and pull off so I think the author deserves 2 stars for effort. I was anxious for the book to end and do not recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a beautiful book","review":"I enjoyed this book tremendously. I laughed out loud, I cryed out loud. I cannot get other the fact that this is the author's first novel. It is beautifully written, a love story for all times."},{"rating":"1","title":"over-rated","review":"This book was an interesting concept, but little more than a trashy romance novel when it really came down to it. The idea of time travel was interesting, but the relationship between the two main characters dragged on and on. I kept reading the book just so I could be done with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"So glad I didn't miss this","review":"Out of the corner of my eye, in the bookstore, I caught the two magic words: Time Traveler. To me, that equals must-read. I find myself trying to find what theories the author uses to make the concept acceptable. I want to know how.(Turns out, our traveler here is \\"chronologically challenged\\"...like a disease or mutation in his genetic code that he desperately wishes didn't exist.)I came away from this with SO much more than that concept. It's a tremendous romance, upheld with adventure and danger. Emotional without being what I call \\"women's magazine sappy\\", the intrigue remained and never seemed to wear thin.Don't forget the kleenex."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Highly Recommend This Book","review":"I just finished reading this last night. It was recommended to me by a co-worker and I was glad that I took her up on it and read this. If you are like me and you are a hopeless romantic, this is one for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it","review":"I seldom take a book back to the library before finishing it, but I only got about 1/4 of the way through this one. What a disappointment! The time travel concept was fine, but what I couldn't deal with was how Henry was able to occupy time simultaneously with himself, as when an older Henry goes back and helps himself at age 5. I also have some issues, as have many other reviewers, with the interactions between the older Henry and the child Claire, which are a little creepy. But what really made me close the book was the account of how teenager Henry has sex with himself in his bedroom. I'm not a prude, but ugh! Why was this necessary!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So Disappointed","review":"I picked this book up to read for my vacation. The movie version was coming out the same week. I started reading it, and for the first time... I had a hard time getting through a book. I found the characters difficult to like. I decided to continue reading and not give up on it. When I finished the book, I feld cheated by the time I wasted reading it. Many parts in the book were disturbing. I found myself wondering why people thought this was a romance. There is very little romantic love happening in this story. As I have admitted my loathing of this book to other women, I have been pleasantly surprised to find out that many others feel the same. However, this book is so revered by so many that people are afraid to bash it. I think if you want a romantic story, go elsewhere. I have no desire to even see this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I've read in a long time","review":"I loved that this was not a straight love story - that I came away thinking, did they really love each other? or did Henry just manipulate her into loving him and she is simply a weak charachter that was with him because he told her that that was her future. This book kept me thinking about the finer points for some time after and made a nice change from the norm. Relationships in books are usually far too straight forward, so it was nice to see a degree of uncertainty about this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting read!","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Kind of confusing, but it was fun to figure everything out. Foreshadowing was excellent. Henry <3 Clare"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I'm surprised that there are any negative reviews of this book. I loved it! Yes Henry and Clare are intelligent, artsy types who go around quoting foreign poets and philosophers but it's a fiction book, it's not based on real people. Never once did I find the dialogue forced, it flowed wonderfully. The reviewers who take issue with Henry reciting German poetry didn't take issue with him being a time traveler?Anyway, don't let the bad reviews keep you from reading this book. I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would Give It 500 out of 5 stars if I could!","review":"I am in love with this book. I felt like something was missing from my life for a few days when it was over."},{"rating":"1","title":"huh......?","review":"I have no idea why folks are gushing over this book! Why all the hype over this drivel?I personally adore reading anything that has a time travel story line in it, but this story was total garbage. I will admit that the first couple chapters had me intrigued but it never......well...that's just it. It never amounted to anything. The backbone of the story could have been fantastic. This book was anything BUT. Such a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"You will fall in love with this book!","review":"I am usually very critical on books. But this book is such as exemption!!! Very well written, it will make you fall in love with the characters.It is that type of book that will \\"hunt\\" you for a long time. You know what I am talking about, don't you? While reading it, it will be hard for you to think about anything else. After reading it, you will wish that all your friends would read it too, so you can talk about the book...This is the story of a man who has a desease that makes him travel in time, like the title suggests. Throughout his life he meets people, makes friends, gets married... But not exactly within the pre-established order that a normal life follows. His curse is the lack of control he has.Even with this lack of control, he lives a passionate life, taking with him the lives of people who loved him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-important Rubbish","review":"If I'm going to be manipulated by a novel, I at least prefer not to be aware of it. \\"The Time Traveler's Wife\\" is too content to show the reader the strings - one is always too aware of the effort that went behind it. The effort to make Henry \\"cool\\" - half the time, he just lists lyrics or bands that he listens to, or quotes obscure poetry. The effort to make witty repartee between all the main (read: to be liked) characters.And yet, no effort at all went into making the reader believe in the central relationship. We never see the two falling in love - we are just meant to take it for granted that they ARE in love. That's a dangerous thing to do with a romantic novel.I also strongly object to the way Clare narrates. I hate narrations that eschew punctuation like commas for really no reason at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressive-sadistic","review":"The book is incredibly depressive, culminating in a series of chapters that I can only describe as sadistic. A very good original idea of involuntary time-travel kept me reading until the end, because I'm a science finction fan, but it is rather a book about clinical depression, drugs, suicide, torture, and death. Oh, and references to drugs and painkillers look more like advertisement. The story line goes from bad to worse.I could not sleep well after finishing the book. Now I deeply regret that I read it. Horrible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"This book is probably one of the most interesting books I've ever read. It was way easier to understand than I thought it was going to be, as it flips back and forth through time and that can get tricky. Soon after I started I just couldn't put it down. I passed it along to my mom and she can't put it down, either. I recommend this book to just about anyone who thinks they would like this type of novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Terrific Journey through Time, Love and Intimacy.","review":"Henry De Tamble has a little problem. He has a peculiar penchant for disappearing and reappearing in different times. Part science fiction, part fantasy, part love story, THE TIME TRAVELER'S WIFE WORKS surprisingly well in all three areas.The author weaves a tale of impossible time travel into a classic love story showing that love, grace and intimacy transcend the boundaries of mere time and place. While suspension of belief in the temporal and physical laws is required, one is quickly lost in a masterfully descriptive novel which, ironically, possesses a most timeless quality.The idea of time travel is certainly not new in literature (not to mention in television and movies), yet the author manages to make the story fresh and new. It is a tale that delights, taking the reader to another dimension as universal issues and themes are explored with poise and sensitivity."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book ever","review":"I am an avid reader and have recently gotten into the love story genre. This is the best book I have ever read. Once I started reading this book I could not stop. It was a true addiction for me. I wanted to stay home from work, not eat or sleep, until I finished this book. I would recommend this book to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The honeymoon is over... before it's even begun.","review":"Easy and enjoyable to read and the author did a laudable job of structuring what might have been a very confusing story. Even though the characters were completely banal and unengaging I wanted to know what happened to them. Soon I realised that I could not enjoy this book as the sweet and quirky romance it had been marketed as. I could only enjoy it as a macabre examination of intimate relationships, seasoned by the horror of inevitible decline. The ending, right down to the last paragraph, is particarly ghastly. I am completely undecided as to whether A. Niffenegger is cheap writer with the convenient ability to pull heartstrings or a good storyteller with the ability to expose the dark void at the core of the American Dream."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a BORE!","review":"After reading reviews and hearing people swear up and down that this was a good read I gave in. Unfortunately this book was so boring It took me two weeks to force myself to the end. The characters are bland and their romance is unconvincing, I wouldn't even call it a romance, honestly I found nothing romantic about these two. BORING!!! Plain and simple!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An unsatisfying read","review":"I liked the premise of the book but the lack of character virve and the \\"so, what happened?\\" ending make this novel a definite El Passo! If you want satisfying, intelligent time travel (of sorts) read Robbins' JITTERBUG PERFUME instead. Now that's a 5 Star winner!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"The author took an original and interesting idea and failed to execute it properly. It really drags on in several parts, which is surprising considering the abundance of story lines and the fact that the non-linear time line forcibly ads an element of mystery to your reading. I was not touched by the romantic storyline between the two main characters because it was so shoddily developed. I'd classify this book as Chick Lit for the reader who is in denial about liking Chick Lit. Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thoroughly disappointed...","review":"I had very high hopes for this novel. I saw the previews for the movie on TV and wanted to read the book first. I finished the book last week, and I thought it was poorly written. There was no character development in the book at all. There was lack of emotion...I never could figure out what it was that Clare saw in Henry or vice versa. I thought that the book was exceedingly disgusting, especially the part about Clare fantasizing about Henry after he is dead when Gomez is making a pass at her...I'm not going into further detail there because it is utterly disgusting. I thought that the author took something beautiful, which is making love, and made it look trashy and disgusting in this stupid book. Again, I was very disappointed and I will not be reading anything from this author ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird, bizarre and frustrating","review":"The idea of someone who travels between past and present is interesting, if not totally original and I give the author credit for tackling this kind of story. The problem I have, however, is that many of the scenes are just plain weird. Some examples - Henry's nakedness, two adolescent Henrys alone together, a forty-something Henry with eighteen-year-old Clare. And there are many more.Niffenegger clearly spent a lot of time coordinating the dates of Henry's appearances and she plants the hints of the story's end in appropriate places. But the jumping around is too frequent and varied and just plain awkward. To help the reader, Niffenegger supplies an unending supply of references of Chicago, music, stock market activity, pop culture, etc. I get the feeling she Googled every decade from 1960 to present and crammed in all the results.The story is a fast, casual read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected....Too much raunch","review":"I expected this to be a nice sappy clean love story but including things like Henry's 15 yro fling with himself was a bit much for me. If you can stomach that sort of thing, go for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been a charming love story","review":"This could have been a charming love story. Great potential. However, as it stands right now it does not offer a reader anything except an easy read on an airplane where you have plenty of time to kill and no place to go. I do not want to repeat what has already been said by other readers in terms of analysis. Highly recommend a review by Amal Jacobson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating premise","review":"As with all books that deal with time travel, the premise is so rich with possibilities, that if done correctly, the result can be fascinating. This book was well written and very interesting, but not quite deserving of a fifth star. I'm glad I read it as it was very thought provoking. Reminded me somewhat of Nicholas Baker's Fermata, one of my all time favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than I expected...","review":"This book surprised me, and that was more than I hoped for. I generally don't go for popular \\"Oprah Club\\" style literature, but the characters in this book were so vivid, loveable, and heartwarming that I could not put the book down. This book doesn't fit any category, it's not a cheesy romance, not really a science fiction, not a mystery. It's a unique story about two people who go through so much together over a lifetime. It's well worth reading at least once...and you might find yourself reading it again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinary","review":"This is a book that will wrap itself around your heart once you are established in the rhythm of \\"time travel.\\" I originally rejected it because of the sci-fi angle, but realized once I had begun reading it, that the time travel is a necessary adjunct to the love story of two exceptional people. The intensity and depth of their feelings for each other would not, I believe, have been there without the concept. Audrey Niffenegger is a consummate writer who succeeds in combining two or three disparate themes in one truly outstanding novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Traveler's Wife","review":"Awesome book! I was a bit confused at first; however, I eventually got caught up to pace and enjoyed every encounter. Although Henry is the one with the \\"disease,\\" the story is told from his wife's persceptive. It was interesting to see how their love bloomed and the troubles they encountered.I recommend to this book to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"very boring","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. It is filled with stereotypical suffering females while offering no resoultion to the wife's true agony of loving a man with flaws. The ends nowhere. I expect to see this on Lifetime telveion or a movie. There is no character development at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"The movie promos looked good so I decided to read the book first. I could not get through this. I got half way through and finally gave up. There is NO plot. Nothing happens. Characters come and go with no real purpose. I feel i wasted a week trying to plough through this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure garbage","review":"I tried to read this book and felt it was pure garbage. I read alot of books and have read alot of books in my lifetime. This is not at all good literature. It reads more like porn and I do not read porn. I tore the book up and discarded it in the trash. Shock values do not set well with me. I do not recommend this to anyone. If you like trash reading then buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like reading an internet chat room","review":"I confess -- I bought this book for the intriguing title and well written first page.NOT FOR ME. It's all written in first person from the point of view of both characters (which kills any suspense), and you have to wade through it to find anything resembling a plot. You would have to pay me to wade through the whole thing.It reads exactly like an internet chat room -- on and on and on about what?Give me a book with a plot and some suspense anyday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Reader","review":"This was a pleasant enough read, but certainly not serious literature and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. It was so repetitive and silly and, in the end, overly sentimental. I was really looking forward to getting into this book, or at least being entertained by a novel idea, but all I got was a very long Danielle Steele type piece of fiction. It's a shame because the author obviously had an interesting idea, but she had no plot ... and without plot, you've just got a really long dialogue.By the way, if you are choosing books for The Today Show, you should really start looking around for a new job. Your choice of literary material stinks. There HAS to be better work out there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Drivel, Unfortunately","review":"I finish books. I have read plenty of poorly written books simply because I feel like I have a moral obligation to the author not to give up on them too early. I have read just over 100 pages of The Time Traveler's Wife, and I just don't think that I can finish it. The characters are flat, the dialog is unrealistic, and the plot is confusing. A true pity. The idea of the plot is innovative and fascinating - I kept wishing that it was in the hands of a more talented writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slightly below average","review":"I was disappointed after reading this book. While it did keep my attention, I was unmoved by the love story. The method of story telling was unique, but ineffective in the end. In addition, I found that the use of vulgar language was totally unneccessary - not a book for children of any age."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Pointless rubbish. Worse than Nicholas Sparks. Don't waste your time or money. Besides, not available as an eBook due to the small minded author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time!","review":"This is a terrible book!

I hated the insipid characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Time Travelers Wife","review":"Would never order from this person again I put my order in on the 19 Of October she did not send until the 1st of November Horrible customer service"},{"rating":"1","title":"nice try","review":"Nothing new and exciting happened in this book. I couldn't get into it. I read 3/4 of the book just to give it a chance but i just couldn't finish it. it didnt keep my attention at all. total waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking Emotional Depth","review":"I watched the movie first, and I loved it. I cried at the end. Most books are WAY better than the movie, so I picked up the book at the library and was prepared to feast on the story. I was hugely disappointed. The story lacks emotion. I couldn't feel for either character at all, because there is no emotion told at all. There was simply no depth to this book at all. It's merely a telling of events and that's about as exciting as it gets. In addition, the author uses terms to describe the sexual acts that are crude and vulgar and very clearly meant for shock value as none of the characters talks this way at ANY other time except when referencing sex. Sex between the characters is mostly only referenced, using the 'f' word. Again, crude and vulgar references.I'm very disappointed in this book. See the movie. It does this story better justice than the author of the book does."},{"rating":"2","title":"SURE TO BECOME A CLASSIC!!! From author of EXPLOSION IN PARIS...","review":"I'm not really into far out, unrealistic, science fiction books, BUT......the reviews, the hype, and now a movie aroused my curiosity and, as a writer myself, I HAD TO ORDER AND READ IT! I was bowled over and competely fascinated by the lovely storyline and the Henry and Clare love story! This was so cleverly done and should have been more confusing, but somehow, it wasn't. This novel is beautifully written, enchanting, unforgettable, and sure to become a classic!! I thoroughly enjoyed it!!! TERRIFIC JOB, AUDREY!! I'm in AWE!...From Linda masemore pirrung, author of EXPLOSION IN PARIS....."},{"rating":"1","title":"This poor, poor book","review":"This poor, poor book is dying to be a movie. It's just struggling to exist as a novel on a bookshelf when it has been deformed by a few significant major-motion-picture-style characteristics. First, the text is littered with trivial detail. Second, there is an abundance of dialogue. (These two combined make some pages read like parts of a script, stage directions and lines.) Third, the graphic sex. Fourth, the lack of a single defining plot point. The premise of the book is extremely clever, diligently crafted abd explained and well-held, but the horrifically expository writing (think the first fifteen pages of any Baby Sitter's Club novel) distracts from the central ideas and questions the book should raise. Not to mention that Niffenegger's theme of comparing her two characters to Odysseus and Penelope is presumptuous and downright cocky!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very flat and repetitive","review":"I read Time Traveler's Wife for my book club. We all agreed that the characters were poorly developed, there were numerous unexplained inconsistencies, and so many potentially really good scenarios were dropped. I think if the author had whittled it down to a short story, it could have been excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite as shite","review":"Niffenegger is a broken woman. Some man, somewhere, broke her heart and so, as artists are apt to do, she used that pain to create this novel. Unfortunately, she used it to create Henry, an idealistically perfect and laughably implausible man. He's witty and devoted and handsome and says the perfectly scripted things at the perfectly scripted time, and he cleans up well and is well-read. Oh, but he is an alcoholic, which, strangely, hardly seems to be a problem for anyone. Garbage.He has no depth; his love, Clare, has no depth. They sit in their home with their angsty time-travelling problem, being hip and so beautiful, and nobody ever says anything REAL. I felt like I was watching Dawson's Creek. I'm sure Niffenegger is a lovely woman, and I'm sad that she was slighted somehow, but she is a poor, poor writer. This book is trite. Not one character rings true. Not one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing and pretentious","review":"I finished it, so it gets 2 stars, not one. However, it's jumpy, hard to follow, and kind of boring at times. It doesn't take long for me to get pissed off at the constant whining of Clare. Poor, poor girl - born rich, live rich, basically farting around all day being \\"artsy\\" and naval gazing. Bleh. And why are all their friends their friends? What on earth do these people have in common??Henry is kind of interesting, in that he has to make his way through whatever situation he's in.The chapters about baby making were worrisome. Don't they get a little freaked out by the multiple miscarriages? Or the idea that fetuses might be time traveling outside the womb? FREAKY.By the end I was depressed and annoyed with everyone in the story except Alba, who is just a victim of everyone else's selfishness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh please","review":"Go to Einstien's Theory of Relativity. It's just better thought out and easier to understand. Time travelers cant change events says the author. So how did he win the lottery???? Oh please. Dumb book."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT WORK","review":"Got the book very fast. Great condition!!!! Check out seller Hirsch Books for similar great service!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Bad","review":"I just knew this book would intrigue me. The write-up on the back cover drew my interest, and the first page promised I'd get into the story.However, it never delivered. Even though this book had received good reviews, I could not find what they were based upon.About halfway through, I laid the book down and never went back to it. A shame.Rent it from the library or borrow it from a friend if you are intrested. I wouldn't purchase it.It's a boring, plodding-along tale. Nothing of consequence happens to keep the reader turning the pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"??????","review":"Could not finish the book. It was recommended by several people, but I didn't find the concept that interesting. The writing style never could capture my attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"COMPELLING","review":"great reading material found within this one. very engrossing.well worth the hardback price!quite good!( I am not a writer so my review wont do it justice. buy it. youll like it)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow","review":"I knew they had made this into a movie and so I was curious and decided to read the book. It was a little disappointing, very slow in my opinion. Other then the fact that he can time travel not a lot happens in the book. Overall, though it is a sweet story."},{"rating":"2","title":"4.5 Stars","review":"I never wanted it to end! Great story, loved the way the author helped me keep track of what time I was reading about. Wish she'd do a sequel...but of course she can't do it about Henry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time Travel that actually made sense","review":"I have tried to read books about this subject before or books that aren't in chronological order and I usually end up confused and frustrated. But not this time. This book is so well written that even though it goes back and forth in time, it makes perfect sense. It was touching and lovely. I laughed and cried. I still cry a year later when recalling some of it's events. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meh...","review":"It is a strange yet interesting novel. It draws you in from the very beginning so that you won't want to put the book down until everything unfolds. At the beginning I really enjoyed the book and how the story was progressing. But after Clare turns 20, the story seemed to be missing something. I can't quite put my finger on it but something was bugging me- maybe it was the f- words.I do feel that the novel could have been more enjoyable if the writing had not been so bawdy.The story is compelling, interesting, and even sad. I admit, I cried at the end. Henry and Clare's story is unlike anything I have read before.Overall, the story made me read til late into the night and that's a good thing. I loved bits of it and hated others."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book!!!","review":"As I said, I LOVED this book! The plot is a really quite original and I stayed completely immersed throughout the book. I loved watching the characters change as their situations change and as time goes by. I am really disappointed that the author hasn't written any other books that are as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suprisingly Simple in its complexity","review":"My book group selected this book. I didn't really know much about it going in.I was quickly impressed by the way the author was able to take such a complicated plotline with characters interacting with each other at different ages throughout their lives and make it easy to follow.It was a really different take on time travel than I had ever read before---not a scifi \\"go back and fix history\\" book, not about paradoxes and alternate universes--and I enjoyed the fresh view of the idea. This vision of time travel is much more believable to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant and engaging","review":"This is a lovely and captivating story. It took me a bit to get use to the bouncing around in time. But once I got use to the author's style, I was hooked. Pay attention to the dates at the beginning of chapters right from the start. Due to the bouncing around in time, the story really comes together in the end like a mystery novel. If you like a good romance (not the cheesy kind, but the \\"real\\", powerful type) and a cleaver mystery, I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast, Fun Read","review":"An interesting twist in fiction. The timeline of the book jumps back and forth as the main male character travels in time against his will. Fascinating concept."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Time Traveler","review":"In short, the novel was 200 pages too long. It was full of repetitive scenes.By the end, I didn't care for either character. I just wanted to see the end of the novel. I wanted to be shown more of what happened to Henry in his time travels. We \\"hear\\" he has been beaten and even raped, but that remains for the imagination to solve since Niffenegger decides to omit those parts and castigates us with endless scenes of Henry showing up all over the place shivering and naked."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you unravel it...","review":"If you took the events and played them out in linear time, it's a pretty dull story. Which means, the time traveling was just a gimmick. As such, it was entertaining once, but won't stick with you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read for a romance","review":"This was such a great romance story! The love between these two is amazing! I was a bit confused by the time jumping around, but doesn't distract from the story too much. If you think about the time travel too much, then it can distract the story. Like if Henry never traveled back to be with Claire, how would Claire have met him? Things like that..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Novel","review":"I was a bit skeptical about this novel because of the hype around it, but I was happily proven wrong! This is a fantastic book, it is a thriller and romance in one. It is a bit mushy though, so I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who doesn't enjoy a good romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Touching","review":"This is a beautiful book----I just finished it five minutes ago and I am still teary-eyed! The plot is interesting, the character development is good---there were times that I felt it was not the \\"greatest\\" book but those moments were few and far between (and they mostly had to do with all the name dropping of punk bands...as if the author was trying to show off her musical expertise...it was distracting). BUT I was sucked in and could not put it down. A very nice love story--sprinkled with sci-fi and not too sappy! Great ending. Sniff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! 500 pages never seemed so short!","review":"This book just flew by! It's rare for me to find a book that I just can't put down, even after I've finished it! I'm so reluctant to give up the story and the intimate connection with Henry and Clare that I don't think I'll be able to start another novel for a few days. Let's see, where's that Reader's Digest?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Henry will travel through time for a long time in my mind","review":"This is one of those \\"chunky\\" books you look at and think, \\"when I have the time...\\" Fortunately for me, I found the time. I review many new debut novels for a large newspaper and read a lot of rehashed ideas. This book is fresh and I cared about it from page 1 to the very last. I cared about the characters, I found the plot not just satisying, but intriguing and interesting. At about page 400, I wished it was double in \\"chunk\\", because I didn't want it to end. The Today Show apparently brought the book to the forefront, now YOU keep it there. The book and Ms. Niffenegger deserves time in the limelight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic ending","review":"I will agree that the bulk of this novel was an engrossing page turner, however the ending was pathetic. Clare seemed like a strong character and then she just lost her backbone. Niffenegger handled the time shifts reasonably well, though she never does adequately explain the final tragedy. I found Henry's attraction to Clare as a teenager, and vice versa, to be a bit creepy. I also don't understand how this guy could keep a job when he's always disappearing, leaving behind his clothing and reappearing naked. If you are an observant reader, the obvious flaws will bother you."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Time-Travel Romance Works Like a Charm","review":"This is a book that reeled me in with promises of a love story told through multiple points of view, as well as multiple time-streams. In those areas, the books excels greatly. However, it's more prominent asset is the love story between Henry and Claire. Their journey through time is a unique one, and it is filled with questions from the get-go.Why does Henry time-travel, and can he learn to control it?How does Henry's time-traveling affect Claire, his true love?How can a relationship so odd as theirs survive the sudden surprises?All are answered here, and I was happy to be along for their ride.If you like an honest love-story and not a Harlequin romance, then this book is for you. Throw in a little sci-fi, and you have one of the most unique stories of the past five years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"The manufacturer says this is for \\"beginners of all ages\\" but the case says \\"ages 7 and up.\\" It is definitely not for total beginners.

This was a required text for a first-year graduate seminar on \\"History and Theory of Geography\\". This book gives a biographical sketch of numerous recent luminaires in Geography. The book is easy to read because it's broken down into nice nuggets of information about a specific Geographer and makes mention of how their work relates to other Geographers also in the book. Granted, it's not comprehensive, but it does give a good foundation in the theories behind modern Geography.If you are into Geography (with a capital-G) and not just geography, buy this book. Even if you don't read it right away, it'll find a comfortable spot on your bookshelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Worth The Read","review":"I must admit that I am a fan of Michael Phillips, which I became after reading the first book in this series.

Now, that is a great camera also and the glass in those days was wonderful.

It's the artist that matters, not the genre. To say that this album lacks soul is ridiculous. Everything Tony sings or plays bears the mark of an artist unequaled. To try and equate Mr. Rice's artistry with Kenny G and selling out is pure rubbish. Rice has the courage to tackle the material he loves and he succeeds beautifully.

The country rock of the Eagles and producer/writer John David Souther remains the idiom, but Ronstadt has the voice, style and background to deliver this commercialized roots music with little loss of authenticity. Unlike Bonnie Raitt or Janis, she is relatively free of blues or R&B influence. In another singer this might seem a liability, but it allows Rondstadt unusually direct access to the emotional wellsprings of the country and folk which defined post-sixties rock music. Whether on the Eagles' own \\"Desperado,\\" the country warhorse \\"Silver Threads And Golden Needles\\" or Neil Young's \\"I Believe In You,\\" Rondstadt's powerful contralto emerges as a representative voice of a musical generation just coming of age."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of her best","review":"I think this is one of her best albums of all time.

This Album is one of my favorite, and was produced in the great year of 1981!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Album Invented All Post-Rock Music...","review":"In 81, when I was 15, I bought Computerworld. Instantly, I was seduced by the band's aesthetic. And others were two. This is the album that Bambaataa sampled, that helped birth electro, hip-hop, house and all the other post-rock genres.But why is it so affecting? Partly it's the brilliance of the *sounds.* Sounds I'd never heard anywhere before juxtaposed with found Speak & Spell voices and Casio VL Tone presets (also used on the Human League's 'Dare'). The lyrics are also classic Kraftwerk. Spare, direct and almost hysterical with softness, they are the antithesis of the commodified ROCK swagger of macho lies. Computer Love is the most beautiful love song ever, even if it's only indirectly about humans.In 1998, this album still sounds fresh and inspiring where electronic music from last year sounds stale and hollow. Only Kraftwerk could ever do that. And this is their finest work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfekt musik","review":"Kraftwerk are the musical equivalent of BMW and Mercedes-Benz.Pure perfection in sound, rhythm and harmony.Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The blueprint for the sound of the 21st Century","review":"If you don't own a copy of Computer World, your CD collection has a gaping hole in it. Computer World is the blueprint for the sound of the 21st century. When you hear fantastic futuristic electronic sounds on TV commercials, Movies, and even top 40 hits by Gwen Stefani + Justin Timberlake, you're hearing Computer World. If you enjoy modern electronic pop bands like Goldfrapp, Freezepop, PLiD, Komputer, Hyperbubble, Ladytron, Miss Kittin, Madonna, or just about any modern dance music, it's time you hear the sound in it's purest form. So program your home computer to beam yourself into the past, and hear what today sounds like."},{"rating":"2","title":"another classic","review":"This is my second favourite Kraftwerk album, only slightly marred by the faddish subject matter. The electronics are thrilling and the beats infectious. This can be seen as Kraftwerk's first \\"dance\\" album ( sure, the Man Machine had a few dance-ish beats, but they weren't this good )Every track here is a winner. I especially like \\"Numbers\\" and \\"It's More Fun to Compute.\\" Highly recommended for fans of early eighties experimental synth pop ."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have classic.","review":"The first of Kraftwerk's many extended periods of silence was broken with the release of Computer World, a record exploring the ramifications of living in a society dominated by technology. A tightly honed, starkly minimalist effort, its implementation of recent technological advances yields a brighter and sharper sound than ever before; the single \\"Pocket Calculator\\" typifies the group at their most playful, while \\"Home Computer\\" eerily presages the emergence of techno and house music later in the decade."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have bigger ears now than I did in 1981!","review":"This is my only Kraftwerk CD. I bought it only recently; I had NO interest in \\"Krautrock\\" when they were active. My motivation to buy this CD in particular was that I read where Neil Young was listening to it around the time of recording \\"Trans\\". Well, I can guarantee that's not a lie because he has rewritten 'Computer World..2' as 'Computer Age'! I can see a thread from 'Numbers' through Afrika Bambaata to Arthur Baker's work with New Order on 'Confusion' and beyond into rap, hip hop and other variants so it has convinced me that Kraftwerk have been VERY influential. The copy I have is a recent UK EMI reissue and the sound is great. There are no bonus tracks so it's quite short - but it's very, very good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING","review":"I just love it, especially the fifth track: Computer love, it's something like an airplane trip, the first three minutes are like you are looking for the best runway to take-off, and the last four minutes are like the moving fly itself. One advice: close your eyes while you're listening and you'll see what i'm talking about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crank It Up!","review":"If you have never heard New Orleans \\"Indian\\" music before, prepare yourself for an energetic blast from your speakers: this CD starts off with a yelp and the energy level takes off from there. With support from New Orleans musical luminaries such as Dr. John and Cyril Neville, Chief Bo Dollis and the Wild Magnolias simply tear the joint up, and the sound is dynamic and full, with plenty of midbass energy to give your woofers a workout. If you can't make it down to New Orleans for Fat Tuesday, crank this CD up and you'll be close, awfully close to the real thing--any old time of the year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wild Mags","review":"These guys are the real deal check em out yeah you right life is a carnival get it live it love it"},{"rating":"2","title":"So simple and yet challenging, educational and FUN!","review":"I am a first grade teacher, and I am crazy about this game.

I would so much rather see them playing with these than with the video games and they like these as well or better!

I love almost everything that Ben has ever written, but I don't like \\"With my own two hands\\" and \\"Sexual Healing\\" is not on my top 20 songs of his. Now remember, I DID give 4. Trust all of our online reviews, \\"Amen Omen\\" could not have been recorded and performed better. At a point Ben holds a note and the band stops as Ben shows us how talented of a vocalist he is (it's BEAUTIFUL).

What I want to know is, who were the other contestants? James Booker's best album, and probably one of the most soulful and rhythmically exciting albums ever recorded in this genre. Booker was a musical originator, but also famous for his ability to impersonate a wide variety of players. He seems to borrow heavily from Ray Charles at points on this album, but in my opinion he actually surpasses Charles in certain respects. His singing on this album is both bizarre and tortured and soulful, he has a nasal style here that was de rigeur for funk groups such as The Commodores and Cameo. You know what I'm talking about. The whole album is just Booker and his pyrotechnical piano (check out the amazing crescendo on the last track,) and should serve as a reminder that you don't need a big band or fancy production to be funkier than the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly funky","review":"James Booker is a gem. This album features some of the most soulful, joyful piano playing and singing ever recorded in this genre. Booker's voice is deep and stirring and his piano is astonishingly free and funky.

Therefore, they wax poetic about launching Palm Emulators, etc, from the Palm OS Menu in Code Warrior...a feature not supported by Lite.

His voice lately has been just either shot or it's intentional. I like to see him sing Martha like he does here. His voice after this album became to me a show like a vagrant bar piano comedian performer but still great song writer.

In short their both right and wrong. Look at it this way...If your interested in getting a collection of well rounded (For the genera) Folk and Blues songs then this is the album for you...so is Looking for the Heart of Saturday Night.

These thoughtfully rendered songs come off as wistful and melancholy, and together this makes for fine listening. \\"Martha\\" is a touching song in particular, and for a man just beyond mid-life, I was moved by the regret so evident in Waits' voice. For that moment late at night, sitting at the computer and writing, no album can better this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Three","review":"This is one of my three most respected and loved albums. Tom Waits is ranked, in my opinion, as one of the three unsurpassed poet musicians of our time or the times before. 'Closing Time' was played for me every night while I remained in a coma from a motorcycle accident in October of 96.'Martha', for me, plays/pays a tribute to my first love. 'I Hope That I Don't Fall in Love With You' sings the song that represents the beginning of my present day relationship with my girlfriend and the second \\"new love of my life\\". 'Ice Cream Man' is a nice break in the potential seriousness of the album and 'Ol' sings, to me, the story of life.Tom Waits along with Bob Dylan and Jewel, have played a key roll in my recovery from what I hope is the most trying time in my life. 'Closing Time' is a must for those reaching a \\"cross-roads\\" in their life, or who just want to here a fabulous poet, singer, muscian.....etc... openly display his talents for all to hear.Love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Waits Minus the Hound Dog Growl","review":"This is, I believe, Tom Waits' first album, and it was the first one I picked up. I had heard him sing a song on the Dick Cavett (SP?) Show on Nick At Nite and fell in love with that raspy voice (I still haven't figured out which album that was from...). That rasp is nowhere to be found on this disc. But, what is here is Mr. Waits' keen sense of language and melody. He would be equally at home laying down piano on a Coltrane tribute as he would guesting on Willie Nelson track. The songs are beautiful. Tom Waits is the only person I know who can get away with not sticking to one genre or idiom because he makes them all so much his own.The innocence on this album is somewhat lost on later efforts due to the harshness his voice picked up over the years ...but his inner voice never changes."},{"rating":"2","title":"the essential tom waits cd","review":"by far his best recording. if you don't get chills after listening to \\"i hope that i don't fall in love with you,\\" then there is something wrong with you, my friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Duck and cover","review":"This album is one of them: one of those few albums that transcends the forms that make up it's substance and become TIMELESS.

The rhythem section is completely in sync with each other, it turely is like listening to a conversation between people. Lee Morgans playing is a little rough from what I've heard before, but no less powerful. Joe is at the top of his game in this album , spewing ideas through his horn almost effortlessly. And his sparse use of his Overtone throat slids gives a razor edge to this album. Bobby Hutcherson on the vibes gives this album such a great mood.

It's an ambitious, complicated record that alienated a good number of fans and began the precipitous decline in Mitchell's sales, popularity and respect. It's also a kind of graduation. Her skills are complete, and now she's free to synthesize everything she's learned into something no one else could create. Sonically, it's a decade ahead of its time, full of sampling and tape loops and ethnomusicology. Lyrically, Mitchell is looking outside herself in a new way, revealing a keen social critic. And it rocks, which wasn't often true of Joni Mitchell records in the past. I won't single out any tracks for special praise, because it works best all in one go, as a kind of journey. Aside from the groundbreaking music, the \\"Hissing\\" LP had maybe the best packaging of any album ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"The soundtrack to a different California...","review":"An album that bears many many listenings, without ever growing old or stale. The music itself is jazz-pop, and the lyrics are far better poetry than anything that comes between the covers of books these days. \\"Harry's house/Centerpiece\\" is perhaps the best song, a surreal, bluesy stroll through suburban ennui. In an image similar to that of David Lynch's opening to \\"Blue Velvet,\\" Mitchell's theme album-wide is how the hissing sound of sprinklers on California's green lawns masks the barbarity of \\"the Jungle Line\\" hiding beneath the surface. California is no longer the sunshiney, fun place that the Beach Boys sang about; Joni Mitchell sang about the transition before it became apparent. Joni Mitchell is one of the most influential jazz-pop artists of the 2nd half of the 20th century and this album is a central example of why."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless greatness","review":"Ever since it's release, this has been a favorite of mine.

I am not someone who would complain just because this album was a departure from her folkish ways; I admired all earlier phases of her work, and there was something bold and different on each LP. Merely, I find the lyric writing here overwrought and the music weak and forgettable. The only brilliant track is the radical yet tuneful \\"Jungle Line.\\" Obviously, there are many fans of this album, but I believe it's mostly appreciated on an intellectual level by people who can relate to the rather dismal stories on it. It's a bitter house of cards that randomly arranged music tries to hold together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joni's Best Work !","review":"The incredible roll Joni was on forever changed the singer / songwriter genre. Which also included Carol King, Cat Stevens, Paul Simon, Stevie Wonder and Bill Withers.But it was Joni that was pushing the envelope with Hissing of Summer Lawns. While her rabid fans were in love with this lady of the canyon, they turned on her in droves with this pop / folk / jazz masterpiece.When you listen to For The Roses, Court and Spark and Hissing, back to back, it's obvious that the Lambert, Hendricks & Ross jazz of her youth was rearing it's ugly head, for all of us who had a clue ( unlike the idiots at Rollingstone ), for us to embrace.If you aspire to be a great songwriter, listen to Sly & The Family Stone / Stand, John Lennon / Plastic Ono Band, StevieWonder / Music Of My Mind, Paul Simon / Paul Simon and Joni Mitchell / Hissing of Summer Lawns."},{"rating":"2","title":"True poetic triumph.","review":"Joni tells many different breath-taking tales on \\"The Hissing Of Summer Lawns\\" that leave one in awe at their beauty. Brilliant sonic landscapes are verbally painted on achingly gorgeous songs such as \\"Shades Of Scarlet Conquering\\", \\"Edith & the Kingpin\\", \\"Harry's House/Centerpiece\\" Etc. In my opinion it is Joni at the climax of her lyrical genious. Exquiste use of imagery & texture. On the amazing \\"Don't Interupt The Sorrow\\" she sings:\\"Don't interrupt the sorrowDarn rightIn flames our prophet witchesBe politeA room full of glassesHe says \\"Your notches, liberation doll\\"And he chains me with that serpentTo that Ethiopian wall.Anima risingQueen of QueensWash my guilt of EdenWash and balance meAnima risingUprising in me tonightShe's a vengeful little goddessWith an ancient crown to fight.\\"This is a truly brilliant & flawless record. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary good","review":"Interestingly, I'm a big Zappa fan, and Joni's music is pretty much as far removed from Frank's as you can get. But you know what? This CD just freaks me out. \\"Edith and the Kingpin\\" has to be one of the most moving songs ever written--I don't weep over many songs, but I do over this one, time after time.

This time around she muddles them in too much production, whereas on Miles they gain better power, clarity, and meaning through the stripped down renditions on solo acoustic guitar.

I really want to love it. There are a couple of nice arrangements on this album--\\"Graveyard Shift\\" by Anna Fermin & the Trigger Gospel and \\"Black Eye\\" by Jason Wilber are two of my favorites--but none of them come close to touching the originals.

Perhaps the highest achievement for a tribute album is to make you enjoy songs that weren't really among your favorites - this album did that for me, particularly Dolly Varden's soulful take on Steal the Crumbs. For Tupelo fans, this is a must. For the uninitiated, this would be a great companion to one of UT's albums - I'd recommend No Depression and Slate as good introductions to the band that most successfully married punk and country."},{"rating":"2","title":"tom waits is the best","review":"all his cd's i've ordered (too many) have come in good shape, music sounds good. love tom waits ...he says it all. my favorite poet in music. hope he lives forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some Humorous Waits","review":"This is a refreshing Tom Waits CD.

This is a disc that should please old and new Waits fans. He may have been drunk or maybe it was an act. Either way, it made for a great record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Piece of Art","review":"'Nighthawks at the Diner' is maybe the best description of Tom Waits as an artist. He simply invited some audience and presented them his new work - very brave and original way to record (his only 2nd) album. It just shows that Tom Waits like to experiment, later on he made few experimental rock albums (on some of them even Primus helped him). From the musical side we have bar jazz songs, that Tom uses for background for his poetry, just as he does it all the time until today. About his lyrics, I don't have too much to say - beatifull beat poetry, who likes Jack Keruac and Charles Bukowski, he'll like Tom Waits too. Through this album Tom Wait built his reputation of a skid row artist, that has big lfe expirience, has something to say and knows to do it in a great poetic way."},{"rating":"1","title":"tinny disappointment","review":"i heard waits in nightclubs in the '70s just as he was breaking out & this was always my fave LP of his. when i sold my vinyl recently, this was one of the 3 or so records i had to replace with digital, so i bought this CD. it's in good shape, so i'm glad to have it, but NIGHTHAWKS is a sloppy, intimate record that benefits from the warmth of analog sound, pops & skips considered. i'm glad to have this CD for reference, but won't be listening to it for pleasure. the tinny '90s digital technology is most disappointing if you're familiar with this LP on vinyl. the seller can't be faulted, as the CD arrived pronto, in good condition, & as promised. & i'm sure audiophiles would have known how to have avoided my mistake."},{"rating":"2","title":"A day late and a dollar short","review":"This is not what I would consider a live album per se, as it was set up in a studio, but none the less the audience and Waits' jokes and monologues give the album a most special \\"feel\\". The album continues much in the same vein as Small Change, but with the added audience the barroom feel is overwhelming, imagining Waits and his 3 man ensemble(which by the way do a great job) on the stage in a smoke filled bar(I know they are not in a bar, but in a studio, but one can imagine), right from the start the illusion and the feeling is created untill it culminates in Waits cover of Big Joe and Phantom 309, and the Spare Parts II(and closing) he make a very amuzing presentation of the band, and a strange farewell. A classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kids Country","review":"Many Inappropiate lyrics for kids. Some adult songs and adult themes - not appropiate for children.

After reading the Immortals and Alanna series and Circle of Magic, I was excited to find that Ms. Pierce was righting another series set in Tortall. There was no fluidity. The characters had no depth and the plot was thin. As opposed to Alanna and Daine who were great characters and had marvelous stories and lives. But this book lacked all that Ms. Pierce had shown great talent for in writing when she wrote the other quartets. I hope the next books are much better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"New to Alanna and her World?","review":"I was and I had no clue what the big deal about the minor characters were. 5 stars?

Second, Yamani is way to much like Japan. Third, it's predictable, rather like the Realms of the Gods.(See 100% junk review.) Fourth, I wanted to scream at the simple grammar and sentences. This book is for third graders. Fifth, I think that the Shang people have itchy feet and would NOT have stayed for a whole year. If I may borrow a line from another review I read about another book, \\"only slavering fans\\" will love this."},{"rating":"1","title":"a shallow find for mature readers....","review":"This is a book about a little girl who wants to be a knight. Ms. Pierces's writing style and presentation are too cutesy, too prepackaged. One gets the impression that she tries too hard to impress and to hold the reader's interest with her heavy use flippant humor - which could certainly make it entertaining enough for elementry readers. However, it is a shallow find for those who might have the thirst for subtlety and a more complex, subdued hue."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book!!!!","review":"This book is exciting, with constant action and great characters. Kel is a great main character, and is really easy to like. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes adventure and excitement. This a great beginning, and I am anxiously awaiting the next book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"Loved this book just like all of her other books. A great read for girls of all ages. I would even read this book to young children. Most of Pierce's books are centered around a strong female role model and this one follows suit."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am so glad that Tortall is back!!","review":"For awhile, I thought that I was one of the only Tamora Pierce fans! Her books were difficult to find. Now, i see lots of people love her books as well! \\"First Test\\" was probably one of my favorite books by this author. It showed that girl's can do anything else that boys do. I ordered \\"Page\\" and can't wait for it to get here! One question springs to mind, 'Will there be an upcoming romance with her and Neal?' Considering the age difference of previous couples this is definetly not impossible. I can't wait to see how Kel's character grows in future books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Couldn't Put It Down","review":"This is a fabulous book! The characters of Kel and her friendsare well thought-out and totally believable. Kel's experiences withpeople that think \\"girls don't belong\\" is an encouragement for the rest of us to try our best. The book covers her first year of training with a difficult horse (Peachblossom), practical jokes by third year students, and an exciting climax with spidrens (carnivorous human/spider monsters) among other things. I couldn't put it down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best!","review":"This is one of Tamora Pierce's best books, but I think all of her books are great. If I were you I wouldn't tell a guy about this series unless he's taken health or has an older sister. But this book is wonderful for any good feminist or someone who just loves Pierce's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've been holding my breath since I read it!","review":"Ever since I read this book (about 5 months ago) I've been waiting with baited breath to find out what happens. It starts off Keladry(Kel) of Mindelan has just decided to become a knight. Ever since Alanna (Lioness Quartet) became King's Champion, it has been legal for girls to become knights. So against the better judgement of Lord Wyldon, the guy in charge of the training, she is accepted. The only catch is Alanna is to have NO contact with her. And Kel is on probation unlike any boy. After Kel gets to the palace no one wants to beseen dead with her except Neal, Duke Baird's son. Kel learns to deal with bullies, unfair treatment and fear. It's a really great book! The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was it wasn't written like the Alanna and Daine books. It's more like the Circle of Magic books, kind of young seeming. It's still a great read though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't stand the test of time","review":"I was about twelve years old when I discovered -- and fell in love with -- two of the books of the Song of the Lioness Quartet. Back then they were pretty hard to find, and I couldn't find the other two books until six or seven years later.Since then, I've tried Pierce's other series, and they just don't stand up to an adult's reading. _First Test_, like the Daine series, suffers from a distinct lack of subtlety, and I never felt drawn into the story the way I was with Alanna. Nothing much really *happens* to Keladry in her first year as a page. Which might be okay if we were given a deeper, more subtle look into her feelings, but instead it's mostly a repetitive, \\"She tried to be stone, like a Yamani.\\" It gets old very fast.While this book may well charm younger readers, unlike the Harry Potter books or Robin McKinley's body of work, they won't stand up to reading by adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book is Fabulous!","review":"I loved this book, as I loved all of Tamora Pierce's books. I think my favorite part of her books is their capacity to make me giddy while I read them. For a day or two I'm completely drawn up in the majesty of the royal Tortallan court, the complicated hierarchy that exists within the government, and the wonderful spunkiness of the main characters. This book is great because, unlike Alanna and Daine, Kel has a strong female role model to look up to--her mother-- and Kel has never been forced into doing anything she doesn't want to do in the name of being a lady, and so is free to completely be herself. I would also reccomend Page and Squire--I guarantee you, once you read First Test you won't be able to wait to read the sequels."},{"rating":"2","title":"A start","review":"My sister and I started this series with \\"Squire\\" and we enjoyed it so much that I bought and read \\"Lady Knight\\". I thought I did not need to read the first two to get any more out of the story. I was right and wrong. Those two can stand alone, but with the other two there is view of Kel becoming what she is \\"a leader of men\\" and \\"protector of the small\\". We listen to these a lot and enjoy the battles greatly. Get all the books, even though for the size it is kind of expensive.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Wait!","review":"This will be a great book.I allready know!I love these books!It shows that girls dont have to be weak as some people say.I take karate and my sister and I are the best in the advanced class and I am only 11!!That is living proof that girls are just as strong and sensable as boys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great series great book","review":"Tamora Pierce is one of my all time favorite authors who could only improve upon her writing skills by turning out her books a bit faster.

I tend to read all kinds of books and only a double handful keeps me in suspences and a smile on my face to the thought what the next book will be like. The First Test was the first book I have read by Ms. Pierce, and because of that I am now hooked.( for thoughs who want to know I am 19 years old.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"It was okey, but where is the plot?","review":"I was highly dissapointed in this book. After reading all of Mrs. Pierce's book( Alanna, Daine/Numair,and Circle) I was expecting something as much as exciting, but I was SHOCKED! To see her stories reduced into such dullness was painful.I mean, it's the same background and almost same situation, only this time, Kel get to go around all the tough stuff Alanna had to go through. It dosn't even match up with the title!! First test? what test? Personaly, I think kel is such a stuck up, Yamani island this and that and that. But otherwise I liked her determination and wise over her year. I'm still looking forward to the second one and the Circle Opens sequences. Please write more!!!! P.S- I want to know more about Daine and Numair.I really hope they get married :)!!! Keep'em comming, Mrs. Pierce!!! $;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"In the footsteps of Alanna comes the First Test","review":"I think that this series will be great. I have read First Test and it was good. The starting books are always the most boring... setting up for the future and such. I had hoped that there would be a series continuing Numair and Daine's adventures(PLEASE!!)! I would recommend this book for anyone that is interested in the genre and to those who have had prior experience with Tamora's works. It's a worthy read and I am at Amazon looking for the sequel! So go out there and get a hold of a copy! ~.^"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!","review":"This book is so awsome!! Kel is smart and hard working character. The only prob is Daine, Numair, Kally, Alanna and George aren't in it exept for breif apperiences. I know this story is about Kel, but we need the old characters too. Also time passes slowly. I mean at the end of Alanna's 1st book she was almost a squire. Keep 'em comin Ms. Pierce."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good as usual, but...","review":"I love Tamora Pierce, so of course I'm going to love this new book by her. I'll admit, I didn't like it nearly as much as the Alanna or Daine books, but then I didn't like the first Circle of Magic book much either and ended up liking the rest of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Believable characters, cool story","review":"This was one of my favorite Pierce books. I liked it better than Immortals, but not as much as Alanna(although it was better than the third and worst Alanna book). I liked it that Kel was afraid of heights, it made her human and believable, and it was great that Neal has a crush on Daine!(Although I'm hoping he and Kel will get on with it in a later book) Anyway I like this book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not excell in my eyes.","review":"Eh, not quite the kind of material Pierce usual writes. Does not excell in my eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book!","review":"This book is really neat. Having read most of Ms. Pierce's other books, I liked this because the main character doesn't have any magic. I like that a lot. The cultures and characters in this author's books are really well developed. That is important to me. Thanks for such a great book, Ms. Pierce!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Return To Tortall; not very interesting","review":"After all the begs and pleads to get another Tortall series, here it is! The first book! Not very exciting! I still prefer Alanna towards Kel, who was just too...cliched...and was the simple kid who somehow has magical powers with out ever being trained so. How unusual that Kel is the female that tries to be a knight, when she is so weak a character, how unusual, Tamora Pierce has dissapointed me. I hope the following sequels will be much more entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously Dissapointed","review":"I have read and loved both the Lioness and the Immortals quartets and so was greatly disappointed to find this book was just a mere shadow of what had come before. It lacks the suspense and gripping plot I found in abundance in the other books, in fact I rather felt the central character, Keladry, simply retrod the paths already walked by the far more interesting Alanna finding herself in the most predictable of situations and never really capturing my attention at all. She lacks the sense of humour Alanna and Daine had and introduces no new challenges to being a female in a mans world. I absolutely love Tamora Pierce's writing and once I start one of her books I usually can't stop; but when I found myself simply looking out for those amazing characters from past stories (Daine, Numair, George, Alanna...) I had to accept that this book really didn't hit the mark at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all as good as her other books","review":"I was very disappointed when I read this book. I expected better from Tamora Pierce. She's a great author; I love all her other books. Especially the Lioness and Immortals series, but this book was just boring and dull. Nothing unexpected happened. It was a totally predictable story."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time","review":"This book was so boring. It is a little dull girl who wants to be a courageous night. PLEASE! Kel is a bore. This book is writen for like kids in first grade! I hear all these \\"Wow, what a great book!\\", but that is just a bunch of lies. Another thing that is not very goodabout this book is that the way that the characters from the other series are not important characters. I was looking forward to seeing how things went for Daine and Numair, but they were rarely shown at all. This book was a major disapointment. I give this book two thumbs down!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BRING BACK THE LIONESS!","review":"Not what I expected, I've read her other two Tortall series and this wasn't nearly as good, It had a horrible plot and bad character devolopment, although some of the ideas are good. Tecnicly, shouldn't Princess Kalisen have been the next girl page? And wheres the humor that was present in all the other books? No swordfights, no plot twists, nothing. It's a quick, boring read. Frankly, I miss the Rogue, Gary, Rauol, Alex,and Graerth the Elder. They added a style to the books and I felt I knew them. Kel is just some girl. Her fief isn't even in Tortall. I expected more from the best author in the Universe. I want to see more of Allanna and George(though I can do without Jonathan). If you want to read this book, don't buy it. BRING BACK THE LIONESS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh the horror . . . The absolute TERROR of it all . . .","review":"This book was sooo bad. It was better than the Circle of Magic series, but it still stunk up the fantasy section of the bookstore. Kel is a big dumb stuck-up moron, Neal is cliched, and who's the mysterious gift-giver? Alanna! Duh! I cried tears of joy when I finished this book. The second one is a wee bit better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!!","review":"When I first got this book I wondered if it would be as good as the Immortals and the Song of the Lioness quartets.But then when I started reading I couldn't put it down.Kel, the main character is the first girl to start training as a boy since the proclomation had been made ten years ago.Even though she is shunned by most of the boys and put on probation, she works hard and shows everyone that she is just as good.It does not matter that some of the plot is taken from Alanna because it is totally different.It is a very good book and will keep you wandering through the whole thing if she will be allowed to stay and become a page or not.I am an extremely big Tamora Peirce fan and I can't wait for more Tortall books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great surprise","review":"Dispite my trepidation in reading this book I found that it was highly enjoyable. I was worried that \\"The first test\\" would be writen for younger readers (I'm 16), and that I wouldn't find the book interesting. I was wrong. \\"The first test\\" is a book that can be enjoyed by people of all ages, young or old. The book is well writen, with interesting characters (new and old), and an interesting plot line. These books are not just a rewriten collecting of the Lioness books either.Kel is a young Totalian girl brought up in Yamani ( a land where women are tought to fight), and when she returns home decides to become a knight. She is the first girl in Tortal to try after Alana's success 10 years ago, and must prove herself before she is allowed to stay for the full 8 years. She knows it will be hard, and it is. She faces bullies and hard work in her first year as she strives to become a knight, and to become accepted by her fellow pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kel is cool... and so human!","review":"Yeah ok. This book was definalty one of Tammy's best. I noted some simiarities between Kel and Alanna (besides that they both wanted to be female warriors...) like Joren picking on Kel and Ralon picking on 'Alan'? Call me a sucker for romance but I really think that Kel and Neal have a thing. Sure he likes Daine but i'm sure that will change...Yeah he and Kel would be nice together even if he IS 5 yrs older than her. Numair is 14 yrs older than Daine sooo... Well i won't get to into that discussion but i will definatly read the second book 'cause i can't wait to find out what happens with Kel... and Neal... and Merric... and Sever. And if Joren will ever get what should really come to him!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not the best","review":"I thought this book was very interesting, but compared to the other books set in the realm of Tortall it's just okay. I'm not saying I won't reread it or buy the next one, I'm looking forward to reading the next one, actually."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome back, Tortall","review":"Yesyesyesyesyes! It's Tortall again! Circle of Magic wasdisappointing because it's not in Tortall, but First test was, too, alittle bit. It doesn't have as much action, but this is still a pretty good book, and it's GOOD to be back in Tortall again. Also, I wish Pierce had said more about Daine and Numair."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS!!!","review":"Tamora Pierce has done it again. I never thought any book could be better than the Alanna Quartet, but this series proved me wrong. First Test, the first book in The Protector of the Small Quartet is about a girl who wants to become a knight. Keladry of Mindelan is put on probation her first year as a test for the training master, Lord Wyldon to decided if she should be able to continue on. This is the first test of many. The rest of the boys play tricks on Kel and try to chase her away. However, time and time again, Keladry proves that she is just as good and better than some of the boys under certain um, circumstances. Kel is a born leader. She saves the lives of her year mates and inevitably earns their respect, if not their friendship...Tamora Pierce will draw you into this book, making you feel like you're part of the scene too. Tamora brings back a few old characters as well as she introduces new ones. This is a great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"And Tamora does it again - well, sort of","review":"Although I enjoyed this book, I preferred the Alanna quartet. Alanna - I don't know - she got into your head. You felt more that she was living a life beyond the books. Kel doesn't do that. This book is the sort you read when you want something relaxing, when you're feeling ill, or when you don't want to struggle. However Pierce has managed to extend the girls-as-knights idea beyond the Alanna series very well and I liked the Yamani culture. I personally disliked all the animal stuff, but that's just me. And I would still buy the second book, it looks quite interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Protecter of the Reviews","review":"Keladry is the first one to take advantage of the proclamation that girls can be knights.She isn't welcome in the palace with Lord Wyldon of Cavall and Joren of Stone Mountain.She is the only page ever to be put on probation.If Lord Wyldon says she isn't good enough at the end of the year, she can't remain a page.JOren and his gang try to make her life miserable.But with the help of her friend Nealan and her animal friends, along with her will of stone, she toughs it out. But everyone say's that Lord Wyldon never changes his mind.The reason I like Kel more than Alanna and Daine is because she wasn't born with anything special.She doesn't really have the gods looking out for her, she doesn't have the Gift, and she doesn't have Wild Magic.She has to make her own specialness.She also refuses to give up, even when Lord Wyldon and the boys give her a hard time.Will Keladry be allowed to stay?Will Joren drive her out?Find out when you read the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"OSD:FJSDJF","review":"IT IS THE BEST OK... It has adventures and more...shes the only girl she fights off spidrens and she fights boys and stands up 4 them..."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOOOOOOOOOOORING!","review":"This book is just more run-of-the-mill modern fantasy. Most books have something good about them, but not this one. It's basically Alanna's story (which was only slightly better) told all over again. I could not care less about the characters. I heard there is going to be yet another Tortall Quartet. Please, NO!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A real let down!","review":"Another reviewer really hit the nail on the head when they said this book was unoriginal. It was like the whole thing was trying to copy Alanna and Daine's stories, but without any of the fun stuff. Mostly this book and the series just went along Kel's daily life and every now and then one thing would conveniently happen and Kel would save the day. I actually skimmed through some of the Page and Squire books hoping that we would be rewarded in the last book, but sadly I ended up just giving up on that one all together.Also, I am not really big into romance stuff, but I do enjoy there to be a little something going on.... and really that aspect of this book fell flat too."},{"rating":"2","title":"More, More, More","review":"What can I say, I'm happy with the condition of my purchase and would use this vendor again and again. Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book to trash.","review":"I thought that Kel would be fighting more immortals. And I thought that Kel was a very typical\\"do-gooder.\\" Complete with all the lectures on morality.That thing about letting the pages get pushed aroung was dumb. As in dumb.As in kill Kel.

I kept trying to like this with the character, but I found her to be selfinvolved and kind of irritating. Sorry. If you want to read an excellent fantasy read Alanna, Calling on Dragons, or Court Duel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started Off OKAY For a fantasy Fiction","review":"I'll have to say that like any other book, the beginnings are always wonderful, in this case, it was outstanding. The only fault was that I didn't like the ending, everything was concluded, well, everything interesting. Now there's nothing to look forward to next.If you have connects, you can get this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Test","review":"This book is very good, the characters are very well portrayed, but it does have a few flaws that keep it from being 5 stars.First of all, it's a bit boring. It drags on and could have been told in less pages.Second of all, we didn't need to hear about the nitty-gritty descriptions of her injuries! It made me shudder inside, and I have a very strong stomach.Third, the story is a bit like Alanna's all over again, except with a more timid character. Also, one other thing I noticed. Although Keladry wears dresses, she is no more 'feminine' than Alanna, the cynic, was. I am by no means a chauvanist (I'm a girl myself!), but Keladry needs to have a less 'prickly' side to her.Overall impression: 4 out of 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"very very bad","review":"Okay... I will admit that I haven't fully read this book. I started reading and gave up in disgust. The 'prejudice' that Kel gets seems forced. Tortall has had a 'female' Kings Champion for ten years and the guards to the Mother Goddess are females, so the 'weak female' prejudice doesn't ring true, especially from the man who has to train her. Yes it's a medieval world, yet the queen can fight and so does her bodyguard, the queen's riders are amongst the best fighters in Tortall and many women swell their ranks, so why would people be against female Knights... Surely with the history of Tortall, people would know that some women can fight.To have a book that focuses solely on kel's desire to be accepted as a knight, by laying the sexist attitudes on her with a trowel, particularly in a world like Tortall, seems wrong. And I couldn't get past the 'no women can become a Knight, they're too weak' attitudes from the council. Particularly given the recent history of Tortall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snore!","review":"This book was, how should I put this? Snore! I am a biiiiiiiig fan of Tamora Pierce but I was very dissapointed in this book. I mean, come on! There was no suspense, and no action. Kel doesn't have anyone to fight except for that bully. And it is pretty obvious that Kel is going to stay. Also, there should be more more of Alanna, George, Daine, and Numair. Tamora, if you are reading this, please make a more interesting part and have the other characters having a bigger part!"},{"rating":"1","title":"where have the good old days gone?????","review":"To say plainly: I did not like this book. kel was an uninteresting character. I will wait for the next book by Pierce, even though this one was bad, worse than the circle of magic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Very good, Tamara. I like Kel's personality, and Neal's. This is a great book for anyone who has read the Immortals and/or the Lioness series. I would've liked to have seen a little more of Daine, but then, I'm all too hooked on her. Where is Princess Kalasin, by the way? Didn't she say she wanted to be a page in Wild Magic? Also, what about Alanna's kids? Anyway, I liked how the author managed to mix fighting and magic and everyday problems like bullies. Stop reading this and start reading the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"It was better than I expected. I esp liked the part of Numair and Daine. However, they were so short (The parts I mean) Maybe in the next book, there would be more appearances. What happened to Kitten? Isn't she always around Daine? Kitten isn't something which could be ignored or forgotten by Neal. It is quite a good read, though the contents seem little, only 206 pages compared to her other books which are 300 odd pages, I wished it was a bit longer. Well, still, the book has intrigued me enough to go and wait in anticipation for the sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like all of Tamora Pierce's books, you can't put this down!","review":"Tamora Pierce is a great author!

First, this book is free for download (I didn't by it either). Second, it's almost not worth the time to download. I've found that the explanation for the examples don't work and there is no depth to the examples. I've tried to email the author but the yahoo email given bounced back. I'm surprised at the complete lack of topic and mention of real tools provided with Weblogic such as DDInit.ejb, DDInit.ejb20, etc. which create the deployment descriptor's under weblogic. This book simply explains how to install Weblogic (which is simply a few button clicks) and states that you should execute \\"ant\\" to build the beans with a predefined build.xml script. What are you really going to learn from that? I know I'm going to get a lot of flack from this post but I'm sorry, this book is definitly not worth a purchase.

Both of those singles contained awesome remixers (Razor N Guido, Junior Vasquez, Hard Attack) which ripped the original versions into fierce club stompers. They also had the vocal stylings of the fantastic Sandy B. This track has neither of those things.I would not suggest buying this single. I would wait until the album comes out if you're that interested in hearing this song.

Usually, first person point of views to me are lacking great storytelling, but with Kim Harrison's bounty hunter series it takes on a whole new meaning. I love the life of Rachel Morgan. The supporting characters are also wonderfully written and are not just used as filler. This novel surpassed the first and I am really looking forward to the third installment.The first book made you love certain characters and hate the others, a couple in the second book stays that way but one in particular stood out, Trent. In the first book I hated him and wished she could take him down but now after reading the second book, I look upon Trent in a whole new light. I am hoping that something happens between Rachel and him, or maybe its just me.If you enjoyed the first book you will find that the second is just as great! Way to go Harrison, another terrific novel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Good, the Bad, and the Undead...great read!!!!","review":"I have read both of Kim Harrison's Book.

The only thing I can say is, can this woman write a book where 3/4 of it isn't filled with sexual tension, sexual references, and how hot her main character thinks all these guys are that aren't her significant other? It gets old with her constantly coming on to, or someone hitting on her every other page. I seriously thought this should primarily been marketed more as a romance novel than a Fantasy/sci-fi/Alternate history as that is where it belongs. I'm no prude, but I think it's a little backwards when sexual references/tension/rape scenes make up the majority of the book while the actualy dialogue/story-line make up the minority."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review - The Goood, The Bad, and the Undead","review":"Love the book, was delivered very quickly, in good shape.

This story just flows, now that I know the characters. It adds a lot of new twists and turns to the previous book, and the plot thickens. Love the characters: they are totally unique, and still mysterious as to what their relationship to the overall story will be. You think you have a character figured out, then a whole new way of looking at them is thrown at you. The story is dangerous, mysterious, and sometimes fun, with a hint of romance, but not overdone. Love the series now, and am going on to the third."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for kids! But great for adults.","review":"I saw the age recommendation on this site and want to make it really clear that I wouldn't give this to 9-12 year olds.

Plots are good (though this book made a bit of a leap with the plot in the end). Great characters!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Even better than the first!","review":"The series really turns up the heat and characterizations in this 2nd installment. The ending was much richer and fulfilling and the characters are really developing. I'm becoming intrigued as well as entertained.

Not since the tv series \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" have I found a group of sci-fi/fantasy characters I enjoyed so much. Bravo Ms. Harrison!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Again","review":"I read \\"Dead Witch Walking\\" and was so excited about Kim Harrison's work. I am from Cincinnati and I was really looking forward to the familiar local of the novel's setting. However, that brief joy was ruined for my in \\"Dead Witch Walking\\" as well as in this novel. I think this series has such potential if Harrison would lay off the cliches and all of the Ivy-wants-Rachel-to-be-her-scion crap. Ivy freaking out and trying to murder Rachel every 10 pages gets really old, really fast. I adore Jenks and his kids, but I have difficulty relating to Rachel and the other characters. Harrison needs to make her non-human characters a bit more accessible to us human folk. I may give Harrison's work one more try, but if the next installment doesn't make some pretty big changes, I won't be reading anymore of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why does Harper Collins charge more for the eBook version than the hard cover version?","review":"I read the first book in the series and enjoyed it. I'm not buying the second book until Harper Collins reconsiders its practice of gouging customers for eBooks. The eBook version requires no printing or shipping costs, yet the publisher still sees fit to charge more. The price should be substantially lower."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite writer in this genre","review":"This book was fantastic as was Book 3. I had a hard time getting into Book 1, but was so glad I stuck with it so that I could enjoy the rest of the series. I bought myself books 4 and 5 for mother's day and am going to donate them to our public library. The library cannot keep enough copies of Kim Harrison, Charlaine Harris, or Kelley Armstrong, to meet their circulation demands.This series appeals to me because despite the supernatural genre, it is very down to earth.

Well, this book was just as great. The writing is so quickly paced and I feel like I'm reading a cool version (almost like Men In Black) of the underworld. The combination of characters and personalities keeps it delightful. I love going along with Rachel while she's making mistakes, guessing right, or just going after what she wants. I also love Ivy. Okay and Jenks! It's a great ensemble of characters and they all provide the perfect amount of intrigue.

I'd recommend anyone interested in Bonsai buy thru Amazon!p.s. I must concur with the over-abundance of environmental UNFRIENDLY peanuts that encased the tree.

This is extremely noticeable on the poster with the black background. The website also did not list dimensions-irregular size-17\\"x22\\"- will not fit regular size poster frames.

The text and graphics are equal to or better than machines 3X the price. The tones and shading are rich and the pages fly out of the machine at the 600dpi setting. Installation was a breeze in Windows XP. Paper trays are admitedly a bit awkward when open, but they fold away neatly when not in use. Envelope printing was less than satisfactory initially, but it runs smooth if you don't pinch the envelope too tight in the feeder. Drum and toner are separate cartridges which is a plus. For simplicity of design, high quality printing, and space efficiency this may be the best value for the home system. Probably not a good choice if you have large volume printing needs, but for home or school use it's a gem of a printer that delivers a very professional looking product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work on 64 bit OS.","review":"This printer is great on 32-bit OS.

I would stay away from this company. Nice printer, but a crappy company. You would think these dummies would want some good PR for their company; but they seem not to care. Gotta figure that people that neither care about their company nor their customers are not people worth buying from in the future. They deleted 14,000 forum comments asking for printer driver so PagePro would work with Windows Vista, 7, etc. Basically told people to go to hell. Could not even leave a helpful suggestion, or pay some programmer for a quick and easy Open Source software solution for their abandoned customers.I wish I was enough of a programmer to find a solution, but all I can say is that old HP printer works with XP and Vista, whereas Konica Minolta does not.

All you need to really enjoy \\"Canyon Country\\" is an enquiring mind! A good deal of information is imparted in a very low-key but well-organized way, unobstructed by obscure technical terms. You can learn a lot, the b&w and color pictures are nice, and Mr. Ranney brings a quiet but obvious love of the region to his writing which makes \\"Canyon Country\\" a pleasure, as well as an educational experience, to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommend","review":"This product is similar to the Hide-N-Sleep line of beds (alligator, fish). My ferrets absolutely love it. The bottom of the igloo is attached by velcro, one strip on each of the four sides. This leaves an opening at each of the corners that my ferrets prefer to climb through rather than the main opening. It's round-ish shape makes it very entertaining to watch when both ferrets go in and start wrestling, as the igloo will start rolling across the room. The quality is great. The walls are very thick, strong enough for my little one to climb on top without crushing it's shape. And although the bottom is only attached by velcro, they have yet to separate it from the rest of the igloo.

She melts at his kiss, repeatedly jumps into his bed, \\"does the nasty,\\" but then claims they shouldn't do it again. Ugh. I want to shake her, \\"Make up your mind!\\" If I were Rhys, I'd dump her. And the amnesia thing is getting old real fast. I'd like to read Sebastian's story, but after this, I'm not so sure.

Basically, if you want a kinky romance novel read this. If you want a vampire novel and don't want to know the whole story by page 30, skip this!

I would've preferred if you could unselect all of the other bundled imaging software and just install the drivers, but that wasn't an option so I went with the absolute minimum.Print quality was good, speed was not quite as fast as the box claims, but still quick.

I have owned a number of HP ink jet printers before and always liked them for their reliability and performance. This printer however is a piece of junk.

I was told it was a \\"really good all-around printer.\\" Well, it's not. This printer has never printed anything on the first try. It cannot grab one piece of paper and print on it. It grabs 15 or 20. And forget printing envelopes. Paper jams are a constant annoyance. They should call this the HP Jammer. Save yourself some money and sanity. Don't buy this piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not with a ten-foot pole","review":"I agree with those who say that this printer is a joke.

We have only had one problem with it, and that was when there was a problem with the printer driver. Reinstalled the software that one time, and no more problems. It prints quickly, quietly, and color is good. We haven't had the paper feed problems some other people seem to have had, and I really don't know why, except that maybe we use 20-25wt paper.

Don't waste your money on this. Note the cheap price, you get what you pay for. The paper feeder barely works, most of the time I have to feed it one sheet at a time. I had another HP (very expensive) printer with the same problem. So I guess I am the fool here.

I am pretty advanced with Windows NT Administration (2 Years), but have only been using Redhat Linux for the passed six months.

This is classic Judy Collins from her early career and contains her versions of songs by Phil Ochs, Dylan, Gordon Lightfoot et al plus a couple of traditional songs. As always her voice is beautiful and her interpretation of songs sublime. Her development as a performer/singer is quite interesting and I find it fascinating to compare these earlier songs with her more recent (scarce) output. Personally, I prefer her earlier work, possibly because I grew up with this genre of folk. Basically, this is an album for the Judy Collins fan. Most of the songs may be found on various 'collections'. However, if you have never heard any of these songs and find the current resurgence of 60's folk interesting, this album is well worth a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of her best","review":"My all time favorite of Judy's mid-60's albums.

Since that time, it has surprised me how little our kids have played with this item. Amazon.com rates this toy for 24 months and older, but I submit that the interest for this toy probably ends at 24 months (Neurosmith rates the age range as 12 months and older). The effective age range for interest in this toy should be considered between 12 and 24 months. The Jumbo Music Block would seem to hold the interest of a child who does not move around a great bit, but as soon as our youngest child could easily move around on her own, the interest in this toy disappeared. It is hard for a toy to be educational if your children don't play with it.....The durability rating is a reflection on the fact that we have had no problems with the toy, but this should be judged keeping in mind how little the toy has been used."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 1 yr old & 2 yr old LOVE this toy!!!","review":"My kids love this toy.

We were given the Jumbo Music Block and it is horrible. It does nothing to teach, the areas that \\"invite exploration\\" has resulted in nothing but frustration. Imagine a ball that you can't take to the other side of the room, or a book that you can't pick up. As for the music, it's one or two sentences that only play once. To get the song to play again you have to kick it. The \\"quiet\\" setting drowns out fire trucks driving on the street (sirens blaring!). The only part of it that our 18 month old likes is that it can be music on demand. She would be better off with a kid friendly cd or tape player.Save the [money] and get something else.This toy does not teach anything.

Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not fun and expensive","review":"I purchased this for my daughter when she was 16 months old and she initially found some interest but not much. I have a couple of the cartridges as well and changing these did not encourage her to play with it. A couple of months later she played with it, but only to climb on it.

He has shown some interest in it. I was reading the reviews and saw that some people said it came with a free cartridge and others said it did not. Well, the one sent by amazon.com did not contain a free cartridge. While looking around in some toy stores in the area, I noticed that there are two different boxes for this toy. I guess when Neurosmith reissued the toy, they included a free cartridge. The older boxes do not. So, I called the 800 # for Neurosmith and they sent me a free cartridge ($20 value)...with no hassle. I just explained that I did not get one, and they sent it to me for free and the call only took me 5 minutes...and it came in the mail about a week later."},{"rating":"2","title":"My two kids fight over this toy","review":"I bought this toy for my one-year old's first birthday and she and my 29 month old absolutely love it. It provides incentive to keep playing (you turn the cube over and it plays a new song)and learning at the same time (shapes, colors, motor skills such as zipping, buttoning, snapping, pulling, pushing). The songs the cube plays are cute and catchy. It is also highly durable (despite repeated warnings, my two year old jumps, sits and lays on the cube). But more importantely, I enjoy this toy (isn't that why we buy toys in the first place?!)

The series of videos aired for the Discovery record in addition to those created for the accompanying songs create a movie chroicling the events around an abducted musical group, their captor, and the hero who frees them from their captivity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very excellent and unique","review":"I never owned the CD by Daft Punk. The only songs I knew were the singles that were played on the radio. This movie is truly an impressive piece of art. Even songs that are rather boring are exciting simply because of the story telling on screen. The songs fit so perfectly with the action visually, even on instrumental songs. You can read the other customer reviews that say all I think, so I'll talk about something else on the DVD:The sound itself. The DVD has DTS and Dolby Digital. I've only listened to the Dolby Digital so far, but it's safe to assume DTS wouldn't be totally differant. I was a slightly dissapointed (only because I was perhaps overly expecting more) that the music itself doesn't take advantage of all five speakers. Instead, the music is basically the same old two-channel stereo mix from the CD. The use of the rear speakers and the center speaker are when there are sound effects onscreen, which are rare."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great to watch or leave on as party background","review":"I originally bought this movie to put on as a background during parties. I thought it would be nice to have music with an accent of visual entertainment. Many people end up enthralled; they sit down and watch the movie from begining to end. I have found that people that don't normally like techno enjoy this genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie\\\\OST","review":"the Album is great and the animation is great.very recomended!if you have the CD you really need to get this.- and also if you don't!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"After reading a couple reviews for this title, I decided to give it a shot. I'm glad I did. Daft Punk has made some of the best music in the last decade. Though not to many people have been turned on to \\"electronica\\", they should consider Interstella. No dialouge whatsoever and that I believe is one of the movies strengths. It relys on Daft Punk's music to gudie you through the film. Before you know it you have connected with the characters and are suprised at how quickly the movie is over.Highly recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"Secretly Incredible","review":"This DVD is incredible, it matches the great synth of Daft Punk with beautiful japanese animation. If you love the Discovery Album by Daft Punk you will be knocked off your feet when you watch this dvd because it places the music so in sync with the movie which makes it flow very nicely.Reccomended for anyone who loves Daft Punk or Japanimation in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really nice","review":"I really like this product. I think it makes a great gift for folks who may like anime and for those into electronica music. It's your classic good triumphs over evil plot line and that stuff never gets old.

It's like a low quality DVD pressed into a blu-ray format disk. It's horrible. I've seen online clips with better video quality.

She didn't get Spike in her Btvs novels, and she doesn't get Lex in Smallville. I really think she would be better served sticking with series where all the characters are clearly labeled \\"good\\" or \\"evil\\". If you like Lex, you won't like this novel. In fact, if you like the \\"gray\\" morally ambiguous characters in any series, you should probably avoid any tie-in novels by Nancy Holder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rotten","review":"I don't think this author knows anything about the characters. This book was like reading a screenplay to a corny old horror movie with the names of the Smallville characters added as an afterthought. I didn't like this book at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Educational and Enlightening","review":"A wonderful book that is unlike other books I've read about Chinese culture. This book is based on factual experiences that Peter went through during his 2 years in Fuling. There is a lot to gain by experiencing, through Peter's chapters, about the Chinese people, their past, and their future. This is not a fictional story, but a true life experience of what it is like for an American to move to China, overcome the language barriers, the culture barries, and learn to live with, work with, and and understand the Chinese."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Poignant Account","review":"A well-written memoir, an eye-opener to those who had never been to China and an appetizing read for me who had first-hand experience of what it's like to live and work there. This, I could read and reread every few years, satiating my desire for Zhong Guo's landscape, culture and food. Peter Hessler is a wonderful writer who can easily transport the reader to China's River Town."},{"rating":"2","title":"Packed with hilarious remarks & profound insights","review":"The book is peppered with hilarious remarks about small details and profound insights about Chinese culture. And it is very well written.What Hessler describes in his book is what all foreigners notice when they come to China and observe the locals, I guess. I starting living in another province about 10 years after his stay in Fuling, yet I was struck by the same things. Except maybe the omnipresence of political propaganda, but it may be due to his position in the education system. The attitude of the \\"laobaixing\\" is not the same here in Shenzhen, but I lived in a small town for a few months and it was much closer to what Hessler describes.Easily readable. Highly recommended if you are wondering how the \\"Chinese system\\" works."},{"rating":"2","title":"a masterpiece","review":"I am reading Hessler's new Oracle Bones now, which could be an informative book about China for readers who are not yet well-acquainted with the country. However, I feel that River Town is the much more compelling book, in which the people and place of Fuling come alive much more than the people and place of Beijing do in Oracle Bones. I read an interview with Hessler where he says he wrote River Town in just a few months. It must have been a few really inspired months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read...","review":"Because I will soon be traveling to China, I have been reading many books about the country and the culture. This book was fantastic. It presents a perspective of Chinese culture and life from fresh eyes; the author is knowledgeable about the country and culture but he also inserts his personal reactions and responses to some of the oddness he sees, never hiding behind what his reaction \\"should\\" be. His description of the road race in which he participated still sticks with me and makes me laugh. I appreciated his ability to see the humor in many of his experiences without ever taking a superior attitude. The book is not intended to be a history of China but rather a first person account of his own interesting experience.I am a big fan of travel writings, and this book stands out among the many I have read. I couldn't put it down, and I look forward to reading it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked River Town and I loved China","review":"River Town is an enjoyable reading.It helped me to understand the impact of the social and political changes on the Chinese people that live in Fuling and nearby areas. I traveled to China last October and was eager to learn more about this wonderful country. The book written by Peter Hessler gave me an intimate view of a person that has lived there. I spent sixteen days in China,but Hessler's narrative surely fulfilled the gap that I felt during my brief stay. River Town added richness and depth to my recent travel experience. I will be glad to read more books by Hessler.I give this book a 5 star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughtful account of what it was like to teach and learn in China in the late 90's early 00's","review":"Excellent book. When people ask what it was like to live in China during this time period, I suggest they read this book. Really appreciate Hessler's thoughtful insights, as well as his humor. Great Book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hessler knows China","review":"While this book is excellent for people unfamiliar with China, it is also highly recommended for those with a more in depth knowledge. I myself have spent time in Taiwan and China and was often struck by how accurate Hessler's observations were.The section on Chinese photo albums and the rather bizarre photo culture there was hilarious, as was the section on the English names Chinese people take. I also identified with Hessler's alternate personality, his self in Chinese, Ho Wei. Anyone who studies Chinese has this other personality...kind of dumb, illiterate, and not at all erudite or funny. This book will make you laugh out loud, but it also has a serious side, discussing issues such as the sky-high rates of suicide among women in China, the educational atmosphere in a system tightly controlled by the CCP, and the death of Deng Xiaoping."},{"rating":"2","title":"A glimpse into the opaque mindset of the Mainland Chinese","review":"Do not let the fact that this book is an easy read fool you into believing it is trite.To the average Westerner, China is opaque which gives it a kind of mysticism. The language barrier and script exagerates this. The author of this book spent two years submerged in non-tourist China. Armed with the ability to speak Mandarin the author allows the Westerner to glimpse and understand some of the mindset of the Chinese. This is not the mindset described in Wild Swans - authored by someone escaped Mainland China and can now loathe it as an outsider - or the China described in Simon Winchester's diverting River at the Centre of the World - which is more preoccupied by colonial tales. Instead it is a book in which the author ends up questioning his own cultural assumptions and political indoctrinations through the thoughts and experiences - occasionally absurd - of the people to whom he is teaching. Compulsive and unique."},{"rating":"2","title":"River Town","review":"This book was an incredible eye-opener about Chinese culture. A sprinkling of wit binds together a string of vignettes which lay bare the society of this remote, interior, Chinese city. Hessler's personality rings through the pages as he draws you into his world and his experiences.This is a must read for anyone who wants to travel in Asia or who wishes to understand the role that China will have in the coming century.Simply a fabulous book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flows Like A RIver","review":"The 26 year old Peace Corps worker describes the real central China in 1996-8.This is a world in transition, moving from historic agriculture to the modern world, always shadowed by China's 20th century history and central party.The eternal sense of time, culture and community in China is described in meaningful ways. The role of foreigners and the source of Xenophopbia is portrayed. The strengths and weaknesses of modernizing college students, peasants, teachers, entrepreneurs and party officials are shared.This book is a quick read. It provides the flavor of China through the author's personal experiences learning the language, culture, politics, rules and people. The country has developed greatly in the past 15 years, but history, culture, language and memory remain very important to the country and individuals.There are no breakthrough insights in this book, but the lessons are highly valuable for anyone who is curious about modern China."},{"rating":"2","title":"China as you have never seen it...","review":"This is a very well written first person narrative of the life of two American men, who are teachers on the Yangtze River in China. The colorful descriptions of the Chinese People, the beautiful countryside, river life and the culture should not be missed. I read the book twice and each time I learned more about China. It is a China I wish that I could have experienced during one of my several visits there before the Three Gorges Dam backed up water to cover many of the villages, ancient ruins and temples.I encourage you to buy the book, enjoy it at your own pace and read it as you would savor an in-depth experience of life, culture and beauty in an ancient civilization.Ron Lewis"},{"rating":"2","title":"River Town","review":"Excellent and intertaining story of town in the way of being inundated by water behind the Three Gorges Dam. And, the experience of an American who volunteered to teach Chinese in a small college for teachers and their lives after graduation."},{"rating":"2","title":"China, both Complex and Fascinating","review":"I picked up this book whilst on a business trip in China. It tells the tale of a 26yr old American Graduate (Peter Hessler) heading to rural China for 2yrs to help teach English. His portrayal of China is beautiful, complex and fascinating. You learn a little of how the people are influenced by the communist regime, their lifestyles, attitudes to the western world and of course their inner beauty. You can almost inhale the Chinese environment as he navigates you from industrial China with it's bellowing smog to the natural beauty of the rugged landscapes. Where this book wins for me is it's portrayal of the Chinese people, warm, curious and captivating. If you have a passing interest in Chinese culture, then you should read this. A very easy and enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"River Town-Learn While Reading","review":"This is a thoroughly enjoyable book that guides you through the experiences of life in a remote village in China from a American who is the first white person to live in their community."},{"rating":"2","title":"perceptive and enthralling","review":"Peter Hessler is a fine writer, with insight and sensitivity.

I look forward to comparing my impressions with the author's."},{"rating":"2","title":"A treasure for non fiction genre","review":"This is an incredibly written book. It is a political, historical and human interest chronicle, and to top it off it is beautifully written. Some chapters could easily serve as examples for the writing craft. Particularly impressive was the comparison of the rivers. I've recommended this book to several friends looking for interesting non fiction for their book clubs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peace Corps teaching in China","review":"This was a real pleasure to read. It took me back to the many rewards of being a Peace Corps volunteer myself, as well as to my teaching for a year in China in the late 1980s. Hessler writes well, and the book succeeds nicely on that level. Also, his insights are fresh - and candid. He is able to capture the richness of his experiences in China, and also to honestly talk about some of the more unpleasant episodes as well. Many of his experiences ring absolutley true to me in my experiences in China. And, he does especially well in capturing a China in the process of profound change, as well as a China complex and contradictory in many ways. I have just begun reading his second book, Oracle Bones. Already I am enjoying it. I would certainly recommend River Town - and I suspect Oracle Bones as well. One learns many facts about China and gains some broader understandings of the culture and the people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rivertown: 2 years on the Yangtze","review":"Peter Hessler is a well-educated Peace Corps volunteer who was sent to China to teach English at a local teacher's college. He very vividly captures the ups and downs of his experience for 2 years beginning in 1996. He was sent to Fuling, a primitive city, where the people are not familiar with Westerners. Peter describes his unusual experiences in the first person as well as giving the reader a glimse into Chinese thought, language, politics and culture. The book is quite interesting although it sounds like a documentary."},{"rating":"2","title":"a book that teaches","review":"Simply...enthralling. A book that not only captures the lifestyle of the Chinese but also teaches us various life lessons.The chapter on Shakesphere, and the student's interpertation of his (Shakesphere's) work, sheds light on how we all should interpert ALL things that we see and do in life."},{"rating":"2","title":"China is on a roll!","review":"Cannot believe the wild changes in China.

A wonderfully detailed close-up look at the real China. Peter Hessler is a master writer This is a book to be recommended to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"River Town","review":"This book is great for anyone who enjoys travel and/ or learning about new cultures. The author, Peter Hessler, tells about his Peace Corps experience in Fuling, a traditional remote city in communist China. Hessler and another teacher are the first foreigners the town has seen in over 50 years. They teach English and literature at the local college. Together they must learn to adapt to the dramatic changes in cultural, social and political life if they are to make friends. They struggle to learn Chinese and adjust to the communist viewpoints of their students. Nothing could have prepared them for this journey. River Town will open your eyes to the mysterious country and culture of China."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-written and engaging","review":"A well written and engaging account of a young man's tenure as a Peace Corps English teacher in Fuling, a small riverside Chinese town. A nice blend of history, observation, and analysis, he demonstrates the difficulties and joys of integrating into local life from 1996-1998."},{"rating":"2","title":"A SWEET READ","review":"As another former Peace Corps Volunteer who was able to almost become fluent in a foreign language while serving, I am aware of Mr. Hessler's sacrifice. One must be truly obsessed to do this. The result for us readers is a very detailed look at a remote part of China during a time of incredible change. Forty years ago, large newspapers and magazines had journalists stationed overseas to report on stories. Generally, they stayed in a city for some time and the result was often an interesting and detailed description of some far-off place. Mr. Hessler's book is unusual since it reads like such a piece of journalism, rather than a Peace Corps memoir. Usually Peace Corps memoirs are introspective and lack much in-depth history or politics. Hessler turned his eyes outward instead of inward. This is a wonderful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy, Interesting Read","review":"Interesting peek into Chinese life. Four stars because I left wishing for something a bit deeper. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can I give six stars? (:","review":"After reading this book, I felt very proud that the Peace Corps had individuals like Peter and Adam.I also came to China to teach English but it was in 1979. Conditions were very poor and the influence of the Cultural Revolution could still be seen and felt.The author makes some very insightful analysis on Chinese society but he gives a background and perspective that helps the reader understand the conditions and difficulties the Chinese people had to face.Many of the observations that Peter made I observed myself. I could only shake my head in amazement as I read of his experiences. As an American black living in China, I also had some very, very interesting experiences. However, the longer one lives among the Chinese, one cannot ignore their talent, creativity, and their humanity. Peter Hessler wrote a beautiful book.My only question is how could someone only give this book three stars?brad polkbeijing, china"},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"Peter Hessler's memoir of a rural Chinese city was a very enjoyable read. Wonderful descriptions of the local people and scenery, and of his interations with both. Definitely worthy of its praise, and an eye opener to someone who wants to know what life as a Peace Corps volunteer is like. His experiences in the remote, outlying villages in rural China remind me of my own experiences on the tiny islands off the west coast of Thailand. Friendly people, with no harmful intentions, seeking to interact with \\"glamorous\\" Americans, often asking ridiculous questions. It is full of insights and humble confessions, but free of overly-wordy or oppressive prose.

Each day we read after school a chapter of Sophie's World, and my 5th and 3rd grade girls can relate to Sophie's life, her imagination, and the struggles to fit in with peers. They remember previous chapters, love the introduction of new vocabulary words, and look forward to the next chapter. This book offers lots of opportunities for discussions, and it has inspired our family to consider local history around us and how family vacations can be used for expoloring and not just entertainment. We are grateful to have found a series that offers so much in a small package that appeals to a fairly wide age range. Sophie makes it ok to still play and enjoy life to the fullest in those confusing tween years.

Regardless of any sequel, I ordered this as soon as I saw it available, without reading any synopses, because his other books were so great.My bad---although I probably would have gotten it anyway, regardless of synopsis.But his other books were terrific. Great page-turners, and a great capture of Miami. In understand an author gets tired of the same characters, but he really had a good, creative and imaginitive thing going.This one just drags.

The topic is compelling. I'm a fan of the literary thriller in general and this could have been really good; that is, if you took out all the dull character studies where, I swear, I could hear Michael Gruber thinking of ways to sound intellectual and profound. It was Dan Brown with a broader vocabulary and a bigger ego. Yuck. A waste of a good idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Book of Hot Air and Implausible Plots","review":"I listened to this book on CD while commuting -- which may be one reason it didn't drag for me as much as it did for other readers. The story started promisingly enough. The last third, however, is a mess, as if the author didn't know what kind of book he wanted to write. The attempts at humor became grating; the characters started to bore me. And the resolution was not in the least believable."},{"rating":"1","title":"arg...","review":"The parts where the author spends several pages at a time narrating about his past make me want to scream. Frankly, I don't give a crap about what happened to him in middle school, his sexual exploits in college, the history of his parents, his ex wives, or his friend's ex wives... I've taken to skipping those sections of the book because they are of no relevance to the plot. It doesn't feel like the author has created a character, it just seems he felt like ranting to us about his own personal history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brace Yourself","review":"This was my first experience with Mr. Gruber and I found this novel compelling! The wonderful thing about Shakespeare is that for such a famous poet we know close to nothing about how he lived his life, which provides novelists, like Mr. Gruber, with a blank page on which to create the life of the Bard as he sees fit. Mr. Gruber does an exceptional job of keeping it believable and painting a reasonable, believable, respectable painting of what WS may have been like.With endless possibilities, with a multitude of liberties available for the taking, Mr. Gruber does a fine job of keeping this adventure believable and never fully crossing the line into the land of the absurd.It's a great combination of historical fact (what little facts we know) and fictitous predicaments and possibilities woven together by the narration of interesting characters both past and present.It's worth exploring!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing thriller","review":"This is an extremely well-written book that keeps the reader guesing until the very end. There are a myriad of disparate characters, and all of them are well developed. The plot line involves an old manuscript that may or may not lead to an unknown play by Shakespeare, and it is very difficult to discern who are the \\"good Guys\\" and who are the \\"bad guys\\". Even by the end of the book I was still a bit confused as to what really happened, and whether or not the manuscript was genuine. If you like literary thrillers, and puzzles to figure out, you will certainly enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful reading","review":"What a wonderful, amusing book. It reminded me of Saul Bellow's Herzog combined with a much smarter version of The Davinci Code. It gets a wee bit confusing at the end as layers of intrigue are peeled away, but still a delightful, fresh voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"I want to meet these characters!","review":"Amazing, well-drawn characters in this entertaining and fascinating book. Loved the writers's ability to create REAL people: quirky but recognizable, flawed and yet endearing. Suddenly deeply involved in a centuries-old literary argument, they have clues to follow, mysteries to solve, first-love heartache and changing family relationships to deal with, all while trying to avoid Russian mobsters and pin down the truth about Shakespeare's possible involvement with treason.Really!And funny. Literary without being snobbish. I really enjoyed this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun in the historical mystery field","review":"Mr Gruber has a lot of fun juggling several elements in this fast-paced thriller. He throws in enough literary background to let you know he's read the latest research on Shakespeare but he doesn't let the literary side overshadow the thrilling chase as the main characters hunt for the clues to a possible Shakespeare manuscript.At first I was confused by the swift changes in point of view between characters, but once all the players are in place the pieces lock together. Jake, the lawyer who is one of the main characters, reveals far more than he realizes about himself as he tries to find the manuscript and the mystery woman who lures him on. Albert, the bookstore employee and wannabee film-maker, comes to life as he uses all the resources at his fingertips to decipher the code.This is the book that the Da Vinci Code should have been.

My advice to anyone thinking of buying this book is a resounding NO! If you still aren't quite sure, at least go the library, check it out and save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is an IQ test of sorts","review":"If you cannot see the plot \\"twists\\" coming a mile away, you can safely conclude that you're among the dumbest people on earth. Look, I'm terrible at predicting surprise twists and turns, plot points, etc. But if even I can easily foresee every alleged twist, then what we have here is a fairly crappy book.The prose is, of course, truly wretched. I don't generally expect much from these types of books. Usually, a compelling plot can compensate for pulpy prose. But for a supposed thriller, this book offered no suspense, no tension, and only a passably interesting plot. Not horrendous, but not noteworthy.The pace was fairly lethargic. Some of the background facts upon which the plot is laid are entertaining. As a whole, the book is okay in a time-killer sort of way. But to say that the book did not live up to the blurbs on the cover is an understatement of the highest order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck, yuck, yuck!","review":"Lots of pages for too many characters. How to track what they know/when they know it? Even in the end the reader is left hanging with not so much as a wrap up. Author assumes we're too smart for that. Well, some of his plot lines don't make sense so it would have been nice to see him try to put the cherry on top.In summary: confusing and wordy....verbose. And the Shakespeare translations became so difficult and irrelevant that I just skipped them. Not the fun ride I thought it would be.This is my only revenge for spending $ on this book....writing my review."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY","review":"Thank god I got this out of a bargain bin.

Phooey on this book. Another author who is paid by the word, not the idea or story telling abilities. Way too many digressions (even the narrator admits to that), and the old manuscript in olde English was a trial as well.Life's too short to spend on books like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I really expected more than this book delivered. The basic concept of the book was excellent. A missing Shakespeare manuscript and coded correspondences from an individual sent to spy on WS. I took a lot of British History and Literature in college and found this an interesting hook.However, the character development and dialogue was poor with plot being very predictable. As another reviewer pointed out, none of the main characters were very likable or interesting. I did finish the book by speed reading through the middle portion of the book but did think about dropping the book half way through and reading something else.Unless, you cannot find anything better to read. I would wait for the movie or a greatly abridged book on tape. If it ever is made into a movie, hopefully a screenwriter can clean up the junk in the story, and there is a lot of junk.I was not a fan of the Da Vinci Code, but this book makes Da vinci look like a Hemingway novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"When does the story start?!","review":"OK, I can't give it a full review because I have to admit I didn't finish it. But that's my point. I picked up the book based on a couple suggestions from people reviewing other books (including those by Dan Brown). I got as far as page 54 and gave up. I am 54 pages in and I cannot tell you what the book is about. Sure I can read blurbs or reviews but if I was 30 minutes into Raiders of the Lost Ark and all that had happened was Indy sitting in a bar talking about his childhood - my knowledge of the plot wouldn't matter. By this time in a reasonably good novel you should be hooked, not wondering what the plot is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loses a star because he is often a good author","review":"This was a shrug-worthy book. I am a fan of this particular author, having read his superb novels that he ghost wrote. Here, sadly, I think that he was trying to recreate that tangled web of intrigue that surrounded the Karp family delivered with humor and insight. But it was not to be. In my opinion, he drove every character or plot device into the ground and I stopped caring whether the treasure was real, whether the waif bookbinder was a player or a victim, whether the self-loving lawyer would redeem himself, and so on. Every so often there was that Karp magic and the special command of the English language that the author owns. On its own this was probably a three star book, but I give a special demerit for a favored author who made me not care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tripe, Severed Cold and Rubbery","review":"Can't lose plotline ... unknown Shakespeare manuscript, a nebbish, a mysterious hot chick, a disgraced English Professor, Russian mobsters, and a Jesuit Rambo ... unfortunately the story is dragged down by rambling parenthetical explanations and minutiae. And a Jewish Conspiracy Theory of WWII that I just plain didn't get.And then, heading into the finish, some other darn personal agenda rant, and then, the plot turns more twisted than the Golden Gate Bridge after the '89 Loma Prieta earthquake.And an obvious plot ... flattening rather than a twist, that I saw coming somewhere around Chapter Five.I finished this book only because it was loaned to me by a friend, and I always finish books I've been lent, even if they are this awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! In the Da Vinci code realm","review":"When I first saw a review of this book in, I believe, USA Today, I was intrigued because it said that if you enjoyed The Da Vinci Code, you'll love this book. They were right. It's chock full of historical information and intrigue, but is told in a very RIGHT THIS MINUTE time period.

Admittedly, I have engaged thistechnique previously but always with library books or paperbacks bought at the half price store, never with one for which I had paid full price at a boutique bookstore.

Dixon or Beverly Cleary. His dialogue is certainly reminiscent (conjuring grade school conversations), his structure not quite as complex.I'll tip my hat to an interesting and fairly well-researched premise, however Gruber has executed it with all the skill of a high school junior slamming together a last-night, creative writing project.Taut thriller?

More effective than Ambien, it took me weeks to finish.Buy this book only if you want to question why you still read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lee Child disappoints","review":"AFter reading the 3 Jimmy Paz mysteries, I was very disappointed in this book.

They are usually accompanied with a simple reason why this answer is correct and the other choices are wrong. Admittedly, this is great for a refresher and/or for an assessment of problem areas. But to really learn how to apply these rules consistently, you'll likely need a companion to this book. The cool part is, if you take all the tests, you'll know which one.So, if you are looking for lasting improvement, this book will get your started, but it is probably best used in that context.

You would think if evolution was completely bunk that creationist or intelligent design believers would have more to say.Anyways this book is more of the same literary slight of hand that is in the authors other book \\"Tornado in s Junkyard\\" in which he uses dishonest manipulation of facts and a gross misunderstanding of statistics and evolutionary theory to disillusion the simple minded reader. Whether he does this intentionally or if he to is delusional we dont know but either way this book and the authors other works can not be taken seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short and Sweet","review":"This is a short book which is very easy to read. The author is very precise with his arguments and he explains many facts which are unanswered by evolution theory.

Perloff also explains the importance of separating microevolution theory from macroevolution theory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perloff does it again","review":"Perloff sets up a strawman with misrepresented facts and hucksterism.

Perloff's \\"arguments\\" have been repeatedly and summarily dismissed by the scientific community as either ignorance or willful misrepresentation of fact.The notion that Science avoids the claims of so-called critics of evolutionary theory is both ironic and laughable given the fingers in the ears approach that \\"creationism\\" generally takes to the subject.To call this book \\"logical\\" is to dilute the meaning of logic to the level of the superstitious pap that goes by the name of \\"intelligent-design\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Common Sense not based upon theory but fact","review":"This was a great book.

While the book offers up a detailed accounting of Beethoven's life, it does not go into elaborate detail on every aspect of his life. I truly enjoyed this book and it greatly whetted my appetite for learning more about Beethoven's life. In fact, I felt a kinship with the maestro, as I too dealt with an alcoholic father in my formative years.For more detailed exposition of the maestro's life, I would recommend Maynard Solomon's \\"Beethoven.\\"However, this book is a terrific \\"launching point\\" to the more detailed and nuanced Solomon book, that Morris references in his own book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Short Biography Devalued by Sloppy Editing","review":"Emund Morris' short biography about Beethoven is perfect for anybody who does not need to know the most trivial minutiae of Beethoven's life. Everything that is important is contained in this book. Major compositions of Beethoven are briefly described and give suggestions what titles one should add to the personal Beethoven collection.Without doubt, though, the writing of this Pulitzer Prize winning author is at times pompous and marred by very slopping editing. There are many instances of typos, poor grammar and misspelled German words.Bernd Neuenkirchen"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak and disappointing","review":"The author spends much too little time on what made Beethoven great as a composer, how he differed from the composers who came before, and how structurally he created his masterpieces. In addition, the anecdotes at the beginning and end of the book, which I guess are supposed to give perspective on Beethoven's lasting greatness, are a tepid waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unfortunate book on Beethoven","review":"I was received this book as a present, shortly after reviewing the more objective biography of Beethoven by Barry Cooper, part of the Masters Musicians series publihed by Oxford University Press, a second time. It did not take me long before before I realized that Morris relied too much on the writings of the Sterbas, and accepted without questioning some of the more contraversial aspects in the writings of Maynard Solomon. Many of these aspects were adressed in the Barry Cooper's biography, in which he has investigated and put into proper perspective. I became more and irritated as I read through Morris's book. It is a shame that this book is written with the idea of for introducing Beethoven to the general public. For a more acurate biography of Beethoven incorporating his life and works, one without the other is meaningless, I would suggest the Biography by Barry Cooper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Concise and very well-written","review":"A good starting point for research into the life of Beethoven. Not overly technical and an excellent version for the music lover who wants to understand the person without the need for fluency in musical theory."},{"rating":"2","title":"easy read yet at sophisticated level","review":"For some reason I thought this biography was going to be for young adults. It is not. It is a highly sophisticated book both in terms of its subject and his music. Yet at the same time it managed to be an easy, enjoyable page-turner showing warts and all. I had not realized how very insane Beethoven became as his deafness and personal life worsened -- and yet it was then that, apparently, he most cleanly broke through convention to achieve revolutionary masterpieces. Made me think of Van Gogh -- and the whole idea of insanity melded with brilliance."},{"rating":"1","title":"it looks amazing and my boyfriend loves it BUT","review":"he's only been wearing it for a week and the silver is beginning to tarnish.

The first thing I noticed is it doesn't open smoothly and it also doesn't close easily at all. I will say the blade is very sharp, but other than that I have nothing good to say about it.Trust me, you can find much better in this price range for a small lock blade folder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Little Knife","review":"Beautiful Little Knife.

I still like Buck but make sure it is a real Buck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buck knife made in china.....","review":"I get how we outsource, but to me the name buck instills a image of sturdy american made products. this knife how ever is made in China. its quality is poor, the open and closing of it is not fluid to say the least.

After over 2 years of use its still like new, with absolutely NO wobble between the blade and handle. The stainless handle still looks great, only a few small scratches. Easy to sharpen, and stays sharp."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic for young and old","review":"When I was a kid my uncle gave me a copy of this book and it opened up a world which still intrigues me...reptiles and amphibians. Even today I consult the book for info on some lizzard I don't recognize or to see if salamanders actually spend a lot of time out of water. In fact, I'm sharing it with my own nephew now--age 11--who's discovering this new world of life for himself. This book is well-presented and easy-to-use, as well as full of great illustrations that alone make it worth reading through. Profiles of each reptile and amphibian are thorough withough being overwhelmingly scientific. A timeless classic for young or old...one to share over the generations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Product Shipped","review":"I ordered a CD but a cassette showed up.

I really enjoy the fast guitar work and the deep raspy vocals. My favorite song on the album is \\"When Skin Turns Blue\\" with the gruesome lyrics and cool guitar licks. This album does not use squealing guitar work which I detest in metal. Buy it and start enjoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ew and Ew Again","review":"Okay, I heard Amerika the Brutal on Music Choice and I was like \\"hey! cool song!\\" So I went and bought this CD and was crushed. First off, why the hell is there no PA in this? Every other word is f***.

But not for other rock lovers."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album belongs \\"six feet under\\"...","review":"And I liked \\"Haunted\\". Sounds like this band has \\"evolved\\" and \\"taken a new direction\\". I mean, it was always over-the-top psychosis, but in a good way. Now it's rediculous. How do you go from writing murder glorification songs like \\"Feasting on the Blood of the Insane\\" and \\"Torture Killer\\" to whining about American \\"brutality\\" against the regime of real-life \\"Torture Killer\\" Saddam Hussein? Now THAT'S real psychosis! Unless... they're joining the liberal f@g pacifists because they LIKED Saddam's mass-murdering, serial-raping family! I guess that would make sense. What's next? A song about banning guns? Or maybe paying reparations for slavery?

Its very rhythum driven. Great production, cept for the vocals which they should just get rid of (chris barnes can't growl like he used to) and ok guitar work. They seem to use more dynamics than most death metal bands, which is what makes them so great to bang your head to, BUT, this album is very repeditive, and shows alot less skill than past six feet under albums, the songwriting is poor overall and there isnt any blast beats or technical guitar leads like past six feet under efforts that ive heard, disipointing overall. The dvd is a useless piese of junk that is made of a bunch of interviews of chris barnes while smoking his brains out, and a documentary that is boring and stupid. Im giving 1 stars for the few tracks I like on here."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT IS THIS CRAP???","review":"THE BEST SFU ALBUMS ARE \\"THE HAUNTED\\" AND MAXIMUM VIOLENCE\\" DO I NEED TO SAY MORE????

Not only is this song horrible the rest of the album doesn't make up for it. If you haven't heard of SFU before then stay away from this album at all costs. For some reason you want to start listening to SFU then pick up there first two albums, so much better than there latest.

While on cc he sounde demonic, disturbing, sicko like as in sfu he sounds tired & lame and his vocals coulnd even scare a little baby--infact, it wouln't scary any one but only bored them to death and its pretty damn funny and lame! I was dissapointing to actullie see how awfull Chris barnes turn once he left cc i mean i thought atleast he would get with a gore or disturbing or dark type of band but nope he got wid the crap we kno as six feet under! This is not deathmetal by a long shot...Sounds alot like nu-metal! Linkin park has more metal in them then six feet under and likin park has basically no metal--so what does that tel; you about sfu ? Since they begun all of their albums are awful and no not even their debut is any good! Do yo self a favor and skip this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"As a fan of good old school death metal as well as some of the new deathmetal bands with actullie good and original music i find Sfu to be one of the worse bands i've ever heard and trust me i have listing to all of their albums since their debut and not one of those cds impressed not even one song did any justice for me so there fore i say Chris barnes should retired and stop hurting his vocals and stop growling like a retard and leave the deathmetal to people who can actullie play it well... All the songs in this cd are awfull but if you want me to name some i willll exemple \\" amerika the brutal\\" \\" my hatred\\" , \\" when the skin turns blue\\" i laugh when i listing to sfu because frankly ? Its a joke and thats how sfu should be taken as a joke nothing else... If you consider your self a true deathmetal fan and listings to sfu then my friend your not sorry to inform you!

Six feet under. I had a chance from a friend to listing to six feet under's \\"bringer of blood (w/dvd)(dig)\\" and my thoughts were that it sucks more then a vaccum... I mean, the whole album is a complete joke! Chris barnes rapping? This is suppost be deathmetal not linking park!Anyways, any band that chooses to name a song spelling america with amerika ? Does not deserv to be in the deathmetal category maiby in nu-metal or rapmetal but not deathmetal. Dont waste your one on this washed up/has been garbage. Not recommend. This isn even deathmetal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Politics and music just doesn't mix well in my veins.","review":"Amerika The Brutal was a failure to bash.And Chris Barnes - please take those socks out of your mouth and growl for me, is that too much to ask?I will say, however, that it is better than the death-rap of 'One Bullet Left.'I'd recommend this album to rookies of the death metal genre, but I'm very disappointed in knowing that Barnes is putting out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fecal Matter","review":"America.....The BRUUUUUTAAALLLL. How can music get any worse? This is album is weak, boring, and flat out stupid. The guitar is remedial at best; meg white from the white stripes plays a better drum kit. And Chris Barnes, oh how you have fallen from grace. You vocals don't fit the music at all. You have become a stoned, smelly cartoon of yourself. I with there was a negative star on the rating scale. My friend bought this album and after we used it for comedy, we used it for target practice.If you are so stupid and baked that any chugga chugga downtuned riff with heavy vocals sounds sweet to you, go ahead and buy this. You'll still hate it, it's that bad.Don't buy this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"garbage...","review":"what can i say? six feet under will never be anything more then mediocre. they do get an award for writing the gayest song in metal...amerika the brutal. what is this trash? sounds like chris barnes was trying to sound like zach de la rocha only with a growl and a pathetic attempt at singing...utter garbage. there might be 2 or 3 alright songs but this cd does nothing more than drone on...very dissapointing. maximum violence is as good as it will get. its sad to see the linkin park fans enjoying amerika the brutal as their first step into metal....you have along way to go...your definately headed in the wrong direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure garbage this is.","review":"This album sucks.

However, I have recently noticed some great new directions in both of these \\"death-metal\\" bands, and I absolutely love it, especially \\"amerika the brutal\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good But Is Crumbled In Presence Of Cannibal","review":"The music is pretty heavy and whatnot but what happened to Barnes' vocals? Before his vocals (in Cannibal)practically untouchable in the death scene but now, his voice is more of a NYHC type of thing and he does this wierd yodel thing too. I don't know if the yodel is on purpose or if its his vocal chords so worn out that they're wobbling around like a downtuned bass guitar. Besides the down points its still a good cd. If you've never listened to Cannibal Corpse and just Six Feet under I would strongly reccomend picking up some Cannibal cds."},{"rating":"1","title":"i would give in negative 5 stars.","review":"ok. six feet under have lost it. i have liked all of their albums except this one. its just, well, really really bad. and beleive me, i really wanted to like this, but i cant sink that low. i think all of us who didnt like this should kick chris barnes's ass for writing such stupid lyrics, for death metal. he should go start a hippie band and bitch about the governemt and weed. damn damn damn six feet under."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite of all there albums","review":"This CD has the best sounding production of all of there CDs. It's loud and clear, you can easily make out the lyrics. The first 6 tracks are very catchy and stay in your mind. 13 is my 2nd fav followed closely by Maximum violence."},{"rating":"1","title":"This sounds more like a Wierd Al spoof of Death Metal","review":"after listening to this album i found myself rolling on the floor laghing at how rediculous this is. i mean seriously, Six Feet Under were already a lame Death Metal band, but this album shows how bad they really are. i also find this a bit dissapionting because Chris Barnes used to be one of the coolest death vocalists around when he played with Cannibal Corpse. but after he joined Six Feet Under EVERYTHING went to hell. anywayse if you want good Death Metal, check out bands like Cryptopsy, Deacapitated, Cannibal Corpse, Napalm Death, Origin, Nile, Dying Fetus, Cattle Decapitation, Suffoction, or Vomitorial Corpulence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less green, more creativity Barnes!","review":"I know I may not be the only one who thinks this, but ever since Chris left Cannibal Corpse, his career has been going through a downward spiral. His music is simple and repetitive, his vocals lame and annoying, and everything is just awful and dull. SFU's only redeeming value is that guitarrist from Obituary, thats it.I listened to this for five minutes, took it out in disgust, and put in CC's Kill. Instant satisfaction."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible, just about as lame as metallica","review":"Why do i even bother listening to this garbage? These guys get worse with every album, and dj dreadlock (chris barnes) should be put up against a wall and shot for trying to mix inferior nu-metal with death metal, come on know, what the f&*k were you thinking?, as if true carnage wasn't bad enough. In short if you want true death metal do not listen to this s$#t, try Drawn and Quartered, Aborted, Decapitated, Dying Fetus, Vile, Sepsism, Morbid Angel, Monstrosity, Suffocation, Vitl Remains, Death, Obituary, Vehemence, or Cryptopsy.. to name a few."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment after much anticipation..","review":"I am the happy owner of 7 SFU cd's.

Way better than the Boss Metalzone or DOD Death Metal or basically any overdrive/distortion pedal i've ever had. The only thing I can say is it doesn't seem to work that well with tube combo amps, it only seems to go really well with solid state amps which I guess makes sense since tubed amps really aren't for over the top gain, hence why dimebag used solid state."},{"rating":"2","title":"Assisted opening","review":"The Buck Folding Deep Platinum Sirus Knife is a great knife.With a spring assisted opener for one handed opening with ease.A strong knife with good looks, Perfect for anyone who carries a knife."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Clock DVA album \\"Thirst\\"","review":"This is not the album \\"Thirst\\" by Clock DVA. This is something else...apparently a film score by various artists. It needs to be relisted under \\"various artists\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The real deal","review":"In this album Peter Rothbart combines original material and prose from his brother's Found magazine letters to create a lyrically haunting debut. The unusual combination of ethereal vocals and unwaveringly precise guitar give Rothbart's songs incredible weight. Due to such precise rythm, melodic accuracy and very clean production, this album stands out from other recent young folk musicians who have gone the lo-fi route--missing notes here and there and approaching rythm with drunken lethargy. Though I think Rothbart would benefit in the future from a slightly grittier sound, the honest beauty of his music is unmistakeable, and well worth the listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"are u lonely?","review":"i was caught by the feelings trapped in 'on the verge of breaking completely down' from their website. i thought, \\"i HAVE to get their CD\\". it's nothing great or phenomenal, but if u looking for sth sentimental with lots of acoustic guitar, u might like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"garbage!!!!!","review":"Ronni Le Tekro is a genius lead guitarist.

When I was growing up I used to buy all of the albums by The Archies and watch their TV show every Saturday so this is nothing against them...at all. It is more with the distributor and producer.

So when the title states \\"20 Greatest Hits\\" I expect to see 20 songs listed...not 10."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"I hated the ending. The book itself wasn't all bad. It was just mostly bad. I love vampire fiction and this fell way way short."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Definitely Not Thirsty for More M. T. Anderson Novels After This Effort!","review":"Previously I read this author's book Burger Wuss and wasn't too impressed. Thirsty however from the blurb on the back cover looked like it would be a good interesting book. However reality is just like the way a vampire gets blood from a victim's neck, it sucked! Not even an ounce of believability this story starts off with Chris the main character attending a vampire execution in the town square with his brother. Where not talking a couple of centuries ago but set in 21st century Massachusetts. The author really needed to make up his mind which period to set this book in. The reader obviously has to assume vampires exist for this novel but we all know vampire executions don't happen in the USA today. Novels are not enjoyable if you can't believe what you are reading could be happening."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Sucks!","review":"From the cover to the end, I was disappointed. I kept reading in hopes that it would get better, but it didn't. It was a lousy ending ant the beginning just rambled on and on. I love vampire books, but I'll never read this one again."},{"rating":"2","title":"thirsty for lies","review":"Of course this book is a good book, but it isnt because its true. In fact it is very WRONG. Vampires have to be blooded, they just dont turn into them,but that is the only lie. They can tell between themselfs who are fake, not by their shadows, but their aura, its kinda of like a scent a vampire gives off.Other than that this is a very good book full of interresting things. If you want something that is true, I srongly recommend a different book. If you want a fairy tale, this book is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really absorbing book. I loved the way he wrote the end page.","review":"I really, really loved this book. It really shows the emotions and frustration that Chris goes through as he fights to restore his humanity, only to realise that he's damned forever at the end. M.T. Anderson really captured the effect of vampires well, especially Chris' lust for blood when he cuts himself while shaving and just won't stop tasting his blood. The other vampires are portrayed really well, such as Lolli and her boyfriend (I think??) Bat, with their dark personalities but very laid back attitude that fits with several teenagers nowadays. I did find it kind of wrong when Chet imitates Lolli's screams and drove Bat into a rage.I could write on about this book for hours, but I guess I'll end it on saying that this is a fantastic book. Read it if you like vampirism, as Thirsty is basically a very interesting but different take on vampirism and the forces of Light and Darkness. Anyway, just read this if you want a dark, epic story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't Put It Down!","review":"I checked this book out of my school library last year, the first chapter wasn't very pleasing at first. I was going to return it for another book, but I read more that night and was hooked! It only took me two school days to finish this book! I was very disappointed when I went to my school library today and they threw it out :(.. I am a werwolf and vampire lover. I am sad they changed the cover the other one was better showed a picture of Jack. But this story pulls you in when you least expect it and gets better by the minute! Amazing book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"Well, this book was two days of my life I will not get back. I pushed through just because I don't like to leave a book unfinished. Sadly, this book had so much potential. There were many openings where the writer could have really taken the story somewhere good. The writing itself was tiresome. It read pretty much like this \\"the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\\". The ending was absolutely horrible. It resolved nothing for the main character. Save your money on this one. If you truly want to read it, I suggest getting it from the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply wonderful","review":"I thought this book was alright. This book is mainly about this boy named Chris who wants to get with this girl but he cant because he is turning into a vampire but he does not no why.

I would recremend this book to people that like boring scary stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing puts it mildly","review":"And this book was so bizarre!Harry Potter meets the Lost Boys.But the worst thing about this book is the ending.It just falls flat. There is no ending.Chris just ends up back at square one andthe whole point of everything just read is futile.I recommend a bypass on this one.

I hate the ending, if you can call it that."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH","review":"I think this book was at most: okay?? maybe. Listen this book is too long winded to begin with because it's mostly him being whiny and doing really dumb stuff or wonder if he should have done something different.

I actually lost something, my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Lonestar","review":"It's not that this is a \\"bad\\" project by itself. It is actually better than their last 2 projects. I just find that \\"Lonely Grill\\" is the standard Lonestar has to hold themselves up to, and once again it was not met. There are of course the romantic ballads, but nothing as well done as \\"Amazed\\". It strikes me as strange that the first 2 singles off this CD were originally songs done by Emerson Drive (on their \\"What If\\" CD). In my opinion, Lonestar does not measure up on these songs. They just kind of drag in comparison to the fire and passion Emerson Drive put into it. But I suppose if you haven't heard the previoius versions these songs would be capable of standing on their own, since they both are good songs in their own right. I wish Lonestar better luck on their next CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad you can't leaf through the pages before you buy.","review":"This book claims in its introduction, to be superior to other baby names because of its accuracy but clearly it it poorly edited, with names with no meanings and meanings with no names. The bulk of the book does not define if names are masculine, feminine or unisex, and in the one section that does, there are clearly feminine meanings in the male name section. In addition, the title of the book led me to be believe that it would be ALL African names but instead, there are entire pages with no African names, but rather Eurocentric names that some African Americans have used for their children in the past. Worst of all is that some of the \\"African names\\" are not names at all. Who would name their child \\"Ugly woman\\", \\"evil\\" or after a particular \\"market place\\".

In my opinion, Gen. Longstreet was Lee's most capable and dependable Corps commander - Lee's \\"Old War Horse.\\"This book is about the 'Lost Cause' myth and how it came about, and only mentions James Longstreet in a 'few' lines. The book is very interesting and factual, but I believe the title is misleading.Buy it to read about the Lost Cause origins, but not to read about James Longstreet.PS: If you are in North Georgia, a visit to his grave site in Alta Vista Cemetery,Gainesville, GA, is well worth it.

It is nice to see something different then the usual Diego, Cars etc etc.! It comes with the pilllow case, comforter, fitted sheet and flat sheet.

This play made me feel a full range of emotions in three hours when I saw it in the theater, and reading it was almost as good. Ruella and Phoebe, the two main characters, are two of the most likable and complex people I've encountered recently in literature. It kept me laughing, and in suspense, right up through the final scene. I rarely give out five stars, but this play deserves it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as expected - I would chose the less expensive option","review":"I purchased the Hammered Steel for $25.99 on recommendation of the Martha Stewart Living magazine. At the time, I had a choice between this set and a set for hanging plants for about $8.99. I should have chosen the much less expensive set of hooks for hanging pots as those hooks came with rubber tips (Enclume hooks do not) and were probably the same or similar quality. I do not recommend spending the money on these unless you have to have the specialty finish like Copper."},{"rating":"1","title":"no communication","review":"It has been 2 weeks since I've placed the order for this item, and all I can find out is that it's not yet been shipped. If you plan to order this, allow LOTS of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The overlooked masterpiece","review":"This book is extremely imporatnt for economists - yet it is definitely mainly overlooked in mainstream economics and/or misinterpreted in some references what I saw. Actually no wonder why - it evidently shows that modern economics was based on incorrectly understood physical principles from its inception in 19 century, and in fact remains almost in the same mode now. The recent rise of econophysics just showed that from another angle. The aggregation of Mirowski's excellent histgorical findings and modern econophysical concepts is still waiting its hour. The only drawback I found in this book is some redundany, when the same thoughts are repeated several times, quite unexpectedly. It seems it could be reduced in two times without any loss of its value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baloney","review":"I bought this book with high hopes. I found, to my disappointment, that it is baloney. Poorly written -reminscent of travel literature in which every noun is preceded by at least one adjective - and incompetent. If anything the author claims is true, he has not demonstrated it. It is just a meaningless polemic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great replacement handle","review":"After both of my handles broke on my 99 Chevy 1500 K I ordered these and couldn't be happier. It took me about 20 minutes to install these each side. The hardest part is removing the door panels but if you are careful it's pretty easy. I would recommend picking up a cheap pop rivet gun and replacing the rivet you drill out to remove the handle with another rivet. If you replace it with a screw there's a possibility it will come loose. These handles are upgraded from the OEM handles and have a much sturdier feel and matched the gray interior perfectly. All around great product at a great price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Replacement","review":"I have installed the $60 dealership replacements, and the $25 parts store replacements on work trucks, and this one on my own truck. I can tell you they are all the same at least in quality and fit, and last the same amount of time. Normally, you get what you pay for, but these things are only $8 parts no matter how much you pay for them, so why pay more?It fit perfect and my door works perfect again. Will buy again...for the passenger door next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Matched great!","review":"Great replacement part, \\"Dorman Help\\" make excellent parts to fix your broken door handle or etc.Only fitment issue is the clip opening for mounting was too small (might be for rear door??)After all panels put back on all is tight and not falling apart so all is OK."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice to have my handle back!","review":"The handle is great. The only thing i did not like about it is the plastic rod holders both broke off when i was installing it other than that it is great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dprman review","review":"It's OEM and I guess that's the problem. After so long the plastic breaks, and I expect this to break again years down the road. It also takes a huge rivet which most people don't have. I had to purchase a bag just for this so I used one in the whole bag and don't know if I ever use the rest. (To be fair it did say you can use a certain size screw if you don't have the rivet.)I guess in the end, I'm not happy with the overall quality of my truck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inner Door Handle","review":"I have installed this item on my 1996 chevy pick up, it works just fine so far, has been in for about a month now, was an easy replacement and fits just like the oem taken out, nice to not have to open the window and use the outside handle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dorman 77187 Chevrolet/GMC Driver Side Replacement Interior Door Handle","review":"this was an alright product, but there was a couple of issues, first was the picture online did not match the real thing, also the lock plug for the door lock does not work, had to use the old one and cut the tab down for the old one to fit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product failed about a month after purchase","review":"Initially, I paid about $2.39 for this product and for the passenger side handle. It arrived quickly and was easy to install. I could not notice any major differences between this product and the original product. Even after installing on the passenger side, the door is difficult to open. It worked fine on the driver's side door until today, when I noticed difficulty opening the door. Eventually, the lever snapped off the handle. I am not thrilled to have to keep opening my door from the outside when exiting the vehicle. Now, my interior handle needs to be replaced for the second time in one and a half months."},{"rating":"2","title":"best door handle I've ever purchased, well the only one...","review":"It was a stock door handle replacement for one that was broken in my old truck.

Her book, a project in itself, no doubt, is as clear and well-organized as the work plan you'll be able to create when you finish reading it. As befits an author in the hands-on \\"Smart Things to Know\\" series, Deeprose provides charts, tables and worksheets for designing project activities, as well as a dandy summary of key points at the end of each chapter. She addresses planning in detail and offers examples of how to organize and present your project's master plan. While she does not skimp on straightforward logistics, the author emphasizes complex projects, where you have to plan for multiple activities and work with a team of people handling tasks of varying intricacy. Some of the general ideas about planning might be fairly familiar and obvious, but We recommend this book for its greatest strength: a solid presentation of specific procedures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Format doesn't make sense...","review":"OK so it is a cute story. BUT....* The glow in the dark format is ridiculous because in order for the moon to glow on each page, you would have to expose each page to the light one at a time. Before bedtime.* Even if you DO expose each page to the light so the moon will glow in the dark, you can't READ the book in the dark because you can't read the words! or see the dark-colored animals! The glow won't be seen because you need a light to see the words.* Just what IS that glow stuff anyway? Because it has a texture, my toddler scratches it and it worries me that she gets that stuff under her fingernails...is it toxic?I would not buy this book again. There are just so many good books out there that this is just not worth the $."},{"rating":"2","title":"A metal ring mechanism would be worth the extra 50 cents","review":"This is a nice bell and works well for a child's bike. It does seem cheap to have a nicely made metal bell with a plastic ringer. For the extra 50 cents just make a nicer ringer like the older \\"vintage\\" bells. My only complaint about the sound is that the ringing does not persist past the push of the lever (forward and back). If you loosen the bell it can ring longer, but then of course you risk having the lid fall off. Most children won't care about details like this, so if the price is right go for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"YOU'RE BUYING THE WRONG CD!","review":"Yes, this is the great PBBB 1st album (actually, the 2nd, see below), but it's not the CD you should be buying.This domestic CD was released in 1990 and has never been remastered.The import 2CD version of this title (backed with the PBBB's 2nd album \\"East West\\") is the one to get. It was remastered by Bob Irwin in 2001.Ditto for \\"Pigboy Crabshaw\\" & \\"In My Own Dream\\"; the 2004 import 2CD is also remastered (and sounds incredible) and the domestic CD's are not.Why WEA and Elektra have not made these four remasters available domestically is a mystery.Don't waste your money on these inferior versions: Get the imports!Also: Don't miss the \\"Original Lost Elektra Sessions\\" CD, which was the real first PBBB album, recorded before this one.

I've been blown away by the music ever since. It never gets old or too familiar to me. There is such a drive to the sound and an intensity that is non pareil. Butterfield was only 23 when he made the album but had the wisdom and vision of a man twice his age. Haven't heard a band that can touch these guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"The essence of early '60s electric Chicago blues.","review":"This was the first blues album I ever heard and it locked me into a history of appreciation for hard driving harp and guitar. Besides Butterfield's note bending, you get to hear Mike Bloomfield and Elvin Bishop trade licks on some really soulful guitar. The first stop for appreciation of Butterfield, as well as Chicago blues. Note: The original jacket liner suggests that you play this album at the loudest possible volume.

I can tell you what I thought of it. It was okay. The young actresses were all pretty good. The adult actresses are merely there to lend their names, to show us what happened to the girls, and balance the \\"then\\" sequences with \\"now\\" sequences, so they can't really be expected to give excellent performances. Yes, this movie was filled with cliches, which got annoying after a while, but there were some good scenes, like the scene with Crazy Pete in the graveyard and the scene where Christina Ricci's character cried about her mother dying. All in all, this movie is really what they call a \\"chick flick\\", and it isn't one of the better ones, but it has its moments."},{"rating":"2","title":"a really cool movie","review":"i think this movie is really good. and the casting is good too. i really like everything about it especially when the girls are younger discovering heaps of stuff and growing up \\\\, talking about all the things teen girls talk about. so i think this is definitely a girl movie. go see it u will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth It","review":"I remember loving this movie growing up and when I found it on amazon I was excited to finally watch it again...Now I remember why I loved this movie so much, you can relate to these girls.

It was good in that the story was told fluently by the mature acting of the young cast. I think the adult cast merely cameoed. In fact, Rosie O'Donnell and Demi Moore's face looked devoid of emotion most of the time. But the young cast was brilliant. The camaraderie among the four girls was brought out in such an awfully touching manner. A good movie about childhood should be one that leaves the audience wishing people never have to grow up, and this was one of those movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"stand by me rip-off","review":"This was the biggest rip-off of the much better film Stand By Me.

Maybe its because I love 'Stand By Me' (and you gotta admit they have their similarities) but all in all, this is a movie that I have grown up with and has been the movie that me and my mates watch (religiously) whenever we go round each others houses. It is a movie that not only has a great storyline, but also a great soundtrack that gets you in the mood for a laugh. The added bonus of Brendan Fraser (hubbada hubbada hubbada) makes this all the more worthwhile! Anyone who doesnt even give this movie a go (for unknown, twisted and strange reasons) should be damned to the darkest regions of hell and made to watch old re-runs of some really BAD 70's american 'comedy' television series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch this movie!!

Trust me!","review":"Gather up your three best gal pals, one of those extra-large containers of popcorn (c'mon, you know you put it for some special occasion!), some soda, a nice comfy spot, and put Now and Then in your closest VCR and you'll thank me.I first watched this at camp last summer - as part of a movie night where a blustery rainy day had turned to night and the counselors decided it was time to stop complaining how bored we were, it was time to watch a movie. So, in our bunk where she brought in a television and VCR (which, to our amazement, made us all want to sneak into the counselors' lounge more often than we already wanted to), we watched Now and Then beginning to end. Occasionally we cried. Often we laughed. But we had bonded over a movie that clearly described what we were - stereotypical 12 year old girls.Watch Now and Then. If you're a preteen, teenager, or just 13 like me, you'll re-watch this again and again.

It reminded me at times of Graham Greene's The Power and The Glory (one of my favorite novels, and another book about struggles with faith and religion gone wrong), and as other reviewers have noted, it's the kind of book that is hard to put down. It's also a harrowing story about abuses of power, which can make the novel's images hard to confront at times. The Book Of Night Women may be his current calling card, but James' work here is also worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of \\" Ye Are Gods\\"","review":"This is most excellent work inspired by God.

They're obviously only concerned with 1/4 mile times/mph and cost of build. The video is jerky, and often the microphone isn't passed to whoever's talking.

Its primary focus is on parenting your baby in the NICU, and its filled with advice on how to handle your baby, ways to provide comfort and more protection and assistance in interacting with professionals in the NICU. Overall it is a comforting book which introduces you to the astonishing world of neonatal intensive care.The title is really a bit of a misnomer, as what the book does best is provide information for the new parent, especially one whose baby is doing relatively well and is not extremely premature. For someone whose situation is more fragile, I would recommend this be supplemented by one of the more extensive books in our recommendations on prematurity.org. However, there is a broad audience for this book, as most preemies will do well in the NICU and after; for those parents this is a gentle and supportive introduction."},{"rating":"1","title":"useless after the first few months and outdated","review":"I bought this after my twins came home and it was a waste of money.

No Way!","review":"Although I have a copy of the original 2000, hardcover edition of this book (titled Boring Postcards, with the \\"USA\\"), this edition looks to be basically the same, but with a slightly different title and cheaper binding. This is a collection of photographs of postcards from the \\"what were they thinking?\\" school of public relations and tourism promotion. It's kitsch, it brings back childhood memories for Americans who grew up in the 1960s and 1970s, and it's fun, pure and simple. After looking at these examples of poor planning, aesthetic ineptitude, boring \\"scenery\\" and all the rest you'll never look at a rack of postcards in a gift shop the same way again. Although boring postcards are still out there, they just don't make them like they did in the 1950s-1970s.

Nothing is explained and the ending leaves you wondering in mystery where these people came from, why they wanted to do what they did, and what happened which wanted to make them do what they had to do.Not to mention the blood, gore and unnecessary swearing in this film, it was an absolute waste of time.

Aliens awake, nurse him back to health, teach him their language, help him get back to a laboratory, and finally allow him to join them in their next Little-Big Sleep to wait out the development of spaceships. The story is a mite bit shallow but the moral teaching is the point. Do the Right Thing and you will be rewarded. I have liked this story since it was first published and if you like medium-hard SF you will too."},{"rating":"1","title":"buyer beware","review":"I puschased this book on a whim after searching for novels specifically about this subject. I was hoping for something with some well thought out scientific basis. This story does not have it. Buyers should be aware that this is not published by a mainstream publisher. It's a publisher that specializes in allowing unpublished authors to get in print. The narrative has some vivid moments, but for the most part the characters are generic and flat. If you are fascinated by paranormal or psychic events, you may find this novel interesting, but in my opinion it is a very amateurish effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"blistering guitar","review":"all of these recrodings were made between 1952-1959, and they show why Clarence Gatemouth Brown was such an influence on so many gutiar players after him.

Those who credit his work know nothing about Mormon teachings or the Book of Mormon since many of the things he brings out as true are out of context and completely false. On the other hand, those who use just a little intelligence can easily decipher his motives and quickly see his errors.

I've researched the Church a lot, and yeah I don't know everything, no one does, why should we have all the answers now? True, us members don't know everything about the Church but there are a lot of scriptures to read and memorize! Even if you don't believe, this is America, and this country was founded on religious freedom. Please do not discriminate against me or any one else that believes something that you don't, whether it is Mormons, Catholics, Jews, Buddhists, Satin worshipers, or gays.

I was looking for a book to educate me, not equip me with the best vitrialic one-liners to retain in case I get in an argument with a Mormon. I'm still looking for a book that is not biased one way or another. I suppose I'll just have to suck it up and read the Book of Mormon itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing here that will make sense to a Mormon","review":"While I welcome accurate criticism, this book falls far from the tree. If you are a Protestant or Catholic wanting to convert Mormons to your brand of Christianity, using this book will really make you look dumb. Anyone that has been to LDS Sunday school or skimmed the Standard Words (King James edition of the Holy Bible - Old & New Testaments, Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, Pearl of Great Price) will think someone asking these questions is brain washed and you won't get anywhere with them. This book is clearly to keep Protestant flocks from looking too far outside their own world, not for getting LDS Christians to move away from their faith."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I have been taught,and I'm78","review":"I am a member of the church. I thought I would read this to see what could be so horrible that someone had to write a book about asking member of the LDS faith questions. Couldn't this author ask someone themself?Sharing the teachings of Christ with anyone is wonderful.I am concerned about the untrue statements. That the church does not believe in the Bible. Every Sunday, since I was little girl, we have learned teachings from the bible. Old testament, New testament, we believe the scriptures to be true. The only reference to it being traslated correctly is that we prefer the King James Version and do not use others, such as Amplified or NIV. I have never heard anyone say the Bible is not true.We also believe The Book of Mormon, Another Testament. It testifies of Jesus, who we do believe is our redeemer. I would not recommend this book. The author seems to be bias, and misinformed.Note:my daughter typed this for me, thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"misleading title","review":"This is not filled with things to say to a Mormon to try to reassure them, console them, or make them feel better.

It is well documented in numerous other sources, that this religion has changed, and dramatically, over time. If nothing else, that would make me questions a religion.It's a free country-SO FAR! And, because of that, no none MAKES us be any religion, one way or another. There are many countries around the world where killing is the accepted form of trying to convert people to that religion.

As a Latter-Day Saint (Mormon), I find that those bashing other religions are the people that are the most Un-\\"Christian\\" of them all! Myself, I will continue to exhibit a Christlike example by saying that I will pray that these sort of people have a change of heart towards them feeling that it's ok to hurt others...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anit-Mormon Trash","review":"Look, if you want to read Anti-Mormon trash, this book is for you. If you really want to find out what Mormons believe, just ask one. They tell you what they believe without 'forcing' you to change. You find out the truth, make your own decisions, and do what you gotta do. No ifs, ands, or buts. Do go wasting time with someone obviously bitter and hateful (doesn't seem Christian-like to me)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not particularly poignant","review":"Shortly after starting to read this book I noticed such bias hatred. I normally would have stopped reading, but of course couldn't because I was interested in what other untruths he's written about. It is obvious this author isn't interested in inter-faith discussion, rather bible based bashing. He at no time uses the bible to teach properly, he uses it as a means to separate and divide Mormons from a heartfelt gospel teaching. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone seeking to find answers on the Mormon faith, that is unless you're looking for a confrontational explanation and tools to alienate any future dealings you might have while attempting to bring others to Christ, Mormon or otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Author Needs to Check His Sources","review":"Just as the author says that the Mormon religion has falacies, so does the author. As a writer it is important that you find accurate information about the topic. This author did not. He is an anti-mormon that wishes to lead people away from learning true information. I admit that all questions in the gospel are not answered. What religion does answer all the questions of the human mind? None. If you truly want to learn more about the church, find a book that is written by a Mormon apostle or prophet."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Meaning of Life","review":"I appreciatte that the author is writing about respect and compassion but I don't understand how anyone can have time to worry so much about another religion let alone another person's chosen beliefs. As a fellow Christian I believe in following our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ - and his first commandment was to love one another - not to prove each other wrong. I don't think you need a book like this to tell you how to treat mormoms, catholics, buddists, jews, or any other religion. The Bible already told us how to treat our fellow man - as ourself! Just love them. And don't worry about the rest - that's God's job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"What makes Anti-Mormons to be so destructive?

Perhaps written by a former member of the Church that was dis-fellowshiped? Hmmmm.........And no, I am not LDS. In fact, I'm Jewish. However, I lived in Provo for two years, and found my Mormon neighbors to be very lovely people. I was never \\"black balled\\" or shuned. They were all helpful and nice.

Approximately 137,000 babies will have been aborted. You can't tell me that while Christianity is under threat globally, attacking Mormons is the best use of our energy. Even if they don't accept the Nicene creed, they are not the biggest threat. This book's strategy is to straighten deck chairs as the Titanic sinks.

It was a nice thought, but it sounds like they didn't arrange much studio time to pull this one off. It lacks 100% of the emotion of the first version and the added rapping segment is completely disrupting to the whole thing. The piano intro is nice and it's too bad the entire things wasn't just the piano being played and Paul Hewson belting out his trademark line from 1984.I'd give this one a miss.

This CD outshines both and I highly recommend it. The recording makes you feel like you are in the bar with them. If you listen closely, you can hear Brewer Phillips' amplifier crackling. Bar patrons talk to them between songs, though I wish they had just left the tape running. The band has a lot of energy, though I sure wish they would tune together once in a while. If you only get one Hound Dog CD, definitely get this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Musical and Spiritual Masterpiece","review":"This album is a wonderful spiritual journey. The music is inspiring and uplifting. Exodus is a particularly dramatic work giving a magnificent telling of the story of Moses.

Each video has a clear theme and explains concepts in a simple, straightforward manner making it very palatable to my 3 year old. He has been watching these videos since he was a toddler engaged by the vivid imagery and is now enjoying them for the interesting knowledge he's gained. I was having trouble finding nature videos for kids that didn't mask the inherent entertainment value of nature itself with song and dance and cartoon characters. I never feel guilty playing these videos for my children because they are truly learning about the world around them in an intelligent way. This series is a refreshing take on nature education for children and one that even we adults can enjoy and learn from."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst yet","review":"Hadn't updated my greeting card software in a few years so was looking forward to this updated Hallmark version. As an owner of previous Hallmark, CreataCard, Print Shop and Printmaster software, I expected this newest version to be as good or maybe even incrementally better. It wasn't. Rather, just the opposite.Very limited card selection sentiments (i.e. no risque humor), pale and washed out graphics, no business card functionality, awkward maneuvering and limited editing flexibility during creation are some of the many reasons for rating this product poor.

Noticed right away that the nice graphic telling you how to flip the paper over to make a 2-sided card was much smaller and much more difficult to see how I should flip the paper to the correct orientation, but I didn't let that deter me.Graphics are nice, and you get a reasonable selection, but once you narrow your search down, it isn't that impressive of a selection anymore, and really didn't add that many more cards from the last version. You will eventually run into problems printing particular cards for which Sierra has posted fixes. However...After some update (need to keep Windows updated after all), I can no longer print any cards. Sierra takes forever to fix their bugs or to help you out.

I loaded it onto my computer and sat back to be amazed at all the new \\"stuff\\" that I believed would have been added. I was so disappointed. For starters, the entire format has been changed. There were fewer cards to pick from and apparently, users of this program have no reason to send a get well card, because that entire catagory doesn't even exist on this program! Basically, this program is a smaller \\"updated\\" version of Card Studio Deluxe 2, because there were fewer cards and many repeats from my previous version.

My only problem is that the description says it's sterling silver, and all the other sterling silver items I have usually get that cool dark tarnish, which adds a good bit of depth to the piece...that's not happening with this bracelet, which I'm interpreting as the item being silver-plated rather than sterling silver - but then I'm not a silversmith. The depth added to emphasize the dimensions and intricacy of the weave was part of the reason I originally wanted this bracelet! But I still enjoy it, and have been wearing it for about a month & a half now. It's a great deal for the price paid!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit blingie","review":"Product is as described, both written and in the image.

Breaking the drive from its enclosure and either putting it in a new external enclosure (which will come with a new USB controller), or installing it into a bay on your computer, may fix the problem.

So many of my Tebaldi friends have old copies of this, and figure, why bother to buy it again?Why bother? Because you will feel you are at the FRONT ROW of the theatre.

No need for Syrup of Ipecac when you have a monograph like this around!

It reads as if you might imagine overhearing an art critic talking to another art critic, except on a cell phone with spotty service, only picking up a few sentences at a time.

I dont know what because I did not follow them since.Theres also a remix of the Telephone Song which is good.Have no fear, all the previous albums were stellar, even back in the Organization and Neu days and the organic sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, Interesting Album From Kraftwerk","review":"This is certainly Kraftwerk's most accessible and commercial-sounding album. The songs are all very dancey in a robot kind of way if you know what I mean. Fans of Kraftwerk probably understand that I am sure. \\"Techno Pop\\" and \\"Electric Cafe\\" are probably my favorite songs on the album but I really like all of the songs. This would be a good album to buy for those new to Kraftwerk who want to ease into their music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Part of a great concept, Kraftwerk","review":"This was the latest disc I wanted buy from Kraftwerk, don't know why, perhaps thinking that being one of the latest creations of them I would be a bad. You would not be disapointed on buying this disc, it preserves all the great sound of the early Kraftwerk. All the tracks are great, my favorite is \\"Music non stop\\", as they explicity said someday, \\"let the music speak by itself\\", this track speaks about its origin and all the hard work they have done for the music, you would never be dissapointed about this group, all their discs are snazzy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kraftwerk-More than just into it!","review":"Kraftwerk isn't just another techno. They invented it. I bought this CD the day it was US released in 1985, then it was on vinyl, I've since upgraded to CD of course. Play this CD with Dolby Surround and a sub and it will change you life... Buy it now! I have every US available Kraftwerk release and Boing isn't the best, where I rank Computerworld, but it is as usual, very well-produced and clean and original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Furious","review":"The most fun you can have with chemistry without blowing up the lab!A natural writer, Turin is both a genius scenteur and scientist. His theory makes complete sense (no pun intended) despite the opposition from entrenched adversaries in the field.Endows the reader with the vicarious excitement of iconoclastic discovery while honestly acknowledging the frustration of presenting it to the politics of peer-review for publication.Yet it is a breezy read, hilarious in parts, and completely entertaining! Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"After reading Chandler Burr's \\"The Emperor of Scent\\" I was anticipating a great contrasting book written from the scientist's point of view. Although Luca is a brilliant scientist and showman...he is not a great author/book writer. The book was a dismal disappointment a choppy one person view monologue. The subject of how Luca turned academia on it's ear by proving the vibration theory of smell....is fascinating. The story of the perfume industry and it's rich history.....mesmerizing. Unfortunately, the tale is well told not in Luca's own book, but Chandler Burr's book \\"The Emperor of Scent.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"What snow gauge?","review":"So - they didn't actually carry snow gauges - poor customer service too!

I'm more into Sci-fi and drama. We recently brought home a beagle puppy and when I saw these movies about a beagle I thought they might be fun. They were. These are not movies about a super dog, or a dog that acts like a human. They about the responsibilities of owning a dog, the challenges of doing what's right, and being a person of integrity. I brought them with me to a Christmas Family reunion and we watched all three straight through. Everybody loved them. All ages of us. I wish there were more of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"two words ----\\"NO MUTE\\"","review":"Seems like a fine phone, except how can you design a speakerphone with no mute?

I tried to return it per the vendor's instructions, which was to call the manufacturer with no success. I called several times and was instructed to leave a voice mail, which was never returned. I finally called Amazon who had to intercede to get my refund. The second phone does seem to be working properly at least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last!","review":"Features were fine for what it was used for. Got it as a backup phone for my mother when the power is out which is often. Installed in the laundry it worked fine the first year but was literally only used a half dozen times as the house is vacant 6 months a year. 2nd. year it started giving a little static when used but we thought it was bad phone lines. It finally crashed our whole phone system because of the feedback which was fixed immediately after this unit was unplugged. Can't recommend this phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't play in DVD Bath,UK","review":"This DVD was purchased as present for my Mother in Bath, UK and wouldn't play in her DVD player.She was looking forward to it as she lived a lot of her life in Rhodesia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chose Carefully","review":"The film, Adventures Of Tartu, is a one of the best WW II British propoganda films. Robert Donet is one of the finest actors of that era. However, the video and audio transfer of the film by Alpha Home Entertainment Studio is terible. The video is dark and the audio is way out of sync (so badly it is unwatchable). I did not return the copy of that DVD because it would have cost more to return it then to keep it. I then ordered another copy of the film (from another source) manufactured by Terra Studio (which is also available from Amazon). The Terra Studios copy was of much better quality and is well worth watching. Be careful of the source. It would be nice if Amazon would post Studio specific reviews for DVDs rather then compiling multiple manufactures reviews into all like DVD titles."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Adventures of Tartu","review":"I like the movie, and Robert Donat does a great job as usual, but the audio is not that good.

While you read it, you'll be reminded that we all have choices in life and that all of us can and should be 'doing work that we love.' I found this book very empowering. The text is easy-to-read and follow, the exercises are very insightful, and the \\"Aphorisms and Reminders\\" at the back are extremely empowering. I found myself jotting them down in places I could see them, and I still review them to keep me motivated. I felt so empowered by this book that I made the decision to leave my job in search of Work That I Love and I have never looked back. Cheryl Gilman provides a forum for you to explore your own options, be it staying where you are, or moving on...the CHOICE is up to you!

I thought it looked pretty cute as well so I caved... what a mistake! This is the worst designed product! It has no support, so when you carry it (kangaroo style) the thing folds in on itself and creates a very uncomfortable ride for the ferret! Not to mention, if a ferret is unhappy with it's environment, it will throw a VERY big ferret fit. After scratching and pawing at the front pack for 5 minutes, my ferret figured out that she could easily unzip the pouch and hop out.

Many books try to do this, but don't quite do it the way this one does it for me. This book shows you how to detect \\"smells\\" in code that need attention. More interesting is how a so-so/poor program can be turned into an elegant piece of engineering that is simpler to read and understand.In addition:* It's well written.* Indirectly shows you how to make better OO code* Section on identifying \\"bad smells\\" in code is dead on.* JUnit - a testing framework introduced in the book is fantastic.Must get. - Best programming related book I have read this year (2000)."},{"rating":"2","title":"refactoring","review":"a good and clear book for improving your code in small steps. a lot of (not language specific) good examples."},{"rating":"1","title":"Refactoring is needed on the book","review":"I agree mainly with all the comments below 3 stars.
