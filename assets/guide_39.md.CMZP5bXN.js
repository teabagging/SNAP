It explained some of the mystery surrounding Robert Johnson and why people were so enthralled by him. The main character was a pathetic soul until rescued from the trash heap by Kiki. Their platonic relationship created their salvation, as she found a purpose to live and Soupspoon finished his life searching out is past. I found the characters realistic and also pitiful. Moselys' gift is to transport the reader back in time and show him the rich history that makes up our culture.I recommend this book to music lovers and lovers of fiction everywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully touching","review":"There are some writers whose talent is so special that you want to save their books and make the reading of them an occasion. Walter Mosley is one of those writers. He invests his characters with such depth, such full histories that you cannot help but care about them. RL's Dream is populated by a cast of such characters; even the most minor ones (including a baby) are fully fleshed and very real. Soupspoon and Kiki are two almost-lost souls who bring each other back to life in unexpected ways. It is a credit to Mosley's rare and splendid talent that the book itself resonates with music; its cadence is almost audible in the spare prose, the all-too-human behavior of people who, often, do things without even really knowing why. To comprehend the blues, to put words, literally, to a musical theme and to do so in a kind-hearted and deeply understanding fashion is to deliver magic in the form of a book. This is a \\"must read\\" novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"a pretty good yoga mat","review":"All in all this kit is pretty decent. It comes with an instructional tape that tells you how to use the other tools that come in the yoga kit. For the yoga practice that I do, I didn't really need the other tools. But if this is part of your practice, then it's worth it.As far as the mat goes, i like using it but find that, with some activities, it slips underneath me. Also, the mat rolls up a lot on the end so sometimes that can be annoying. Overall though, the mat serves it's purpose. It would probably be more useful to use this on a hard surface than on a carpet. That way it may not slip as much."},{"rating":"1","title":"yoga kit","review":"The yoga matt itself is ok but it comes with a video TAPE and unfortunatly I don't have a VCR anymore.

The Choir of Trinity College, Cambridge presents these in a clear, exuberant, though controlled style.

At this price, I would consider them a good deal, despite a few defects. They are basically decent glasses, not too heavily weighted on the bottom. Because of the extra weight on the bottom and the large circumference they are fairly sturdy, but can be a little bit difficult to hold if you have small hands. The frosting on the glass is NOT perfect, pretty uneven in fact, but you don't really notice if you aren't staring at it. To clarify the other review, the glass' walls are about 2 millimeters thick, by my measurement. Not so thin, but the quality of the glass (not so good) makes it feel fragile. Also, they do come with stickers on the bottom, but I had no problem peeling them off, and the residue was easily removed with soap and water. For the price I paid, I am satisfied with the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are we playing the same game?","review":"Maybe I picked up a rogue bootleg copy of this PSP title, but it seems like everybody else here was diggin on this and I was just..well not. The missions are repetitive, the variety of guns/armor/villains are nonexistant, and the aiming on the wee PSP screen is barely a pinprick. It's also shorter than any video game I've every played. Side by side to GTA Vice City stories this is basically a mini-game. I'd say if you find it used for less than $10 and need something to do on an airplane go for it.

A song about shapes has the viewer identifying circles, squares and triangles in Busytown storefronts, and then those shapes are isolated and outlined so your child can see a direct correspondence between objects and geometric shapes. All the songs are done in a similarly clear manner without a lot of overload. The children's voices are robust and refreshingly non-professional.

It was a breath of fresh air. Beautifuly written, without being 'over-written', and almost magical. It is a story centered around a time where things were rapidly changing..the late 50's. I can easily say it is one of the best books I've read this year.Some of her prose were so lyrical I almost had the urge to haul out a highlighter. It certainly won't be the last Hoffman book I read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new reader who will read more","review":"Between quirky, poignant, sad, and hopeful, I found Hoffman's Seventh Heaven to be an interesting and quick read - but that \\"quick\\" read didn't impede the power of the novel. Tucked in these pages were characters who \\"shouldn't\\" be likeable; characters who make bad choices, or even harmful ones; characters who seem dark and damaged, but some how the light bursts out of them all the same, and somehow the author made me care and love them, and even feel that lump in the throat I don't often get.This is my first Hoffman book and I will be reading more."},{"rating":"1","title":"put me to sleep","review":"I didn't care for \\"Seventh Heaven\\".

I kept thinking that she was eventually going to center around Nora Silk, but she really never did. I think if she had done that, then there would have been more of a storyline.

Sad but not depressing.","review":"I have never read Alice Hoffman before but I liked this book. There is an air of mystery to the strange little neighborhood she describes.

A page turner."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was expecting far more from such a renowed writer.","review":"There was no real strong connecting bonds between the characters. Far too many characters were continuously introduced and consquently it was difficult to feel that you got to know any of them in depth. There was no real theme that you could get a hold of and the ending followed suit as I found it rather meaningless. Also she didn't really have a good handle on what the late 50's were really like. Heck I was a teenage babysitter in the late 60's and all I got was 25 cents an hour....I was absolutely amazed that Nora's teenage babysitter got paid 4x that amount!! This was the first Alice Hoffman book I have read and it was a let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst Alice Hoffman novels","review":"I'm an Alice Hoffman fan, having read her short stories and some of her more recent novels. Seventh Heaven was a disappointment. At the start, the theme of estrangement among the women in the transition from the 1950's to the 1960's seemed promising. But the characters were shallow and were never fully developed. The prose seemed distant and not particularly insightful about any of the characters' interior lives. Her novel the Ice Queen had an emotional intensity/depth and beautiful metaphorical imagery that was completely lacking in Seventh Heaven. I would recommend other books by Alice Hoffman but I wouldn't recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A plodding book","review":"I enjoyed The Dovekeepers by Alice Hoffman so much that I decided to give another of her books a try.I wondered why I persevered with Seventh Heaven as it was laborious reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greater than ever","review":"Lynyrd Skynyrd is the GREATEST southwest band ever to live!. and for the stupid reviewer who says skynyrd sux, his momma mustve not been very smart cuz she didnt teach him well. hey loser... get off this site"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Service","review":"One nice thing about using Amazon, Predicatbility!

I think Alcorn creatively offers a somewhat viable solution to the race problem in light of biblical theology. As an African-American, it still saddens me that some white envangelicals can love the Bible and miss the need for compassion, repentance, and reconciliation in Christ. Alcorn is right in that many Christians did particpate in slavery, Jim Crowism and even racism today. This is sin! However, once again, in the name of being biblical, some evangelicals would rather stick their heads in the sand and claim \\"sola scriptura\\" instead of practicing \\"true Christianity\\". I applaud Alcorn for raising the racial issues without excusing African-American Christians on their need to forgive (a point I thought he did not soften!). The American church will hang her head in shame before God if she doesn't come face to face with this issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Currently, I am recommending this book more than any other","review":"Alcorn has captured a composite American urban scene, with its pathos; distresses, answers...herein hope is offered only because things seem just a little less complicated after travelling a while with his characters.

Alcorn is one of my favorite Christian authors. While this book is over 600 pages, it is well worth the effort to make time to read. It touched my life and I plan to read other books by Randy Alcorn. I liked the way Alcorn so vividly addressed the many racial problems in America. Clarance Abernathy, the main characther, a conservative black American, seems to be so real and genuine. The scenes in heaven by his deceased sister and loved ones is most poignant.Keep up the great work Randy Alcorn and may God bless your ministry...Eternal Perspective Ministries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read Alcorn's Deadline first, but then be sure to read this","review":"Great plot along with much thought provoking info about blacks in America"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"The story kept me going. While I was not enthused about the names particular races are called, and the fact that there were a few uncomfortable moments in this book, I felt that it was written splendidly. The use of slurs actually helps to make the story more realistic, and it didn't feel like someone had written 'just another book.' Real life has ugly parts to it, and this book exposes some of those ugly parts, while also presenting some sound Gospel truths.I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good, honest, real book to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"First off I have to say I loved the scenes about heaven. Second to those who thought that the book was only about race, they need to look a little deeper.

I love the view of Heaven, from someone who has truely studied what the Bible teaches us about Heaven. Also, I am not someone who buys into playing the victim for any reason; whether it be for your race or handicap or position in life. I haven't always bought into the fact that Blacks are still oppressed because they're not. However, this book did open my eyes in many respects to show me the mind of the black community.

Unfortunately, after reading only half of the book, I felt & still feel as though I were under spiritual attack; I could not finish the book. The magnitude of information on black/white racial history and gangs is OVERWHELMING. I learned from Mr Alcorn that all caucasian Americans are generationally culpable for the poverty, social ills leading to gang culture, and inequality of black Americans since the first black slave stepped foot on North America.

However, if you aren't a Christian or don't care about God or heaven read the story anyway as the theological elements are wonderfully woven into the story and add to the drama.

I was so very surprised to find out that Randy Alcorn was not black. He captured the life and trials of the African-American experience so well.

The writing is excellent, and the story is compelling. It is a great novel, regardless of subject matter... as Christian literature it is at the very top! I found it hard to put down.

This one I couldn't pick up. It also suprises me that Randy is not black. That cover he did well, because reading the book you just felt that the author was black.

Hopefully she will do better next time..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Significant","review":"The most entertaining part of the book was the first chapter. After that, I had to force my self to continue reading the book. I believe that Ms. Siplin had a great idea for a story line. However, it lacked continuity and a real development of the characters. The author had the ability to pull me into the story, but made it difficult to keep my attention.

Touching and often very funny as well- not an artistic triumph, but it more than held my interest. Wish they had more footage of Wassa and a little less of Miss Jonel's whip! The performers are absolutely spectacular and deserve full marks for their courage in doing what they do in Zumanity: present a vision of sexuality that is more...well,..

The slow movements are played beautifully, with delicate and emotive ornamentation, while the fast ones are exciting and, well, fast. The cello sound in the contnuo is also rich, with just the right character. My only problems are with the harpsichord part. As a (very amateur) violinist, I own the Barenreiter edition of this, and noticed that the right hand harpsichord part seems sometimes to be missing. This detracts from the music - for example, in the first mvmt of the D major, while the violin is resting, the harpsichord should play the motif of the previous two bars. But doesn't. Also, in nearly all music I prefer the sound of a piano to a harpsichord (philistine that I am...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice change of pace...","review":"This tea has a little hint of citrus which works well with a very sort of mild green tea taste.

The standout track has to be \\"Diez Lagrimas\\", which has great, menaningful lyrical content furthermore, a musically sound guaguanco. As I have said many times before, Lebron Brothers are highly underrated in my estimation and should have more recognition than they currently do.

I bought these 3 movies believing I was going to see some great true crime trilogy (that's what the synopsis on back of each video made me believe) and what I actually got was a very thin thread of a possible serial killer in action, spoken in a British accent that was so thick and unintelligible that I often found myself playing the same parts over and over, trying to get what they were saying. Halfway into the second disk I decided to stop trying and just muddle thru on my own. That was probably my smartest decision. This is not a serial killer trilogy. It is a set of three different movies with 3 different plots, 3 different stars, all done in a dark moody, rainy surrounding. All they had in common was the almost impossible to understand dialogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"9 hours of my life I'll never get back....","review":"What a waste of time.

This guy is a MOTIVATIONAL SPEAKER! This is how he makes a living! The books are fairly good, but full of inconsistencies. The title book, A Child Called It..... is a good example. Only once does his mother call him, \\"IT\\"....but if you buy his last book in the series the phrase is peppered throughout... Another example I found was in the profound memories this 4-year-old child has. Nobody thinks that way as a kid.....who remembers details so vividly at the age of 4!?!... I know this guy suffered some form of abuse, it is recorded in the county records, but as the episodes morph into more bizzare forms of punishment as you buy each installment, I think there is a bit of exaggeration going on here.

The tantalising teasers left by the author in his first book have not been addressed in this, the sequel to It...let's get real here - the book's lack of objectivity contributes to this less than insightful book. I'm disappointed that Dave, once again, didn't mention his brothers and mother, where are they and what has happened to them. Why did his mother seem hell bent on having him institutionalised. Why Why Why. I need answers. And will I find them in Book 3?A disappointing read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good!!! but sad.","review":"I thought that this book was one of the better ones that I have read. This book tells how a young boy who was once abused by his mother is now able to start a different life in a foster home. This story tells about the troubles that David has to go throught to get out of his mothers abusing home. David tries to get his dad to help him but his dad knows that if he helps then it will just get David into more trouble. I would recommend this book to any one who can read it. It opens your eyes to the kind of abuse that people do not see, and the kinds that you should look for and report."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read","review":"I recommend this book to everyone. This book draws you in and lets you see and feel how David felt during this time in his life. As I was reading the last couple of pages tears came to my eyes as I could feel what he might of felt.I am a new foster parent and I wanted to get an idea of what a child may be thinking or feeling coming into my home. Pelzer's books have given me a lot of insight and I feel I can be a better foster parent by reading his trilogy. Every foster parent should read this and his other books. I can hardly wait to read book 3 of this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very touching book!","review":"This book touched me in many ways. The foster system is not perfect but does turn out extraordinary people such as David Pelzer, who use the resources available to him to gain higher ground. Although he didn't start out this way, several hard lessons help guide him to higher ground. A truly good book which provides answers to the questions in his first book.The effects of abuse often last well past the ordeal and root themselves in the victim. This is a path that no one should ever go down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very great book as good as the first one","review":"This book is great I went and got it right after I finished the first book.

Very sad story though. I recomend it for EVERYONE. I wanna get the next book when it comes out. It looks like a pretty look book its over 300 pages long but its a great book I could probably read it in about a week or 2. VERY populare book too.

Hasn't anyone read the New York Times article tracing Dave's childhood and examining the inconsistencies in his books? He peddles these books at 'conferences' in order to keep his name on the NYT Bestseller list - which is NOT an evaluation of the merit and literary value of any particular book, but just shows the general ignorance of today's reader.I'm embarrassed for the readers who actually believe the pages of rubbish. It's a sad state when books like these continue to garner attention and prey on poor innocent readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sequel To A Well-Crafted Writer's Painful Past","review":"The Lost Boy, leaving off while David is shuffled between foster care homes is another story of triumph and survival. He goes through painful lessons along the way, including the difficult task of just fitting into a family he can rely on. It's inspirational as he learns the cores of a normal life, when he is just learning to be a normal kid with The Mother as a black cloud over him.

As we embark on Dave's journey from foster home to foster home we begin to become enchanted by this young man's strong will, love for adventure, and his life in general. The realistic dialogue sends you to the psychiatrist's office, to the junior high schools, and to the love of David and his foster parents. From the first chapter of A CHILD CALLED IT I was attached. The end of this book brought played my emotional strings and warrented the immediate start of the third book (A MAN NAMED DAVE) For anyone who has ever loved a child: this is the book for you. For anyone who has ever needed a little inspiration: search no further. Dave Pelzer will indeed give you more than your share of inspiration and really bring about some serious soul-searching."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's hard to get this story out of your mind.","review":"After reading A Child Called It, I had to see what happened to Dave after he escaped his horrible family. The story that follows is a real eye- and mind- opener. Dave's telling of his journey gives the reader a whole new understanding of the foster system. As is pointed out in the book, all too often we only hear of the \\"system\\" when something goes wrong with it. Bravo to you, Dave Pelzer, for showing us something different. You are a true hero.While this book answered a lot of questions that were left at the end of A Child Called It, there are still a few more that are burning ones - specifically, WHY did his mother turn on Dave like she did? Why wasn't she or the father ever prosecuted for their horrific abuse? What became of Dave's four brothers? Readers looking for the answers will probably make the upcoming sequel, A Man Called Dave, an instant best seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as his first.","review":"I read his first book which I liked but thought this one was boring.

So when he told the police had brought his mother to court and she lost custody of David and then he got put in foster home untill he was eighteen years old. David went to foster home to foster through out the time. After he finished school he went into the states Air Force anf from there on out he had a better life."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of the same!","review":"After determining that the first book was really a work of FICTION, I started to read this book because it claimed that questions would be answered.That turned out to be a sales gimmick!There were no answers, no explanations, no closure... merely the further embellishments of the author through the foster care system.If I want fiction, I at least want fiction that is honest enough to be in the fiction section of the bookstore!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why I Liked 'The Lost Boy'","review":"I felt Pelzer was able to portray his life in a way that was descriptive and real, but in a way that was interesting and at times humorous.

Kudos for him!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Ringing True","review":"Reading Dave Pelzer's story of his troubled youth as contained in \\"The Lost Boy,\\" I constantly found myself troubled by the author's point of view. It is essentially the point of view of an adult attempting to mimic the point of view of a teenager. One gets the impression that the author laid down in print stories he had refined through repeated telling to audiences on the lecture circuit. I also found troubling the detailed recollection of conversations many years after the fact. Again, the recollections (to the extent not wholly manufactured) are heavily tinged with the attitude of an adult, not that of an adolescent."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lost Boy Is A Good Book","review":"The Lost Boy was about a boy that gets thrown around foster homes his whole teenage life. He tries to find love but it's hard because he doesn't stay in many homes long enough for that. As a young boy he gets in trouble a lot only because he wants the attention he never got. He does things that get him into trouble. Later he's not as bad and ends up finding some foster parents that love him.I liked the book a lot. It was good and I just wanted to keep reading it. The main themes of the book were survival and finding love. He was trying to survive his teen years and his foster homes. He was trying to find love because no one had ever loved him. The tone of the book was mostly the same at the first. He would get in trouble and no one would care. Then it changed to where he would get sent to juvenile hall if he got in trouble. So then the tone changed to him making friends and having fun. Overall it was a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"unforgettable","review":"In this page turning sequel to A Child Called It, Dave Pelzer brings us through his journey from foster home to foster home. Because of a small handful of caring individuals, Dave was able to escape the physical abuse of his mother and grow up to make something of himself.Reading the book gives you such a sense of helplessness because although Dave makes you feel as though you are right there with him, there is absolutely nothing you can do but watch. Perhaps this story would encourage more individuals to take action and become foster parents. The world could always use a few more good people."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lost Boy","review":"\\"The Lost Boy\\" by Dave Pelzer is a remarkable way of touching lives and giving everyday people the sense of loneliness that David Pelzer must have felt as a small child. This book tells about David's brutal beatings all the way to his crazy physiatrist. Dave Pelzer will show you how he was able to escape the living hell his mother put him through. In \\"The Lost Boy\\" David explains the amount of trouble he was involved in and how he was switched around from foster home to a juvenile prison called \\"the hill.\\"Other people you will meet in this story are Ms.Gold; which is David's social worker. Ms.Gold teaches David how to love again. If you like books about less than mediocre mothers, brutal beatings, and loving social workers, along with other drama then I highly recommend you read \\"The Lost Boy: by Dave Pelzer.

He read them and then the rest of us (his family) read these books as well as the first book in the series, A child Called It. This is an informative series about child abuse and the help that is available when someone is there to encourage the child to ask since these children are most often afraid to ask for fear that it can come back to cause more hurt. We admire Dave Pelzer for writing about his life so others can see that with help an abused child can become a useful person and a loving father."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fake Story per NY Times","review":"The NY Times covered this author and his books more than 10 years ago in 2001. None of Dave Pelzer's claims can be substantiated. This guy is a charlatan preying on people's minds and compassion. I read the books, was horrified, and then saw this article, which set me straight. This guy has made his entire career telling this false story for 15 years. His brothers say it isn't true and that he was a spoiled brat with visions of grandeur growing up. The genesis of his story of his mother \\"stabbing\\" him was actually her cutting food in the kitchen, and him moving fast around her and getting slightly poked, but not cut, by the knife. It is an outrage that someone like this has taken advantage of people's emotions for so long. His books are pretty low price, even here on Amazon. One is 7 cents? That doesn't happen to valid books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Follow-up to an amazing story.","review":"I first heard about David Pelzer's story years ago but wasn't until recently that I decided to buy his books. \\"A Child called It\\" tells all the horrible things he had to go through as a boy, but the ending left you hanging. \\"The Lost Boy\\" works as part of the trilogy as well as on its own. It's easy to read and keeps you wanting more. This man's story is truly amazing and inspiring.

It was so sad and relistic. I felt so bad for Dave the little foster child expesually when he didn't have a single foster home for him, but i am glad they at least found him temporary foster homes. You should really read this book if you like knowing about what is happening to some of our children. If you don't read this book you will miss out on the best book in this world. Even though this is more of a book for adults I still loved it and I am only 13. Also if you like a book that keeps you interested all the time you have to read this book and even though it seems long it is a real quick read when you get into the book.

I read the first two in one day. They had me so enthralled I couldn't put them down. Dave made me realize through the stories of gruesome abuse that he endured that the abuse is there in this world. He talks about the love and the want for exceptance that he carried as a child well into his adult years. Without telling too much of the book I admire the courage that David has showed to grow out of what has happened to him in his past and to give his son a better life then what he had. He truly is a model figure in this world that each reader can learn something from. To tell his story instead of bottling it up in hopes that at least one child in this world remains unharmed is the best act of love I have seen in a long time. I urge you to read all three of his books to gain the full knowledge of what \\"it, Dave, and David\\" went through. What a terrible experience. Like I said the courageous one."},{"rating":"2","title":"opened my eyes","review":"This book helped open my eyes to what children go through in Foster Care.

I picked up a Child Called It and thought that this can't be that bad many other people I had known had been reading it. I started it in class one day and could not put it down till I finished it the same day. A Child Called it was a book that made you wonder how somebody could be so mean to their own child and would want to do these kind of things. When you read it you feel bad for Dave because, he don't understand what is goin on and why it is happening to him. You have to have a open mind and a stomach that can handle things because, there are parts that get a little gross. The worest thing was that she has more than one child and they all are boys and out of all of them she just keeps picking on Dave and he never does anything to deserve it.

Also, for the reader to understand you would have to reas the firt book. The book is touching and inspirational the pain and struggles he faced let him to become a boy with faith courage and stranght. Comapred to todays life, we must realize that most of us have it easy, comapared to Dave's.

It was very heart warming and inspirational. It shows how a boy goes from an abusive, alcoholic mother to several foster homes in search for a family that really loves him. I would recomend this book to other people because it kept my attention through the last page with all the dramatic and adventures.

Mr. Pelzer pulls no punches, describing in great detail his rebellious behavior, juvenile criminal history, and his motivations for such behavior, as well as his time in a number of foster homes and juvenile hall.I found this book to be very inspirational in the way that, as a child and teenager, Mr. Pelzer somehow scrapes together the strength and inner reserve to endure and eventually persevere in the face of such terrific odds.

But that doesnt mean its bad by any means. Its not an action movie so ergo its not a overused typical action score that crashes over you. And Bad movies do not eqyual bad scores. I think Kamens use of Americana themes in this score is great. Its a great score to relax to at points. And the vocals on the last track are beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Open Range","review":"I love the Open Range Score. The western genre is one my favorites. The music is passionate, dramatic and soothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"John Williams?","review":"You really need to pay more attention to film scores if you are going to give advice. John Williams had no part in scoring \\"Dances with Wolfs\\"; John Barry was the composer. I don't have a review. I just thought I'd let you know, since you think we should listen to someone that doesn't know John Barry from John Williams. Look if you want real advice, go to www.Filmscoremonthly.com. Those people know what they're talking about, just ask them whether or not something is worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspired and Tepid","review":"Like the movie, this score needed a good strong pot of coffee. I stayed with the movie for 1/2 hour, but when I saw the plot had been rehashed a thousand times (zzzzzzzzzzzzz),I left to watch another movie. When I came I told my husband how Open Range turned out and he said I was right. As in \\"The Postman\\", this movie could not inspire a usually good composer. I think Thomas Newton Howard should have been used in this movie and a more lively score would have helped. Anything to wake us up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product!!","review":"These Spark Plugs really work! They are delivering excellent gas mileage in hot or cold weather. Starting is better as well. I have gone ahead and purchased these Plugs for my 4-cycle lawn mower engine, 4-cycle snow blower engine, 2-cycle string trimmer engine, with excellent results in all. Highly recommended! They are made out of conventional materials and yet last forever. They are much cheaper than the Iridium or Platinum types. Check out their web-site and other reviews. You don't even have to worry about gapping these plugs ........ ever.2 Thumbs up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a beautiful song","review":"*N Sync and Gloria Estefan did such a great job on this song. It is so beautiful. Their voices blend so well together. They make a great team. This has to be one of the best songs I have ever heard!! *N Sync is really great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very boring, generic","review":"The first time I heard this song on the radio, it nearly put me to sleep. It's very forgettable, and the song barely stays in your head for five minutes. It's hard to tell whether Gloria Estefan or 'N Sync is singing at times. Plus the lyrics don't make much sense and it's hard to find a meaning to the song. While Gloria's singing is pretty strong, the members of 'N Sync sound really strained, and just plain annoying as usual. I respect Gloria, but I don't understand why she chose to do a song with 'N Sync. They aren't talented at all, and she could have done a lot better. If you're looking for a better song, check out \\"Larger Than Life\\" by the Backstreet Boys. It is really upbeat and gets you feeling good."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this CD!!!","review":"I have loved the music *nsync has put out since they first came out with I Want You Back.

Technology is worthless if it doesn't bring bottom-line value.2. \\"Drum-buffer-rope\\" and \\"Buffer Management\\" are good3. \\"Pull\\" inventory management is goodAs an rabid reader and huge fan of The Goal, I was dissapointed with the delivery of this book. The fictional plot was boring and the characters were met with absolute apathy. While the above three points are repeated ad nauseum, no real background or detail is revealed on their delivery or use. Instead, Necessary But Not Sufficient is written as lengthy pieces of plot followed by short, almost textbook definitions of these business concepts.If you're looking for a more interesting and in-depth read, stick with The Goal. Otherwise, shop around for a more engaging and insightful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far and away worst Goldratt","review":"I have thouroughly enjoyed Goldratt's other books--each taught me a new framework and how to apply it. Each taught in an interesting and easy to follow manner, and applied the framework to many different problems. This book didn't do that. It restated that the concepts that we learned in the Goal, Critical Chain, and Its not Luck are good and still apply, but doesn't add anything new. As far as I can tell, the only new idea briefly appears in the last chapters-- dollar-day metrics; and seems to appear from out of the blue. On the positive side, the style of writing hasn't changed much-- its still easy to read. If you've read the previous Goldratt books, don't bother. If you haven't, don't bother--go read them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The plot is the constraint!","review":"Don't get me wrong--I'm a big TOC fan. I loved The Goal, Critical Chain, and It's Not Luck. I even bought a textbook on TOC. I was so excited for this book and so disappointed. I'm surprised anybody has given this book more than two starts. The plot is 100% non-captivating and I learned NOTHING new about TOC.Please Mr. Goldratt--Give us something good next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Student's point of View","review":"I'm a student at Tec de Monterrey, in Mexico City. I've been assigned to read The Goal, it wasn't luck and this necessary but not suficient. I have to say that when i read the goald and it's second part i really loved the book. I was introduced to this concepts like DBR and inventory management. While i was reading necessary... i thought, this is by far the worst book written by this author (also read the race).As a novel there's nothing exciting about it, is not that the other's had me in the edge of my chair, but at least there u could feel the threat was bigger, closing the factory and selling three of them.And here trying to use TOC and DBD in the technology environment just doesn't work. U could see where the book was going to end, probably cause we are living in that time where u have to make the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"When is something going to happen?","review":"Let me first start by stating that I am a big Goldratt and Theory of Constraints fan, but this book was bad. Over of the book is a statement of the problem and then a solution is proposed that is so high level it is impossible to learn anything applicable from it and I'm a Jonah. Also, the book needs some major editing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Finally finished Necessary But Not Sufficient","review":"In my opinion Necessary But Not Sufficient failed to meet the Goldratt five star standard in holding ones interest and unleashing the readers innovative juices. This book lacked an engaging quality found in The Goal, It's Not Luck, and Critical Chain. I felt detached from the story rather than part of the story.I found the book tedious and more often than not, boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"NBNS is necessary","review":"We have been hearing about the technological provess of the ERP systems that the market leaders are offering. Still, there are many clients who have not got the promised/desired results from the ERP. Why ? Is it b'cos of the ERP package or the implementation team ? ERP/APS alone is no panacea...Goldratt & his co-authors have struck at this very right point in NBNS. It says Technology is Necessary, But not sufficient. We need something more. We need to relook at our business rules, measurement indices when we go for the techno-solutions. The transformation of ERP/APS and the implementation team itself from a mere business/techno-solution provider to a bottom-line improvement enabler is etched very well. The importance of revising measurement indices like \\"throughput-dollar-days\\" & \\"inventory-dollar-days\\" is explained in very simple and wonderful manner.Certainly, a recommended read !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Sufficient, Need More Luck","review":"I agree with some of the other reviews, Goal and Its Not Luck were very helpful, and so I expected this book to give more practical examples for service industries and for more abstract and unpredictable manufacturing processes like software development. The sample company covered by the book was already growing by biblical proportions and used TOC to keep growing. I pictured this company buying up Microsoft and HP on a whim one day. How about a small to medium sized company with tough real life problems?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Medium gives mushroom tummy to dress size 14!","review":"I bought the medium, thinking it would fit me as I was dress size 14 before I became pregnant. The product came in my fifth month, when I really started to need support. I've only gained 10 pounds, so I'm not huge. The first time I put it on it felt nice and lifting. But when I put on a shirt over it I realized that my pregnant belly mushroomed over it, looking very strange. I tried adjusting the velcro but without the amount of tightness that creates mushroom belly, there's no support. This product will quickly get on your nerves and you'll find yourself donating it, like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like","review":"I tried this belt but I might have got a size too big. The strap on the top is worthless. It didn't support anything. The other pieces were too bulky and uncomfortable to wear under clothes. I ended up buying the simple one piece one at Motherhood Store and it was perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"guarenteed not to roll? HA","review":"I bought this product because I am pregnant and have trouble with my lower back and hips. I am a petite, but a big lady. I ordered the size recomended, but it was slightly too long and rubbed the top of my legs. Velcro burn is not pleasant. IT is NOT supposed to roll, but it does and the two sticks in the back dig into me. It may just be that it is not the right size, but I am very dissapointed. I Like the BELLY BRA. the elastic on the bottom rolls , but it is much more comfortable and does a better job"},{"rating":"1","title":"what is Simon thinking?","review":"I read all 3 of Simon's books on the history of Britain. I did it because I am a history buff. However, Simon writes in a way that makes it difficult to remember anything about the book. Instead of focusing on significant historical events and figures, he weaves in alot of information and persons that are either not that relevant or difficult to place in context. I think his whole series is average at best. Surely, someone can do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"for Brit Lit specialists","review":"I don't think it's something you'd want to read for its own sake unless you have a particular interest in the development of the novel in in the nineteenth century. The plot concerns the efforts of Sir Austin Feverel to prevent his son's marriage and then to break it up. There are ponderous attemps at humor. A tragic and melodramatic ending is tacked on. The story is often difficult to follow, with characters being assigned different names. Jane Austen had already shown how a a tight light novel could be constructed. Madame Bovary had been written (for the diffference between mediocrity and genius compare the descriptions of the food at the wedding breakasts in this and in Madame Bovary). This has the clumsy baggy long-winded structure of Dickens (who was writing Great Expectations at the sme time) but without the great characters and confrontations. This was popular literature in its time, and considered scandalous."},{"rating":"2","title":"almost perfect","review":"I've loved these songs since early childhood, so it was a particular delight to find this nearly perfect recording many years ago. Sioned Williams's harp playing is just right and, despite modern misgivings about Marjory Kennedy-Fraser's approach to the traditional songs of the Scots Highlands and islands, the arrangements are truly beautiful. Lisa Milne's voice is lovely. My only beef is that a very formal voice singing traditional song -- however beautiful the voice may be -- tends to sound unnatural and over-produced. That being said, this is a charming addition to my collection, and I recommend it warmly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chelsea Ceramic Goblets","review":"The Chelsea ceramic goblets have an old-world flair to the shape, which accent a table for a formal dinner, but are also casual enough for a patio party. Accessories for entertaining can make them complement any theme. The colors (sage and honeydew) are much brighter than they appear on the website, so if they are to be used with dishes one already has, might want to see the colors in a store before buying sets of goblets. I like mine so much, however because of the design, that I am going to buy complementing dishes and bowls to mix and match."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Recording","review":"In case you do not already own the Chandos CD featuring this pairing conducted by Richard Hickox, there is also this excellent recording with Vernon Handley. No, I am not going to bore you with a movement-by-movement comparison (I have not done one, and you can always read Fanfare if you enjoy more musicological exposition), I am only going to point out that these are two entertaining symphonies by a modern master, recorded in excellent sound--if you really enjoy symphonic music, this is a disk you ought to have in your collection. And if you already have the Hickox recording, then by golly, YOU can do the movement-by-movement comparison!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!!!!!","review":"lucas arnau is one of my favorite artists! if you like latin music, you will love the flavor that lucas brings to the scene. very passionate and great rhythms. a true gem!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The real on 305","review":"Do not buy this cd, the first two reviews said this is a good cd. NOPE. I'll tell ya the real about this cd. I believe this was 305's first cd, and I don't see how this cd was ever in mass production. While It does have a few decent cuts most of this cd belongs to a different artist. 305 got much of the material for this cd on Techmaster P.E.B's masterpiece Bass Computer. Any one who has both cd's can tell. If your looking for bass, you'll find it here. But you can find knock with any bass artist.

There is a lot of people in the story to keep track of, including another person named Daisy. We haven't completed the book report yet, I'm hoping for an A! With all the knowledge from reading the book, she will know more than any other girl in our troop. I'm tempted to read it myself. There is even a picture section in the middle of the book.

To listen to American Fooball. I am forever in his debt- for this alone. This album by American Football is one of the most remarkable things that I have ever heard. These songs are completely emotional, and stunningly heartbreaking. When I first heard it, I instantly grew to love it. I wanted to hear it constantly. I began playing it over and over and it never left my CD player for months on end. The beautiful guitar work, the extremely talented drumming, the soft spoken lyrics, and the pure comfort of this recording made me an instant fan. I was horrified to hear that they had dismembered, even before the record was put out. But I strongly urge everyone to listen and purchase this album.

It's filled with poorly-framed expository segments, the male major character, Messenger, is an entirely unsympathetic and unpleasant person, and the female major character, Helen, although somewhat more interesting, is unfathomably and annoyingly attracted to Messenger.

Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruined by Lodge's obsession with sex","review":"Every time the philosophical debate starts to get really interesting, Lodge interrupts it for a sexual pursuit, encounter, or reverie.

Sheppard is a decent artist, but his style isn't particularly clear, or beautiful, or any other adjective that would make it ideal for instruction.

I have no previous experience with human anatomy, and this book has not proved to be at all useful. I have found the illustrations of the more complex parts of the body (such as the vertebrae) to be generalized and vague. Because of this, I have struggled to understand how to interpret Sheppard's lines, especially when it comes to small, detailed areas. Besides that, the style of illustration is extremely dated and obnoxious.

It was refreshing and had an interesting plot for a non-fiction book: how will the acquisition and restoration of Bramasole work out? All of us who have fantasized about doing what Ms. Mayes did were intrigued. Bella Tuscany, however, is pure trash. No intrigue, no hook and outright boring. Moreover, it is poorly writtenand has virtually no educational worth. Ms. Mayes and Ed should stick to writing poetry which is not read by anyone but students. Moreover, she should leave the Cortona area alone. Citizens of the area are tired of her and the publicity she has invited. Now that she has made a few bucks, maybe she will just blend into the beautiful Tuscan environment and let the world's spotlight tarnish some other area."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good News if you HATE this book","review":"I was able to recycle mine on Amazon auctions.

The imagery is so powerful that it almost felt as though I were in Italy. It enriched my reading experience by teaching me the finer parts of Mediterranean culture -- and Mayes has done the same in a unique and memorable way. This is a wonderful book and I highly recommend it to anyone without an ax slung over their shoulder."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful book","review":"Frances Mayes is a wonderful writer who can verbally transport you to her personal adventure of living. She describes the beauty of her home in Tuscany with such a personal style, it is as if she is speaking to you. Her observations and comments about daily happenings make you feel \\"there\\"; walking the streets, weeding the terraces, buying the ingredients for a special dish, then cooking and enjoying the dish with her and her companions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Terrible","review":"I can't read this book. I have tried multiple times, but I find this author to be arrogant, emotional detached, impersonal, boring, unimaginative, superficial and in need of an English lesson or two. I will burn this book, as I could not conscientiously allow another individual to suffer the pain of reading this book.My perspective may be spoiled, as I just finished reading the Olive Farm series by Carol Drinkwater. If anyone is interested in reading about rural life in Southern Europe, then the Olive Farm series should either satisfy your imagination, or make you move to Southern France. At all cost, avoid reading Bella Tuscany by Frances Mayes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassed to be an American","review":"Frances Mayes makes me wish I were not an American. Her narrow, negative view of other parts of the world were offensive, to say the least. And her unappreciation of the efforts of her friends and family to visit her was despicable. She sounds like a despicable person and it is reflected in this book. Besides, her writing style is choppy and amateurish. Too bad she's made so much money at this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Glad I got this from the library. I hadn't read the first book, but saw the movie Under the Tuscan Sun. I found the book rather confusing at the beginning--it's like she just plunked you down in Italy and you were supposed to know about \\"Ed\\" (WHO is he? Husband, boyfriend?) and the gardner.....don't remember anything about gardening in the movie, but the book starts out with all this talk about plants and gardens. The book is 286 pages and I'm on page 80 and not sure I can read anymore. Seems like a catalog of plants, trees, museums. I thought I would get to know the Italian culture but this book seems so shallow. After reading other reviews, apparently it gets worse with her whining, so I'm not real motivated to finish it. Never did understand where she got all the money to just up and move to Italy in the first place and spend unlimited funds on renovating a house. Skip this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing after under the Tuscan Sun","review":"I *loved* Under the Tuscan Sun. I read and re-read it and loaned it to several friends. When I saw the new book I was so excited, but after reading it I was very disappointed. I think this is more a reflection of me than the author however. What I loved about Under the Tuscan Sun was the struggle and the passion and the frustration. I empathized with their hopes and dreams and vicariously shared their fears. Bella Tuscany is boring...but so is every day life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author's petty comments spice up otherwise boring book","review":"Author's very unhospitable comments about houseguests, especially the vicious gang bashing during the expats dinner, and her superior attitude and degrading comments about other people's bad Italian make you cringe for those who will recognize themselves. These things reveal far more about the author than anything else in the book. Obviously none of the good things about Tuscany have rubbed off on the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to Finance an Italian Villa","review":"at the expense of the reading public, would be a more appropriate title. How did this silly book get such good reviews. Who are these people? I'll trust the Amazon rating public before I ever trust the \\"pros\\" again. This book is weak, annoying, and just plain foolish. And I adore cooking, gardening and wine. Wish I'd thought of this idea first ... I'd be writing from Italy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite the longed for sequel.","review":"Sequels often don't hold up to the standards of the original, and this one is no exception. It's still a very pleasant travel journal about Italy, but it has no cohesive central story line. The first volume was held together by the restoration and discovery themes; this one has only some new discoveries. In fact, it has too many reveries about her childhood in Georgia for my taste. So if you enjoyed the last one and crave some more Italian life and escapism, it's here, but not altogether satisfying or exciting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monogrammed linens are stimulating stuff","review":"It was so bad I don't know where to start. I was interested in Tuscany, instead I spent my time at Ed's parents during Christmas in Minnesota, Ashley's wedding in California, hearing what Ed and Frances saw and ate .... I don't even know how to finish it. I'd like to figure out how to get my money back after having paid for the hard copy version!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Listening to her drone on made me lethargic;","review":"not recommended when you are driving. Having read Under the Tuscan Sun and refering it to my book review club where we seriously disect a book, not gloss over it, I could hardly wait to read Bella Tuscany. Better yet, I thought, I would listen to it instead. What drivel! Whereas I was ready to return to Tuscany myself, having been there about a dozen times, drive by Bramasole en route to finding a good wine, I'd rather go elsewheres now. Anywhere. Her soft Southern voice is enough to put the most rambunctous of children to sleep. Her overuse of metaphors and similies becomes more like a labor of necessity than love in this book. It's almost as though she felt she was compelled to write a sequel but had run out of things to share. Cook up the recipes in her first book and enjoy delightful meals as you read or listen to something, anything else but Bella Tuscany"},{"rating":"1","title":"Frances Mayes should have stopped after the first book.","review":"Please tell me what vacationing in Sicily and Venice, attending a funeral in Minnesota and a wedding in California have to do with Tuscany. The reader buys the book expecting several hundred pages filled with insight into Tuscany only to be bored to tears with the ramblings of a self-indulgent author. Frances Mayes has taken her fantasy of becoming the next Martha Stewart to the pinnacle. First she's a poet and travel writer, then a chef and now a landscape designer and art historian. Even Martha wouldn't attempt this many feats as a mere mortal! This book was written for one reason, to coattail on the success of her first book and to rip the reader off!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tuscauy Calender","review":"the one you show is for 2001,, we are now at the end of 2002 and going into 2003 do you think you can update the site?"},{"rating":"2","title":"As Sweet as a Tuscan Breeze","review":"I've spent many wonderful summers in both Tuscany and Lombardy and I think Frances Mayes captures the spirit of Italy perfectly in this lighthearted and entertaining book. I smiled at the sections that depicted Tuscan life and laughed out loud at the spoofs. When Mayes writes about food she makes my mouth water; her shopping trips left me with memories of my own days browsing through the shops of the many little towns that dot the Tuscan hillsides.Mayes' writing is not only wonderfully descriptive, it's absolutely flawless. It's smooth and flowing and the pages simply fly by. Bella Tuscany has made me decide to visit Italy again very soon (and to visit more of it) and, more importantly, to buy every Frances Mayes book as soon as they are published.La vita e bella, and Mayes proves it with this book. I want more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bellas Tuscany","review":"I read Bella Tuscany while I was living in a villa for a week in an area very close to where the author was living. It was magical for me to be reading about and experiencing the same quality of life simultaneously. I think Frances Mayes did a superb job of capturing community and daily life in these small hill towns. She was able to put into words my impressions and experiences. Being of Italian descent, able to speak the language, and having lived in other parts of Italy at different times, I thought Ms. Mayes was masterful in her ability to capture the esssence of life in this small community. As I was reading, I was wishing I could talk with her. If you have some familiarity with Tuscany, I think the book will come alive for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"sweet book about the sweet life","review":"This was the first Frances Mayes book I had ever read; I must be one of the few who bipassed Under the Tuscan Sun (probably because I really didn't like the movie). However, I do love to travel-though I don't have the money to go as I'd like- and I really like Italy, and for those reasons, I found this a delightful read. I love the descriptions of living the sweet life in ways that I can only dream about doing. As with some other reviewers, I find Mayes a bit \\"whiny,\\" and in this regard, she seems like a spoiled child occasionally, but overall her descriptions of people and food and landscapes and problems is just simply beautiful. She has inspired me to be a better writer. I would love to meet her one day."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good book ruined by careless error.","review":"Bella Tuscany gets off to a good start, continuing the charm of Under the Tuscan Sun. And then. And then! Author Mayes, a professor of English and native Georgian, calls Sidney Lanier's classic poem \\"The Marshes of Glenn\\" instead of \\"Glynn.\\" For shame!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty prose, but very little content.","review":"Now that her vacation get-away in Tuscany has been renovated, the olives planted ... Frances Mayes has run out of things to say. There are only so many pages of people eating and gardening and lounging in their lemonarias that one can stand. The vignettes of Italian life that made \\"Under the Tuscan Sun\\" so delightful are all but absent here. Frances Mayes and her husband appear to be spoiled academics with too much money and time on their hands. It is difficult to sympathize with their minor construction problems as if they are life tragedies."},{"rating":"1","title":"pleasant, but","review":"an ok read, (helps a lot if you like gardening) but pretty thin; leaves you wanting to find another book with a lot more substance; although parts make you crave Tuscany. Preferred Mates Hills of Tuscany. Finished reading it thinking they wrote it to finance house renovation - it read passionless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sequel Slump","review":"I enjoyed Under the Tuscan Sun but Mayes turned me off at the beginning of this book with her discussion of the Mafia. Her feeling the oppression of the Sicilian people was extremely pretentious. She should stick to describing the renovations of her home and descriptions of daily life in Tuscany. Spare us the insights about social problems and paranoia about the Mafia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Peter Mayle ripoff without the sense of humor!","review":"I have read only 92 pages of this book and I'm not sure if I can finish it. I haven't read the first book, but it has to be better than this. My impression is that Mayes is trying to imitate the success of Peter Mayles's hilarious books about restoring a house in the French countryside, but she doesn't have the wit to do so.I can hardly believe this woman is a university professor with the trite writing. Some of her meanderings on the Veneto, religion, and plants are positively painful.The cover photograpy is beautiful, but it's downhill from there.And I really don't need to hear about Ed's sexy back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I am about half way through the book and can't bring myself to read another page. I only read this far hoping that soon it would become as interesting as her first book, but sadly I feel I've wasted enough time listening to the boring rants of wine, gardens, and other writers... If you'd like to read whole chapters devoted to describing gardens and flowers and if you like to whole chapters devoted to recipes she's come across while in Tuscany, you'll enjoy this book. The only parts I enjoyed were her travels to other parts of the country."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I found this book to be slow-moving and in no way as enjoyable as her first book. She should have quit while she was ahead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spectacularly Boring","review":"I cannot understand why the first book was a best-seller. It was about an ultra-rich, ultra-materialistic women that has only a very superficial understanding of Italy and the Italian people. I bought this book to read for my book club. It was even worse than the first. No more Frances Mayes for me, ever! One of the most self-absorbed authors the book club has ever read. Hope she finds happiness in her eternal quest for the perfect stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book Club Disaster","review":"Last night my book club got together to discuss this wretched book. All of us absolutely *did not* like the book.Mayes shallow, stereotyped images disgusted me, it was as though she presented a Disney-fied version of what the citizens of Tuscany were like. Mayes comes across as a snob, and one who doesn't even live an interesting life. She's rude, but not outlandishly so, I couldn't even qualify this as a guilty pleasure reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"why is it called Bella Tuscany?","review":"I keep wondering why she chose the title \\"Bella Tuscany\\". I feel the title only fits if the book takes place pretty much completely in Tuscany. However,the book takes us to various locals in the US as well as to regions in Italy other than Tuscany. I feel the title of the book misleads people into thinking they'll get the focus on Tuscany that her first book had. I feel it would have been more effective for the book to have a title that would more acurately reflect its content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"This is a pretentious, boring, self-absorbed book. I couldn't finish it. The writer comes across as someone I would never want to meet or spend time with, although I'm willing to believe that this was just the effect her writing had on me. Her attitude toward Italy and the Italians I found patronizing and uneducated. And if I buy a book about Tuscany, I'm not looking to read about the author's family and childhood, etc. Highly UNrecommended. Read MFK Fisher for good food writing, and anyone else in the world besides Mayes for good travel writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Travelogue + Memoir + Cookbook + Fodder for Dreams","review":"This book is fabulous. More so than Under the Tuscan Sun, and both are better than the movie. Mayes has such a lightness to her writing, yet her words leave you filled. She writes of the travels her husband and she make to various regions of Italy, describing the local foods, customs, and topography. She includes wonderful recipes and paints life in Tuscany as a beautiful thing. Read on an empty stomach and a full wallet (so you can hop on the next plane to Italy). I read this before and after a month long trip to Italy and both times Bella Tuscany proved a great way to whet my appetite for the trip, and a nice way to reminisce afterwards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing meanderings of Frances Mayes mind","review":"Having read Frances Mayes \\"Under the Tuscan Sun\\" I eagerly anticipated reading her latest creation,vicariously wandering the countryside of Tuscany and enjoying Italian cuisine.Other than the enjoyable dust jacket of the book \\"Bella Tuscany\\" the book is a tremendous disappointment. I have doggedly read 203 pages and will finish Ms. Mayes metaphysical look at Italy, however,it has been more about her meandering mind than her wandering feet. I particularly missed the wonderful recipes that were interspersed throughout her first book. They all made my mouth water in anticipation of my next trip to Italy. These recipes were perfunctory and very unimaginative and left me with, not a deliciously sated feeling but hunger pangs."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK since I didn't know any better...","review":"I listened to this book on a drive up the eastern seaboard to Montreal. I was completely captivated-- but I hadn't read UTTS first. Now that I have I see where others' negative comparative comments come from.The other thing that I definitely did not enjoy was the author's reading of the book. I did not find here voice at all pleasant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely","review":"Mayes is a treat. I loved this book as much as her previous Italy book; can't understand the attacks herein, but it doesn't matter. This is a wonderful book and I highly recommend it to anyone without an ax slung over their shoulder."},{"rating":"1","title":"a very mediocre and biased account of Italy","review":"While this book was enjoyable in parts, I just don't see what sets this book apart from other travelogues. I'm glad the author enjoys living and entertaining in Tuscany (who wouldn't) and tending to her garden, but the bottom line is that I just didn't find these vignettes all that interesting. Maybe it's because I'm not a gardener - I tended to identify more with the eating and cooking aspects of the book which were at least lively and interesting. If you're visiting Italy or just like armchair travel you may enjoy perusing this book. It's passable, just not the most exciting book I've ever read. I think most generic travel guides (like the Rough Guide) are more interesting reads.Plus, even though she claims to be the sensitive American living in Italy, she has so many silly mafia stereotypes and \\"canned\\" portraits of Italians that I almost didn't recognize Italy from the actual weeks I've spent travelling through the country. Mediocre by any standard."},{"rating":"2","title":"The next best thing to going to Italy!","review":"It you can't afford a trip to Italy, this book is the next best thing to going there. Francis Mayes shares the sights, sounds, and tastes like a native Italian. She has a talent for bringing you to a place beside her--sharing Italy through her eyes.This is a delightful book--a good surrogate to the real thing--at a fraction of the cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bella Tuscany","review":"Lovely, light book all about Tuscany and life in the author's adopted village and her renovated old stone house and garden with such a view! Wonderful characterizations of people, great foods, travels here and there. Enjoyable and very well written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much rambling","review":"I enjoyed UTTS and thought Bella Tuscany would be better or just as entertaining. There was too much digression about plants one has never heard of, ancestors and life in the deep South plus the new house in St Francis Woods and elite area of San Francisco which the first book no doubt financed. Disappointing!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does she really like Italy?","review":"Let's see, her first choice to live was Greece, and, throughout both books, although she loves her Tuscan home, her land [Whose land is this anyway, she snobbily thinks, when native Italians try to help her prune the garden] she admits she's \\"squeamish\\" about folk customs, food, the people in general. Mayes claims to be \\"at home\\" in Italy, that she is now Italianized -- and then gives us a recipe where she adds at the end of it, \\"Serves two.\\" Serves -- TWO?"},{"rating":"1","title":"No sour grapes -- just plain disappointment","review":"I finally had to remove Bella Tuscany from my bedside table because I knew I was never going to finish it. It's been sitting there for months waiting patiently to be finished and the guilt is killing me.I am a huge fan of Mayes and adored Under the Tuscan Sun. I couldn't put the book down and I sighed, daydreamed and planned a vacation to Italy through the whole book. I snapped up Bella Tuscany ready to soak up a bit more of Tuscany and their lives there. Instead of sweet, leisurely Tuscan days it was a disappointing bitter pill. I never got into the book and had to force myself to read 100 pages. Ever since I abandoned Bella Tuscany I thought if I could get \\"in the right mood\\" I would adore it. But, I realize that's not going to happen. Hopefully book number 3 will be better. If not I will cherish Under the Tuscan Sun and find other travel writers to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frances thinks she IS the Tuscan Sun","review":"Ms. Mayes has, yet again, managed to upstage a land as magnificent as Italy. For yet another time we are treated to the self-absorbed ramblings of this gastronomo-llectual jet-setter. If you want to read a treatise on life as it can (apparently) be lived in a charmed and timeless European setting, try Peter Mayle's \\"A Year in Provence\\". He is mercifully less full of himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE: Do Not Befriend Frances Mayes","review":"She allows you to stay at her villa in Tuscany and then in her next book writes about what a pain you were. I was embarrassed for her visitors, but sincerely doubt they are friends any longer. This woman needs a life, because the one she has is incredibly self centered. One of the worst books I've read in a long time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the first","review":"I liked the first book better, in which the book described the ongoing risky theme of an American couple buying and restoring an ancient house in Italy. This one has none of that excitement, and shows signs of elitism and snobbery. It's apparently ok to slam Winona, Minnesota (and thus, it's people) because it gets a little cold in the Winter, and it's grocery stores don't meet her qualifications for fresh vegetables. House guests also get dumped on for eating up her private time but that's what happens when you choose to expose your life and house via a book.I prefer more humble travel writers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy On Persephone's Island instead","review":"Another disappointment. This dribble has little to do with Italy and no plot. This best part of the book is the picture of the house. The chapter on Sicily appears to be plagerized from On Persephone's Island by Mary Taylor Simeti who has lived in Sicily for years, speaks the language and in contrast to Ms. Mayes really knows the people (published 1986). it is disgusting to see a writer mention her sadness about prostitution in Italy and then move on to discuss hiring full time garderners and choosing between tile or marble for the bathrooms. Also, it is suprising for a woman who claims to love teaching to portray the students she has as \\"uh like idiots\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"charming but shallow","review":"This is a charming read if you love Italy, but the author gets lost about half way though the book and pads out what is basically a very long travel piece. From someone who teachers creative writing you'd expect something a little less self absorbed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's Go Shopping","review":"I loved Under The Tuscan Sun which focused on Tuscany, its people, places and food. This book is about Sicily, where the author was either cold, rained on, put in crummy rooms or deeply frightened by the mafia, which she seems to believe are everywhere, and Venice, where we learn about her bird phobia, and San Francisco, where she buys another house to renovate and gives the ultimate bird to her former husband by (if you believe it) not recognizing him at her daughter's wedding. It is also about Ed, who I refuse to believe exists. But most of all it's about shopping. Fran buys everything she sees, smells, or heard rumors of, and will doubtless be named the patron saint of shopkeepers in Tuscany and Umbria. This is a boring and self-absorbed effort that her editor should have stopped cold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bella Tuscany: The Sweet Life in Italy","review":"Quick and simple...bad. I have lived in Italy for the past 3 years. As an American, I am embarrassed as Ms. Mayes personifies the term \\"Ugly American\\". A pleasant writing style is no excuse for bad manners. I think that Ms. Mayes should know how to embrace the customs and ways of another country."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh...the first one was MUCH better.","review":"Sorry, Ms. Mayes, but I think your first swing through Italy was better. \\"Under the Tuscan Sun\\" was a fabulous book. \\"Bella Tuscany\\" pales by comparison. I do still love the descriptions and the wonderful places, but I feel that we're between a story and a travellogue with this entry. Actually, I'm rather hoping that Mayes' next book *is* a travellogue of all of the wonderful places we should all visit in Tuscany! I appreciate the fact that Ed is more present in this book than in the first -- nice to \\"meet\\" him more, at last!"},{"rating":"1","title":"torturous monotone narration ruins exquisite writing","review":"The writing is exquisite; however, the author's monotone southern accented voice makes listening torture. I adored her first book, and really tried to give this a go, but had to stop after one cassette of cringing at the slow unrelenting monotone and the frequent southern-American accented Italian words. Torture. Why on earth did the publisher allow the author to do this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"It hit me what I don't like about this book","review":"Her descriptive language is well thought out, but almost no emotion comes through in this humorless travelogue. She shares very little about herself and her feelings and the book is left with being a very well written still life."},{"rating":"1","title":"A TRULY HORRID BOOK!","review":"How snobbish can someone be? Mayes spends a good part of the book whinning. She whines about her repairing the house (the one in Italy and the one in San Fransco), she whines about the gardeners, the septic cleaners,her house guests, and even the Grandfather who paid for her education. It is a good thing that she is so rich or else she would never make in the real world. And what is with the odd, out of place story about how she didn't recognize her ex-husband she hadn't seen in thepast 2 years. Weird!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I had heard about UtTS and how wonderful it was, so when a copy of Bella Tuscany came my way, I grabbed it happily. Perhaps I didn't give Mayes enough of a chance: I assumed she would be a female version of Peter Mayle, and write with joy and humor.After about a third of the way through, I was thoroughly sick of her whining and sniveling. Her descriptions of food and landscape and wine, I thought, were less than dazzling, less than enamoured - they were more like descriptions from a creative writing class. Mayes became a traveling companion that annoyed me, someone who could not appreciate her good fortune, a drain on anyone's good humor.I never did finish the book. I couldn't see my way to spend another moment with Mayes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time!","review":"Getting through Bella Tuscany was painful! I found her annoying, insipid and elitist. Her editor failed her miserably this time around.I loved Mayes' previous prose for more than just delightful musings on home renovation in a foreign country.

Hopefully that will get the nasty taste of out my mouth....Yuck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like most movies; loved the first one, hated the sequel.","review":"Having just finished reading her first book about Tuscany, \\"Under the Tuscan Sun\\", a charming and compelling narrative about restoring an old house in the hills of Tuscany and learning to live in Italy, and having just returned from a trip to Italy myself, I could hardly wait to read this book. I should have saved the $15 and spent it on a few more bowls of that wonderful Italian chocolate gelato.... I guess when you pour years worth of experiences into a book, it's hard to come up with something else to say fast enough to get a sequel out while the money machine is still spitting out bills.I think I will go back and re-read her first book, so that the impression that sticks in my mind is not the horrible sense of disappointment that grew worse with each page of this book.Sigh..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too wealthy, too contented","review":"The \\"Bella Italia\\" industry cranks up again, when our smug and self-satisfied rich Americans deal with the quaint natives once again.

If she really wants to know anything about Sicily and the mafia (\\"I never heard anyone say mafia in a whole week!\\" she exclaims breathlessly.

If I could give this book a zero star rating I would. This book has none of the charm and warmth and character of her first book. I didn't buy this book to read about her childhood or her parents or her siblings. I didn't buy this book to read about Minnesota, her house in California, or her daughter's wedding. I didn't buy this book to read about her trashing her houseguests. I didn't buy this book to read poetry, or her opinion of art. Ms. Mayes should really be ashamed of herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Next time just tweet","review":"There are some delightful moments in the book - how could you live in a villa in Arezzo and not encounter them? - but they are marred by the whining, by the hatchet job on Sicily (believe it or not, other people living in or visiting Sicily don't spend their time looking for a Mafia Don around every corner), as well as by other less direct hints that the author is, in the end, just another visitor with money who lacks the soul of an Italian."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"Enjoyable and fun.

I'm not sure why the subtitle is \\"the sweet life\\" because very little about this book is sweet. The author seems self-absorbed to the point of being self-obsessed, waxing poetic in between complaining about the woes of having a second home.

This book reads like a draft outline of a novel in paragraph form. For example, we're told early on that a character has a sparkling wit, and 200 pages on I'm still looking for an example of that wit. There's only sparse dialog here, and what little dialog is very stilted. It's all completely lifeless.

This book is overly long by about 200-300 pages, and consists in the main of endless navel contemplation and long discussions of how the Church has supposedly ruined Western society over lo these many years. The \\" action\\" sequences are few, far between, and not that convincing. If this tome is the first of a planned trilogy, I shudder to think ! I picked this book up on a whim at Costco; I am at least glad that I didn't pay full price!

For those who have a firm grip on history, I suggest run sceaming from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Templar History","review":"If you like \\"stories\\" then this is a good book to read.It is not anywhere close to the real Templar History (but it is fairly good fiction).Some \\"information\\" is taken from fact/history, but the story is, all in all just that(a story).If your concerned with actual facts and history, then this is not the book for you.If you want to just have something to read,to pass the time away....then you might like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Polemics distort even pseudohistory","review":"In Whyte's story, another Templar potboiler inspired by The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail, the founders of the famous Christian Templar order are not even Christian, and the Templar treasure's discovery predictably threatens the continued existence of the established Church.It is clear from the first 50 pages of the book that however much research has been done, and however interesting the actual history really is, it will all be warped, like the boards in the hull of a boat, to serve Whyte's polemical purpose. And it will be a very tedious journey--unless you share an enthusiasm for pseudohistory that salivates at the possibility of toppling millennias-old institutions."},{"rating":"1","title":"axe grinding","review":"I am very open minded but obviously this guy has an ax to grind with Christians....exactly as the title describes; there is not ONE decent christian in the book(black); ALL of the Jewish characters are model citizens NONE of them ever do anything remotely base(white) what a JOKE...don't bother even if you are tempted! why not just write this book: Jewish people are good, Christians are evil...at least you would be giving an accurate portrayal of the contents of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"No character development","review":"I read the entire novel after loathing the first 200 pages in honor of how much i respected Jack Whyte as the author of my favorite novels of all time in the Camulod series. The novel was over 700 pages and by the time I finished the book I felt like I did not know a single character. I do not know what happened to Whyte: halfway through the Skystone I felt I knew Publius Varrus very well. It may be Whyte is not near as skilled in writing in the third person. The novel had an alright storyline, except the lack of context with which the treasure is found is aggravating, but it was the utter lack of true character development that made me give the novel only two stars. I was extremely disappointed with this novel, especially after reading the Camulod Chronicles."},{"rating":"1","title":"piqued","review":"piqued. as \\"insulted\\".He could probably save himself a lot of dialogue. It's a misuse of privilege. The profesional term is \\"anachronistic\\". And he sure does abuse it.Don't get me wrong - I do admire the effort. It is admirable!

I will not spoil yer pleasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unintentionally funny","review":"I like the ideas and the setting but the characters are so stiff-backed and awkward. Like the Camulod books, I was cringing, and laughing, through all the dialogue. Also, for better or worse..... you be the judge... Whyte's getting a little closer to the unconventional bedroom scenes of the early Camulod books. Yikes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"As another reviewer has said, those who loved the Camulod chronicles will be disappointed by this new story. It seems Mr. Whyte couldn't decide if he was writing an alternative history book or a novel, and ended up writing neither. Long pedantic discussions by men of action seem rigged to hammer a particular viewpoint (and hammer, and hammer, and...), and characters who could be explored in an interesting way (in particular Hugh de Payens) are given shallow treatment at best. There is no edge in the story, no grip, and no passion.I was looking forward to reading more of Whyte's work since I so enjoyed the Camulod tales, but this book didn't give me any satisfaction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clunky writing, sloppy research","review":"Sadly, this book is very poorly done. Historical \\"facts\\" are inaccurate, for example, maintaining that Paul was a Gentile and the Knights Hospitaller were never a military order. The dialogue is so painfully clunky that a reader really has to force his way through the murk. I gave up at about halfway through, and I'm a very patient reader. I cannot recommend the book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"unrealistic story","review":"the characters in this book lack realism , the author states that Raymond is a man to be feared and one who will never give his heart to another woman other than his first wife whom he killed, but within a few chapters he is vowing his love for Elizabeth. Sweet Elizabeth who has been raised in a convent her entire childhood vows that if Raymond will accept her as his bride in lieu of her cousin whom he was formely betrothed that she will be a good wife and never disobey. As soon as the vows are repeated she begins to disobey her husband in foolish unbelieveable ways. Even for fiction these people were unreal. No depth of character to make me really want to find out what happened to these people. Frankly not sure he killed his wife i think she may have died of boredom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This book was great. Raymond is so strong, manly, mysterious and sexy and although Elizabeth seemed painfully naive and stupid at times, I realize now she was very strong...and lucky with the way things turned out for her.

This time it was getting air but it wouldn't spray the stucco. I only tried it on stucco so I don't know how it would do on the other things it claims that it is able to do. So my advice is to save your money until they improve on their gun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless for stucco","review":"I bought this texture gun to spray the finish stucco coat. But, I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone. After reading the previous 2 reviews on this product, I decided to make the mixture a bit thinner. For the first 5 minutes or so, everything was ok. Then, the nozzle keeps getting stuck, and I had to throw out all my stucco and flush out the system with water. This went on alternately for the next 5 or 6 attempts. The next day, and texture gun gave up completely; apparently some air leaked out of it and it wouldn't even spray at all. I then gave the product to a handyman to try to make it work, and he tried for more than an hour but to no avail. Who wants a product which only functions intermittently for one day and then breaks down? Don't waste your money until they improve their gun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another View of a Symphonic Master","review":"Rubbra is best known for his eleven wonderful symphonies, but his work is grounded in Elizabethan counterpoint and the great English madrigalists.This excellent set gives one a chance to hear his compositional style stripped own to its essentials. It also shows that Rubbra's chamber output belongs in the great seventeenth century tradition of Locke, Lawes, and Jenkins: work which while melodic demands considerable intellectual involvement from the listener. Highly recommended for those who care for 20th century English music--particularly its lamentably neglected chamber tradition."},{"rating":"1","title":"From Back Cover","review":"When Courtney places a personal ad in Attitudes, seeking a valentine for her older sister, a fellow classmate by the name of Jeff responds.

I know sometimes it just takes a few tries to get the hang of it, but this one was ridiculous.I liked the weight lifting part of it, at least I felt I got a workout from that.

It covers the battles and the leaders of the Confederacy, both great and flawed. I found it hard to believe that some Southern leaders/generals fought harder against their own side in stupid little infights and disputes. The book goes a long way in explaining Lee's strategy and that of Davis and how they were different and the results of that difference. This book concentrates on the Eastern Theatre, the author's other book 'Jefferson Davis and his Generals' covers the Western Theatre of operations and is brillant in its examination of this area.

Marsh is bitter and vindictive and often cruel to Sarah. She simply has no common sense; she repeatedly makes atrocious decisions -- no wonder trouble always finds her.The book isn't horrible; the characters, even the romantic leads, have redeeming qualities and good scenes. But the work as a whole is less than fulfilling and the chemistry between the leads lacks convincing heat. Worse, it lacks the sort of love upon which a good romance hinges.The book is worth reading as part of the series, as long as the reader neither expects too much or is not put off from other books that follow. Perhaps the best character in this book is Sarah's sister's husband's nephew, Adrian Hawke. His story comes up in the Bridemaker, which is an excellent read."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very good","review":"I really didn't enjoy reading this book.

Otherwise you just get a blank screen. It took me hours to figure out because the manual didn't say anything about it. Second, the tray that holds the DVDs is horrid - the sides have no cutout, so it is tricky to take the disks out. And the HDMI output is always stretched to widescreen - which is terrible because many of my DVDs are 4:3 TV series.

The pieces do not snap together well, if at all. This experience has convinced me that Legos has the corner on this market. To bad the fortress wasn't produced by Lego.

The plastic blocks just do not function and cannot keep any of the constructions together even after hours of frustration. The instructions are terrible. You would think they could somehow imitate Legos better but these are best avoided. The only worthy item is the dragon as a play figure but even these are of extremely low quality.

The bricks are inferior in quality to Legos and they won't stay together so the base and towers are useless. That wouldn't be so bad if the dragons worked -- they look so cool they'd be fun to play with on their own, even without the towers. But the day after we got this their lights failed to light and one dragon's tail snapped off (in a place it wasn't supposed to come apart)and it hasn't been played with since.

The sets were cheap, the costumes were cheap, and the acting was cheap. The setting was so overly simple as to cause distraction. It looked like someone had spilled a can of Tara Cota red paint all over everything. The costumes were no better. Some looked like they were just buttoned up robes while others looked straight out of Star Wars. All of the actors were so melodramatic that one could not focus on the lines, and some close-ups were so close it was disturbing. Overall, I did not enjoy the production."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Close Captioning","review":"Since my hearing is pretty bad - even with hearing aids - I depend on sub-titles and/or close captioning. This DVD was described as having CC but it didn't so I could not understand the dialog."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holm not horrible","review":"The acting was fine. Edmund and the sisters, Regan and Goneril, were played with sufficient nastiness, and I definitely felt Lear's pain. However, there was just a bit too much screaming, and when they weren't screaming, they were mumbling. The set was obviously low budget, which you'd expect from the Beeb (BBC for you Yanks), but it seemed to fit quite well. There was a small discrepancy in the modern-ness of the costumes, some being relatively renaissance and some of them from the twentieth-century (ie. Lear's fool.) All else being equal, I didn't hate it, and that's the main thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate Data in this production.","review":"The BBC production of king Lear was a good portal of Shakespeare's original except that historically inaccurate throughout the production and the lack of good actors took away from the production itself. However, I will say that David Burke as Kent and Timothy West as Gloucester fit there roles well as well as done very good acting in this production, even though surrounded be some horrible acting. Sometimes the actors couldn't be understood because they were so focused on mumblings and screaming. Then the inaccurate data such as the rubber tires on the cart, Gloucester's filling in his teeth, and the Fool's custom which was not of the period. Therefore, I didn't like this production because I myself couldn't ignore the inaccurate data, and the bad acting however the storyline itself is a good one."},{"rating":"1","title":"You'll survive just fine without it!","review":"King Lear was fine, but I don't want to see it again. The acting was okay, nobody stood out or struck me as having great talent; the weren't terrible. I think the set and costume were a little to boring, I would expect a little more extravagence, being that he was a king. Maybe they did it to keep the focus on the dialogue because they were speaking in the shakespearian language. However, the dialogue was still hard to follow. The diction of the actors wasn't to great. Either they were yelling making it hard to understand, or they were mumbling.Kent was probablly the best casted actor in the movie, and the easiest to understand. I would not recommend anyone to watch this movie, and I don't want to see it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"King Lear Review","review":"I really liked the actress who played Cordellia. She brouhgt that sense of innocence that i pictured her having. She played the emotions really well. I did not like the actors performance of King Lear. He made King Lear seem a lot more crazy then he really was. The actor playing Edmund i thought played him well."},{"rating":"1","title":"King Lear Meets Star Wars","review":"The casting director should have spared us the bow to diversity and political correctness when a hispanic was cast as France and a negro as Burgundy. Set design and costume sacrificed tradition and historical representation to economy and off-beat originality. The costumes resemble those of Star Wars. The Fool, instead of being youthful, agile and entertaining, is fat, old and dumpy. The most entertaining thing about the fool is Lear referring to the grizzled 70 year-old as \\"boy\\". Holms as Lear can't hold a candle to Lawrence Oliver. Holms plays every scene with the same, monotonous, high level of intensity, like a manic Lear. He is unable to play Lear as a likeable, sympathetic character, in any scene. During the scene in which Lear's heart is supposed to break when Cordelia fails to declare her love with sufficient eloquence, Holms' Lear only comes accross as manic, obsessed and neurotic. Even with its poor film quality, Sir Lawrence Oliver's production is the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"King Lear Review","review":"The movie was somewhat lackluster. The production was highly lacking, leaving the audience wondering what the heck was going on. The only settings were a red room with sometimes different furniture, a hall, and the outside during a storm. For example on teh acting confusion, one scene showed lear at his castle with his knights and the next was with him at his daughters casstle. I do believe the actual stage production may have been the best and most clear, and this, if not all, remakes should be laid to rest with Shakespeare."},{"rating":"1","title":"A film that would have made it to the Goodwill screens but not Hollywood.","review":"I didn't really like this film, but I guess it got the point across. I was surprised as to how well the actors played the parts, and how well they remembered the Shakesperean lines. The setting however way to cheap and would have never made it to Hollywood, but it would have made it to the producers of the Goodwill films. There was way to much screaming in the play which made it hard for me to stay focused on. I found Victoria Hamlet, or Codelia, to be less prettier than her sisters, which was ironic. Edgar was not aggressive enough with Edmund, which made him look like a big queer. So if you haven't watched it don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks for the DVD!!","review":"In an earlier edition of this review, I pleaded for a DVD release of this wonderful \\"Lear\\" ...and here it is! THANKS to PBS for this! It's one of my favorites!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the worst King Lear, but not the best either","review":"King Lear on film will always be compared to Olivier's version near the end of his life. All the performances, especially his, were so nuanced and clear. Holm isn't a bad Lear, but he just doesn't master it the way Olivier did. The Fool's character was edited too much. Some of the play's most poignant moments came from him and his interaction with Lear. Unfortunatly some aren't here. Do yourself a favor: FInd Olivier's version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Hot","review":"This movie did not attract my attention as much as I thought it would. The movie didn't have good stage setting, acting, dressing, and actors to fit the description of the people in the play. The movie lost my attention at the beginning when it showed how slack the movie set-up was. Next time they make a King Lear movie they need to fix all of the things above so that I won't fall asleep in the middle of class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shakespeare in space","review":"When I first learned that I would be watching King Lear in my English class I was greatly over-joyed. Firstly because we never get to watch videos in class, and secondly because I was curious to visually see the play. However, upon watching the first minutes of the play I felt like watching the movie was more like punishment than pleasure. The costumes made the characters look like they were on spaceship flying towards another planet. The simple sets didn't fit the extravagant lifstyle I thought a King would lead. The actors, though they were talented, did not fit what I visualized the characters to look like. I must say that with the simple costumes and sets it did help me focus on the dialogue of the play. Visually seeing the dialogue come to life gave me a better understanding of the play. I would not recommend this video for entertainment but for learning purposes only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shake 'n' Bake","review":"The play was well done by Ian Holm. Their were a few inconsistencies such as:Though they were played very well Goneril and Regan seem a bit old for their respective parts. Barbara Flynn seemed old enough to be Lear's wife and Regan seems to grab the attention away from the other sisters since she is a blonde. The clothing was out of date and other discrepancies such as LAND MINES!?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read it. Don't watch it.","review":"This movie was acceptable lighting and staging wise, but the costumes seemed to be a strange mixture of different time periods. At the beginning, Lear's attendants looked like a S.W.A.T. team, and at the end of the play Edger, who'd already had far too many costume changes, was dressed as an executioner. The actors screamed and mumbled their lines, which may have distracted them for focusing on more important things, like being believable characters and staying true to the play. All the actors had their moments when they seemed to show the appropriate level of accuracy to the characters, but that was usually when they weren't speaking. All in all, if it were a real movie, I would have waited for it to come out on HBO, and even then, I might have only viewed it while something more interesting was on a commercial break."},{"rating":"1","title":"Handicap Version of King Lear","review":"Holm does a fine job portraying \\"King Lear.\\" I do believe that it would be a very hard part to portray. As I have only seen this production of \\"King Lear\\" I do not believe this would be the very best possible production(at least I hope not). The movie contained to much screaming, too much mumbling and not enough clear tone to comprehend. The set was obviously low budget and did not take much time to set up and film. Overall I probably would not like to see this production again."},{"rating":"1","title":"King Lear Video-Regretful Experience","review":"From the appearance of this movie I can conclude that this is a first time experience for the director and most of the actors. The acting was either too much to stand or not enough to be able to understand. The actor that played King Lear was overplaying being insane. Edgar was very overdone. He was too much into his own world to make the audience understand his character. But I did like the performance of Goneril and Regan. I thought they were quite eviland exactly like i pictured. I did picture Cordelia to be prettier and not so \\"Thriller\\" like. As far as set design I thought it was incredibly poorly done. Costumes didn't seem realistic to the time period the play was supposed to take place in. Overall I thought it was i poor performance and a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"My opinion of King Lear","review":"This movie really didn't interest me. The actors and actresses seem too dramatic and seem to be over-acting. They also did not appear how I imagined them to be after reading the book. I thought of them to be younger. The screaming and mumbling also distracted me. It made me want to pull out my book and follow along. The setting was dull and very cheap. The death scene at the end of the was kind of ackward. The evil sisters were in the room,ironically on a cart that had just enough room for two more bodies, and it rolled away easily. For the most part I did not like the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Nuance","review":"This is a production totally without nuance and its owes that to the bellowing of Ian Holm. Holm as Lear bellows at the beginning. he bellows in the middle. And he belows at the end. Lear bellows when he is dividing teh kingdom. he bellows then he rejects Cordelia. he bellows when he realises that he has been betrayed by Goneriel and Regan. The character presented as Lear is entirely one dimensional. Any change of circumstance or emotion is presented as more bellowing. There is no tragedy in this production because there is no change in Lear from beginning to end.This DVD is not worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Alice Adams Classic","review":"This is another one of Ms. Adams collections of short stories. Like the others it refers back to some of the characters in other books (like Popsie).

On a recent ride I saw another rider that had a Fizik saddle bag with ICS clip. The bag was significantly bigger than mine. The label on the carton of mine showed medium. Which dimensions should a medium sized bag have? I could not find size information on Fizik's web site.I saw the bags later in a store and found out that I actually received the small bag labeled as medium bag.

I like the SM57 Beta better because it's thinner sounding and picks up further away. But, being almost broke I couldn't justify dropping $140 on one, so I decided to look at other options. I picked up the Pro41 because of the price point and because I know that Audio Technica makes good stuff (I absolutely love my Audio Technica AT-440MLa cartridge).I was pleasantly surprised when I tested this guy out. Reasonable pickup distance, good tonality and bass response more akin to an SM57.

The script is hilarious and the film company could have had a classic on their hands save for one fairly major quibble - the casting! Who in their right minds would believe that Arnold Schwartzenegger and Danny De Vito were twins. Apart from the lack of any physical resemblance they don't even have the same accent or dress the same most of the time. I have to admit it did rather detract from the film as far as I was concerned. I think they should have gone for the obvious choice and cast The Proclaimers instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, So-So DVD","review":"While this is a very enjoyable movie, the DVD doesn't have that same amazing quality of most DVDs.

Check out the 'Sperm Milkshake'! This is a great comedy that seems always fresh to watch and it's got everything you could possibly want in a comedy movie; loads of gags, two great actors and a brilliant storyline.

So Schwarzenegger is in a comedy...yes, I suppose at one time that was a novel concept. But it's just not very funny. The highlight for me was a shot of Arnold's face after a sexual encounter. Aside from that, DeVito does a good job playing a slimeball, with some good lines and a rather funny scene where he is supposed to be running away from the bad guys...but due to his tiny legs and the suitcase he's carrying, he can do little more than waddle.I just can't recommend it. It's really light-weight fare. If you want to see a REALLY funny Schwarzenegger movie, see \\"True Lies\\". That is definitely a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great...","review":"I purchased this workout dvd a while back and was really disappointed...I am an intermediate-level exerciser and this workout really didn't get my heart rate up as much as I'd have liked.

Don't get me wrong, it's very low-impact, but there are a few twisting dance movements that caused some discomfort and just didn't feel \\"right\\".

On their 2000 CD release, Bill surprises us with female vocals (Lisa Bouchelle) - he really shouldn't have done that. Obviously, Bill isn't skilled enough to write good vocal parts. Hence, this album is great in its instrumental-only parts, but sounds like a cheap middle-of-the-road-wannabe-metal-band-with-female-singer otherwise. And was this \\"Endless Enigma\\" thing really necessary?!? I mean, this is one of ELP's best songs, and it's hard to top their own version. Now Bill comes up with a badly arranged cover version, with a female voice that sounds absolutely misplaced on this track... One more unneccessary rehash of a great classic prog composition. Two stars for the few instrumental parts that are great, as usual. Hopefully the next album will be an instrumental one.

A stack of cards would be more durable. Save yourself some head aches and stick with Legos. It is hard for me to believe that most of these other reviewers have purchased the same product with their kind words. This is the only product line that I have ever given a negative review on and maybe these words will save you some money from being dumped on this.

He obviously was driven to share, in equisite detail, his difficult, unhappy childhood and subsequent growth that resulted in a man who readily finds joy and compassion in life. Mr. Miranda used his experiences to teach us, particularly young, disadvantaged people of all races and ethnicities, that life is what you make it. He learns from a young age that one cannot pin one's hopes and dreams on promises from friends and family. Rather, one must become educated in order to find a career that leads them to discover their path.

Still worse is the brutally harsh sound of the flute (and occasionally clarinet) in its' upper register, rendering listening quite painful. I've played it on several high-end stereo systems and the sound is still bad.

Did not read every page looking for errors. Any book has errors but in most cases the concept(s) are easy to follow. No author, editor, or publisher is infallible, and it is a professional courtesy to contact the author / publisher to bring errors and inconsistencies to his attention so that corrections can be made before the next printing. In my view, the best profreader is the reader, student or working professional. The one star review is certainly unfair to the author and I am very surprised that Amazon allows it. I wrote to Amazon to express my feelings on that, and the response was that it is within Amazon's guidelines! Extremely disappointed. An objective review should point out both the strenghts and weaknesses of the text and recommendations for improvement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!

Taxation, regulation, spending, corruption, bail-outs. And it is always government that starts wars. When government adds on junk like \\"carbon taxes\\", signs legislation like NAFTA and forces people to buy health insurance, yes, jobs are going to be lost!

He makes such a habit of attacking strawmen, one has to suspect that he's at least somewhat aware of his intellectual dishonesty.

The first half of the book was devoted to complaining about Bush Jr., Bush Sr., Clinton and the evils of Corporate USA, going so far as to suggest that Global Warming is a result of our currently flawed governmental system. The author is obviously very bitter about the G.W. Bush presidency, and made me feel more like I was reading a book written by a disgruntled Liberal or Liberal-Socialist activist, rather than making a case for Socialism.

Also his choice of interesting rarely-played composers is admirable.In my opinion though, the Scriabin performances are not in the league of the Russian school recordings. Scriabin's complex music takes a musician of genius to play, and paranormal technique is not enough here. Hamelin of course is a great musician, but this recording is only good as an intruduction or for novice- Scriabinites.

So maybe I expect something different for a \\"close family\\" book. I read this very rushed book and grew more annoyed with the book as I continued to read it.The description of landmarks are horrible. I've never been to Paris so I cannot comment on it's land mark but I do know Grambling State University is not an hour from New Orleans.A simple map can show that.The names of the \\"main\\" character's name in the Book Description does not match \\"main\\" character's name in the book.

I am a huge book lover and I finished this book only for the sake of the fact that I spent my money for it. If you really think you need to read it borrow it because this is one that no one will mind getting rid of. Her other two books were decent, I especially liked her first one(Those were pretty unrealistic also but better than this). This is just so unrealistic and happy go lucky that it is comical, even Walt Disney himself would have to laugh. A huge boring fairy tale, you'd be better off reading Cinderella. I am sorry but you will never see this one on the big screen. If you really need to read I am willing to part with mine because I will never read it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"This book was so boring. There was no drama and the author kept repeating the same thing over and over again. And I was so sick and tired of hearing about how beautiful someone was because of how light they were. A truly terrible book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"Pretty good book. In the beginning, I was a little worried, but once it got started, it was good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great even if you have a big kitchen","review":"This book is from the '70's, before microwave ovens and food processors were common. The recipes and almost all of the advice is still very relevant today. The book contains dinner menus that are designed for people with tiny (or no) kitchens who love to eat and entertain. The authors describe how to prepare and serve delicious, impressive meals, yet mingle with one's guests. Their recommendations for equiping a small kitchen are great and relevant for anyone who is starting their first kitchen or organizing an existing kitchen. Buy the book for the Simon's Cheesecake recipe if for nothing else. I've had it since 1987 and it is time for another copy.

So then, I hoped it was an informative account of contemporary Christian music of the '70's and into the '80's. I found out it is another bland book of \\"look at me, I'm coming of age\\" and a few attempts at humor. I really gained nothing by reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good piece of history with a personal touch","review":"I bought this book because I was told it features a picture of the house I just purchased in La Honda.

No, no!","review":"I've been the unfortunate owner of several Huffy bikes. Here's why. I buy a Huffy bike, do $60 worth of damage to it while falling down in a ditch, yet I can buy a brand-new shiny one at Wal-Mart for $70. Huffy crankcases have always been bad due to cheap bearings, bad seals, and their steering assembly tends to leak too. I've had my Huffies serviced by numerous shops and when they're not laughing at me, they're trying to sell me a better bike. I took them up on the offer and bought a Raleigh mountain bike and haven't yet bent a rim. The crankcase works perfectly, is durable and I haven't seen a bit of rust on my bike yet.

Steel Frame with cantilever brakes","review":"Very Entry Level, might be OK for beginner or kid @11yrs, but Steel frame is too heavy for a new bike otherwise. Steel parts, import alloys. You can get into one with lighter frame for about $40 more. Frame has a lifetime warranty because it is like a brick.I saw this or very similar model at Toys-R-Us 2 weeks ago, non-Shimano parts I thought, would be hard to replace. It would get you from point A-to Point B, just not as good as an aluminum frame. Plastic chain guards and similar,non-adjustable suspension, low-end tires. This would have been a pretty sweet bike to own back in 1993 though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pedals do not fit","review":"This bike is good, but the pedals that came with the bike are not the ones it needs.

They're pretty sturdy and a good size."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indeed, my favorite mugs.","review":"They are indeed my favorite mugs. I've wanted this kind of mugs for quite some time. The only think I don't like is it's made in China. However, the material looks quite nice, and it's easy to hold. The handle doesn't seem to get hot in the microwave, which is great. I got the set from the Amazon Warehouse with a very reasonable price. Overall, I'm happy with what I got, and will get more."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best mugs we own.","review":"How much can you say about a huge coffee mug? Well, not much, but as far as mugs go, these are fantastic. They are a very bright, clean looking white. They are very sturdy (my 2 year old frequently bangs them into things). They are nicely shaped and not \\"bulky\\" looking. They are microwave and dishwasher safe and large enough to hold a full sized latte, which is why we bought them. A standard coffee mug just won't hold a full size latte or mocha as per standard recipe. My husband drinks them daily and needed something bigger. For lunch guests, they make a beautiful, but simple presentation filled with a hot soup, nested on a plate next to salad and a sandwich. I would definitely buy them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 for 3 DEAL, ONLY $9.99","review":"Got this during the 4 for 3 deal. So, got 8 mugs (4 sets) for only $30.

Needless to say the table inside was no longer useable, the pressboard construction just can't handle that kind of hard useage. Amazon was awesome however, they even paid the return shipping through UPS for me and apologized that the item arrived in such poor condition. I won't purchase this item again however as even the areas of the table that were unaffected by the delivery problems were of very poor quality with paint chips and many dings on the surfaces."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for a small space","review":"I love that the footprint is relatively small, and the table comes with built in storage. Very cleverly designed. The chairs are heavy enough not to tip easily, but light enough to be dragged around by my toddler when he's in the mood to be mischievous. The table came out of the box with an unsightly ding, so I'm not vouching for the durability of this set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible quality.","review":"We ordered this table set for our two year old.

I would NOT reccomend this product to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"After one week top no longer attached.","review":"When my husband put this together he knew the design was flawed and likely to not stay attached. Sure enough less than a week later our son called to ask if my husband thought he could repair it. We arrived a few days later with glue and some product my husband had to fill holes to help hold fasteners in place. Our two year old grandson enjoyed watching him fix it. We're now one week out from repair and it seems to be holding. If not for my husbands expertise I would have had to return it. We still might if this repair doesn't hold. The set is very cute and our grandson seems to enjoy it when it's holding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Table","review":"Very pleased with this table, it was easy to assemble. I like the space saving design and how stable the chairs and table are. My 18 month old boy still struggles to get on the chairs but no matter how much he pushes on them, they just won't tip over like the ones we had. If anything, my only problem now is keeping him from standing on them since he figured that he can get away with that. My only improvement to this table would be a lip, so small items suchs as crayons don't roll off. Overall this is a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken within 24 hours","review":"I really wanted to love this table, but for one thing it was MUCH smaller than I thought it was going to be, and my oversized 2 year old dwarfs it already.

Withstood the test of time!","review":"We have had this table for 6 years and it has been fantastic. It has survived twin boys and my daughter constantly playing and climbing on it.

It was easy to put together, looks great, and has good storage for coloring books, etc. I love that it doesn't take up a lot of room either. Fantastic!

Zakk Wylde might be one the last great American guitar heroes, the true successor of the greatly missed Randy Rhoads. If you don't get to feel it straight away, it's because it might be deeper than some of the other things you're listening to these days.. Give it some time and it will grow in you, and you'll end up drinking beer, headbanging like crazy, singing all the words and playing air guitar.

Wylde and Co. cut right to the chase on the opener(eye-opener?)\\"Stoned&Drunk\\" and only let up for a couple of pretty cool forrays into Neil Young territory;\\"The Blessed Hellride\\" and the piano driven \\"Dead Meadow.\\" Most of the titles speak for themselves. \\"Destruction Overdrive\\" shows Zakk has lost none of his chops. While \\"Stillborn\\" sounds like his early work with Ozzy. The funny part is Wylde's voice sounds more like Sabbath era Ozzy than Ozzy's does and less like the Layne Stayley/Gregg Allman impersonations he's done in the past. And, believe or not,that's a good thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's about time","review":"What can I say about one of the greatest heavy metal CDs I've ever bought.

Just listen to the first track and you get the idea of how slammin' this album really is. The first single 'Stillborn' featuring Ozzy Osbourne as a guest vocal is better than entire 'Down to earth'. And don't forget to check other smashing tunes like 'Doomsday Jesus', 'Suffering Overdue' or 'Funeral Bell'. If you looking for real Sabbath-esque heavy metal at it's best, this album will brings what you want to hear.

It hits on so many levels with the hardrockin' but remorseful \\"Stoned and Drunk\\" to the relaxing and ironic \\"Blessed Hellride\\" which has a nice southern sound to it. This album is still in my top 3 favs by BLS including 1919 Eternal and Mafia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD","review":"Good CD from start to finish although a little disappointed that the riff of Funeral Bell sounds like a ripoff ofEternal Decisions song Power!!!

The problem is that none of the BLS material comes even close to Zakk's Pride and Glory and Book of Shadows in terms of playing and song writing. Zakk is a great slide player, he should showcase more of that. He could have been the next Duanne Allman for crying out loud !!! One problem is that the insanely heavy stuff is a bit generic now and almost interchangable between the last three albums.

Although \\"1919\\" had some good tracks, it just seemed to be subpar after the veritable masterpieces that were \\"Stronger Than Death\\" and \\"Sonic Brew\\". With \\"The Blessed Hellride\\", Zakk Wylde marks a strong return to those previous albums, and cranks out quite possibly his best work to date. All of the tracks are flawlessly produced, letting Zakk's blistering fretboard mastery come through clearly. Some of the best tracks include opener \\"Stoned and Drunk\\", first single \\"Stillborn\\" (with Ozzy Osbourne on backing vocals), the chugging \\"Final Solution\\", and the beautiful closing ballad \\"Dead Meadow\\".

After 1919 eternal [wa so good] i was expsecting something faster, crazier, and heavy ... And with an awesome name like the Blessed Hellride I thought the song itself would at the least not be acoustic. All I gotta say is I miss songs like Battering Ram, Genocide Junkies, 13 Years of Grief and Low Down. Bleed Black Label"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hah, Hah, had to bring in Ozzy to sell some copies","review":"First, I like Zakk's guitar playing. Just wish he put together a decent band to record with. Get James Lomenzo to play bass and add a good drummer. With this release still the same bad drummer and Zakk playing everything else. The only bright spot is stillborn with Ozzy singing. Ozzy makes the song stand out from the rest and would fit better on a Ozzy disc than on this very lame Hellride. I don't like the style he's singing in, but his playing great and with a decent band it would be better. I would recommend, Pride and Glory S/T debut, his Book Of Shadows releases before this. Also pick up both the first L.A. Blues Authority release and the first Guitars That Rulled The World release. They both have a song on them with Zakk playing with James Lomenzo on bass and Greg D'Angelo on Drums. Well worth checking out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sold back within a Week","review":"Simply put, the only song worthwile is STILLBORN, the rest of the album sounds like that group of idoits who play with their \\"band\\" in the garage down the road. You would call the cops, but then again you feel bad about how much they suck and decide they need to spend that time practicing."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible at best","review":"Zakk Wylde is a man that demands perfection in the music of others. It then comes as a surprise that he doesn't practice what he preaches. While he is an amazing guitarist, his songwriting is downright horrible. His chord progressions are mediocre, songs are repetetive, and his guitar solos are repeated flurries of predictable pentatonics with no melody. In other words, his solos sacrifice substance for style. He never allows his band to have any instrumental time of their own. They are more or less hired guns. That is why it's called Zakk Wylde's Black Label Society. This album's poor quality is further augmented by the fact that Wylde cannot sing. He blatantly tries to rip off both Ozzy Osbourne and Pantera's own Phil Anselmo with horrendous results. He has no tone control and at times, sounds like he is yawning while he is singing. If you want real heavy metal with great vocals and/or melodic guitar solos, check out Metallica, Fear Factory, Pantera, Tool, and Shadows Fall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"After listening to Zakk for the past 5 years my enthusiasem has dropped with each cd and with the latest concoction Blessed Hellride my expectations are at an all time low. Sure he can still shred with the best of them but the fact is Zakk can do so much better. In his latest two cds \\"1919\\" and \\"Blessed Hellride\\" Zakk has lost his most admireable attribute, his melody. It seems that these days he's more concerned with kicking everyones ass rather than writing good songs with good melodies. If you want to hear a good Zakk Wylde cd check out Pride and Glory, Book of Shadows, Sonic Brew, or Stronger than Death. But if all you want is mindless bone crushing metal without much substance go ahead and check out Blessed Hellride. Even the lyrics blow - \\"the worms and maggots gather for the feast\\"What the hell?..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book For New Dads","review":"Although this is a Christian faith based book, it has alot of great tips for a new dad!

On the other hand, in Europe it's a mega monster seller so why complain? People seem to like this sort of music - shallow as it may be - and they buy them like Big Macs(R).

Thankfully, GNC takes everything back w/in 30 days, even if opened. I returned them the next day and got GNC's chewable omega-3.

Since that day he always asks for strawberry balls. I tasted them and they really do taste like strawberry. I was concerned about the texture, kinda gummy, but he does just fine with them. I'm ordering more today - the bigger bottle, more cost effective. As far as effectiveness, I have no idea. I have not noticed any change in him, not that I would or should, but if they really do contain all the stuff that's listed on the bottle then I know he is getting a good product. Also, he prefers these vitamins over Flintstones chewables. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DHA vitamin for kids","review":"I just got these for my 5 year old and 3 year old.

They are pretty small so I think my 5 year old will be able to swallow these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Difficult to get kids to eat","review":"I thought that the soft gels would be, well more soft and chewy. When you bite into these, they basically \\"pop\\", releasing the liquid and then you are left chewing on a hardened outer shell that takes a while to break down. I can see why some kids would have an issue with this, as I tried it and didn't find it appealing. I ended up having to cut each one open and put it in my son's juice, which was not fun. The oil itself is great, not too fishy. I'll be switching to the liquid form because the strawberry flavor blends well with other fruit juices and my kids don't mind taking it that way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helped with my sons eczema!","review":"My son has been taking these supplements since October & it has really seemed to help his eczema.

I haven't tried them - something about the idea of strawberry flavored fish oil I guess - but they beg for them if I forget to give them to them daily.

In no way are these chewable. I don't know if I got a very old bottle or what. Very frustrating. Does someone know of a trusted seller for this product where the capsules taste good and are chewable? I can't give these to my kids. My girls are too young they need things that are chewable not a pill to swallow.

I agree with the \\"college radio\\" feel of my fellow reviewers, but it's still very accessible to any music fan. Each track is underpinned by great little guitar grooves, and I especially like the crunchy riff on \\"Kill The Show\\". I find parallels to Travis vocally, with a more upbeat feel ala Third Eye Blind overall. Great CD! You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maine rock","review":"The best rock band ever to come from Portland, Maine, Lincolnville creates an atmospheric sound reminiscent of Galaxie 500 and Bedhead. Lead singer and guitarist Colin Decker uses words not to make a statement or even to invoke emotional resonance, but to paint landscapes of love, loss, and Americana. The result is rock that is often subdued, melodic and powerful. The music reminds me of the stuff the musical gestapo at my college radio station just loved and about which I wasn't wild at the time, but I found this CD to be far more accessible and listenable. \\"Heavenly Calm\\" and \\"Selling His Guns\\" are true college radio masterpieces. If you can catch Lincolnville live, they play a sublime cover of Neil Young's \\"Hey Hey, My My.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money on this.","review":"I picked this up used.

Basically I'm saying that it's flippin' awesome to feel somewhat a part of such a great band, and I'm not just saying that because one of the musicians is my friend. All the songs on the compact disc are exquisite, each a healthy serving of bone-breaking metal with some tasty melodic treats thrown in. Some of my favorite dishes are Guttersnipe, Inri, The Years Between, Moustache Pete, and Atlantis. But like I have mentioned before, the whole CD is a rockin' good time that makes me wet my pants. Oh, and seeing them live is even greater. Hopefully someday my band will be as great as Besieged. But anyway, buy this album because it's basically awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Notes From The Pilgrimage, A Wondrous Journey","review":"This is a wonderful, vibrant gloriously entertaining CD. Daryl Kojak, one of New York's finest piano players really shines here. Backed by a gorgeous string & horn section and guitarist Kenny Brescia, this is a collection of fabulous songs that will take you to that special place in your mind and just let yourself be carried where the music takes you.Lovers of George Winston Take Note: This CD's for you! Great for relaxing, reflecting, star gazing, love making or if you simply want a big happy satisfied smile on your face.

The voices are all top notch, pure and clear and delicious -- especially Tuva Semmingsen and Michael Maniaci. The acting is fabulous; often a weak spot in many operas. The costuming and staging are incredibly creative, but not so much that they detract and leave sticky directorial fingerprints everywhere. The music is letter-perfect, granted I'm a Baroque fan. I can't wait to find a long weekend to pop it back in the player and watch the whole thing again.If you're curious about Baroque opera, counters, modern staging ... grab this thing NOW. Use it to convert opera-skeptical friends who think opera is all about people in enormous dresses throwing themselves off cliffs. You'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warm, sunny, friendly listenin'","review":"This is a nice title that didn't take long to grow on me. The majority of tracks here are from the 60s. But by the end of disc 2 they're well into the 70s. You seriously feel the difference between a tune from 1960 and 1970! And what falls in between is a great progression of styles ranging from an early ska sound to rocksteady, even to a few rhumba, cha cha cha and calypso covers (for the beginning of disc 2) then moving on to reggae hits and a more full-on 70s vibe with stuff like the Isaac Hayes's classic 'Shaft' or (even cooler) 'Message to A Black Man' (wait a minute, just checked the liners, that's from '64!). Then how about the groovy-ish Calypso-reggae ditty Mawga Dawg (now this one's from the 70s) or the chuggin' groovy \\"Poison Pressure\\" after that. In a word, there's a lot of diversity on this compilation, but it's all very enjoyable stuff. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOE IS ME","review":"This cd that I recently had the misfortune of ordering is ridiculous beyond belief. It is self indulgent and painfully obsessed with itself. It was difficult enough getting through the first torturous and over the top dirge of a song, let alone the rest of the unfocused and irritating songs. Man With Money seems to be the only worthwhile song on this disc-unfortunate, as it is not even his.Word to the wise:stay away at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Lone Dissenter Amongst A Sea of Positive Reviews","review":"I ordered this book based on all the enthusiastic reviews I read from other everyday readers like me and I must say I was very disappointed by the writing style, especially since he's quite an established writer. Though the stories themselves are interesting enough, he writes as if this is a blog, with unfinished thoughts, meandering musings and distracting asides. It just made me wonder if an editor was ever involved in the process of getting this book published?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Friends","review":"Friends. We nightclubbed in south Florida in the early '80s. Club society (sic) loved these guys BECAUSE THEY WERE SO BRILLIANT. Listen, they never made a song derived from the common, overused lyrical love-thesaurus; never any \\"I love you like a (insert beautiful image).\\" And they never wrote one line that telegraphed forward the next line. Catch this: \\"I walked out on the Indian Ocean, I wore boots but they did not show, I got caught getting caught in the motion, ... Communist radio.\\" Other points of reference if you need them: they play first generation punk-fast, the guitars spit and tangle, ... the songs PROPEL.The Eat made us grin and laugh, they made us stop drinking for a minute and wonder/imagine, they created a passle of friends that still rock/live on to this day. The title of one of their EPs is God Punishes The Eat. A more appropriate sentiment is God Bless The Eat. This CD will let you peer into the brilliant/fine party that was the band."},{"rating":"2","title":"some good ones!","review":"this book has ten chapters of different myths:the chimaera,the golden touch,the gorgon's head,the miraculous pitcher,the paradise of children,the cyclops,the argonauts,how odin lost his eye,the quest of the hammer and the death ofbalder. i liked all of the stories. my favorite is,\\"the golden touch\\" which isthe story of king midas. king midas has everything but,he wants MORE!!! he wantseverything he touches to turn to gold-and it does!!!... be careful what you wishfor.this book is illustrated with fanciful line drawings by colleen browning. thisbook is for children AND adults. this is a nice,easy book to read and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Energy","review":"This is some of the most energetic music that I've heard, and yet isn't retarded on the musical side of it. Most drum and bass is not all that heavy on the music side of it, and is focused mostly on the beats. This is nowhere near the case from this duo. And they do more than just drum and bass, there's some crazy break beat, and even a track blurring genders, with a sort of electro/industrial breaks feeling to it. The guitars they bring with the music add an incredible twist, adding even more to the energy. Great CD all around, I'd recommend this over most drum and bass CD's out there right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"Aaaaaah. It's refreshing to finally hear something like this. I've been searching for this sound forever! They take the insane tempos of hardcore techno, add some great samples, killer guitar riffs and mind boggling beats and make them sound like never before. I would recommend thisd to anyone who likes fast paced electronic music and is sick of the juvenile and ridiculous Atari Teenage Riot acts."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Look at Woodrow Wilson","review":"\\"Wilsonianism\\" has defined, and in many ways imprisoned, American foreign policy since the end of World War I. But what if Wilsonianism was the product of pragmatic, ad hoc, political considerations rather than an idealistic grand strategy?In his marvelous and very readable study of the statecraft of President Woodrow Wilson, John A Thompson argues that Wilson blended certain idealistic values with hard political realities in his response to World War I. Thompson's book, while brief, is comprehensive: it begins with Wilson's childhood, takes the reader through his career as an academic and later President of Princeton University, discusses his term as Governor of New Jersey, and finally delves into the domestic and international aspects of the Wilson presidency.This book will appeal to general readers, particularly those who wish to be better informed about the Wilson presidency, as well as academic specialists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Careful - very academic read","review":"I'm not an academic but an avid reader who wanted an interesting, informative biography on Woodrow Wilson. This is really a text-book pretending to be a biogrpaphy and it took much patience and persistence to finish the book because it didn't really hold my attention. I love non fiction but not really esoteric or abstruse works, and I found this book overly academic and a bit boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fake alert: Silverline DVD are not Surround","review":"Silverline has gotten a hold of several terrible live concert recordings, (and I mean the concert was bad and the recording quality of it is also bad, a double wammy) Silverline has repackaged them as DVD Audio Surround and is now selling them for an astronomical price in the hopes that an idiot like me would buy them, but I am returning this sucker. You won't be able to hear the surround effect because it was originally recorded in stereo, perhaps even mono. Do not buy them, you will be sorry. But if you do buy one don't hesitate to write a review here to warn others, just like I did. Silverline series is entitled \\"From the Front Row\\", BestBuy carries quite a few of them usually with a green cover. They try to entice you with famous names on the cover, great musicians who undoubtedly would not willingly allow these horrendous concerts to see the light of day if they could. You have been warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"That Puccini Feeling","review":"Those who expect a lot of uptempo drama in an operatic compilation are welcome to look elsewhere - and the price of this gem will stay low.Nina Rautio and Angela Gheorghiu sing beautifully and expressively in Puccini's slow, emotive arias. And there is variety, with an interplay of voices, subtle shifts of tempo, and even a surging climax in the Turandot Act I Finale.This is the perfect album for relaxing after work when you get that Puccini feeling. It can be rejuvenating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I've ever read","review":"As a Lit major I have read a lot of books that are blessed with the distinction of being \\"good literature.\\" Choices is easily my favorite in my long list of quality books.

For some reason, Ginny decided she was going to wait for Tucker to return. Even when she heard he was engaged, she waited.Tucker seemed like a weak, indecisive person.

The tempos throughout are especially well-chosen, transitioning from introspective moments into dramatic scenes in very natural way, while keeping the story moving forward and joining all the different scenes into a unified whole. Gergiev also creates a fairly unified whole, but he does so through the use of consistently brisk (read: sometime rushed) tempos that don't suit the character of many scenes as much as Ermler's do here. The playing is excellent, and the recording is very sweet-toned and with a natural perspective on the orchestra (compared to the slightly more closely-miked Gergiev). The 1994 digital sound has just slightly less presence, however, than the best recordings made today. Would very much like to see this remastered and re-released."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stick with This One","review":"First of all, Pat Boone is not a scumbag. He is a mellow-voiced, cleancut individual with a soothing voice who made his mark in the late 1950's and early 1960s. This piece of work contains the Pat Boone essentials at a reasonable price.

The information is presented in a very sensitive fashion that is less likely to evoke a strong negative effect in survivors.

With sentences like, \\"Whether you're working with galvanized, slip PVC, or threaded PVC, you will now need a stem to connect every manifold orifice to the orifice in the bottom of each of your irrigation control vales.\\" you can see this is not a quick reference. This book is, however, a detailed manual on evaluating, building, and installing your own garden irrigation system. It helps to evaluate your watering needs and from there follows through to offer specific plans for laying pipes, installing sprinklers, using timers, and system automation. Black and white photos and diagrams help make sense of the more technical jargon (which actually begins to sound like English about half of the way through). A very detailed and specific guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intriguing, but poorly organized.","review":"This book had a lot of promise, written as it is by an English professor whose hands-on experience might easily translate to the experiences other do-it-yourselfers have. But it's disappointing. Concepts are poorly explained. There is little discussion about what pipe diameters (1/2\\", 3/4\\", etc.) are appropriate for what kind of job. He vaguely references working through moving from one diameter to the other, but does not explain why and in what circumstances each pipe is appropriate. Nor does he really put irrigation into a context that probably 90% of homeowners experience -- suburbia. There's discussion about micro sytems, macro systems, etc., but precious little discussion of the all-American suburban lawn.

All chapters are good, but \\"Four Mile Grouse\\" and \\"Red Letter Day\\" were personal favorites, and \\"Last Day\\" was the best hunting short story I've read. Well worth buying, and you can't beat the paperback price."},{"rating":"2","title":"None better than \\"Drummer in the Woods\\"","review":"I can agree with, and underscore, every single word of WDMcCann's review and will add this: neither the vast power of money nor the vast blarney of modern media can reach even the shadow of the Wisdom and Soul shining from every syllable of Burton Spiller's \\"Drummer in the Woods\\".

I was thrilled to receive it! It arrived in excellent condition and on time. Nice Job!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Grouse hunting made so SIMPLE!","review":"Spiller's book would appeal to anyone who enjoys the superficial, uninspired articles found in popular sporting periodicals.

Hunt 'em up."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING , ARROGANT, AND WITHOUT SUBSTANCE","review":"This book expressed the attitudes of a snobby, old-school grouse hunter. The stories seem to reflect fairy tale hunts, rather than anything a typical hunter experiences. Contrary to what the book seems to suggest, a \\"good\\" hunting dog need not be perfect, and not every hunt ends with a limit of grouse in the bag. Also, the book contains no useful information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting on Beading but it's NOT tatting","review":"This has some pretty and interesting stuff on beading but it's NOT tatting so don't think that you're getting tatting patterns. That is not the case. These patterns often use the look of a tatted piece (kindof) but it's made with beading (much bulker and not really lace like). The title is a little deceiving, and not being able to look through the book makes this big difference a little difficult to discern. It's certainly a fine book on beading but it's a whole world away from actual tatting."},{"rating":"1","title":"paul mccartney - paul is live in concert","review":"I bought this DVD not one but two times - I figured I musthave got a bad disc the first time.

But it gets worse.....I wish this video had WARNING lable on it for sensetive viewers for very disturbing content regards to animal cruelty and abuse scene.

I am traumatized for life...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does the man bother with quality-control at all???","review":"It's entirely possible that Quag got a bum copy of this thing, but if this is how the disc is intended to look and sound then it's just one more addition to McCartney's catalogue of AWFUL concert films. Lousy picture aside - I remember the videotape looking superior to this mess - there are enough audio drop-outs here to suggest this was made by bootleggers, not highly-paid professionals.

I was so irritated I could not watch the whole video.Its the 21st century. I am sure that the video directors and producers have to know by now,what the viewer is interested in.This guy is a part of rock music history.If anyone is unsure of how it is done, take a look at the Eagles, Police, or a Michael Jackson concert video as an example.As a fan, I really wanted to get into this concert, but I couldn't stay with the video long enough, sorry Paul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not much difference from the VHS","review":"I was at the concert in So Paulo in 1993. The concert was really something outstanding. I have the VHS and now the DVD. However, the quality of the image is not that good. They could have improved the images for the DVD.

But what a waste of money the purchase of this DVD was. If the editing was meant to be \\"artful\\" then the verdict has to be: Misguided, complete failure.

If you are a Paul McCartney fan: Stay away from this DVD, save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not get into it","review":"I have to disagree with everyone else. This book was not good, the writing was sloppy, disorganized, and just all around bad. I wanted to read this book because the plot appealed to me, a young man who comes from a bad home life, yet he chooses to turn his life around. Too many of our men, not just black men are abandoning their children to be raised by single mothers who have no choice but to become strong. I was highly disappointed. I could not make it through the book. Finally, i just skipped to the end and needless to say, the ending did not leave me wanting more.

A friend of mine has one that is the same type of design but made from tubular aluminium and canvas that is so confortable that we fight over who gets to sit on it. I thought this chair would be a classy version with the same comfort so I bought 2. Boy was I wrong.The chair looks great but it is not comfortable at all. The end of the seat is too short or too long and your legs rest on the wood bar which is not at all comfortable. I'm not sure how it can be fixed (I think that the seating surface needs to be longer so that your weight rests on the seat and not the end bar) but it really is a design flaw.It also creaks very loudly when you sit on it.Definitely not worth the money as chairs but they do look nice on my deck! I now consider them purely ornamental."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it...","review":"We found deck chairs like this at a resort and we loved them. Bought this one because it was in our budget.

It is about the author's spiritual journey - a kind of pilgrimage of self-discovery - which she undertakes by visiting key landscapes throughout Alberta, from the far northern reaches of the Canadian Shield to the parched grasslands in the southeastern corner of the province. Thus, it is both a travel book and a memoir, and it also contains good scientific information and beautiful colour photographic plates illustrating the various landscapes of Alberta. Such a mixture is intriguing, but it means the book is diffuse rather than tight in its structure (or to put it more simply, it wanders whimsically from topic to topic). If you approach the book with the expectation that it will be eclectic and a little unfocussed, this will soon cease to seem like much of a defect, and indeed, it becomes part of the book's considerable charm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trust me it's worth it!","review":"I know I know...

However, the flow of this album was far superior on the old ep+2. Stanlely Kubrick is now burried deep inside this rock and roll orgy, and it dilutes the mellower vibe this album used to carry. Don't get me wrong, Superheros of BMX is a great track, but it's better on Ten Rapid where it belongs. Find a used copy of ep+2 and you'll find it a much better listening experience, and pick up Ten Rapid while you're at it.

Thats a first no-no. The second thing is the style this music is played in. Elvis had a traditional style of music that was proportionate to the era it was being introduced. It should stay that way. Experiments like these should be left in the garage, I mean what's with the super heavy distortion on the guitar? It doesn't fit. Third, Lenny Kilmister, Michael Desbarres, and Jamie James voices do not justify Elviss'voice at all. They were I'm sorry to say \\"horrible\\". Let's respect what Bing Crosby thought was amazing voice. This album would have been better and a better use of Slim Jims' time without these three guys and the heavily distorted guitar.

Steel Prohpet, and Hammerfall do great. I also enjoyed the Egypt version, done bo DORO, who I had not heard of, and now that i have, i'll look for more.

The series takes you to Hawaii, TN, CA, OR, WA....but each one is linked to Glenbrooke...a town you kind of wish you could visit or even live there...of course its seems like you do when you are reading the series. I just finished book 7 of the 8. I almost hate to finish the last one....I want there to be a number 9 and continue on. The Glenbrooke series has romance and friendships that intertwine in each book.

Grammar points are reinforced by numerous exercises and by the videos that accompany Travessia. The book is intended for a person learning a foreign language for the first time. If one possesses knowledge of other romance languages, it will seem Travessia moves too slowly. If one is looking for a quick transition from another romance language to Portuguese, a solely grammar based Portuguese text may be more appropriate. Travessia also does well with respect to the culture covered throughout the book. Another emphasis of Travessia is the development of pratical language skills (e.g. telephone, hotel, and travel vocabualary/situations)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ineffective...","review":"I agree in part with the reviewer (of another text in this series) who stated that Travessia is lacking in a structured, grammar based approach. Naturally, any textbook is going to be a poor substitute for other, more immersive ways of learning a language but Travessia tries too hard to rise above this basic fact. The result is that the texts really don't stand on their own as even a minimally useful reference/guide to the language. Worse, they tie you to dependence on the video, a circumstance that is, among other things, highly inconvenient. I found this very frustrating...as did my teacher, a native Brazilian, who--bless his heart--found creative ways to get around this constraining series of texts in his classroom."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Most Unfortunate Choice of Narrator","review":"Mr. Brown has no abilities with accents. Hence, the Irish Maturin sounds the same as his English friend Jack. Even Worse, Mr. Brown has almost no acting abiltiy. He reads in a sing song voice that is painful to hear. The Only reason I continued to listen to this abomination was that I wanted to follow the series and this was the cassette the library had.

I use these to mark my sprinkler heads when doing any kind of yard work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not really literary theory, but criticism categories","review":"I bought this book for a literary criticism class and it fit the bill well. This book is not really about literary theory like the title may suggest, but rather it gives different types of viewpoints for criticism of literature. Some include Feminist, formalist, reader response, etc. It doesn't talk about the relationships between an author creating a text, what literature is, etc. that is more of the theory part. So if you want to know the generalized types of criticism that professors expect English majors to be able to point at and name, go for it. It's not going to teach you how to think about it abstractly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neo-Soul music lovers who also love gospel","review":"Heard her music on satellite TV, went to the computer to find it.

I was hoping to find something else on the internet that she might like better, but so far there isn't much to choose from."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mostly What You Would Expect With B-Sides But...","review":"This album has some killer re-mixes and that in some cases are better than the original version. Specifically, songs like Next Is the E, Have You Seen my Baby, and Drop a Beat. It also contains one of the most jarring tracks ever in Thousand, which according to the Guiness Book of World Records, is the fastest song ever recorded. Needless to say, it probably won't be one that you would want to listen over and over to. The remixes of Go are good at first, but then they sorta become bland, but then again there are 14 different versions here. The Rainforest mix is my favorite version of Go, and the In Dub mix was my least favorite.Should you pick this album up? Most definitely if you're a fan of Moby or of techno. Yes, there's some weak stuff here, so it's not going be another Play, Everything Is Wrong, or I Like to Score. It's more like Moby but with more filler, and it's probably a better album than about 85% of the stuff that's out there now."},{"rating":"1","title":"only way to get his Dust Mix","review":"I had to hear Time's Up (Dust Mix) from a P to P download (unfortunately @ 128kb) and got fixated on it's trippy groove.

The only reason I took away a star, was for lyrics that at times came off as very generic (emo/pop-punk). The flow of the album is really good. The highlights are Timid Gentleman, Love Lust and Fake integrity, the continuation track Capitol Arrangement, and Fountain Imperfection (truly a perfect song).-If you like/dislike the review let me know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard Science, Clearly Delivered","review":"This book is much the best introduction to solar energy's prospects and possibilities. It makes the science easy, and puts the politics of solar energy firmly in the context of the physics of the possible. A highly recommended guide for anyone considering a solar project, and also a superb guide for those who seek to influence or to understand energy policy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Negative, irritable and often outright hostile.","review":"Overall, I did not like this book. The author, Howard Hayden, appears to have a chip on his shoulder brought on by his apparent perception that liberalism is too closely associated with the perceived promise of solar energy. He takes a one-sided Rush Limbaugh-like approach in his analysis of this important topic.....except, Hayden's facts are now outdated. For example, he apparently did not forsee the very recent development of the high efficiency 225W 3x5 solar panels by Sharp Inc. Within just years, for example, his fixation on the land area of Connecticut could now be reduced significantly. He also apparently does not understand the principles of \\"economies of scale\\". Somebody in 1880 could have just as easily written a book about the fraud of electical power. Such a person would have never made any meaningful contribution to this world and would have died writing beside his lantern, while the rest of the world had electric light. [...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a serious book on the subject","review":"As an electrical engineer I am surprised that that solar and wind energy are even questioned at all in this book. Solar and wind energy have the capability of powering the US only if these type installations are made a priority by utilities and government. The costs per KWh have dropped dramatically and for wind are already below coal and oil (specially when considering the costs of pollution and cleaning up spills, not even considering the costs of supporting supply lines from the middle east) at less than 5 cents. None of this is discussed. In any case I agree with previous reviewers this is not a serious book on the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Solar Energy and the Future of Mankind","review":"Mounting evidence suggests that the author's conclusions are valid for a limited time. Solar energy (solar, wind, hydro,& biomass) may never be able to provide all of the energy required for survival of 6 billion people(earth's current population).However, solar energy may have to provide most of mankind's energy in the future. If terrorists make atomic energy too dangerous, if fission energy remains a dream, and if fossil fuels become depleted, then mankind will be forced to obtain most of its energy from renewable energy sources.Current estimates suggest that mankind has about 33 cubic miles of recoverable crude oil remaining and that we are consuming about one cubic mile each year.Perhaps the sequal to this book will be, \\"How to Survive on Solar Energy in the Post-Petroleum Era\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Solar Fraud","review":"For those of us without an advanced degree in engineering or physics, and the suspicion that most of what we read in the popular press on \\"alternative\\" energy is pure hype, \\"The Solar Fraud\\" provides answers. By the way, as used in this book, \\"solar\\" includes not only the familiar solar-electric panels, but wind, bio-mass and hydroelectric power. Although the author is a physicist, you won't see pages of equations. However, the ideas presented are backed up with numerical data, tables, conversion factors, and references. Best of all, the way in which the book is organized, allows easy access to specific facts and figures to fact check the more outrageous claims of the alternative energy hucksters."},{"rating":"1","title":"This man is so shortsighted that he thinks it's already 2008","review":"I mean really, is it far fetched that we could be 80-100 percent solar by 2008, well if it is, then we have failed at a good and common goal! taink yu"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dance Diva's","review":"Love the CD.

The film makes good use of POV camera work, and the actors sizzle with raw emotional power. The plot is also somewhat unconventional, and I was never quite sure where it would take me next. For the filmophile, a rare thinking experience that is searing in its delivery, and benefits from superb acting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing \\"Night\\"","review":"Saw this film recently on Showtime and it was based on the fact that John Malkovich was in it but unfortunately it is primarily a cameo of about 10 minutes of screen time. The kidnapping of a little girl from her San Diego home was harrowing to say the least and the acting from Tom Arnold as the abductor and Jeremy Sisto, Harold Perrineau as his confederates was also very good but the film just dragged on to its dismal conclusion. I often wonder what the filmmakers intent was to have such an un resolved ending? I was hoping that the female, now a teenager would slowly be indoctrinated back into her family. What's also missing from this disappointing film is that we are not shown what the abductors did when she reached the teen age or how she was dumped back into society. So basically the blame is on the writer and director of this film rather than the actors the actress playing grown teenage girl lacks a center in her acting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Living well, for less!","review":"I found Champagne Living on a Beer Budget in my public library when my kids were young and my ex was dealing with a disability.

Oh no!","review":"On the positive side, I found that the author's love of the breed was apparent in her warm comments, and I think potential or new owners of Siamese cats would find some helpful information here. However, since this book was published in 1989, some of the information is dated, such as the statement that none of the commercial cat foods should be fed exclusively because none are complete diets. I was alarmed by the technique used for getting a cat to swallow a pill - by holding the cat upside down! Don't buy this book. There are a number of current books available on owning or, more accurately, being owned by a Siamese cat! I recommend \\"Guide to Owning a Siamese Cat\\" by Brenda Yule (1997); \\"The Complete Siamese\\" by Sally Franklin (1995); and \\"Siamese Cats, Everything about Acquisition, Care, Nutrition, Behavior, Health Care, and Breeding\\" by Marjorie McCann Collier (1992)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feel the Difference!","review":"There are different qualities of ginseng extract - this is one of the best - one bottle a day and you'll be OK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book for Baltic Neoclassicism","review":"This softcover edition of the 1990 hardcover NEO-CLASSICISM IN THE NORTH is currently the best source for information on 18th and 19th century Swedish furniture and interiors.

Whereas early Mayhem made you want to pick up the guitar and start playing, this is pretty generic black metal. I got this because I heard they were one of the only Thelemic bands. None of the songs stand out and even when ripped on a hard drive the vocals are still unintelligable. Skip this and throw away the geek black metal clothes because black metal is dead and no music sells any more. It's pretty much a third world country and this album only reassures that. I'm not taking trash, but come on, this is worse than Mayhem and as bland as Deicide."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE POLISH STORM HAS ARRIVED","review":"Simply put one of the best albums I have heard. Released in 1999, it finally sees a state-side release. Fans of black and death will like this album. BEHEMOTH has created a violent mix of both death and black meatl. From the opening pounding of Decade of Therion to the closing Chant of Eschaton, this is just a relentless album. The guitars are fast and shredding, while the vokalist Nergal sounds possessed and the drumming is hyper. If you get a chance to listen to this do so you will not be disappointed.

I'm a Whitney Houston fan, love her songs, and I'm tone deaf. My friends and I have big fun singing these 15 Whitney Houston songs on Karaoke Night at my house. The instrumental music is not like the actual CD version of the songs but it's close enough. There are a few songs that I'm not as familiar with so it would have been helpful to have the original songs and the karaoke versions on the CD. However, I just go to my Whitney Houston CD collection and reacquaint myself with the songs. Although, the time gap between each song and the intros at the start of several songs are a bit long for me, it's still a great karaoke CD! The price of the Pro Artist: Whitney Houston karaoke CD was reasonable, especially for a graphics type karaoke CD.

It's the kind of curtain you might find at a really cheap, off-the-beaten-track motel where you better wear flip-flops in the shower or you'll get foot fungus. The hookless design does work so it's a shame a better curtain material wasn't used. But as is, it's not at all attractive, flimsy and doesn't hang well.

Every float day began with a reading from the book to explain the history of each bottom as we passed by. The hiking descriptions were what one expects from Kelsey: great if you are experienced and use it as a guide, lacking if you need your hand held the whole way. Get this book if you are canoeing the flat waters of Canyonlands. (In general I find the Belknap guide book easier to use for actual river navigation.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable","review":"Michael Kelsey is notorious for inaccurate information. He'll review hikes he's never done, list canyon entry and exit points he's never attempted. He's all about speed. He races through areas in order to spew out his next book without actually taking the time to experience the canyons through which he's rushing. He covers a lot of ground, but sees little.

The cakes were still higher in the middle and seemed to take a MUCH longer time to bake. Fabric is incredibly difficult to pin to the pan when wet -- especially with the cheap pins included in the manufacturer's package. They also shrank more each time I used them, making it harder to fit them around the girth of the pan. Really not worth the money. Next time I'm going to try a different tip I found -- using a wet strip from an old terry towel. Can't be any worse than this product.

As claimed, it will keep the cake from doming in the center. The trade off is a cake that rises so much it nearly overflows the pans, and edges that are dry and crispy before the middle gets anywhere near finished. I finally threw these away and will just go back to leveling my cakes with a knife. It's no different than having to cut off the nearly burnt crust, and I'll know the inside is actually baked to completion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I wasted my money here.

I ordered the VE-12 blindly - I hadn't seen them or heard them but I trusted the brand. First off they are HUGE which is something I can live with, but they are double the width of other floor speakers. My main issue is that they sound like a crappy speaker stuck inside of a CV cabinet. The bass isn't strong and the highs aren't crisp - its all incredibly flat, thick and dull.

The entry to the subject is careful to build context, explaining the role of signals and signal processing, and how the processing of signals leads to circuits. It also is careful to emphasize the design process and how it is related to SPICE and to analysis methods.There are some sources of confusion, for example, Fig. 2.17(b) and Fig. 2.18(b) contain circuit elements pertaining to reverse bias of a diode that are never explained, including a diode symbol never introduced or explained. The discussion of a peak detector as a demodulator employs a series connection of voltage sources (p. 119) instead of a multiplication of the modulating and carrier waveforms.Overall, an excellent introduction, more modern and much better at context and motivation than most."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality","review":"I find this book very confusing.

Some levels take forever to load, etc.The single player scenarios I've played so far are boring and the scenario descriptions seem lacking (i.e., it's often not clear what you're supposed to do on any given level). Seems like you have to do more running away from the enemy to get through the early levels than actual fighting -- I owe this to the fact the player units seem much weaker compared to the enemy than Myth II and overall the play isn't well balanced.Haven't played the multiplayer mode.

Also, the designers made Myth III too specific by creating a pseudo-Celtic atmosphere that is disconnected from Myth I and II.

If you do know Ballo, this recording is more than worth it for the youthful and smooth voiced Pavarotti, the bright Helen Donath, and the amazing Sherrill Milnes. They sing the pants off of this score. Just beware of Renata Tebaldi's Amelia and take her performance within the larger context of this opera and her career."},{"rating":"2","title":"Straightforward and clear.","review":"Kenneth Seeskin here presents a clear and straightforward reading of Moses Maimonides that can serve as an accessible (if not terribly deep) introduction to the thought of Judaism's greatest philosopher. Seeskin intentionally distances himself from the Straussian persecution-and-the-art-of-writing school of interpretation and wastes no time looking for \\"hidden meanings\\" buried several levels below the explicit text.

If you remember the old G-Shock watches from the 80's; this is bigger and heavier, but way less durable --my first one broke the second day I had it--.The biggest downfall of this watch is that the timer is very unreliable, mainly because if you bend your wrist a little it pushes in the timer and turns it off. For me, this happened more often then not, and found myself constantly frustrated that the watch didn't serve its intended purpose.I hope somebody will one day make a series of light-weight, well designed, attractive standard clock face, vibrating reminder watches... but until they do, I'm just going to buy an ugly digital vibraLITE and keep it in my pocket."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vibrating Watch","review":"I did not care for the watch. It arrived in a damaged box and it did not have any directions. I figured out how to work it on my own. The vibration was weak and a unreliable.

It is a much better product."},{"rating":"1","title":"not satisfied","review":"I have this watch, and there are a few things I don't like about it.1. I got it for the vibrating alarm, which works fine. Unfortunately, it's off by 3 hours. If I set it for 7 am, it goes off at 3 am! I can adapt, but it's an annoyance. Also people should be aware that if its set for a particular time it will go off at that time every 12 hours, not every 24.2. The watch weights a ton. Why should a watch weigh so much? Its big and bulky and feels like its made of solid lead.3. The ring that takes up about half the landscape of the face and looks like a compass has no purpose, as far as I can tell.Maybe I can return this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ex-Bloodhound Gang Fan!!!","review":"Before watching this dvd, bhg was one of my favorite bands. I didn't think anything that they would do could shock me. But after viewing the documentary I was disgusted. Jimmy Pop and Evil Jared, more so than the other members of the band, were total pigs. I didn't see the need for Evil Jared to expose himself so much in the video. (Don't want no short, short man). I'm not surprised that Spanky G left the band.

But this book just drags on and on and on... I wound up wanting to yell at both main characters - get over it all ready!

The mental explorations are tedious.

Kellan Chance and Jamie Winslow are former sweethearts and were once engaged to be married. After leaving him at the altar once and walking out on him for the second time, Jamie must find closure with Kellan to get her license to practice psychology. I found the two characters analyzed each other far too much and I started to feel like I was reading a psychology manual instead of a romance.

The kids said they would definitely start to write letters with this book and they did start.Loved it!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoffa and the mob","review":"Moldea's book definitely has a tone. There's a point early on where he states fairly flatly that the best thing Hoffa ever did for the Teamsters was disappear. Clearly, this isn't the place if you're looking for a psychological profile of Hoffa.However, it *is* the place to look if what you're looking for is a history of the relationships between the Teamsters, organized crime, Robert Kennedy and Castro. A fascinating look at the web of power that bound these players together.Moldea has a reputation for dedication and honesty, and the work here bears that reputation out. The writing is detailed and passionate. What I liked best was how clearly it communicated issues internal to the Teamsters. It's a very complicated subject, and to understand it you have to understand things like the role of owner-operators. Moldea reduced that complexity for the uninitiated, a formidible task."},{"rating":"1","title":"And the point of that review was... ?","review":"I read another review that expressed really well what I thought of this book. No story development, no character development, no plot.... in a word: pointless. But the other reviewer went on to recommend the book. There's where my opinion differs. I agree that the book was readable, that (and my curiousity) was what kept me from giving up on it entirely by the time I was half way through.

These strips are made from material similar to oven mitts and you're supposed to soak them before wrapping around the cake pan. The reason this works (in theory) is because heat then only reaches the top and bottom of the cake. Without this approach, your cake cooks and sets up on the sides quickly before it has a chance to rise fully. So the middle, which cooks more slowly, rises farther.I found the strips to be too narrow to block heat to the entire side of the pan. Also, they were of inconsistent lengths. I suppose that's supposed to provide flexibility for a variety of pan widths. But I would just like two strips of equal length that fit my standard 9 x 1.5 inch cake pans. As a result, I will go back to using a tea towel that is cut to the right width and length. They're cheap and I've had great results."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bad purchase because, unfortunately . . .","review":". . .they don't work! I recently purchased and used these strips -- twice and using two different recipes -- to bake layer cakes for two ice cream cakes. Because I was creating ice cream cakes (center layer was ice cream), I wanted the cakes to be as level as possible. That didn't happen. They baked with rounded tops -- in my still-new gas oven -- and they created large air holes in both cakes. I have been baking cakes for over 50 years and I have never had air bubbles of such a size in any cake, baked in any oven. The crowning touch: they oozed a black substance onto my oven racks -- the filling inside the strips, I believe. Yes, I followed all the instructions. I have returned them to Baker's Catalog and received a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cake still cracked or was uneven...disappointed","review":"I thought these were going to make the cakes even to make icing easier and make cheesecakes not crack. However, I was disappointed on both occasions. Maybe I didn't use them properly (it can't be rocket science), but I'll try again nonetheless. I should mention that it's possible these are only meant for round pans without the latch for the spring? That's the only reason I can think of why they didn't work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked fabulously! Wont bake without them!","review":"These things work exactly like I hoped!

The country plucking on \\"Hipalong Hop\\" adds some perky fun, but it's with \\"Fly Hawaii\\" that Cole's guitar really takes center stage. They take a relaxed approach with \\"This Stuff Is Fresh,\\" which has a dreamy quality, while they're just having a laugh with \\"Cheng Phooey.\\" The dance party gets underway with the electric bass underpinning \\"Party Animals,\\" but \\"Watery Glass Planet (Pt.3)\\" throws a spanner in the works with a twisted, meandering track. \\"Songs Of The Night Life\\" harkens back to the opening, though with a shuffly beat that works quite well.

While the descriptions of life on a carrier may have been accurate, the story-telling just isn't there. We are asked to suspend belief, and to believe that 8000 naval personnel would blindly follow orders without checking. As just one example, we have the carrier supposedly at EMCON (emissions control-nothing radiated), and yet crewmembers are recieving and sending e-mails. And this is just one of the minor inconsistancies. All in all a very dissapointing book.

I was expecting it to be as good as the Metallica tribute by Apocalyptica (which was badass) but I was disapointed, I mean it just [stinks]. It sounds like a lot of noise with a violin imitating Vedder's vocal parts. Also, it turns out that this String Quartet recorded a whole bunch of tributes at the same time (REM, Rush, Alanis, Led Zeppelin) I guess they're just trying to jump on the \\"String Tribute\\" bandwagon that Apocalyptica created to earn some cash.

Consequently, much of the band's best work, including songs that would be suited to adaptation as string pieces like Parting Ways, Off He Goes and Present Tense.

So I ordered these and within a few weeks I keep finding little pieces of the ball in the dryer. They continue to lose their little spikes on the balls. My last balls lasted for years these are ready for the garbage. I can't return them as the window for return expired and it's only been a few months. I would not buy these again!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"Disappointed about the quality. One of the two balls broke down within two weeks and the other leaves static on the clothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUYER BEWARE!!","review":"I did not make my purchase through Amazon but I did buy 4 of these lousey balls locally and how I wish I could go back and say I didn't. They completely demolished a dryer full of clothes. Of course it wasn't a bunch of old work clothes it was really good clothes. Those points on the balls made holes in the fabric and the balls got tangled up as the drying cycle went on and it ripped big holes in many and small holes in the rest of them. A total loss!! Stay clear of these DESTROYERS!! If something sounds too good to be true... it isn't true!! If you want to stay clear of fabric softeners and sheets and go natural try baking soda in your rinse cycle.Tried em and hate em!!!!!PS... Yes they are very noisey.... noisey like bowling balls in your dryer and imagine what they do to your clothese... especially cotton... even denium... when they have sharp barbs on the bowling balls... did I say DESTROYERS... let's try EXTERMINATORS!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for MicroFiber Cloths!","review":"I used these dryer balls on a load of MicroFiber cloths. They appeared to have done a good job.....until I used one of the cloths on my iPad screen. Instead of wiping the screen clean, the cloth smeared the screen up worse than before I used the cloth. I can only imagine those little points rounding out over time.....all over my clothes! That was the end of the dryer balls for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure of product effects","review":"I have been using over a month, every load, but still not sure if this product actually doing something or not. It is not really cutting drying time neither."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saves Energy = 5 Stars","review":"Very happy with these. I purchased two pairs of these and along with another set of pink ones that we bought at a Babies'R'Us we have gone from two full cycles in our dryer to dry a load down to one cycle (one and a half for heavy duty loads like sheets).This will certainly save more on our energy bills than the cost of the dryer balls within one month."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works","review":"They like prickly balls and much heavier than tennis balls. They are odorless, and depending on your preference, you might miss the pleasant smell of your favorite dryer sheets. They do work. It makes the clothes fluffy and also lessen the static without using any chemicals.But if you use it with a little load, it sounds as if somebody put a pair of sneakers in the dryer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damages fabric. Avoid.","review":"I was keen on trying out dryer balls to do away with the chemicals of dryer sheets. It seems as though the balls do manage to fluff up the clothes due to the mechanical action. I actually used a different brand than this one - one with some patches meant to reduce static. The static reduction seemed to work too, since there was none on the clothes.The claims of reducing drying time, didn't seem to bear out. Clothes seemed to take the same amount of time to dry.I had to discontinue using this once I discovered that it damaged flannel sheets. The sheets were left with the flannel bunched into bumps rather than the soft feel that it had before. This is obviously due to the mechanical beating that the sheets gave it. I should have realized that the mechanical action will damage fabric.I suggest avoiding this product and sticking with dryer sheets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality and causes a lot of static","review":"I read that someone needed 6 for large loads so I bought 6 of them. After a month, I only have two left. All of the others split in two. Also, I bought them to help dewrinkle my husband's khaki pants. They did an okay job with this but they caused so much static that I have to use two dryer sheets with them. They are loud at first but as they are in the dryer and warm up they are not as loud. I was really disappointed with the quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap imitation.","review":"Cheap imitation, static did not get reduced, and the ball split in half after a few loads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Destroys your clothes","review":"I loved these things....at first. After several weeks of use, a lot of our bath towels and shirts started fraying around the edges. Before I tossed out the ruined items, I cut off the frayed bits and ran them through several cycles without the balls and guess what? No more fraying. These things will ruin your clothes. Not immediately, but they will tear at the fabric and one day you'll be pulling things out of the dryer and wonder why you bought these things. Great idea, but only for the sturdiest of materials... and then only if there are no weak or damaged areas.Do not bother buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blue Balls Are All You Have","review":"The hard blue balls are suppose to act like a separator for clothes in your dryer with the knubby surface.

I thought I'd be able to stop buying dryer sheets (Bounce). As others have said these are very loud and all of my clothes are VERY statically charged and clingy. Complete waste of money. At least we are only out $10. Despite what one reviewer said, I have ONLY used them on freshly washed clothes, not clothes that have been sitting for hours. Still does not work, does not prevent static. Rather these cause static in your clothes and they get stuck in shirt sleeves, sheets, pant legs, etc. I gave these a good two month try. They're going in the garbage now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the authentic item - cheap imitation","review":"OK, so I ordered two sets of these only to be frustrated!

This, coupled with the fact that the packaging looked like it was printed on some color laserjet printer with several typos, was not reassuring, to say the least. That \\"Made in China\\" sign seemed to blare at me. I know everything is made in China these days, but what corners did they cut in the production process to have these dryer balls delivered to me smelling like they were doused in gasoline?? Not good. I went and purchased some tennis balls for less than $3 instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after a few months","review":"These are ok.

They are free of extra chemicals (hooray for the environment), and they'll pay for themselves after many uses.Cons: After a year's use in a 3-person family, some of my clothes are starting to retain static, but it has only happened occasionally. They also tend to be a bit noisy, as to be expected. Might discolor slightly after awhile, but doesn't affect functionality.Final thought: Decent product, decent price, would buy again."},{"rating":"1","title":"They don't last and are so-so in function","review":"In their advertising, the distributor claims that these balls last for years. One of mine broke into pieces after a few months of light use. Don't waste your money. I'm especially disappointed because my son is very sensitive to any fabric softeners so I cannot use them or any sort of dryer sheet. The manufacturer refused a replacement (rather use dryer sheets, but I can't!) or refund without sending proof of purchase, which of course I didn't have any more. I expected them to last for years, as advertised. I was willing to send the broken ball, but that wasn't enough \\"proof of purchase.\\" Ridiculous and a rip-off.Beyond the issue of durability, they are certainly a poor substitute for fabric softeners and dryer sheets. I never noticed a reduction in dry time, either."},{"rating":"2","title":"They actually work","review":"Strange but true, they do seem to fluff up clothes and make them softer. It's most apparent already soft materials such as cotton shirts or Egyptian cotton towels. These tend to keep them soft. On the other hand I have a couple of shirts with harsher material (probably 50/50 cotton/poly) and these won't make them any softer. They'll make noise when the dryer is first started as they're hard plastic but as the dryer warms up the plastic softens enough to where the noise stops. What these don't do is prevent static or wrinkles so you still need to pull your items out of the dryer quickly after it stops.I gave up fabric softener after learning one of the ingredients was horse urine (thanks for grossing me out Wired) so for the relatively inexpensive price I think it's a worthwhile purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"These are worthless.

All wrong.So I wasted a bunch of bunks for something that did not work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dryer Balls VS. Fabric Softener and Dryer Sheets","review":"Why are these better than dryer sheets and fabric softener? Because dryer sheets and fabric softener are evil. If you're allergic or sensitive, these are a great resolution.I can think of three cons, but they're not really \\"bad\\":- Small loads means that the balls bounce around, making some noise. The noise level is less annoying than, say, drying a pair of sneakers.- Larger loads require more balls to ensure everything in the dryer is reached.- Once they are done drying, you might have to search for them if they get caught in pillow cases and such.On the up side:- Great for sensitive or allergic skin.- Great for saving money.- Cats like them."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT USE THESE BALLS","review":"Do Not Use These. They will tear your clothes. My wife started putting these in the dryer and the next thing you know I had tiny dimples and tears in my expensive clothes.

After two loads I am returning these balls because of the loud noise. I used to be able to run the dryer at night, but its not possible now with the dryer balls. Just imagine hard plastic balls tumbling in the dryer, well for me the additional noise was not worth it. It's very similar to putting shoes in the dryer.

I was, however, disappointed to find that it is a very slight volume with bare thumbnail descriptions of Vermont ghostly activity, usually with only the most rudimentary description of where they occurred. As one who is becoming something of an amateur ghost-hunter, this was a let-down, as the title and description of this work would have you believe it provides directions to find these haunted locales. Sadly, it does not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enthralled by Vermont's Haunts","review":"This is just the kind of travel guide I like: condensed little stories of doom and eccentricity set in the pastoral splendor and the down-home warmth that is Vermont.

Just a wonderful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"I'm a big fan of Terry Pratchett, but found this one to be a somewhat weak effort on his part. The book had its funny moments, but was far from TP's normal hilarity. Also, TP usually mixes in biting social commentary with his stories, but it never quite connects here. At times, he seems to be condemning war as a testosterone driven exercise, but then at other times he shies away from that, and the last chapter actually argues for war!No, this is just not a good book. If you are a fan of TPs, you will want to buy it, just to complete your collection. But, if you aren't a fan, you will find this to be a book, weak on humor and weak on social commentary - a cute story that goes from A to B without making a point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Read!","review":"This tale of cross-dressing soldiers brought a smile to my face, in a way that only Terry Pratchett can! I can only imagine that, back in the day, women really did dress as men to be able to join the military.While giving bit parts to some old favorites, Pratchett introduces a whole new cast of characters to entertain the reader, in this book. Continuing with the theme of all Pratchett books, this will make any reader laugh, not only at the fantastical humor but also at the silly puns incorporated within...This is another of the Discworld series that does not require having read any of the previous books to be able to enjoy it. It would be a great stand alone novel for someone looking for a quick read.And ladies, remember that socks are the key...Courtney ConantAuthor ofThe Blood Moon of Winter (Land of Makayra (Volume 1))"},{"rating":"2","title":"More than they say","review":"Other reviews say this book is not like the others.I did not find a few of his works funny but still great.This work is good,it's a fun read and hard to put down.I have read Pratchetts books at least 10 times each and find this one a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"simply FANtastic","review":"this hilarious novel is sure to appeal to a wide spectrum of readers, while straying from the usual discworld oddities of Nobby Nobs and Cut me own throat \\"dibbler\\", Pratchett again effortlessly draws a portrait in the minds eye, of each character. Subtle hints are given throughout as to the eventual outcome of this feminist view of the armed forces but should amuse even the most starchy of brigadiers and sergeants the world over. Witty, endearing, and equally as amusing as his previous masterpieces, the world as we know it will be a dark and sad place when HE finally shuffles off this mortal coil."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's to laugh about?","review":"This book settles it--I have lost my sense of humor. If you can find laughs in this book, congratulations. You probably collect SNL's last seasons on tape. I was disappointed and bored in turns throughout this book.While Terry Pratchett can create characters and form sentences that nobody ever used before, his conversations are starting to take a predictable form, something like 4-panel comic strips. You know when the kicker is coming and what it will be. I respect his craft and have enjoyed every page of earlier books, but this one and Night Watch seem to have been written by someone else, or when Pratchett had other things to do.I guess I'll stick to re-reading the old ones from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"The least enjoyable Discworld novel yet","review":"I've read, if not all the Discworld novels, then at least 90% of them. This is the least enjoyable yet. Not because it's about the folly of war, or the hazards of stereotyping, but because it just isn't funny. Something's missing here. It reads like a lesser author's failed attempt at emulating Mr. Pratchett."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my thing","review":"This might be a better movie than it is a book. The writing itself is good and for those who enjoy reading this type of book, I'm sure it's fine but I have trouble getting serious about trolls and vampires who are recruited to fight a war. The girl, Polly, is enjoyable and the plot of her trying to find her brother dressed as a boy is interesting and I keep reading because of her and just tolerate the rest of the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not his best","review":"Terry is one of my favourite authors (we're even on first name terms) and i've read. I confess. All of his books. And this is definitely not as strong as most of his discworld series.His humour is, surprisingly, almost as good as ever. He's a funny guy. But i think the fact that he is introducing a whole new cast of characters and there not even in Ankh Morpork its actually a little boring. You don't really become involved because throughout the whole book hes saying how unimportant this country is. Also, he does use an old cast of characters- My favourites- the city watch but they are not used affectively and dont crop up as often as i would have liked. Vimes seems particularly absent from his usual surly self. He smiles.But i still think it's an excellent book. A good laugh. And perfect for anyone.God Save Terry Pratchett."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monstrous Regiment a monstrous disappointment","review":"There isn't much to say about this book. I generally look forward to reading Terry Pratchett's work because he has a way of intertwining his message with a humorous story. But in Monstrous Regiment, there was no such subtlety. His message virtually bludgeons the reader. Even though I agreed with his message, there was so little humor that by page 100 of 500, I gave up. If you like Pratchett's usual wit, sarcasm and satire, then do not read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing from a great author","review":"The challenging part of writing fantasy is making the unbelievable believable. Sadly, Terry Pratchett does not meet the challenge in \\"Monstrous Regiment\\". I have read and enjoyed previous Discworld stories, and was sorely disappointed in this book. I picked it up fully anticipating another great read, and kept anticipating the story to smooth out until the last few chapters. Unfortunately, every chapter got worse and it was with a heavy heart (and heavy eyelids) that I closed this book for the last time. The characters were only mildly interesting, and the many revelations about them were rather more grating than surprising. The overall theme of the book left me rolling my eyes and sighing, something I would not have expected from Terry Pratchett. My advice: if you are looking for a good fantasy novel, go back to some older Terry Pratchett, and leave this one on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Pratchett surprise","review":"I have followed Terry Pratchett's work for years, and have enjoyed them immensely. This one was a disappointment, however.

Preaches endlessly and stridently about the perils of aggression and stereotyping. Normally this is due in a sly humorous manner with a wink and nudge encouraging you to make your own conclusions. In Monstrous Regiment it is repeatedly slammed in your face with no humor.

Rabid fans, this one will dissappoint you. Lacking humor, comic relief and focussed on oppressed characters, this one reads like Platoon with women as the leads. Even our beloved Duke fails to add much to the scenes, showing up at the end of novel, wishing he were home.Please,if you love Terry but don't feel like writing him and telling him to take a break; just don't read this book.

There are, thank God, many superb Discworld books, but if this had been the first of them I'm not sure there would have been a second."},{"rating":"1","title":"An abomination unto Nuggan","review":"You would expect in a series of over 30 novels for the quality to vary, and Terry Pratchett has produced both some gems in his Discworld series and some middling efforts. Regardless, they have all been marked by his inexhaustible humour and inventiveness. However, 'Monstrous Regiment' feels like it comes from another writer, a lump of leaden prose and tedious narration that offers practically nothing of interest or humour.The small nation of Borogravia is plagued by constant warfare and an oppressive religion. A young woman named Polly out of desperation joins the army in the guise of a man, and hilarity fails to ensue. The regiment plods towards the battle, revealing the same plot twist every chapter (which even the title of the book telegraphs for those who know the reference) and some banal reflections on the futility of war and sexual stereotyping. What it fails to reveal is anything to laugh or care about.Read any other Discworld novel before this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliantly funny yet touching","review":"Loved every minute.On the one hand, I found this book more touching, and slightly darker, then some other Discworld novels. There's bound to be some saddness involved with going into hopeless wars for stupid gods. This is not necessarily bad: I felt this was giving a true heart to the story, making the characters real & compassion-worthy (well - at least some of them, that is).On the other hand, Pratchett has always been able to introduce compassion into his novels without ruining the fun (see the witches stories in particular). This book is no different. It has the usual parade of insane characters & hilarious moments. I was reading it on the train & sometimes it was all I could do not to embarass myself by bursting out laughing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good start - lame finish","review":"This book comes in at about 400 paperback pages... which was big for a discworld novel at the time.The book starts off great, and proceeds in typical Pratchett style until about page 240... then, things go downhill quickly. The fun/fast read is over, and it becomes a struggle to even finish the book.I recommend GOING POSTAL instead, if you want a good example of a big/latter day book from the discworld series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spare Socks, Anyone","review":"There must be very little left that has not be said about the genius that is Terry Pratchett. No wonder he is England's best selling living author.This book has a slightly different slant to many of the Discworld novels but it none the worse for it.It is about a young girl, Polly Perks who has her own reasons for going to the recruiting sergeant with a pair of socks pushed down her trousers and asking to join \\"This man's army\\". Included in her section are a set of misfits including an \\"Igor\\" and a reformed vampire and why not.They all march off with their new sergeant who says he is determined to look after \\"my boys\\" and will not let any harm befall them . . .There is a nice comic twist at the end of the book, maybe you will see it coming and maybe you won't.Many people try to imitate Pratchett.

Top stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"TEN'SHUN!","review":"Pratchett's 31st (inc Maurice & Last Hero) Discworld novel still delivers although it took me a little while to get into and care about the new characters. Usually he will set up various circumstances that force cross species to work together; this time they are just dumped on the page and you have to accept it.A few guest appearances from Vimes and guards offer nothing much more than a bit of familiar territory.As per usual, though, once I was a good way into it I felt compelled to see what next and was not disappointed at any point - plenty of laughs and originality. Not his best but certainly an indication that this series has a long way to go yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of Pratchett's best.","review":"I am a very big fan of Terry Pratchett's books, most of which are sidesplittingly funny while including effective satire/commentary on society. When Pratchett is on, his books are great. Unfortunatly he seems to have emphasized theme more than humor and storyline in this book. It's still ok, but it's defintly not going to be anywhere near the top of a list of his best books. It reads similarly to his book Pyramids, so if you liked or disliked that one you'll probobly feel the same about Monstrous Regiment."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"I got my iteam by the time it was said to arive and in great condtion.

I just have to say, I am a massive Pratchett fan. I have read nearly every book in the Discworld series, and I have loved them all, always found something clever, insightful in them...until this book. Monstrous Regiment was like Pratchett Lite...all the footnotes and none of the heart. I felt as if I were reading a book by someone who was trying desprately to emulate Pratchett, but simply didn't have the skill. So much low-brow humor, predictable plot points, and nothing original. Pratchett has covered war issues, gender issues and equality, in books infinitely better than this. This is the first time a Discworld book failed to make me laugh out loud. And Vimes and Angua's little cameos did nothing to improve the situation. I truly hope that this book is not an indicator of what's to come, but if it is, at least I still have every book that came before this to fall back on."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put it down!","review":"Terry Pratchett is one of my favorite novelists. I'm trying to work through the Discworld series-- a marvelous universe full of characters that interconnect in ways you wouldn't have dreamed possible. Even so, when I opened the front cover... I didn't put this book down until I reached the back.Our protaganist is a young lady who, because of religious ordinances (which keep getting stranger), cannot inherit the family tavern. Her brother has joined the army and should he not return, the tavern is lost to her. So she hatches a daring plan to join the army and find her brother. Only on Discworld, nothing is what they appear.I won't say more, because I will risk giving away the twists. But oh! What delightful twists Mr. Pratchett gives us on this part of Discworld. Familiar characters will peek in, new characters will be introduced, and a madcap adventure await you between the covers of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Downer","review":"This book is a downer.

It has catchy characters and an okay plot.Actually, don't read this even as a light read unless you enjoy the \\"guilty pleasure\\" of reading novels with way too many adverbs. Monstrous Regiment is completely formulaic, and seems to be written by a machine and not a person. It is so shallow and badly thought out that it's nauseating.I liked Pratchett's the Wee Free Men better. That was easily funny, whereas Monstrous Regiment is trying too hard. Don't read it unless you're a diehard Terry Pratchett fan. Or a masochist, that too.SPOILER:By the end of the book, it's revealed that everyone is a woman. This annoys me no end- it's predictable and yet so stupid that you have to wonder whether Pratchett was conscious when he wrote it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shows great Fan support!!","review":"Collar and leash look great.

Luckily it's a Saturday so not many people are in the building (budget reasons?) We've got newspaper editor Stella Stevens and her suffering assistant Siri Baruc, and a few others.This low budget film has a couple of scenes that are really bad but overlall, it's your average low budget giant insect movie. The story is standard stuff, not very inspired. Not a very good movie but not all bad. It's watchable but not really as entertaining as some other movies of its types and not worth spending too much money on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watchable, slightly boring giant Ant movie","review":"Pretty good production values for a low budget film. The acting is hit and miss, again this is a low budget film so don't expect miracles.

This movie is on par with made for TV movies on SCI-FI and other networks."},{"rating":"1","title":"The real problem is...","review":"Firstly, this movie does some things well. The introductions of most of the cast were reasonably good and the general plot began to develop quickly. As for the comic relief parts, some of the one-liners in this movies are better than the one-liners I've heard in most movies.The main problem this movie has is, once the main premise, ants attacking humans in an office building, is underway... the threat level never increases. As you'd expect, the body count rises, but in this movie, that is usually the result of the victim's actions.I think the writers should have spent more time trying to decide what actually happens when ants start attacking people. Aside from that, the only problem is that a central character debuts far too close to the end of the movie.It does have its good points, but ultimately, the main elements of the plot could have been handled better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agreeing fully with the comments from the reviewer b4 me","review":"I totally agree that we can feel conned this way.

The insulator will allow the spring to rub into the metal mounts and is no where near sufficient to protect your springs or prevent metal-on-metal noise that will follow.

The disc contains a live recording from 1975 of the band performing the entire Godbluff album plus two songs from a Belgian TV appearance in 1971( theme one and a plague of lighthouse keepers).Th 1975 footage is fairly poorly shot, mostly close ups of either Peter Hammill or David Jackson and some wide shots of Guy Evans. Hugh Banton is almost nowhere to be seen. In all this is fairly typical of the period and for fans of the band is well worth owning.The two numbers from 1971 are another thing altogether. The director has tried to interpret the music ( Lighthouse keepers ) visually and has done a great job.This is a moody and magnificent recording of a great band.The last two tracks really left me wanting more.The sound quality of both gigs is great and I highly recommend this disc to fans of the band or of prog rock in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"You should rather buy The Live Broadcasts","review":"Goodbluff is a good video, but one should rather buy the other DVD available of Van der Graaf Generator, which is The Live Broadcasts.

And she sells chocolate from her website, that is from a network marketing company. I don't trust this to be unbiased information. Chocolate is loaded with fat and sugar. It's hardly health food. It does have some benefits but that doesn't make it good for you. You will gain weight if you eat it on a reular basis. There is no pricing information on her website, which is odd for a commodity like chocolate. So I'm guessing it's priced higher than the market value. I asked her for pricing and she sent me a link which was bad. I'm still waiting for price information from her. She seems to be evading me on the price. But how am I supposed to order it then?

Zip Foster organizes a desperate search to find the Benefactors before the enemy does. Without their help, Earth stands no chance against the technologically superior Xenobots. With impeccable logic, the Starman leader has determined that if the Benefactors had a central base in teh Solar System, it had to be on Europa, one of the moons of Jupiter. What the Starmen do not even suspect is that there is also a powerful enemy close to home.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming and Clever for all ages","review":"I found this book in the Library while planning a Valentine Party for fourth graders. I needed a book that was brief enough for a quick activity, but challenging enough to hold the attention of 10 year olds. The familiar rhyme can be sung or read, but the vocabulary and concepts are tricky enough to engage older elementary students & spark further conversation.Kids who are familiar with the world of Little House on the Prairie will recognize the modes of transportation and communication (horseback, railroad, smoke signals, pigeon, postal letter). In an age of instant messaging, the tenacity of the protagonist to deliver his Valentine message is charming and impressive. Kids will learn both ingenuity and perseverance from his example.

It seemed that just when a song began to coalesce, some needless key change, or irritating noodle would mess the composition up. I got sick of it.

Well, I did! Now I like the version a lot and I have put it to my favorite play list for my daily enjoyment. I've had 20+ years experience listening to Bach and I believe this version can be a valuable one for many Bach listeners.This CD also contains Violin Concerto in A minor and E major.

The simple illustrations fit quite well with the story line and are quite eye catching. Kids seem to love this one and even like it read to the over and over and over again. The story does bring home the good lesson that is is just fine to be different, as the three frog find. This is one of those books that is nice to have in your book stack for something quick to read or for a quick bed time read for the little one. Like all of Leo Lionni's work, the quality is high, the story good and the art work interesting. It would be hard to go wrong with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book!","review":"My kids love this book. They are 3 and 5 years old. This book follow the adventures of Jessica the frog who finds an alligator egg. The other frogs tell her it is a chicken egg and they call the baby alligator a chicken throughout the book (the kids get a kick out of this - and try to correct me after they heard the story again and again). Things good for kids from this book: 1) nature 2) use your imagination 3)explore the world around you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Traditional ballads that rock","review":"An energetic marriage of folk ballads and rock, the music of Tempest deftly weaves traditional melodies with modern riffs. This is the first album of theirs I have listened to, and basing my judgment on its own merits I think it's very well-crafted (although no recording could match the band's live performances). Whether a sentimental acoustic piece or a lively number infused with edgy riffs, each track has a captivating rhythm that makes for really pleasurable listening. And the medleys have seamless transitions that in themselves exhibit the professional level of Tempest's craft. Though I personally like the instrumental sections best, frontman Lief Sorbye's vocals offer an irresistible storytelling flavor to the songs. Like \\"The Journeyman,\\" his earnest intonations invite the listener to follow wherever Tempest roams."},{"rating":"1","title":"loosey-goosey religious mush, a disappointment","review":"I came across this book in my search for religious truth. It is a profound disappointment. Trying so hard to be au courant, RR elevates religious experience over divine truth. The result is religious mush, rather than transcendental meaning. Best suited perhaps for aging liberal Catholics striving to retain fragments of a lost or dying faith. Not for earnest seekers under fifty."},{"rating":"1","title":"'The Holy Longing'","review":"As I found this book to be quite liberal and \\"cafeterial Catholic\\" in presentation, I stopped reading it after page 94!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Classic","review":"I found this book to be very special and one that can be read over and kept.

It is written in a straightforward comprehensive language and yet does not attempt to dismantle the basic tenets of Christian belief. Those who want a deeper understanding of the essential ideas which religion couches in antiquated and dogmatic terms will find in this book a blessing. Rolheiser, like any good writer, puts into simple and precise terms the anxiety and anguish that those who stand in the razor thin neutral zone between the religious and secular worlds feel. He is also refreshingly non-judgemental, reflexive and intelligent in his approach. This book is a wonder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cocktail Music, or Meditation Music, Classical with swing","review":"The most outstanding music I've heard in years.

While this reviewer has greatly enjoyed all of her other releases, this recording is by far one of the best made by any artist in the past thirty years. Ms. Carter (one of the best musicians in any genre playing in the world right now) and her ensemble evoke such profound emotion on all of the tracks, but two particularly stand out: Ravel's \\"Pavane pour une infante defunte\\" and Morricone's \\"Cinema Paradiso\\" theme. These works defy musical category; they are simply statements of pure artistic brilliance on the part of Ms. Carter and her colleagues, and listening to them will leave a lump in your throat. An absolutely extraordinary emotional statement."},{"rating":"2","title":"The tragedy is that you haven't bought it yet!","review":"My top five albums are U2's \\"Achtung Baby,\\" Peter Gabriel's \\"Us,\\" Interpol's \\"Turn on the Bright Lights,\\" And You Will Know Us By The Trail of Dead's \\"Source Tag's and Codes,\\" and this album. I once listened to it fout times back to back on a three hour drive, and no I don't do drugs thank you very much. What perlexes me is how all these reviews say these guys are great in concert. I saw them live, and came away thinking they had the world's greatest producer recording their albums. A lot of work went into perfecting the sounds, finding the right levels, and timing the sychopation shifts that make this album so incredible. Perhaps I'm a philistine. Perhaps I spelled that wrong. But I love this album. It's had to believe how young these guys were when they recorded something so proefessional. I have yet to hear anything else like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heard by mistake, never again","review":"I was in Austin for an Impossible's concert when I heard this band. They were an opening act, and I must say, I can't see what the big deal is. Their keyboard player is terrible, their lead singer is whiney, and they put on the worst show I ever saw in my life. Their songs are all uninspiring and forgettable, but it was the keyboard playing that left the worst taste in my mouth."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best CD since the Getup Kids","review":"These guys are totally amazing.

The 3 layers of vocals are just incredible and I really like the contribution from the keyboard. I am a huge emo/indie fan and I have to say this is one of the best cd's I have heard in quite a while.

Too bad Josh and Justin couldn't keep the musical relationship going, because I think these two guys needed each other as a balance. 'All Things Ordinary\\" I think best captures the pace and the style of this album, although most folks I talk to remember the outstanding 'D in Detroit'. What's unique to this album is the sound of Adrianne's keyboards - its what ties it all together. And, of course, there are those great harmonies.

This is the first Orchestra that I have heard that has played the appoggiaturas in the second movement of the first concerto in D minor as written in the autographed score of Bach. The added ornamenation that is done by Robert Hill is very tasteful and makes this concerto extremely exciting. I would love to have Harpsichord lessons from him. I point out Robert Hill but all of the soloists are gifted performers. The Orchestra takes some chances with the tempos and play some movements quite quickly. I prefer them this way. They feel and sound better. Their (the Orchestra) playing is wonderfully soothing in the slow movements and dance-like and electrifying in the faster tempos. I cannot wait to listen to the others. Bravo!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing find","review":"I have been looking for a harpsichord version of BWV 1056 for quite a while before I came across this modest, budget release.

It's smooth, sexy and has lots of atmosphere. I love that song so much that I went ahead and shelled out the money to buy the whole album. I got a deal buying it used from a third party vendor.I popped it in and was very disappointed. Other than the before mentioned song and one other (Frost - Amygdala (Mind Over Midi's Emotional Memories Mix)) it is a yawn-inspiring collection. Ok, 'Echo - I've Got You Under My Skin (Karsh Kale Remix)' and 'Aim feat. Kate Rogers - Sail (Rae & Christian Remix)' were sorta ok too, but that still leaves 16 songs in this collection that are featureless, watered down bores that simply drone on and on.I'm hoping that my husband might like it so I don't feel like I wasted my money. He likes Moby and there are some tracks reminiscent of his work. I don't like Moby very much at all. I thought I liked chill out.

Soon Ed is immersed in bodies and a determination to unravel the secrets which started many years ago.Definitely noir with lots of brutality and a few too many threads, but a very good debut nonetheless. I appreciated that Hughes tied up all the threads in a very satisfying way. Ed is an interesting character who was fleshed out quite well. The story was well paced but what stuck me most was the underlying that sometimes family is more than blood.

I have a 5ft chain attached to the anchor so the rope won't get cut on anything. I used to have a mushroom and and a grappling anchor but this one beats them both. Its a bit pricey but I think its worth the investment if you are a serious fishermen or a boat owner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the price","review":"I use this on my 26 foot pontoon boat (14 pounder). I tried the clam shell anchors with double the weight of this thing with poor results.It works by turning on its side and digging in. When it's time to pull anchor, the sliding ring slides down to the base thus freeing the prongs that have dug into to underwater surface.Just remember you need about a 5 to 1 ratio on this anchor. For every foot of depth, you need to let out 5 feet of rope. So 10 feet of water would be about 50 foot of rope. Why? So that the rope is pulling the anchor more parallel to the bottom than perpendicular. Too little rope means the prongs won't have a chance to dig into the muddy bottom."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bittersweet Masterpiece of the Sentiment of Love and War","review":"This play will take your breath away. It did mine. Obviously written by a brilliant historian and gifted playwright, this piece by Terry Kroenung's is not to be overlooked. It encompasses the brutal reality of war, lost loves, resentment, patriotism, and eternal light. This incredible piece affords any director and the actor and actress a welcome challenge including: allusions to Shakespeare's works, dramatic gender bending (for the role of \\"Julia\\"), songs of war, post traumatic war shock, pain of a debilitating wound, and much more.If you are a history buff, a serious actor or actress, a director, you will indeed appreciate this gritty, witty, and uniquely sentimental play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Music from San Francisco Indie Ing","review":"Ing are one of those indie bands that you continually seek-out because you know you're never going to be disappointed with the results. \\"Liberty\\" is the second CD I've acquired, their first being the slightly more modest (but equally entertaining) \\"First Version of the Wheel.\\" This is likely due to the fact that the band has doubled its members and is now a quartet. \\"Liberty\\" starts out in trademark Ing-stylee with \\"Confusion\\"- a track that, if you only read the lyrics, would appear to be woeful and lethargic. In fact, the opposite is true- the track pours with sunlight and chipper ambivalence. Very SoCal. Other standout tracks include \\"Inside Out\\", \\"Drop\\" and \\"Good Friday\\". My one complaint is that the songs go by very quickly, and the album is a tad short. Still, if you like bands with strong lyrics, good tunes and that still have their souls, Ing is a good place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hobbs Jersey","review":"This jersey is fantastic.

It sounds nothing like Karma, Poem or Chimera. It is more of a mix of enigma, ambient music and Enya. There are plenty of sampled choirs and the sounds are not aimed to be as dance friendly. This album can be listened to whilst studying, meditating or used as background noise for dinners or coctail parties. Spiritual Archives resecembles old Kraftwerk albums in the sense that it has an ongoing theme throughout the album and that not one track stands out but every track works for the better of the whole album. The cover art is wonderfull and the inside litographs are nothing short of stupendous."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Delerium CD","review":"Spiritual Archives - is a collection of Bill Leeb & Rhys Fulber's great drive and imagination.

Pixter in 2004 for my daughters, it didn't have the updated video features but you could play games on it pretty good. After a few months, it went dead, everytime you turned it on and use the pen the screen would freeze. So I figured ok, this thing has just gone bad.In 2005 I purchased the new and improved Pixter (in pink) for my girls, with the new video feature, and hoped maybe just maybe this one would stick around for a while. Needless to say within two months, the game was blinking on and off and not playing at all. I wrote to Mattel and let them know of their faulty product and they told me to send it to them, I did and they sent it right back, still a broken mess. I'd never buy another Pixter again.Leapfrog has a much better handheld video game Leapster and their games are far more educational and practical than Pixter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it, but watch out for accessories!","review":"My twin 7-y-olds LOVE their Pixters. They spend hours on them. Better in the car than even DVD players, and far more interactive. The only thing I don't like is that all of the accessories I have tried to buy ONLY work on the older Pixter models (called Color Pixter, I believe). The travel case is too small and the digital camera doesn't work either. Now, the camera did say \\"requires color pixter systems to work.\\" I took that to mean they had to have color and not b/w, not that it had to be an older system. The travel case didn't say anything but \\"pixter\\" on it. So, while I've had to return a few accessories, the kids LOVE the toys. So, would still recommend. Just buy accessories with caution!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pixter","review":"This is a great toy! Can find great educational games to use with it too.

The lesson? Just because you are a multi-instrumentalist and can cover different styles, does not necessarily mean you can write a good song.

I was positively hooked. This great thing about this new album is that while the songs can sound silly you realize that the artist doesn't take himself to seriously and that he having FUN with his music. Fuzzy is one of my favorite tracks, and if you catch a show you crack up because he plays retro slasher movies in the background of this sticky sweet song. His music is clever, uplifting and groovy.

If you had 3 ships and sailed them from England to Germany, how many would you reasonably expect to make this short voyage? How many if you controlled all the coastal regions in northern europe?

I have been kicked back to my desktop, so many times it aint funny. I have problems running a game with sound. SECOND--The game is limited. Three land units and three naval units??? Yup. Sure there are upgrades, but you can only make the SAME number of units. Hmm... THIRD and THE MOST IMPORTANT--In my opinion this game just is not FUN. It may be realistic, but afterall it is a GAME. It needs to have some aspects of fun. The battles are lacklustre, the play action is repetive.If you are a student of history, you MIGHT like this game. If you are not, chances are you wont like it...."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, but not great!","review":"I have to vote with the folks who recommend not buying. Terrible manual, clunky-awkward interface, awful tutorial, exceedingly steep learning curve - to name a few problems. It could have been a great game, but it's not.

The workouts are tough and do give results--hey that's what it's all about, right? It's a Bootcamp alright!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A consistently challenging workout","review":"I really like Angie Miller's Kettlebell Bootcamp. It offers a perfect stand alone workout that offers a great mix of cardio and strength training. I do agree with other reviewers that it is pretty leg intensive and you might want to avoid this if you have any knee issues. For the most part, the leg work involves straight forward moves, bending, lunging, and stepping sideways. I do modify the curtsy moves in the first set as it is pretty awkward to do and I was afraid I could twist my ankle. Rather than curtsies in set 1, I just do standard lunges which works fine and is easier on my ankles. You will adjust to the workout and the weight and once that happens you will want to up your weight. I now am doing 25 lbs for everything except the upper body work in sets 5 and 6. I plan to move to 30 lbs.

This workout will get your heart pumping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Total body workout","review":"Good intro to explaining the moves used in the workout Just a few new moves, if you've already been exposed to the kettle bell. The workout starts right off working your quads!! There are 8 segments, majority on quads/legs. Incorporated throughout the workout are upper body and abs. I felt the last workout segment for the abs could have been a bit longer and more intense. Overall a good bootcamp total body workout. I rented first and plan on purchasing now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kettlebell workout?","review":"wasn't sure exactly what kind of workout this was trying to be.

I expected an intense KETTLEBELL workout. This was more like an aerobics class and BTW hold this kettlebell while you're at it. Do not waste your money on this DVD. I was able to put together my own workout using information I found on youtube/online about kettlebell exercises...and my routine is much more enjoyable and energized than this robotic nonsense. I have to give credit to Angie though - she is very fit. But I doubt she got that way doing THIS particular workout.

However, I think Ball totally missed the mark in terms of function, because you cannot stack these jars on top of each other!! They simply slide off to the side.

They are perfect for this so when I purchased additional varieties of tea I looked for more jars but the grocery store did not have theme jars in stock. I was happy to find them on Amazon and ordered three 4-jar sets as they are also great for storing my dried herbs and small sewing notions. Between the time I placed the order and it arrived I saw that the jars were back on the grocery store shelf. I was dismayed to see that I could have purchased three sets from the grocery store for what I paid for one set from Amazon. I'm so accustomed to Amazon's usually great pricing that I didn't think to check on the pricing for a set of these jars... a mistake I'll not make again! I've been an Amazon customer since the early days and this is the first time I've seen such a huge pricing discrepancy between Amazon prices and pricing by other retailers. Really disappointing!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nicely made with a serious flaw","review":"What at first appeared to be a nicely built tool had a crude design on the cutting wheel mount. It was simply a screw threaded full length and undersized to the cutting wheel center hole. I used it once and the cutting wheel and screw threads were already damaged where the wheel tries to turn on the threads of the screw. They obviously know how to do it right because the two guide wheels were nicely mounted. So I don't know why they didn't give the cutting wheel a nice mounting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simplistic, yet informative","review":"Rice's book is written with the layperson in mind, not the scholar. And this isn't a bad thing, since most apologetic material today seems to be directed towards scholars, and is simply over the head of the average person. His section on hyper-Calvinism isn't as meaty as I would like it to be, but again, Rice isn't writing to the scholar (for a more scholarly treatment of the issue, read \\"The Other Side of Calvinism\\" by Laurence Vance, or \\"Chosen But Free\\" by Norman Geisler). The books contains quite a lengthy section on Roman Catholicism (including a rather humorous letter to Dr. Rice from a Catholic priest), and the sections on the various cults are worth reading. The section on baptismal regeneration was the most helpful for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product review","review":"Well it is sad to say i have not received this book that o bught on Amazon.

Ummm...what the HELL is going on? What did I just read? I don't know what Frank Miller or DC was thinking ($$$) but I could barely follow the \\"plot\\" of this story. Add to that the nearly incomprehensible artwork (there is also NO sense of space, all the characters might as well be flying in the air the whole time)and the random appearance of DC superheroes (oh look, it's Hawk & Dove...how cute) and you get one of the worst comics I have ever read.

Its not well written and the huge splash pages seem like an excuse to extend a story that could have easily been told in one issue to three so that the DC could maximize profits. Sure, the art is pretty good; a little overly CGed for my taste, but that could just be me. Its that it doesn't have the grime and grit of the original series that really drew the reader in to this recreated world of a defeated Dark Knight detective. The whole story seems contrived: Bats beats up on Supes.... again. Seemingly to show that, yep, Batman is still ... bad ... and Big Blue is still a dumb wimp.No new territory is gone over in terms of characterization, which is what made the original so fascinating. In the original DKR, Miller truly broke Batman's character into his component parts, studied them, and showed the readers how Bruce would react in this futuristic distopia.Don't bother with this one kiddies, its not worth the [money]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Godfather 3 was way less disappointing.","review":"Did you love \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\"?If so, stay away from this celebration of idiocy.The best thing about this series is that it's over."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE DARK KNIGHT FALLS (FLAT ON HIS FACE)...","review":"Having finished the third installment of Miller's latest epic,I have to agree with the consensus of others who read it...it was a lot of hope that turned into hype. To his credit, Miller didn't go the safe route with Batman and decided to take some chances. The problem was that in the original \\"Dark Knight Returns\\", Batman was true to his roots, which hooked readers for 60 years plus. In DK2, he comes off at times as a bad borscht belt comedian, especially with his dealings with Dick Grayson in volume three. And what does he have against the original Robin and Superman (he gets the super snot beated out of him yet again)? It made me appreciate Klaus Janson's inking of the original series (background detail is all but eliminated in DK2), and the presence of Denny O'Neil's editing is sorely missed. DK2 is proof that sometimes you can't catch lightning in a bottle..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I am sad to say that this book was disappointing, even though a friend had already warned me it did not measure up to the original. The art and story are... sloppy. It's almost as if someone were hired to create this comic in the style of Frank Miller - it's such a pale imitation that it is hard to believe it's really him behind the scenes. The splash-pages in the original were breathtaking; here, they're laughable.And doesn't Miller know that Naked News already exists? Hardly a futuristic concept.My recommendation: get yourself a copy of the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miller Strikes Again!","review":"This is Frank Miller's followup to his highly influential Dark Knight Returns. It has generated controversy in the comics community with its stylistic departures from Miller's earlier series, but let me tell you: This stuff is fantastic! Fans have complained about his more cartoony style (you get used to it) and the garish coloring by Lynn Varley (it isn't great, but almost works in context) but the story more than makes up for any visual idiosyncracies. You can read the editorial reviews for story content, but let me just say that this opening chapter is a good start for a potentially dynamite series. Not as grand of a scale as DKR, but it seems like it's going in the right direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"Boy is this one bad. Horrendous art---often done by the colorist is matched by a script which is both dated and poorly executed. There are literally dozens of comics released every week which are far superior.

I liked the idea of seeing aged super heroes fighting in a world that refused their existence. Frank Miller had an important job on his hands when he wanted to write a sequel. I am afraid that \\"Dark Knight Strikes Again\\" does not live up to expectations. It falls far behind the first one. The story and the telling is a replication, introducing new super heroes to keep the attention. I fear that whatever happens in the end will not surprise me. Buy it if you want to complete DK series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, but missing Klaus Janson","review":"Miller clearly has thought out an excellent storyline that won't disappoint readers with the return of the seminal Dark Knight series. As with the first series, Miller wastes no time building tension and energy into the storyline, waeving multiple threads into a fast-paced plot.The art on the other hand I find lacking compared to the first series, which featured in my opinion some of the most striking, seminal artwork to appear in comics at the time it was published. This time the work looks slightly unfinished and hurried, with a few panels that Miller and Varley should have simply redone. Clearly the influence of Klaus Janson would have helped develop the art further, as a quick comparison to the first series would illustrate.All in all, this is definitely worth owning and it is likely that many comic collectors will find it impossible not to buy this entire series, regardless of the reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"I had originally read the Dark Knight Returns when in college where it was assigned text for an english class I was taking. That was the best comic book ever. When I head that a sequel was being made I couldn't see how Miller could possibly produce a well written, successful sequel. Miller not only wrote a successful sequel, it nearly surpasses the original. The Dark Knight Strikes again is superb (thus far) for seizing the DC comic universe and using it to its full extent. From Captain Marvel to the villans of the story (I won't spoil this for those of you who don't know) he uses the panaoply of characters and their history. Comics are made to be incredible stories of incredible people doing incredible things and this is what Miller has done. In his first tale he vaguely refers to the fact that there were no more superheroes. In DK2 he shows us what happened to them and why. He does so in such a way that one wants closure to this series immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"Says an editor inside DC, \\" Paul Levitz got leaned on by Warner Bros. to just put out the last issue of this mess because Frank had to work on Batman screenplays.

Eh...","review":"To be honest, this almost ruins \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\". I always liked the conflict between Batman and Superman. Who's right? Batman, for freeing people or Superman, for simply saving lives. Both thought they were in the right, which is why their battle at the end of DKR was so monumental. Now, however, Superman is working for Lex Luthor, and is, clearly, on the side of the \\"bad guys\\". Frankie, frankie frankie, why did you do this? I personally loved the Wayne-Kent moral struggle, and now you turned it into a battle of the super-villains. This book is worth buying for the art and the well done super-hero introductions. However, the plot is VERY lacking."},{"rating":"1","title":"COMPLETE SWILL!","review":"Like any comics fan of the past 20 years or so, Miller's Dark Knight Returns is a treasured favorite of mine. It's one of the books on any comics fan's list of \\"Books I'd have on a deserted island\\". With all the hype and excitement of DK2, I really thought Miller would have done more. He had the time to come up with something great. Instead we get three books of crude artwork (even for Miller) and nearly meaningless plot with little motivation for the characters to be doing what they're doing. Complete garbage and swill--and to date I love most of Miller's work. That ends today. If it isn't Sin City, I will not buy another Miller book. If he doesn't care, then neither do I. Save your money--please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"15 years for this?","review":"The whole story is only in three parts. Each chapter is a fraction of the size of the first mini-series. Yet, with all of those constraints, Frank \\"I forgot how to draw\\" Miller wastes pages on single pictures spanning 2 pages apiece. If it's the bat-plane-something hovering or Superman impregnating Wonder Woman, it's given it's own spread.The story is too slender for his epic style, the drawing too crude and the guest cast too generous. This is a BATMAN book, not The Atom or Plastic Man. Yet these guys get more of the story than Bats.I don't see the point to this except a sell out to get fanboys to spend their hard-earned moolah on this crapola. Yeah, I also am a sucker who bought it in the hopes it would be a worthy follow-up to a classic original.

Garish colors, clunky art (with dayglo two-page spreads), and a plot that defies all logic. It seems that Miller's goal was to squeeze in as many DC superheroes as possible, but if you haven't followed all of their rampaging plotlines for the past decade or so, you'll be constantly wondering who's who and who's doing what to what. I expect Kitchen Sink Man to show up any minute.

The book takes clear direction after a slightly slow beginning, but was so enthralling that I finished it in a week. It was great! Even if you read it and don't like it, you will pick up some interesting little tidbits of information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly","review":"This book was downright silly. I read it back when I was in college and I, as many of the other reviewers here felt like I was reading some extended story from an 8th grader. (actually, I think the stuff written by my classmates back in the 8th grade was more interesting).Just silly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughable","review":"Laughably badly written, plotted & researched. Cereal boxes have better character construction, spiritual insights and dialog. Makes you feel embarrassed for the writer and anybody who takes this 'book' (using the term loosely) seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deadly stuff","review":"This book is dull and so badly written I am astonished it found its way to print and commercial sale. Fortunately the first insight explains the value of coincidence because everything that follows is appallingly contrived. The author might have done better to write a brief article about his new age philosophy because he is not capable of clothing it in fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoot me in the head!","review":"This book is the worst I've ever read, and I absolutely hateit. I tried to struggle through it, thinking it would get better, onlyto find that it got worse. I stopped about halfway through, and would be more than happy to use it to start a fire!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like this book, I really did","review":"O.K. the writing style wasn't up to much, but then neither was Tolkien's. That's forgivable. Don't get me wrong, I'm no dyed in the wool sceptic. Far from it. I loathed this book, because much better and more profound ideas were being regurgitated at me. The author wasn't bringing these ideas to a wider audience, but just removing anything that didn't fit his readers pre-conceptions. If you liked this, go and read Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance. You might not like it, but it will challenge your preconceptions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reading between the lines.","review":"The extremeties of scoring on TCP surprised me, although in retrospect I am selective as to which friends I recommend the book to on account of their openmindedness and awareness. On reading this book and following the insights life becomes more enjoyable, enlightened and uplifting, and TCP is a personal journey which leads you quickly and positively into the future. It's nice to see TCP having such an impact globally. Nobody's perfect and the message is more important than the writing style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enlightenment pulp fiction","review":"It's hard for me to categorize this book as a novel or as a \\"statement of belief\\". Let's say it tries to be much more than it is. The plot is rather ludicrous and the writing is pretty shabby, but the ideas are interesting and some are even compelling. Fortunately it isn't too long so if you decide to read it and end up hating it at least you haven't wasted too much of your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"OH I DON'T WANNA WORK,I JUS'WANNA BANG ON DE DRUM ALL DAY\\"","review":"...to quote the Great Todd Rundgren. I don't know, who are the stupid ones and who the intelligent ones? Poor slobs who work hard at their jobs and try to find moments of joy and peace in between the absurdity of life and, at least try, to live a life of poverty-stricken integrity? Or the slobs happily sipping champagne on the tennis courts, chuckling over the muddle-minded who buy their New-Age gobbledygook? Almost makes you want to become one of these Prophets/Profits, doesn't it? Naw; to quote another Great Teacher, Jackson Brown, I guess I'll just stay a happy idiot struggling for the legal tender. Just please don't make the mistake of wasting your hard won legal tender on this bottom of the bird cage filler."},{"rating":"1","title":"the one nugget","review":"Why write a book about spirituality in the form of a poorly-written third-rate Latin American adventure novel? Who knows? I'm guessing that the author thought that the readers are too dumb to read a book written like a book on spiritual awakening. And maybe he didn't have the writing skills to make his point convincingly otherwise.After a few pages I was so insulted by the author's tone that I skimmed the rest, looking for nuggets of insight. I found one: some people get their energy by draining it from others, but giving your own energy willingly doesn't deplete it. That's all you need to know, stripped of all the new age hooey and fake adventure story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Read for the \\"CRITICAL MASSES\\"","review":"This book was highly recommended to me by a good friend and successful businessman. It has a decent storyline- but that is not the heart of the book. The nine insights of this book are REAL and, if not taken too seriously, do not interfere with religious beliefs. It was a coincidence that I read this book at this stage of my life and it only helped me see things clearer. If you want to stop preoccupying your life with materialistic crap...take the journey....read this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I ever read.","review":"This horror was chosen by my book group & like a good trooper, I struggled through it - but I was either laughing at the poor writing & story, or fighting my desire to heave it as far as I could.

I couldn't put The Celestine Prophecy down only because I wanted my misery to end as quickly as possible. This may very well be the worst book I've ever read. The author's style of writing is akin to that of a fourth grader. If lack of detail, timeline, character development, believablity, and, most importantly, lack of a storyline is what turns you on, you'll love this book. I expect a little more from the stuff that I read.I just finished the book about 10 minutes ago and, I kid you not, I did the \\"happy dance\\" because my agony had finally come to an end. Then I had this overwhelming urge to write this review to warn anyone with an ounce of bookworm in them to stay away from this book. HORRID!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An Unworthy Read - don't waste your time or money!","review":"What an absolute waste of my time. Not only is the writing style tremendously underdeveloped, but the characters are simple and simple minded. I decided to give the book a chance and plodded along to the end hoping to find that \\"Aha!\\" moment. Not possible. Moreover, there was not one insight which I found inspirational, and my world did not expand upon completion of the book.I can't believe that Redfield actually left an open ended conclusion so he could leave room for a sequel of the same superficial sort. It was a challenge to finish the book, but I did -- if it was only so I could write a credible review. The book is not a spiritual adventure, but rather a treatise on how to live combining elements of Buddhism, Kubbutzism and Communism. If you want to read a really meaningful and life changing book I recommend Andy Andrews The Travelers Gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun adventure Book","review":"The Celestine Prophecy by James Redfield is about a guy who quits his mundane existence for a life of adventure. He begins searching for an ancient Peruvian manuscript which contains nine Insights that allegedly predict the modern emergence of New Age spirituality. He encounters opposition from the Peruvian government; the Peruvian church the Peruvian soldiers the Peruvian priests and practically anything else that's Peruvian. Eventually he obtains all nine Insights. There's a tenth Insight but that's another story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"This book suffers from delusions of philosophical thought. You'll suffer from the mediocre writing and wonder why the author didn't simply write a term paper. I wish I could rate it below one star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will rock your world","review":"This book most definitely rocked my worldafter reading it things really changed inmy life. Actually, things began to happenbefore I was even finished reading thisearth shaking book. I believe that itwill change you, your world and yourworld view. It is a powerful book to haveand own and most definitely it is worthhaving in one's own personal library.I highly and strongly recommend thisbook to anyone and everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best for Hippies & followers of Environmentalism as a religion.","review":"The story is basically about seeing & understanding the \\"aura\\" that is supposedly around everyone \\"best seen by looking a people while consciously soft focusing your eyes\\". Yikes!Has plenty of \\"Can't we all just get along\\" type of hippie dippy touchy-feely philosophy with lots of environmental whacko (say Rain Forest when you mean jungle, Wet Lands when you mean swamp) sophistry thrown-in.I was able to finish the 3 CDs only by the application of tremendous willpower.Not recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!!!!","review":"This is the most inspiring, amazing book that I have ever read.

Then his address and that scam in the back of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"It wouldn't be so hard to take if it were better written","review":"The plot doesn't necessarily need to be plausible in a book about spiritual mystery. It amazes me every time that people who can't write can get published. I think that the books popularity speaks volumes to how spiritually starved we are as a culture. There has to be a better way to present this message."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor meal for the spiritually hungry.","review":"This book is filled with New Age feel-good pseudoscientific psychobabble that has all the merit and validity of the Psychic Friends Network."},{"rating":"1","title":"unbelievably corny writing","review":"I picked up the book IMMEDIATELY after a strong recommendation whereby I thought that the book is based off of a REAL, ancient lost manuscript. Little did I know that it was cheesy fiction. The first insights are interesting and make sense. The more you read the book however, the more you feel someone is trying to guile you and make you think you are finding all the answers while you keep pushing yourself to think the book may get better-NOT."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Celestine Fallacy: A Misadventure","review":"The star rating for this book should read ZERO, but there was no zero option for me to choose! For those already spiritually 'sussed' it offers nothing new. For those who are mildly interested and are just stepping into the world of new ideas and thinking in terms of 'the meaning of life' then this book will probably put you off. There are great books out there that are completely justified in describing themselves as 'life-changing' or 'life-affirming'. Unfortunately, this is most definitely not one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Celestine Prophecy","review":"THIS BOOK WAS EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED AT THIS POINT IN MY LIFE. I ALWAYS KNEW THERE WAS SOMETHING DIFFRENT ABOUT ME. AND THIS BOOK HELPED ME TO SEE WHAT IT WAS. YES SOME MIGHT SAY IT ISN'T THE BEST WRITTEN BOOK, BUT I BEG TO DIFFER. I THINK MR. REDFIELD DID A GOOD JOB IN MAKING SURE THAT EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS THE HARD TO UNDERSTAND WAYS OF SPIRITUALITY. I DEFINATELY RECCOMEND THIS BOOK. WHO KNOWS, MAYBE THIS BOOK COULD DO FOR YOU WHAT IT DID FOR ME: CHANGE YOUR LIFE?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written, painful to get through","review":"This book was recommended to me by a friend - and was a great disappointment. It is written in a dreadfully childish manner which makes getting through each page to understand the prophecies a real bind. Don't buy it unless you are desperately in need of some spiritual uplifting (because by the time you have got through it, you certainly will!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Idealistic to say the least...","review":"This book has an interesting idea and is an easy read, but the true spiritual revelation of it was lost on me. There's nothing wrong with a book that promotes being nice to everyone, but it's a 'feel good' book that doesn't have any truth backing it. It would be great if we could all just drink up the energy like Coca-Cola, but we can't. That fact leaves this book as a fantasy novel with an oversimplistic literary style. If you want to really open your horizons by reading a novel, try reading Daniel Quinn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Between the Lines","review":"After hearing all the great reviews I was enthusiastic to get started reading this book. I was a bit disappointed, however, I could see some enlightening views on religion and spirituality. We're all in search of explanations.

It was certainly not life changing to me. It was boring and I had to force myself to continue in the hope that there would be a thrilling climax; this was more of an anticlimax! I certainly will not be reading any of the associated books. It was definitely a waste of money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Knowing is Understanding","review":"I read this book in record time. In defense of this author's style i would say, that in order to convey the central message it was necessary to cut to the chase and delete the more detailed aspects that generally go into a book of fiction. The message was the purpose of the book and it came through loud and clear for those of us who have glimpsed a little of what the author was writing about. I believe that he was attempting to \\"make it real\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Great, but Not Bad Either.","review":"I saw the poor reviews, but I thought the book was okay, mildly entertaining: certainly not deserving the initial attention it got several years ago. Two books that were far more interesting with similiar new age themes were: The Alchemist, by Paulo Coelho; and LUMINOUS by Peter Quest. Both had better prose and the characters in LUMINOUS seemed very real, plus great action scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is there a MINUS 5 star rating?","review":"So glad I never spent real money on this waste of time. Kept waiting for something profound to happen. Redfield should invest in a thesaurus to at least make the writing palatable. The plot was ludicrous, the \\"philosophy\\" puerile. Save us from these \\"best sellers\\". The publisher should also be ashamed of foisting this crap on the reading public."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Junk","review":"For years I'd resisted this book and finally gave in when somebody loaned it to me. My fears were completely justified. The Celestine Prophesy has somehow been passed as a self-help revelation of sorts but it's really just cutesy trash. It features hack plot driven by poor writing and characters more two dimensional than the screen you're staring at. The \\"insights\\" are as laughably stupid as they are impossible to achieve by simply reading the book. If you like trash, spend your money more wisely and buy Jacqueline Susann's Valley of the Dolls. That at least has a plot and some real insight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!This book is a real mind-opener!","review":"This book has been not just an eye-opener but mind-opener.

This is a journey not to be missed, no, not at all. Also read all his follow up books and meditations, and workbooks as well.

I reread the book again. I found it a commercial inspired book not spiritual inspired. Apparently the author hadn't experienced the presence of God. He falsely believed the \\"energy\\" could only be harvested from over 500 year old trees. He forgot that Jesus lived near a desert. There are \\"energy\\" everywhere when we look at at sky, look down at the earth, or look around.

Granted the \\"insights\\" have some interest I suppose. Although you (Redfield) could have wrote the insights down on ONE PIECE OF PAPER and stood on the corner handing them out. Wouldn't make any money would you, Redfield. If your \\"insights\\" are so damn important why didn't you write them down in some fancy brochure and mail them out?

The book is poorly written with a plotline so bizarre that it is a stretch of the imagination to believe that the Peruvian government, not to mention the catholic church, would use all their collective energies to suppress and ultimately destroy these sophomoric \\"insights,\\" which in the final analysis would not so much as bend a spoon.

I generally put aside all critical reasoning when I read this type of philosophical fantasy and let my subconcious mind ruminate on the plot. The final result? The story and plot are trivial. The insights rather simplistic and forgetful,for the most part.

I think we have enough \\"New Age\\" ideas tokeep us entertained until the rapture. This book is mildly fascinating as a work of fiction, and truly damaging when seen as truth. Judging from the numbers of books sold and the comments of most of those who have read it, the majority view it as non-fiction.

It is quite simply the most amazing and insightful book I've ever read. Recently, I started meditating and this book is spot on in terms of the co-incidences of life, the way our emotions and being are reflected in those people around us and the explanation of the differing emotional styles (due to childhood) are a revelation in themselves. The author is also spot on in terms of when the main character stops himself to read his own thoughts, little daydreams he is having and how they might actually relate to the world around him. Read it a few times. Theres no wasted words here and I find the charm is also in the simplistic story - all the best fables and legends are simple. It is these seemingly simple things that take a lifetime to learn. This book will take you very close to the pathway. It truly amazed me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could give it a rating of negative infinity","review":"At the risk of repeating what has already been said by the more discerning readers, this book is simply dreadful. It's a shame so many trees had to be wasted on its printing. The \\"plot\\" and the miserably deficient philosophy contained therein are nothing but a thinly disguised excuse for making as much money as possible at the expense of a gullible public searching for answers that don't require effort or concentration.Furthermore, the author's self-centered, New-Age, western bias rears its ugly head on practically every page. Why, in a Spanish-speaking country, does everyone speak English? And why does the author feel compelled to reconcile his \\"philosophy\\" with Christianity?This book was recommended to me by a former boyfriend, who said that it had changed his life and subscribed religiously to the \\"philosophy\\" contained therein.

But this book is so poorly written as to take your breath away. How could anyone finish the entire book?? It gets one star because there is no option to give zero stars -- it's that poorly written. It makes \\"The Christmas Box\\" look like Tolstoy.If you'd like to find keys to spiritual enlightenment, read \\"A Return to Love\\" by Marianne Williamson instead. It is fabulous!

Full of wonder, if you can open yourself to it, wonder that will come back to long after you have put the book down.

The announcement on the book jacket that the celestine prophecy is \\"a book that comes around once in a lifetime to change lives forever\\" was enough to arouse some pretty hard core negative intuitions in me. I should have listened to my aura and put it back on the shelf. Redfield's writing skills are pathetic. The characters are boring, shallow, predictable. The dialogue is contrived and unnatural. Sure, a handful of the ideas behind his \\"writing\\" aren't half bad, but none of it is anything that your average, half competent adult hasn't figured out on his/her own. He makes an astounding number of oversimplifications and gross generalizations. It's also obvious that Redfield needs to do some major brushing up on his biology"},{"rating":"2","title":"Philosophy within a story","review":"Whether or not you \\"buy-in\\" to the theories Redfield proposes should not stop you from enjoying this book.

The plot is hilariously bad. An American hops on a plane to Peru with no clear idea of why, and then gets swept up in a race for an ancient manuscript. The author tells us the manuscript is a secret, but then he puts its contents in the hands and voices of virtually every character in the book. He expects us to believe the Peruvian government is scared of the manuscript's contents, and that we are supposed to be scared of the Peruvian military. I am more scared about how this book wound up on the New York Times bestseller list (I found a free used copy and survived its contents during an airplane flight). Even if you're desperate to consume fluffy pseudo-spiritual tripe by the light of an incense burner, be forewarned that this book's philosophical weight is light as a kite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look elsewhere for good fiction and/or philosophy","review":"The Celestine Prophesy either tried to be a philosophical explanation of life's events presented by the use of fiction, or a fictional story about a man's search for meaning. No matter the intent, Redfield succeeds at neither as the philosophy lacks depth and the storyline is without any gusto.If this book has any merit it is a result of establishing at least enough curiosity in what was to come next to finish the book.

I struggled through it. The fiction aspect was poorly written. The philosophical aspect seemed to come from Eric Berne's work.

Once again, the Roman Catholic Church was the 'bad guy'. That also gets tiresome. So many people found this book to be helpful in their outlook on life so for that, I gave it 2 stars.

The main character didn't seem to have a coince-a-meter in his pocket so as to measure the relative proportion of coincidences over time.

Please be warned that the abridged audio is insultingly simplistic. The reader does well with the voices, but over-enunciates, and completely misses any emotion with a sing-song delivery (same tone to say \\"United States of America\\" as \\"I was so frightened\\")?

The nine insights are undeniable Truths that we can employ in our everyday life to help us to be more loving and effective beings. Although the ending is perhaps a little over-imaginative, the principles taught within this tale are invaluable to our spiritual evolution. You know when you are hearing the Truth because everything seems familiar, like you have already heard or read these words before - but you can't think where you read it or who told you.

The Hardy Boys-style grammar and plot can hardly be discribed as good literature.

Redfield has certainly taught me how to look at the world around me, the sequences of events, and especially coincidences, with a new awareness. He also provided me with a new - and as far as I am concerned totally valid - insight into relationships with what he calls \\"control dramas\\". Think about it: we all have them. Redfield didn't set out to write the \\"great novel of the century\\" - he simply wrote the book in novel form to make the truths he is trying to present accessable to a larger audience.

This book reflects a very dangerous philosophy which neglects a very beautiful material universe, denying such things as reality and the actual existence of physical things in favor of a New Age belief that we create all these things in our own heads. In addition, I had no idea it was fiction - talk about a lack of truth in advertising."},{"rating":"1","title":"There may be worst things, but I haven't seen any yet","review":"This tiny literary piece may appear among the nastiest books read by me. It really isn't worth the paper it is written in, not to say the time I had to spend reading it.

Someone who writes (or speaks) unskilfully doesn't automatically mean he has nothing valuable to tell.I tried putting aside that logic demanding brain. I tried reminding myself that higher realities don't yield well to the mechanistic way we've been trained to think. Still nothing, but a saddening feeling that great masses of people had been swindled by this valueless book.I used the same attitude when I began reading Jeremy Griffith's badly written \\"Beyond the Human Condition\\", and, yes, I found something there. Griffith spent many years (six?) in the Tasmanian wilderness, but NOT to find \\"meaning of life\\". The clues (or the answers) about our existence came to Jeremy Griffith without invitation. I believe he'd been doing government commissioned research work at the time.I wouldn't recommend Griffith for those who disliked or liked \\"Prophecy\\".

This is the hugest piece of junk I've ever read in my life, save my returned teenage loveletters which also deserved burning. At least my loveletters contained style, if adolescent; form, if inconsistent; humor, if subjective; excitement, if also personal; and truth, if fleeting.Mr James Redfield has made hundreds of thousands via a piece of trash. It's not right.I turned the 246 pages (paperback, Warner Books) because I'd heard about it so frequently. I hoped the silly beginning would turn solid. I still hoped the impoverished middle would slip into persuasion. At the idiotic end, I was disgusted, full of wonder at the garbage one can profitably publish.Do not purchase this book! Borrow it, or retrieve it from my dumpster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughably Stupid Book, and Philosophy","review":"This book is so dumb I wanted to toss it out after the first 20 pages, but forced myself to finish -- a sort of intellectual self-flagelation as it turned out -- because I could not believe such a poorly written piece of crap with such a transparently self-centered philosophy could be such a big hit, and thought it had to get better. It didn't. Not only that, there's actually a part in the book where the author gets basic astronomical facts laughably wrong, and has the moon rising on the wrong horizon. What a poor joke this book is. Too bad he keeps writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb Book","review":"A couple of years ago I skimmed through this book in a store and decided not to buy it. It seemed to have all of the flaws that I associate with some popular works of Christian fiction, only in a New Age context. But, the book was judged to be \\"beautiful\\" by a friend of mine, so I decided to read it. I'm about 3/5ths of the way through it now, and I must say I am astonished at the stupidity of this so-called \\"novel.\\" The first responsibility of a novelist is to tell a story through plot and characterization. The author here does neither. I won't say more, as the others who have \\"one-starred\\" this book say it all with great eloquence and wit. This book is an insult to the reader's intelligence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silliness, but not inspired silliness...","review":"A goofy tour through some ill-explored new age beliefs. Redfield uses the device of a novel to lead the reader through a series of \\"insights\\" and posts fictional scientists all along the way to provide entirely fictional support to the ideas he's heard about and happens to like.My favorite part: A character announces he's headed up to the north of Peru (\\"up near Guatemala.\\") Guatemala, as anyone with access to a map should know, is seven countries to the north of Peru -- kind of like saying you're going up to the north of Panama, \\"up by Canada.\\" Where was the editor on this one?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Celestine Prophecy: Or How I Lost My Faith in Humanity","review":"All James Redfield teaches us in this book is that he has a very poor understanding of evolution, history, human nature, religion, and most of all, literacy.Besides being filled with nothing worth taking away, Redfield has accomplished writing the most poorly written work of fiction I have ever read.This book's immense popularity and following among the \\"new age\\" crowd is proof enough that we are damned as a species."},{"rating":"1","title":"The love of money is the root of all drivel","review":"Paul knew it, Anton LaVey knew it, and L. Ron Hubbard knew it.... simplistic spirituality wrapped in a anti-dominant-culture stance to make it look new, bold, and innovative has always been catnip to those unfortunate folks who just can't restrain themselves from believing in tooth fairies. This book is a signpost along the road that the New Age has taken from being primarily the realm of well-meaning but gullible hippies to being primarily a capitalist concern for busy yuppies who want their inner life, like their vitamin C and their fiber, in a pill.Unlike vitamin C and fiber, this contrived (though emotionally manipulative) plot speckled with forgettable characters and those nine brilliant insights that read like one of your better fortune cookies won't actually do you any good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Contemporary Philosopher","review":"James Redfield writes solely on the topic of human spiritual awareness. His books are not meant to be read for a fictional adventure. Rather the story is simply analogous to his philosophical teachings on our everyday lives. He is a contemporary philosopher, and when reading the Celestine prophesy you need to look beneath the surface of the plot in order to interpret the significance of what Redfield is saying."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT CELESTIAL","review":"This book reads like a movie. A few people recommended this book and perhaps my expectations were high. I was completely disappointed and bored. I don't understand how it was a best seller. Maybe I missed something, because I certainly can't understand how people were somehow spiritually enlightened by this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish","review":"Self-satisfied drivel.

I mean, doesn't anyone want to be told what the true meaning of life is; why we are all here? And I must admit, although skeptical of the first insight, I was quite impressed by the second and even started telling people about the book. But it went all the way downhill from there. In trying to reconcile science and religion, Redfield has completely taken away the complexities of the world and stereotyped and categorized anything and everything. Sorry mister - it doesn't work that way. Are you truly trying to make us believe that all of mankind fits into only 4 groups of control drama? And is it so easy to define one based on the groups of your parents? come on - who are we trying to kid? The protagonist might fit easily into one of your molds but the rest of us like to think we have more depth. I'm all for a new world culture but the one offered in the Celestine Prophecy just isn't the way. Stay away from this book please!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Message? What message? How about common sense!","review":"After reading this book, I now see the message. Unfortunatley, I purchased the book therefore the message has come a little too late. This lame excuse for writing is at least pathetic. This story seems to drone on and on, and let's not forget to point out the repeated phrases which seem to make up most of the text. Ugh! I feel cheated. Perhaps the lesson here is, don't judge a book by it's cover. I did. I lost. If you want a good book which lets you make up your mind, read \\"Holy blood, holy grail\\". Not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another how to reach enlightenment book for yuppies","review":"Ok fiction. But nothing new.

I couldn't have been more disappointed when I discovered the flat characters, contrived plot and pathetically oversimplified philosophical tid-bits. I wish I could say that I finished it, but by the fourth or fifth insight I'd grown so tired of Redfield's elementary-school-grammar-class sentence structure that this one was buried at the back of my bookshelf never to return."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you are looking for a philosophy, may I suggest the Bible","review":"I know this book is appealing. I know that the language of forgiveness is appealing. I know that it is wonderful that the book inspires so many people to become more spiritual.But the hard facts are, this book is not the Bible, even though it *seems* to take up where the Bible left off. The Bible is complete, and as a book of philosophy, I have yet to find its equal.I am not a crusading Christian. This isn't about whether your religion is better or worse than mine. This is about people believing, and reforming their lives because of, this book. That is a dangerous practice to be part of, especially for those who are unaware of the differences between what this book professes and what the major world religions hold to be fundamental principles.Check it out for yourself. The Bible really doesn't need elaboration."},{"rating":"1","title":"A drugless Acid Test","review":"I read this book a few weeks ago and the only parts I valued were its abstract ideas on where humanity was heading. I am currently reading The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test, and I am finding a LOT of similarities. The talk of vibrations/vibes and being \\"in synch\\" with others is covered in both (along with other things). TCP seems to me like a poor Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test brought about by the New Age trend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap - hysterical - awful - soul deadening crap","review":"I have to write to say that I have found a use for this book. If one reads it aloud at parties it provides hours of amusement. It serves much the same purpose as watchng Ed Wood movies. But if anyone is actually thinking of reading this all the way through I would strongly recommend against it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid","review":"This is probably the most stupid and boring book I have ever read. The only reason I continued with it was that I had paid good money for it. I will now try to resell it or, perhaps, just give it away, probably with a warning label attached only because I don't want it cluttering up my bookshelf. The writing style itself was quite amateurish and dull. Is this what \\"New Age\\" is all about? I agree with the review that mentioned Ecco's book.

I found inspiration in the Nine Insights and if we only open our eyes we can see life's purpose. But I must admit that I found Dream Maker to be a better book. It has more substance and it really does open your mind to the purpose of life. It told me a lot of God's will, that it really resides within us, and until we learn who we really are we are going to be in pain. I have been also fighting depression, and reading Dream Maker helped me a lot. I am now more interested in reincarnation.I'm glad Amazon is pairing up these two novels, I hope many people buy them both."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Ugh...this is really just the author's religious ramblings, poorly disguised as a novel. And I wouldn't even object to the religious and spiritual aspects of the book (in fact, this is why I picked it up in the first place) if not for the fact that the writing is so spectacularly bad and the characters so one-dimensional. The author can't even keep his facts and story straight (in one scene someone is supposed to be driving and the next paragraph he is reading a map).Normally I try to give books away after reading them but this one I threw in the garbage...I couldn't think of anyone who I would want to subject to this and waste their time. Oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"split world","review":"It's amazing to me the contrasting view-points on this book. Personally, I was led to believe that this book was some ground breaking work by a serious writer. It read more like a children's adventure book then ground breaking work. As a member of the general, reading public, my advice to Redfield is to take some college writing courses. His lack of writing skills severely inhibits the effectiveness of his point of view. He is also extremely self-centered in his assuming that everyone believes in one god, his. Unfortunantly, his dream of a single unified global culture is comming true as indigenous cultures around the world are destroyed to make room for Coke products and McDonald's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank you Celestine Prophecy","review":"The only thing good about this book is it inspired me to try to bang out a cheap novel and be able to get it published.

It's simplified basic psychology for the most.

If on the other hand you are set in your ways, and negative about anything good then you might better look elsewhere. This book is about love, enlightenment, Peace and change. James Redfield takes the beliefs of many and puts them in an understandable and engrossing story that anyone can comprehend. If you get tingles when you talk of spiritual matters then read this book. If you like well written stories that are easy to read and have underlying lessons to be learned, read this book. I personally have 3 copies but I never get to see a one because I always have someone who wants to borrow it, sometimes more than once."},{"rating":"1","title":"A story fit for elementary school students -- maybe?","review":"I was persuaded to read this book by the praises of my college acquaintance, a major in the field of classics.

For me, this book took my own life experiences, without preaching, and directed them through a different thought process. Like through a funnel, my life experiences could finally be seen, through only my eyes, a constanst stream of universality. Since then, I slowly began to practice certain methods of thought, from the Insights that truly moved me (rational philosophy and strong logic). To say the least, I am very glad that I did.

Here is a clue: if Redfield talks about saving the planet why does he participate in the process which is killing 19 million trees a day. Redfield is worthless in the shift of our humanity to search for truth without wanting to make money from it? From a sincere truth seeker, you are a dissapointment, Redfield.

He might as well drop the whole action/suspense portion of the book (about 20 pages) and just call it \\"Religion according to yet another new-age nutcase.\\" I mean, I would be hard-pressed to find another book so poorly written (Try \\"The Death Disciple\\".

A few observations:(1) Not everyone will like every book that is written.(2) Bestseller status does not imply that a book is GOOD. It implies that the book sells well, that's all.(3) James Redfield's book HAS helped several people who are not accustomed to reading \\"heavy\\" books on spirituality. I hoped Redfield's goal was for us to not take his insights literally, but to use them to begin a process of self realization. But his sequels did not convince me that I was right.(4) Fiction does have its power in making people ponder many issues. Take for example, \\"Anita's Legacy\\" available on Amazon, which blends many issues in science and spirituality not addressed by the serial spiritual trio of Redfield, Chopra and Walsch.(5) Like many scientists, I wait anxiously for Insight No. 137, which will explain to us the mystical number in the Standard Model of particle physics."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Treasure of Inanities","review":"I selected one star because I didn't have the option of '0'.

There is NOTHING new in this book and I cannot believe how many gullible readers are out there. This is just a novel that repeats information that's been around for centuries.

As for the premise, well...perhaps it has to do with the bad writing, but I was left with the feeling that Redfield had a drug-induced spiritual/life vision, and felt the best way to share it with the public (i.e.: cash in) was via novelization.

There's no parking lot at Machu Pichu. The Maya were never in South America. Not everyone in Peru speaks English.

Also I saw most of the insights as common sense for a decent human being. I would not recommend this book if you want to extend your vocabulary.

This is such a load of rubbish I can't believe it was ever published. Of course, in the US, anything is possible. I haven't read anything this bad since that Mars-Venus garbage written by an idiot matching Redfield's calibre.There are a great deal of good books written that deal with spiritual life, synchronicity, prayer, and metaphysics, but this crap makes a mockery of such knowledge.The hysteria around the Celestine Prophecy reminds me very much of the HC Andersen story The Emperor's New Clothes. For a long time I thought that I was the only sane person around who could see that James Redfield was a total moron. I guess that if you tell a big enough lie to enough people, people start to believe it.

As a recent tourist to Peru I bought the book hoping to learn more about the country that I had visited and loved - or at least to relive some of my experiences. However, what I found was not just a grossly inadequate description of a magical country but the description of a country that did not exist. R had clearly not seen, or even read much about the places he describes. The roads to Machu Picchu and Iquitos thankfully do not exist. In fact you cannot drive to Iquitos at all. That is one of the fascinating features of this isolated city, cut off by tremendous water ways, mountains and jungle. You cannot drive to Machu Picchu and look down on the ruins.

I only remember the first one (something along the lines of \\"people will start to notice lots of really weird coincidences\\") because I felt the author was setting himself up with an excuse for not bothering with a convincing plot development. I read a great many books, and would guess that I finish about 99% of books I start, even though this often requires considerable perseverence. Well, this one made that exclusive 1%.

From the people with whom I have discussed this book, I have heard nothing but stories of how this book has changed lives. I pulled this book out again about a week ago, after discussing it with a co-worker. I had just finished reading The Secret and was amazed at how the two books are based on very similar ideas.

The ideas themselves are a salad-bar mishmash of various New-Age and pseudo-Eastern sputterings, all of which I've seen before. My six-year-old niece has made finger puppets out of construction paper that have more depth of character than Redfield's stick-figures.

Pick up a Bible, Koran, Torah, the Bagdavadh Gita, some Taoist literature, and throw in some Freud, some Jung, (and let's not forget, some common sense!) and you will have a much better melting pot of spirituality and philosphy than Redfield can ever provide.

The dialogue was worse than the worst episode of Star Trek (no offense Trekkers), and the story was so laughable that I had to continuously force myself to keep an open mind & try to focus in on the point the author was trying to make.

It passes itself off as some sort of mystery book on the outside, but then turns into a jumbled collection of [material] that does a disservice to the New Age movement with which it is associated. It's not that it's just bad New Age literature; it is quite possibly one of the worst books ever written. Not only does it struggle to maintain some semblance of a shred of cohesion, but characters and \\"plot\\" devices just magically appear from thin air when needed. I would advise anyone who is looking for some sort of guidance in the New Age movement to look elsewhere. I would advise anyone who's looking for a good mystery/thriller with elements of the supernatural and archaeology to look anywhere but here. You could probably write a better story yourself, and you won't end up feeling less intelligent for the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eeek, bad science","review":"Many other reviewers have done a fantastic job illustrating how frighteningly bad this book is. One item not noted thus far is the amount of bad science in the book. Though it is clearly fiction a great many physicists and biologists would role over in their graves if they read the book. James Redfield has an uncanny ability to completely mistunderstand simple concepts of physics and biology. He routinely presents oddly distorted accounts of well known theories from quantum mechanics, molecular biology and other fields in shockingly incorrect ways."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous cliche-driven book of supposed enlightenment.","review":"Celestine Prophecy is an awful book on many levels. The 10 prophecies are over-simplified \\"explanations\\" of why the world is the way it is. They start out as obvious in the begining of the book and end up as absurd at the end. The level of insight that Redfield shows is juvenile. It's embarassing that CP is cherished by so many people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Words of Wisdom","review":"Much is taken into consideration in this wonderful book within the circle of our friends. The motive here is a healing point with the results to grow spiritualy. This book is written without technical confusion and is easily understood without complication. Should we digest wisdom for spirit..or ignorance for ego? Ego is a seeker for fault that carries a bag load of ill thoughts, and its likelihood is to blemish the good works of others. Thank God that His strength within overcomes the strain and weaknesses of others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possitive outlook","review":"This book carries a possitve outlook toward life, and is creative at its best-with an open mind. I really enjoyed this reading material- Also recommendable are....The Third Time Is Now...Conversations with God..1-2 & 3. Great spiritual reading material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stimulating Ideas. Poorly Written","review":"I loved some of the ideas in the book. This book is useful for people that are really looking for the truth and are interested in self-discovery. It is not written very well though - which makes it harder... For those that are of a critical nature...this book would not be for them...Some of the principles and insights are really revealing and useful though...Another book that I just discovered that I love and made a gigantic difference in my life is: \\"Working On Yourself Doesn't Work: A Book ABout Instantaneous Transformation\\". It is the first book by two pioneers in Self-Realization and Personal Growth, Ariel and Shya Kane. Beautifully written and also has some very powerful principles for how to change your approach to living. Also not a book for sceptics who can find fault with everything..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big picture?","review":"Anyone with the IQ of a carrot could figure out what Redfield's \\"big picture\\" is. The problem is with the way he presents it. It comes across as too easy and, more importantly, hypocritical. And then he totally blows it when he forces his own make-believe ideals on us as if he's God, then asks us for money. If you think I would or should take tips on child-rearing from Redfield, you should have your head examined. And he apparantly has no genuine interest in conserving natural resources either, as his millions of books are made with the most glossy, tree-ravaging, non-recycled material there is. If he really cared, he would use a paperless way of conveying his message, such as publishing on the internet. Gee, I wonder why he hasn't? Could it be that people would then be able to access his books for free?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Would have been much better in different hands","review":"I borrowed this from the library, hoping it would be good enough to buy later. I'm glad I test drove it first -- I found the writing to be so contrived I couldn't get beyond it. The idea of the insights was brilliant -- it's a shame that the writing was so elementary and flat. In another writer's hands, this might have been truly brilliant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talk about a MESSIAH COMPLEX!","review":"Is James Redfield an aspiring cult leader? Or just a master at marketing? He regurgitates common knowledge as if he's Moses with the Ten Commandments. Then he actually asks people to give MONEY to whoever inspires them with his \\"insights\\"--setting himself up for a pretty nice payoff, no? Also seems like a pretty good incentive for people to spread the word about him. Perhaps that's the reason he's received such extensive word-of-mouth publicity. I can't think of any other reason why so many people would recommend his hypocritical, pathetic crap. This has got to be the greatest MLM scheme of all time! He's probably laughing all the way to the bank at all the lost souls he's suckered in. I would be! Anyone who's moronic enough to support him and give him money deserves to be a sucker."},{"rating":"1","title":"How unfortunate to mistake such drivel for sprituality!","review":"Recently, members of my book group decided it would be such fun to bring in, giftwrapped, the worst book we've ever read. Over coffee, we each chose a \\"gift\\" from the stack and opened our \\"treasure.\\" I chose to giftwrap this book. Anyone who has ever read Joseph Campbell, George Lucas or the Bible, will find this search for the spiritual self lame, if not laughable. I worry for the American public, that this book remained on the best-seller list for so very long.

Reading, skimming, and glancing through all these \\"reviews\\" -- it's actually much more entertaining than the book ever was (having read it twice -- once when it first came out, and again more recently, trying to see what I had possibly \\"missed\\" in it the first time). . . So why not add a comment to the plethora of those already pouring out here! The book itself, as so many others have already pointed out, is sadly lacking in any (\\"standard\\"/\\"conventional\\")literary techniques/skills/qualities. . .but those ideas -- look at the controversy they've stirred just on these computer pages alone! Look at the pure volume of outpouring of opinions! What a riot! Does that mean there is some force/strength to the book?

Go figure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb","review":"The previous reviewer's opinion to the contrary I am not the sharpest pencil in the pack, nor am I a baby boomer but I've got to say that this was a really BAD book. This book is to pop spiritualism what \\"Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus\\" is to pop marriage-counseling books. I have seen more profound wisdom in Bazooka bubble gum comics. I have read other books like \\"One\\" and \\"Illusions\\" which successfully presented their spiritual point in the form of a novel without beating the reader over the head with it, so it CAN be done. This one just stinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's no book like a really really bad book","review":"Based on the rather entertaining reviews of this book, I think I did rather well making it through the first 30 pages (and this without major stomach pains). I did, however, have a whopper of a headache afterward. I suppose that could be attributed to my lack of spiritual depth, as intimated by those favorable reviews of this not-fit-for-even-short-airplane-rides book. In retrospect, I suppose this book will nicely summarize our national (sad but true) state-of-consciousness as we cruise toward the new millenium. As antidote to this book, pick up any good book (even one you have read a few times). It helped me immensely, and worked much better than a headache tablet. Luckily, in Germany we can recycle paper products, and I found that a somewhat satisfying method of disposal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth The Time!!!","review":"Author is not clear if he is writing about his adventurous trip to Peru or about the insights he received, he does not makeup his mind till the last page of his book. All these insights are known to mankind already through various religious gurus. Pretty simple things like \\"God is within You\\", \\"love your brethern\\" are known to everyone. Author is trying to tell the old philosophies with a new cover and a lot of hype. 70% of the book hypes about the greatness of the insights, 29% talks about author's problems and 1% talks about the actual insights. This 1% is so hidden the readers have a hard time finding it. Author's reasoning for the unexplained disappearance of the Mayan Civilization is unique but unbeleivable. Not worth the time! If you do want to know about the insights, you might want to pick up the book \\"Tenth Insights\\" and read the first chapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"the reviews are better than the book","review":"I logged on here to try to counteract all the new-age mishmash I thought I'd find in relation to this book, but was thrilled to find reader after reader giving it the thrashing it so desperately deserves. So how the heck did it sell 8 MILLION copies? Anyway, I'm heartened that I'm not the only one who thought it was ridiculous. The beginning was anyway-I can't talk about the rest as I gave up about a third of the way through, about the time some Peruvian saint or somebody started talking about the \\"poor me syndrome\\". What? Poor ME, for being subjected to this book. PS-I was forced to give it one star because it's the only way my review would print."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow amusement and some spiritual tickling","review":"I enjoyed this book. I enjoy most books i finish. I wont be recommending it to my friends though because i think it falls a long way short of brilliant.I think this book requires in the reader a certain leap of faith, an understanding or a belief in meditation, esp, extraspiritual etc. I believe in all these things, i meditate etc and try to keep an open mind. The story was rubbish but i found myself intrigued as to the final conclusions of the 'insights'.But is this book aimed at everyone?This is not start and finish spirituality. Anyone who judges it on this level is wrong to. And its not a book you would recommend for the plot. So whats it all about? My conclusion is that its a thinly disguised self help book, but lacks enough of the 'guidance' as to be of little use.Buy this book if you want some shallow amusement and some spiritual tickling but please dont embrace this book as the ultimate read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Life is Too Short","review":"Some may enjoy this New Age novel for its kitsch appeal but for me, it is so poorly concieved and poorly written that I just couldn't finish it.Just one example: one of the main premises of the book is that throughout the world, \\"coincidences are happening more and more.\\" No particular reason was given for this assertion. The main character didn't seem to have a coince-a-meter in his pocket so as to measure the relative proportion of coincidences over time. But no matter - he bases major decisions about his life's direction on his unquestioning belief in the increased incidents of coincidences.Please!But to those out there who recommend this book (including my friend the Vassar graduate who should know better) I'd like to ask you this: why should we turn for spiritual advice to an author who, instead of writing the religious tract he ought to have, narcissitically foists upon the world a novel when he has absolutely no understanding of how to use the form?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is this a best seller?","review":"After finally getting a chance to read this \\"best seller\\", I must say I was very disappointed. There were no insights for me. I can't believe people are buying this. It really doesn't compare to the last new age novel I read. \\"The Destiny of Miro\\" is an intriging story as well as enlightening. I recommend that instead or any of Richard Bach's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was suprised by this book","review":"Everyone I know who has read this book said it was a \\"must read\\" and that you learn so much from Redfield and his discovery of the nine insights. I bought the book and started to read it -- I was taken aback, I had NO idea it had all of the \\"adventure\\" of the author's racing through the Peruvian jungle to find the manuscript. That part of the book just did not cut it for me -- I thought the book was too long and the author could have just written up the insights and made the book a heck of a lot shorter.I'm not sure I agree with his findings, but it is an interesting concept. I cannot truly recommend this book, I found it somewhat dull and not very well written. As I said earlier, it could have been a lot shorter and made much more of an impact."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Commercial Message","review":"The several insights and the painstaking route to their revelation was a bit boring. For me, the book was a major poke at all organized religion. Like, who needs a religion if you are totally in touch with and love yourself? So much for a 246-page commercial. Now, back to Baldacci and other great story tellers."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unbelievably empty and foolish book","review":"We should consider a negative scale, just for crappy,pseudo-intellectual/cultural/philosophical books of thiskind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"I told my officemate at work about this book after I finished reading it and he found as much amusement in the ludicrous presentation of its concepts as I did. Not only is the writing sloppy but the \\"adventure\\" would be the first proposal thrown out of an X-Files script meeting. There is something profound latently lurking in the pages of this book but it never really comes into focus at any point in the story. Maybe someone else can do a better job discussing the same material in a different book."},{"rating":"1","title":"you will be stupider for reading this book","review":"If i had to name the singularly worst piece of writing i have ever read, this would be it. an somehow, it managed many weeks on the bestsellers list! you will like this book if: a) inanimate objects or voices from no where instill you with the teaching of the great forest people. b) you've experimented with hallucinagenic drugs. the descriptions of the random colors will bring you right back to those LSD days when you thought you could fly. c) your reading abilities have not yet passed middle school level. the actual writing of this book was undoubtedly the worst i've ever seen. d) you have a chair thats appx. 3/4 an inch to short. using this book as a prop would be ideal.this book is horrible. don't even bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time-rate this one '0'","review":"I heard so much about this book that I thought I'd see what all the fuss was about. I'm just glad that I didn't spend good money on it! I borrowed it from the public library where I work. I love to read, and usually try to finish a book even if it's slow getting into it. I really tried to find something in this one to keep me reading to the end, but about 3/4 of the way through I finally gave up. I found the writing terribly boring, and all the mumbo jumbo about energy fields and dramas just got to me after a while. I found not one redeeming thing about this book. Would have rated it no stars, but that option wasn't available. Sorry I wasted my time on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Start","review":"For anyone who has not yet had an experience in their lives that gave them a deeper understanding of the world around them, this book is a good place to begin. Although the insights that are covered are not a complete explanation of the world around us, it does give us a glimpse at the underlying nature of the universe. At the very least this book will make you think. It will make you question what you have been taught. The conclusions reached in the various insights are hard to deny. After reading this book I felt relief that someone had finally wrote about this kind of explanation of spirituality."},{"rating":"2","title":"The journey is worth the destination.","review":"This is what I consider a self examining adventure.

When I heard that there was a sequel, the Tenth Insight, I screamed with laughter. Now I see there are meditation courses and lectures to assist with helping you pour more money into his coffers. When will all these dreadful wishy washy new-age yuppie hippies realize that they gained nothing from this except a lesson in being ripped off. It is out there, it is real, it is more profound than you can imagine, but you will not find it in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exploitative","review":"Total and utter nonsense which preys on and exploits those individuals who feel that there is a \\"sign\\" within this book. I understand that the author does not state that this should be everyone, but as an avid follower of Theosophy I find this book total non-sensical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Food for Soul!","review":"It is obvious that people either love or hate the book. I found it \\"insightful\\" even though it was unrealistic at times. The truth of the matter is when I read a book my goal is to take away a few good ideas from it and adapt it to my life which I accomplished. Spiritual maturity is not easy to attain but opening your mind to new ideas is the first step. After I finished the book I had three people in mind to give it to as a gift. This book is for people that have a higher level of spirituality and can be receptive to different point of views."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I had consulted other reviews before buying...","review":"...this book. When reading a novel, I try to imagine the movie that would be done based on it. I found myself laughing at the dialogue, the characters, and the concepts. Imagine the opportunities for Hispanic actors: Ricardo Montalban would be Cardinal Sebastian, Alejandro Rey would be Father Sanchez, etc. You would have to put Adam Sandler in the role of the tourist and Drew Barrymore could play any of the female characters. Sort of a remake of the Wedding Singer meets Fantasy Island. Another thing occurred to me as I finally got to the end: Members of Greenpeace must have picked up on the theme of preserving ancient forests and are out there right now vibrating themselves silly trying to stop harvesting of trees used to make wood products and paper. How many ancient trees died to print this book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A poorly written book","review":"This was one of the worst books I have read.

If you truly want to see how events in your life are an influence in your future life, you may as well call the psychic hotline. You'll have better luck with that than with this book.

Then he just keeps meeting people and every character behaves and talks identically. By the end of the book there were like 2 dozen names swirling around and I couldn't remember who any of them were. That's how DUMB and BORING this book is. The rest of it is just him trying to shove his own personal blend of new age mubo jubo and psychology down your throat.

If we as humans don't believe in a god, somehow we create one to believe that there is something more out there. This book encourages spiritual awarness within all of us. I truely believe this book is fictional and this did not happen in factual accounts as the book is trying to imply. I believe James Redfield is trying to convey a message and the message is a powerful one. I feel he had to get his message across through an action filled fictional adventure. Like most of the stories of the bible is filled with action, lust and adventure. I'm not trying to compare this book to the bible but I think he got his idea based on the bible's formula of interest. This book is great for those who are searching for knowledge of the spirit and a spiritual awareness within.I believe life is a journey not a destination especially a journey of ones' spirit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a spiritual classic.","review":"When I read this book, I felt that the author has a very narrow view of the human spirituality as well as the latest developments in science.

I liked it enough that I've re-read it about 3 or 4 times since then, and every time I seem to find some new details that I didn't grasp the previous time I read it. In no way is this book a sort of \\"spiritual guidebook\\" that some people make claims about, but it definitely presents some philosophical and spiritual ideas that have some truth to them, and makes the reader want to consider his or her own life situation and how it relates to the big picture of it all. I also like how the spiritual ideas presented in this book are meant to compliment and coexist with traditional Christian beliefs, and many of the concepts in the book actually promote a deeper understanding of traditional Christian beliefs. Even if you don't have a big interest in the spiritual aspects of this book, it is also an excellent adventure story.

No, they were all too happy to send this snake oil my way (and I thought it was such a cool place).

The larger scenarios are unplayable due to the RT quality of the game. -Too much going on to keep track of -which leads to all sorts of unhistorical results. Leaders are virtually invulnerable to any bad effect -even when surrounded and being walk over by the enemy. I was just glad to get $20 of my money back when I sold the game to a kid down the street. If you are a serious Napoleonic buff, I don't recommend this game.

So if you buy a game for $15.00, you shouldn't expect a masterpiece, however, this game advertises with a ... price tag and somewhat good reviews which is usually enough to expect good game-play and well defined graphics. Well, think again. The price tag on this game should read ... (at the most).

He only weighs 17 pounds so you wouldn't think he'd generate that much liquid, but after only 1 or 2 uses, these things are SO saturated, that the urine just runs right off of them, so I've had to overlap 3 of them to catch the overflow and still I have to put newspaper underneath. Even so, the newspaper gets wet, plus they smell really bad when wet. Using 3 at a time and having to change them 2 or 3 times a day, they're running out way faster than if I'd bought better quality ones that I'd only have to use one at a time and would only have to change maybe once or twice a day, and would save me money (and the work of changing them so often) in the long run."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not absorbent","review":"I am using these for my older pet dog when I am away during the daytime.

Not an entirely bad thing as i've seen plastic sights work just fine.

If you shoot any reasonable amount of ammo out of an AK(150 to 200 rounds)than your gun could get hot enough to melt the post in your gun like it did mine.

When I went to take it out, it twisted up and then finally broke in the rifle, so then I didn't have a front sight at all. Also, I don't know what the idea was of making the middle of these things hollow, but it sure does help them twist up and bend when you try to turn them. Get a scope or stick to the sight that's on the rifle.

The annoying skewed sets brought to mind a bad hangover, bent glasses, or my worst migraine. I found myself unable to ignore the tenor's exclusive attention to the promptor's box, and in spite of the nice voice and a passionatesituation,\\"Cavaradossi\\" never connected with \\"Tosca\\". (I longed for Tosca to sing \\"hey, I'm over here\\" while the prompter's box was being adored; learning one's role is a minimal requirement for praiseworthy performance, and even Pavorati was bad about that.) Finally, the last scene-a ridiculously long flight of stairs for Tosca to climb, with skirt hitched up and audience wondering if she would make it, to end the worst version of Tosca I've ever seen.

Among many grammatical sins, the author uses exclaimation marks for nearly everything! Sometimes she uses two!! Not to be unkind, but the author should have considered a writing course along with culinary school. (Before cooking school, she was an aerobics instructor.)If you're interested in this sort of book, read Michael Ruhlman's \\"The Making of a Chef,\\" which is far superior. Unlike this one, it's a well written and insightful account of what it's like to go to culinary school. That book is based on his experiences at the Culinary Institute of America. Update to review: I also recommend \\"The Sharper Your Knife, the Less You Cry\\" by Kathleen Flinn. It's about her experiences at Le Cordon Bleu in Paris, and a truly wonderful read."},{"rating":"1","title":"And I asked for this for Christmas . . . . .","review":"This book is insufferably bad. It lacks greatly for an editor. The author will switch tense 3 times in a single paragraph. The punctuation is horrible, and the content is lacking a clear organization. The depth of information does not go beyond simple statements: \\"We learned this, then we learn that, and we will learn to do those.\\" She also needs to learn the virtue of pronouns as a way to avoid using the same word (in this case \\"toque\\") in 6 consecutive sentences.Do not buy this book. It will not satisfy anyone's quest for knowledge or interest in culinary school and will be impossible to read through the grammatical errors and dullness of discussion of an otherwisely interesting topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsufferable","review":"I still can't understand how the author managed to write a book on an experience where she seemed to be naive through to the end. The book seems to parallel the author's culinary experience and interest, it only skims the top. She never fully developed any idea or breakthrough experience, and admittedly didn't feel she excelled, yet still felt ok with being called \\"chef\\" at the book's end. It is incredible the lack of enthusiasm that was displayed for the very art that she believed herself to be called to. I personally feel that a person that truly cares about what he/she does would be interested in all aspects, including history and culture. Yet these are the very things that in the book she claims she will not \\"bore\\" you with. Basically, I found that the book told me nothing new. I already know the basic curriculum just from looking at the website, I wanted a thorough first hand experience.

Being an agnostic individual, who walks away from any conversation about God, I listened intently. Now, I wonder? Who am I in all this? What part do I play? Christian helped me to see, I play a big one! Soon after the interview, his song EVERYBODY ELSE was played. His music just knocked me over. Such power, compassion and conviction!

Hilary Duff is a talented singer/actress. On first views the film seems childish and rated for younger veiwers, being 15 I enjoyed it, feeling that it was a film for everyone. The movie was great so I got the sound track. I think its great that Hilary has added many of her own tracks to this CD but also ranging from Atomic Kitten to many other famouse artists. If you loved the movie then you will adore the Soundtrack. All in all Hilary/Lizzie brings a little bit of adventure into everyone who watchs and listens to her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just nice","review":"I like Hilary Duff's acting but I wasn't so sure of her music.

The only reason people should buy it is if they really, really, really love Hilary Duff. I do not recommend buying it. If you want to waste your money, go ahead, but I warned you.

The \\"Lizzie Mcguire Soundtrack,\\" is no different. If anything, this is the soundtrack to own of the year. It includes the wonderful ballad version of \\"What Dreams Are Made Of,\\" which by itself makes this soundtrack worthwhile.Some other great songs include Jump 5's version of \\"Shining Star,\\" and Hilary Duff's remix of \\"Why Not.\\" There are only very few songs to skip on this album, but the only thing holding back from FIVE stars is that it will soon loose it's flare and probably be taken out of many CD players within the next few months. This isn't exactly the album that will be enjoyed for too long as tweens see many things come and go. But for now, Lizzie Mcguire has proven to be a hit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Variety is the spice of life!","review":"And there is plenty of variety coughed up on this CD.

If you listen closely that isn't her real voice!! Let's get Hilary at a performance where she has to sing live and without the help of any computers and such to help her voice. I can't believe people would purchase this cd. The songs are horribly disgusting! Listen to them! They are so so teeny bopperish. And I'm not talking like NSYNC teeny bopper. This is way worse. Her acting in the movie was horrible as well. She needs to go back to school and continue with her life. Either that or stick to TV shows because the movies are too much for her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a star","review":"Hilary Duff will not take the place of Britney or Christina. She won't make it that far. Hilary Duff isn't that good of a singer. Put her at a performance when she has to sing LIVE without anything to fix her voice. It's almost guranteed that she really won't sound anything like how she sounds on the CD. She really needs to stick to acting. And when I say acting I mean on TV shows. Movies are not her thing. There were noticable flaws in her acting in The Lizzie McGuire movie compared to the show."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best I've heard this year","review":"This soundtrack has some of the greatest songs. If it's not the lyrics, it's the voices as well. Hilary definitly shines. The hits such as \\"why not\\" are just the greatest songs to dance in front of you mirror and pretend your a pop-star! Finially a girl that us teens and young girls can look up to. She sets a great example for following your dreams. First from a T.V show on Disney, to on the big screen, and getting your own solo songs! So I suggest you buy this CD if you are a fun, outgoing person that wants to listen to some of the most exciting music and just have fun! Hilary and all definitly score!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun soundtrack","review":"I'm not really into Hillary Duff or LizzieMcGuire, but after giving this soundtrack a listen to at my friend's house, I thought it wasn't bad at all. In fact, it was pretty good. This CD features mostly fun, catchy pop tunes and maybe one or two ballads. Artists included are Vitamin C, Atomic Kitten, LMNT, Haylie Duff, Jump 5, Taylor Dayne, and many more. The CD also features songs sung by Hilary Duff/Lizzie McGuire, including the hit \\"Why Not\\" and \\"What Dreams are Made of\\". Most of these songs were fun to listen to, and they make you want to get up and do something! (I started doing round-offs, back handsprings, and walkovers in my friend's room) My favorites were \\"The Tide is High\\", \\"Why Not\\", \\"Shining Star\\", and \\"What Dreams are Made of\\".

Its beyond horrible, I cant quite describe it. Hilary Duffs voice is terrible (as is her acting) and its very obviously computerized to make it sound as if she could keep a tune.

I was expecting songs that were aimed at just pre-teens/teenagers...but this CD has something for everyone! The best songs on here are the two done by Hilary Duff and the remake of \\"Supermodel\\" by Taylor Dayne! I was totally shocked when I saw Taylor Dayne on the track listing. Where did she come from?!!! While she is no RuPaul, she does do a really nice job of recreating his dancefloor masterpiece...even the reworking of \\"making love to the camera\\" to the more family-friendly \\"smile for the camera\\" works.The rest of the soundtrack is just mainly filler around these standouts.

Bob's a true talent. He's got the chops on guitar as well as voice. And quite the wordsmith a la Elvis Costello, Mike Doughty or Steve Earle. AND he can rap as well! A very well rounded, seasoned artist without the MTV crap that goes along with it, thank God! This CD is quite an accomplishment, with not a bad song in the bunch. My faves are Bullet, Big Blue Sea, Jingy, Round & Round, the amazing Under My Skin..Hell, the whole thing!! See this guy live as well to get what the big deal is about. His band kicks a** as well.

He's 27, I'm 46 and my daughter's 21. We ALL love it. I am ordering another copy for my daughter. I've loaned it to people and haven't found anyone who doesn't love it.

A little roots rock, a good dose of blues, some funk and soul, a singer-songwriter bent... Think G. Love, Jude and John Wesley Harding... Or just follow the \\"music\\" link on Schneider's web site and spin samples of each song. Listen to the catchy pop of Metal and Steel, the Philly-soul of Big Blue Sea, the grunge rock of Jingy, the funk of Bullets, the atmospheric rock of The World Exploded in Love... you get the idea. This guy does it all, and he does it all well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the correct CD, advertised as the Limited Edition","review":"I already owned \\"Lonelyland\\", but found a used copy online that appeared to be the Limited Edition cd that had the song \\"King of the World\\" on it.

Very, very talented musician/songwriter who hasn't sold out desipte being on the verge of emerging into a pop-culture breakout artist. Will you love EVERY single track on this CD? Maybe, maybe not, but you will not be disappointed. I listen to everything from Massive Attack and Garbage to Robert Earl Keen to SRV to....you name it. Point is that if the \\"eject\\" button broke on my CD player, Lonelyland is the CD that I would want to be listening to. In my years of being a music lover I have come to realize that some people/bands are great musicians and terrible songwriters (Aerosmith ROCKS but not too deep), while others are the opposite (Willie Nelson anyone?). I think Schneider's appeal is that he fulfills both roles in a big way. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"billy Joe Shaver","review":"He was listening to \\"Billy Joe Shaver, Reading James Joyce\\".

This was the first album I listened to of his and I was immediately hooked. My favorite song on the album is Georgia On A Fast Train, but there isn't a bad song on the whole thing. I also recommend reading his (very interesting) biography.

It's full of useful information. The authors are open and accepting of a variety of parenting practices and styles.

It was the only Megazord in the toy section of this size and I thought that it was the one advertised. Wrong. Except I did not find out I was wrong until Christmas day when this hard piece of non-transforming plastic had been ripped out of its box by my very excited 5 year old. He was disappointed to say the least when he discovered that it wouldn't transform. But... he wouldn't let it go back to Toys R Us since there is not a transforming one to replace it!!! He wanted a megazord so badly that he is keeping it to look at it!

This sequel to \\"Texas Angel\\" stands on its own, but to truely grasp the entire story, read \\"Texas Angel\\" first. It is the story of a deeply spiritual quest which is obviously the result of years of prayers by others when Micah, the main character, gives up on himself. It is violent, but the violence shows the depth of despair some must reach to find God. It also shows the contrast of God's love... a love that cannot be accepted by Micah, the main character. Good love story too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but frustrating at times.","review":"There were several places in the book where I would have liked to knock some sense into Micah Sinclair for his stubbornness. His father and stepmother, Benjamin and Elise, are minor characters in the story, whereas a trail guide in \\"Texas Angel,\\" a minor character in that book, is now a Texas Ranger and saves Micah's neck more than once, especially when he is sentenced to be executed as a horse thief.Micah takes several years to finally forgive his father for the past, and to overlook the fact that the lady who loves him (despite her father's misgivings) is half-Mexican. The ending seems rather hurried to me, as though a whole year is suddenly thrown into the last 2 chapters and leaves you wondering, \\"what were these people doing since the the previous chapter?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the 1st!!!!!!!!!","review":"And I thought Texas Angel was Great. I'm guessing by now that I must just be a hopeless romantic, but the Christian faith displayed in these books are very encouraging and I think its great for others to see that God is a forgiving all-knowing, merciful God.

Yes that's right, straight ahead Rock & Roll. This cd is very much a blast from the past and it's a refreshing change from the dribble out their today. One reviewer gave this cd a low score because it's full of bitterness and lacks love. Give me a break Please!!!!!!!. Go drink some red wine and then go outside and hug a tree, you'll feel better after that. Love has no place in Rock & Roll, ballads maybe but not Rock & Roll. This cd rocks and it's a treat to hear some old fashioned in your face rock again. All the tunes are good, however it'll take a few listens to truly appreciate them. The Christmas song at the end of the cd is a nice touch and I certainly understand it's meaning being of the Christian faith myself and so on.

I can't believe how boring GO is, the playing lacks spark and the songs simply aren't good or memorable. The arrangements are typical modern smoke and mirrors studio work and Pat just don't sound like she's having fun! When the disc ended I knew I wouldn't be in a hurry to play it again any time soon.Conversely, Deep Purple's Bananas is everything GO isn't. Great songs, unbelievable performances and the band sound like they are having FUN! Plus, the running order of the album is just outstanding. I've played Bananas 10 times as much as Pat's latest.It's safe to say this is not Pat's finest hour, but it might be Deep Purple's.GO: 2 starsBANANAS: 5 stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Benatar Returns!","review":"This cd has it all. For those who like the hard rocking Pat, she still rocks hard, the title track Go and I Won't are both perfect examples of that. She also does ballads and mid tempo songs. Highlights include Sorry and In My Dreams. For those who are expecting or even wanting a rehash of her earlier work, you won't find it here. A good artist continues to grow and evolve artistically otherwise they grow stale. Pat and hubby Neil continue to grow with each release.Pat sounds as incredibly pristine and powerful as ever. Pat and Neil both prove that you don't have to stir up controversy or use profanity to make good records, you can in fact do it on talent alone and very catchy melodies that I found myself humming throughout the day.

The 6 year wait since her last studio album has been well worth the wait. 11 new songs and, as a hidden bonus, \\"Christmas In America\\" unlisted as track #15 (3 quickee blanks in between 11 and 15). A nice mix of mid-tempo numbers (ala \\"Innamorata\\"), a couple of softer \\"ballad-y\\" songs, and some rockers with nice crunchy guitar riffs. And as usual, her voice is in top-notch form.Some of these songs will be familiar to anyone who's seen Pat on tour over the past couple of summers. \\"I Won't\\", \\"Girl\\" and \\"Out Of The Ruins\\" have been part of those shows and they sound even better here. I think my favorite song at the moment is the title track. It's got a great metal feel to it (especially the guitars) and Mrs Giraldo's vocals are slinging more attitude than they have since \\"You Better Run\\". Way cool.The only downside? Some scary makeup artistry in the cover art. I'll deal.Highly recommended, well worth the money for any fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected....","review":"Very good cd!!!

I love part of the lyrics to HAVE IT ALL... \\"You think you're the second coming, Sorry to say it doesn't do it for me.\\" Ha ha sounds like some people I know! While it is about half hard rockin' and half ballads, there is NOT a bad song on this entire album.

Bonynge's tempi are sluggish and his inclusion of the Paris ballet music exposes the listener to one of Verdi's most atrocious pieces of music - no wonder no other conductor included it. Sutherland, while still in her estimable prime, here sounds hooty and tired. Pavarotti sounds workaday - his adoption of heavy roles like Manrico was beginning to wear away at his voice. Marilyn Horne is totally miscast as Azucena - a heavy-handed, matronly personification. Ingvar Wixell sings Di Luna's music but little else.There were so many other (bel canto)works in which this trio could have shone but Verdi's masterpiece is not for them. There are many fine recordings of this work which demonstrate how gripping and lyrical this piece is.

I did see the David Lynch movie and the Sci-Fi channel miniseries. I actually liked Lynch's Dune much better, so I wasn't expecting much from Children of Dune. However, I found this new miniseries to be so incredibly captivating! The acting on the part of Alia and the twins were incredible! I could actually feel the strife that the family was going through. The CG effects were definitely above average for a made-for-TV movie and the film's score was breathtaking. The movie moves at a decent pace, just slow enough to unravel the intricate plot but fast enough that you don't get bored. That was a problem with the Dune miniseries.I would recommend this to anyone who has seen the original Dune. This film is truly epic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frank Herbert's Children of Dune (TV Miniseries)","review":"I was thrilled to dee this come out, and glad that SciFi stuck pretty uch too the book in making this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have movie - it would have been great in the theatre","review":"I have never read the books, but this movie made me want to read them, and that shows how good this movie is.It had great actors/actresses, and the characters were very, very well-played. Unlike the original Dune movie by David Lynch, the story-line is easy to follow even for people who have never watched the Dune movies or read the books.One more big positive was the music and soundtrack during the movie...the music carried the mood quite well. Had the same tones similar to LOTR (looking forward to getting the music during the birth scene)Too bad it can't be put in the big screen. With just a little more money spent on specialFX and on sets, etc.., this would have done well.I highly recommend this movie, and I look forward to watching SciFi's previous movie \\"DUNE\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Like the Book :D","review":"I read the books first and really enjoyed those - this version of Children of Dune does a very good job of following the book and the acting is also very good. I enjoy the lead performances especially \\"Leto\\" (played by James McAvoy), \\"Idaho\\" (Edward Atterton), and \\"Lady Jessica\\" (played by Alice Krige). This film ties in nicely with its prequel \\"Dune\\" mini series where we first meet House Attreides, Corrino, The Fremen, and the other warring houses. The first Dune movie which is much older does not tie in the same but if you want background included from other books it might be a good idea to check this out as well before seeing this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the book","review":"I bought this DVD recently, after a 20-year lapse since I last read the Dune books. With only a vague memory of what was supposed to be going on, the movie was pretty much incomprehensible.What was the reason for Leto II transforming himself into a sandworm? I don't remember, and the movie didn't explain. Somehow, this was supposed to be the next evolutionary step, or some such thing, but why? And why did Leto seem so confident and at peace with his decision, when later we find out that he sobbed in his sister's lap and asked her to help him die?A lot of the acting is truly dreadful, and seems more appropriate to a stage play than a movie. Many of the costumes look like they came from old the original Star Trek series. And many of the sets were obviously just that ... sets with painted backgrounds.As with the other adaptations of Dune books, too much had to be left out in the interest of time, and if you aren't very familiar with the story, you can easily be left scratching your head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dune: Save your coins, buy another DVD","review":"I'm a Herbert \\"Dune\\" series fan. If you haven't read the novels the mini-series is based on don't even attempt to follow the story line, it won't make sense. It was hard for this fan to follow. The mini-series is very much a soap opera and not the intricate story the book is. But to give the devil his due, the films SFX's are great, costuming, etc. is also good. I'm not sure Dune can be successfully made into a movie because so much takes place in people's heads. So I suggest use the money and buy the books if you've not read them.

I found the series irresistible once I got over having to link the original Dune (the Lynch movie) characters to their transformations in Children of Dune (ignoring the first Dune mini-series altogether).Of course, there's items we can pick on in terms of plot details but I'm choosing to commend the director for allowing the actors to act rather than spending too much time on emotionless special effects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inexplicably high rating","review":"Laughable costumes, god-awful acting (even from 'the names'), terrible special effects.

I felt a real sense of things coming one full circle after watching Children of Dune.

Its an interesting take on the book except that most of the main characters are not allowed to develop. indeed at times the 6 hours devoted to the two books seems as an injustice to the vision created by the book. However to be fair the storywriter managed to make some memorable scene although i felt that they should have expanded on the Prophet and his preachings. Certainly he was such an inportant figure in the book to just give him only two mewanigful scenes.

The sets seemed like cheap studio flats.I will say that \\"children of dune\\" did follow to a great extent the storyline. For this I am grateful. I just wish that the producers of a series would not cut the bugets of sequals in order to make a quick buck off of an existing market.

What is there to not like? Everything about this is fantastic. The customes are extotic and sexy, while the special effects of the worms, eye-popping. The only thing is the digital backgrounds, colors, and digtially created cities are a bit fakey. Leto II has an uncanny resemblence to Alec Newman. The scenes with the baron reappearing are masterfully done. My only complaint (well 2) the tigers are dumb looking and the entire thing is a tiny bit slow. There isn't as much action in these books anyways (hence the slowness of the film). Once more, the sci-fi channel scores a knock-out punch. My only worry is that they try to make the next abyssmal novel. Who wants to see Leto turn into a giant-sandworm?

You get everyting in this, drama, suspense, action and so much more.If you're planning on buying this to get a war miniseries, an all out action miniseries, or even a \\"cool and trippy\\" sci-fi miniseries, this may not be for you.It's so much deeper than that and unfortunately I don't think a lot of people will be able to appreciate it. That being said, if you're in the mood for a good story, I'd recommend this one.I would however behoove you to check out the first miniseries,Frank Herbert's Dune (TV Miniseries) (Director's Cut Special Edition), before watching this one, if only to get a full appreciation and understanding of what's going on."},{"rating":"2","title":"not something to miss","review":"Never read the books.

Not so. My husband was not having that much difficulty putting the item together until he got to the CAM locks that hold the drawers together and they kept breaking as he tightened them. He also pulled out the feet and saw that 1 of the feet was drilled incorrectly so it would not fit into the rest of the piece. It was simply beyond fixing. In addition to that it comes in 3 huge boxes weighing several hundred pounds. Amazon is unable to send correct parts so you must return EVERYTHING. And just a side note Amazon's return process is neither quick nor easy and we are still trying to figure out how to return the thing. Just save your time and money and get something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the price, definitely!","review":"Wow, is this a steal at under $500. It's real wood almost throughout, with very few places of laminate. It's really nice-looking and went together very easily. The drawers are a little shallow, but that comes of it being a \\"slim\\" piece - not too big, for those who have a little space issue in their kitchens. We received ours missing a critical piece at first, contacted customer service, and received the missing pieces right away. I really can't recommend this enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST PURCHASE EVER!","review":"This is the worst purchase I have ever made. Peices were not cut straight and did not fit together like they were supposed to. Some pieces were scuffed or chipped and others were coming apart where they were glued together. The product came covered in dust/dirt and was in 100+ pieces. I would NEVER purchase this item or recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Look Great!","review":"It looks exactly like the picture. I've put together a ton of IKEA stuff and this was similar; just not as easy. It literally took about 3 hours to assemble; and that was 2 people. Some of the screws are pictured being put in from the ground up meaning that you have to turn the item over to put the screw in the hole which requires an additional person trying to hold the parts together while you turn it over. There was some damage to one of the pieces; it is pressed wood on everything except the counter top. Luckily the damage went against the wall for me. Everything works well. I would reccomend to others but if you don't have much practice at putting furniture together, it will take you a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"This is a very solid, sturdy piece of furniture, and real wood. You WILL need 2 people to assemble this and you will want a power screwdriver. The finish is perfect and looks like a much more expensive piece of furniture. All the pieces are extremely well labeled - no wondering which screws are for what. This was the best home assembled piece I have ever seen as far as labeling. The furniture itself was easy to put together, it's just HEAVY.It came with mounts to secure to the wall but, even with little ones in the house, it's not needed. That thing is not going anywhere. It's so heavy it would take a LOT to make it tip.I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars for a minor issue with the hutch - the door hinge on one side was a bit off and the magnets stick so bad it's hard to open and close. Also the drawers and cabinets are a bit smaller than I expected. It did fit my china setting for 8 plus serving pieces though.I would recommend this - it really does look terrific!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful addition to our dining room!","review":"This Hutch arrived on time. It is a beautiful addition to our dining room. The directions were easy enough to follow. It took my husband and myself one evening to assemble. The hardware was marked very well! There was never a question on which peices we needed to use next.My only criticism for this Hutch is that the drawers are misleading, they are very small and do not pull out all of the way. They do not extend into the buffet so I feel there is some wasted space. The drawers also are tight when pulling them open, I assume this will change with time.I really enjoy how this Hutch fits in our space. We do not have a very large dining room but we still had a need for a Hutch. This one works quite well. Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like it a lot","review":"We bought this buffet cabinet two years ago from Amazon and really like it. It looks fantastic in our dining area and is great for storing our wine glasses in the glass door portion. Makes for great storage for some of our serving pieces in the doors at the bottom. My main complaint is that the drawers are very small and not useful for much. Also, be aware that you will likely have to attach the unit to the wall to keep it from tipping over (especially if you have young children, like we do). It does come with the attachments. Overall, the quality is good and it looks great and we are glad we bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice cabinet","review":"I was initially worried about ordering a piece of furniture at this price through the mail, but my fears were quickly allayed through a very quick delivery, good quality parts, and clear instructions. My only negative comment is that a couple of the pieces had minor damage, but luckily they're not visible. All in all, it's a very nice cabinet and a nice center piece to our dining room. I would most definitely purchase this product again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Piece!","review":"This is a beautiful piece. I had one damaged piece and it was replaced with no hassle.

Not really.","review":"As noted in all earlier reviews, this shoe runs quite narrow. I ordered a half a size up from my usual and it fit wonderfully EXCEPT for the narrowness, not of the toebox, but of the opening for the bottom of the shoe. And while this is an annoyance, it's nothing that a few hours with a shoe stretcher won't fix. Other than that, the shoe is lovely. The footbed is unbelievably thick and cushy and the t-strap is classy and adorable. The wedge heel looks higher than it is due to the platform sole, for comfort and style. All in all a very good work style shoe for the woman who wants a retro touch."},{"rating":"1","title":"So sad!","review":"These shoes hurt my feet. I can't even wear them.

William Shatner hams it up as he always does, but this is a good performance. Captain Werz, the evil commandant is nobly portrayed as saying that he did not have the supplies to feed the (starving) prisoners and kicks the blame up to his superior officer, Gen. Wilder. Having seen the \\"Andersonville\\" (Ted Turner)movie and read about this I know that this court had been rigged against Werz and he was headed for the gallows anyway-but he had his share of the blame by personally abusing and striking prisoners. I highly recommend this as a companion to those that enjoyed the \\"Andersonville\\" film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Play, Terrible DVD","review":"I remembered this play from when it was first on PBS and eagerly bought the DVD. Some of the actors give great performances. Richard Basehart is outstanding. Jack Cassidy shows he can excell in a drama. Cameron Mitchell, in a supporting role, gives a performance of a lifetime.

Treble Charger used to be good","review":"Wide Awake Bored is a monumental disappointment. With it, Treble Charger, a band that used to create great sounding and catchy Canadian alternative with a hint of pop-rock, has totally de-evolved further into the world of pop punk or straight out pop, even going so far as to play up their friendship with Sum-41 (aka the Antichrists). While the music remains catchy due to the raw talent of the band, the lyrics and overall musical depth are nothing. Perhaps the biggest mistake was by establishing Greg Nori as the \\"true\\" lead singer when Bill Priddle is far more talented. Perhaps they just wanted to go mainstream, and they've certainly established that.Check out \\"Self = Title\\" or \\"Maybe It's Me\\" if you want to see Treble Charger when they did something with the talent they posessed. I am not one that uses the word \\"sellout\\", but this album fits the description more than any other I have heard."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointment","review":"This book is almost totally useless unless you only want to create small-scale simple MFC applications in Visual C++.

It says it is a complete guide to windows 98, etc. but it doesn't handle any true win32, just mfc. I think if they renamed it the Visual C++ MFC Bible, i could take it more seriously.

While Tim Green potentially had an interesting perspective, the book fell flat. The 1-3 page chapters read as though they were dashed off in a few minutes and are as vapid as tabloid press. Why do bad teams remain bad? The owners, of course. Do NFL players take drugs? Some do (or did) but Tim Green didn't, of course. Is Deion Sanders as much of a jerk as he appears? Maybe yes, maybe no, depends on how you look at it. Is training camp awful? Oh yes, it's horrible, awful, they make you run around on a field in the heat, and oh by the way you get paid a million dollars or so for it. About halfway through the book I just started flipping through pages looking for something interesting, and finally put it down. Not worth even the $9 Kindle edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and eye-opening","review":"A very good, behind-the-scenes look at the NFL from a player's perspective. It may not give everyone the \\"dirt\\" on specific players that they might want, but it does give the reader a unique view of the NFL from the player's perspective. I learned a lot by reading it and was fascinated to know what it's like for an NFL recruit/rookie.If you are an NFL fan, it's worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read, Engrossing Inside Look At The NFL","review":"In his book, The Dark Side of The Game, Tim Green disproves the stereotype that all NFL jocks are as dumb as a stump. Green's book is engrossing, I just could not put it down. Each chapter is short (2 to 3 pages), covering a different topic in the life of an NFL player, including topics such as training camp, sleeping during team meetings, playing with pain, drug usage, and an insight to players from the perspective of a player.Green, player turned broadcaster, has seen the game from both sides of the field, and understands (and explains) why players hate the media and vise versa.This is not your typical \\"My Story\\" as told by a former player to a writer. Rather, this is an excellent book giving a rare and fair look at the inside of the NFL. Any fan of the game of football should love this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drops few names, vague, not well written","review":"I was disappointed by this long, winding, dull account of life in the NFL. Tim Green, who keeps telling us how smart he is, rarely gives us the scoop. He'll say, \\"Someone I knew did this once.\\" On groupies, he tells us that NFL players stay away from them, and can't get girls -- yeah, right. In a book about the dark side of the game, he fails to address the type of violence demonstrated recently in the Rae Carruth, Ray Lewis, and Fred Lane situations, nor does he explore the NFL's drug culture -- Bam Morris, Andre Rison -- nor does he get into the real problems with college football and how so many players with college educations can be so dumb. I was hoping for something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"there's no meat in here","review":"This book would be great if Tim Green actually named a few names aside from the guys he's talking up (see Dion, Steve Young).Instead it's a continuous cycle of 'a player I once played with/against' did some unthinkable act. The end result is that no one cares what Green has to say because he never takes any risks and the reader becomes bored quickly.Quick tip: Read Lawrence Taylor's second autobiography for the real inside scoop on life in the NFL. LT holds nothing back, especially on himself. Now THAT's a book I couldn't put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Lightweight Side of the Game","review":"Though it professes to be a frank tell-all expose of the NFL, Tim Green's \\"Dark Side of the Game\\" is nothing of the sort. Green is a third-tier broadcast analyst for NFL games on television and he is clearly still far too indebted to the league to be truly critical of it. Every time you thinks he's strating to get to the good stuff, he pulls his punch and lets the league off the hook. The result is a wishy-washy mish-mash of some gossipy dirty laundry being aired without any information truly damaging to the league's powers that be. And might I add this; as a writer, Green is a lightweight. Rarely in this book does his prose rise above the level of the barely compotent."},{"rating":"2","title":"very insightful","review":"this book takes you on the field.it deals with race,sex,drugs,politics&money.time green does a great job of pointing out the different things that go on off&on the field.i dug the dion sanders chapter.Dion is so underrated he can play two sports real well and offense&defense.michael jordan wished he was as talented as Dion.but that's another debate and topic.this book points out the separation of races and the lack of hiring Black coaches.the drugs to enhance play.like Al Davis says just win baby just win.the money cap and how free agency has changed the game.this book makes sense after this weird and clone style season.very insightful."},{"rating":"1","title":"The biggest waste of [$$$] ever","review":"Want to know about a players life in the NFL? I'm talking about the real lowdown, all the dirt, the stuff you don't see on TV. So do I. Unfortunately, it's not in this book. This book would be just as interesting if all the pages were blank. It doesn't really tell you anything, not to mention it reads like a junior high book report. You'll get so bored of it, you probably won't finish. I left a few chapters unread, only after I forced myself to keep reading for a month (yeah, it took that long because this book is real easy to put down). It just ... . It doesn't draw you in...ever. Maybe if this was written by Emmitt, or someone who has actually accomplished something, it would be a little better.

His autobiography of what he went through, saw, and felt in the National Football League is eye-opening.Most of the information in here is a well known fact, or has been thought to happen by many hard core fans and players. Mr. Green's confirmation of these facts make it all the more chilling.Some of the stories in here are quite amazing. One part of the book describes how players escaped the detection of steroid abuse.This novel is the most important, and best football book in my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising and eye-opening, a fine overview","review":"I had hoped that Tim Green would've addressed some of the really dark topics of the game such as organized crime influence, throwing games, etc. But the subjects he hits on were very informative and give some good insight as to what it's like to play football in the NFL. He paints a good picture of all the ups and downs of playing and gives fair warnings to all young players fortunate to rise to the pro level. Alot of his opinions are colorful and relevant and the book is very readable with many short chapters each packed with unique information. This is a must read for anyone who loves the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I thought that a book entitled \\"The Dark Side of the Game\\" would present a no-holds-barred look at the underside of the NFL.

If you're looking for something more than light reading, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very fast read","review":"I give this book a positive review but at least one criticism is well founded; the chapters are very short.

This book cried out that it was written by a non-Jew, which is not to say that a Gentile couldn't write well about this subject, just that this one didn't write well on the subject. I was further dismayed by the obvious resemblence of the Fictional Rabbi to the one Rabbi who in real life has spoken out about this issue.

Why would you?","review":"In 1985, Marv Wolfman and George Perez took on the incredible challenge of bringing all the alternate universes in the DC world and converting them into one uniformed world. While I didn't think it was necessary, it was an excellent read. I regretted the deaths of Supergirl, Flash, and others, but I felt they did a nice job.One of the highlights of the story was the 'final' fate of the Golden Age Superman and Lois Lane. They, along with Alexander Luthor and Superboy Prime had made enormous sacrifices to save lives and were rewarded with an eternity of peace and happiness.Then, here come Geoff Johns who decides that these four heroes need to be destroyed. Johns rarely thinks about the character or the fan when he writes a story. He writes from the 'wouldn't it be cool' mentality.If you enjoyed 'Crisis on Infinite Earths' from 1985, stay far, far away from this abomination. While COIE brought heartfelt tears, IC brings nothing but tears of regret."},{"rating":"1","title":"Infinite Crisis a disappointment","review":"As a young teenager, Crisis on Infinite Earths made a big impression on me. I was a big Wolfman-Perez fan from the New Teen Titans, and was amazed with the effort that went into the Crisis storyline. So I was naturally curious about the Infinite Crisis product. Though I'd always wondered what ever became of Alex Luthor-Lois Lane-Superman-Superboy Prime at the end of Crisis, I quickly realized that Infinite Crisis was a serious mistake and those four characters should have been left alone. The corruption of Superboy Prime and Alex Luthor was not believeable, nor was the duping of the Earth 2 Superman (The Greatest DC Universe hero of all time!) obviously forced in order to make the Infinite Crisis storyline go. So I cannot recommend this weak book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Better Crisis Than the Original","review":"I found this to be much more enjoyable than the original Crisis. The story was muddled, the dialog was bad, and at times it just didn't make any logical sense. But this for me was enjoyable through out. Infinite Earths tried to cram every character they could into the story often slowing down the narrative and confusing things. Where in Infinity Crisis it felt like they were able to work in a lot of characters, but I never felt it was getting away from the plot. I also felt like there was more tension. Though the threat was just as credible in Infinite Earths if not more so. It never felt like it was as big of a threat. There were some good battles. I like the art work as well. I think it's something a lot of comic book fans would enjoy, but I guess it's not everyone's cup of tea."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ongoing Adventure of Crisis!","review":"Great continuing story of the Crisis. This explains the origins of Superboy prime and more regarding the merging of DC storylines into one continuous storyline. Even better than Crisis on Infinite Earths."},{"rating":"2","title":"Infinite Crisis'","review":"Geoff Johns writes with a certain action-driven lore that keeps this book a page-turner. While this book may not have been as convoluted as Crisis on Infinite Earths, it does still seem to have a lot going on all at once. But it never seemed to be too much(as was the case with the latter) even for me, a half-ass comic enthusiast. All things being equal, it was an excellent read(Superboy surprised me on several occasions) and well worth the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too busy","review":"Infinite Crisis covers a lot of events that are important to the DC storyline, but the Graphic Novel itself it's too busy and often hard to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Artisically beautiful with an overwhelming plot!","review":"I don't know if I'm the ideal reader for this massive amount of DC Universe history but I dove right in. First off, the art was fantastic. Most was done by Phil Jimenez and its beautiful. The plot was a little confusing at times for me but after I caught on I was really enjoying it. Nothing says \\"event\\" comic like ramifications, and this series has them in spades. Overall, a well crafted series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I'm a big fan of the Golden Age characters. If you enjoy these original heroes, and their continuing stories, you might not enjoy the last few surviving characters acting without good judgment. I'm one of the people that think the outcome of Crisis was poor. The multiverse was not so messy that we have to lose all our golden age characters. Earth 2 was a place where it was okay for heroes to age, retire, and train the next generation of heroes.This book gives us northing original, it's boring, and abuses good characters to no good end. It uses the time tested gimmicks of having a \\"Hero Go Bad\\", \\"Bringing back characters that seemed forgotten\\", \\"involving everyone\\", \\"Wonder Woman kills someone(gasp...yawn)\\", and so on.Been there, done that, have the bumper sticker, T-Shirt, coffee mug, snap shots, and the key chain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Infinite Boredom....","review":"Unless you read DC comics religiously, you will not enjoy this book. One of the main complaints I hear from people that try to read these massive DC events is that they are inaccessible to regular people. Nothing in this book will make sense to you unless you know about 30+ years of DC comic history. If you excuse the lazy writing, the art is pretty good. The only other problem is that you won't care about any of the characters in the book because you wont know a thing about them....Except maybe the 3 different versions Superman. You did know there were 3 of them right?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, soothing music- this is the one to buy!","review":"My son LOVES this CD- we've played it to him every night since he was in the womb and it always soothes him when he's fussy.

Quicken's 3 year sunset mode is a crime. I trialed MD 2011 and was disappointed immediately at the interface. Guess I've been brainwashed by Quicken's ease of use. I do simple finance which even Quicken Starter can handle. I'm sure MD can out-pace Quicken on many levels but not for a simple user. MD did not download my correct (verified) checking acct. balance. It was way off, but tweakable. Online bill pay was a less flexible and was too basic even for me. Decided not to explore MD further and re-upped on Quicken.

So I tried Moneydance. It is nothing special. Menus are not logical. The layout so not friendly. You have to click on the top to use something at the bottom. The fonts are too small. The pulldown menus open with the least used choices first. Setting up printing requires manual testing instead of using the most common format.

On first glance, it seemed speedy and feature-rich. Then I clicked an unlabeled button to see what it did, and... it deleted a whole account without any warning or confirmation, and without undo! Ouch. That is too dangerous for my taste.On a smaller note, it was also easy to make Moneydance display incorrectly sized pie charts: just resize the window. The chart gets big when you enlarge the window, then stays big after you reduce the window again. That shouldn't happen.This review is based on 10 minutes of checking out the program. It might be great but the deletion event made me nervous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip off- monthly bank charge to use","review":"I am so disappointed and shocked to learn after purchasing this product that I would have to pay an additional $10/month to have it connect to my bank account!

Everything came over flawlessly. I've been looking for a cross-platform alternative to Quicken for a while now and have tried many of them, but none come close to this one.

This is our 2nd one (hard water stained the 1st one after a few years) My recommendation, do not toss it in the washer with bleach, rather spray it with Clorox Cleanup, rinse and dry over the shower rod. Worked great. Only complaint is that if you do not want to use a liner, you need to magnetically hang it to the opposite side of the tub to dry. This worked great with my first curtain, not so much with the 2nd, the magnets do not seem as strong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Mildew Resistant","review":"If buying this shower curtain, I would definitely use it with a liner.

If Blueprint 2.1 came out first I would have given it 5 stars, but this is simply a repeat of B2. I was hoping the tracks would be remixes or something other than a repeat of B2. If you own a copy of B2, it makes absolutly no sence to buy this album, because you already have these songs except for the 2 bonus/ hidden tracks.

All of these songs can be found on Blueprint 2 except for two bonus tracks. The bonus tracks are hot, but there's no need to buy this album unless you don't own Blueprint 2. This album is basically a 'Blueprint 2 Greatest Hits' collection. At least he put 'A Dream' on here. I really love that song. Definitly one of Hov's best tracks since Reasonable Doubt dropped.

They are probably Bob Eberly and Helen O'Connell, who sang many duets with Jimmy Dorsey's orchestra, but if you are looking for an album that shows Jimmy's expertise on the clarinet and tenor sax to advantage, look elsewhere. On the other hand if you would like an album of duets by a great pair of singers of the 40's and 50's, this may be exactly what you are looking for.I am disappointed with the liner notes, or rather I should say the absence of them, since they don't credit the individual personnel on any of the cuts.

It also talks about following directions, how Noah did what God said, even though he was made fun of and people laughed at him. My children didn't enjoy it as much as most of the older Veggies, but they did watch it. There may have been a few too many funny adult comments(they were asking me why I was laughing). They didn't want to turn it off, but they weren't as thrilled with it, and I'm glad we just watched it on Prime instead of buying the DVD.

I'm sorry to say that it took too many short cuts and took out a lot of the underlining themes that made the comic books such a hit.As you know by this is this your typical Gladiator/Spartacus Hulk storyline where the Hulk finds himself a slave and must fight his way to freedom. Again a good theme but the execution of it was as if they were spiriting for the finish line and cut corners to do so.There were many inconsistencies such as: Hulk thinking as a Grey Hulk, Hulk using full sentences one moment then sounding like the green Hulk the next, or even how Hulk is bound to slavery with a disk which is so easily destroy in the ending scenes.I would equate this to DC's Superman: Brainiac Attacks. Marvel has done relatively well with the last couple of movies it would be nice if they tried to put some continuity into their movies but that's wishful thinking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hulk is Banished............","review":"After the somewhat lackluster, but still equally enjoyable Hulk Vs. films it was time to bring The Hulk to the next level. This features a story based off of the Planet Hulk arc from the comics which was a really good story arc. Possibly one of the best within the last few years. The animation was pretty good. As much as I like the comic book I couldn't help to be a bit snarky at some of the changes they had to make. I won't mention it as to avoid spoiling anything, but it wasn't enough that it spoiled the entire movie.

There was, to my mind, no reason to change and eliminate plot points for the sake of the films pacing, it feels too short and cobbled together.

Wonder Woman, Green Lantern,Batman: Under the Red Hood, and All Star Superman) and Marvel (The Avengers:The Earths Mightiest Heroes) have made this movie obsolete, almost painfulto watch. The animation is choppy, the character designs are too simple andrepetitive, the story is dull and predictable. Most of the characters aretired cliches (eg. the weak, sniveling, cowardly character who manages to \\"find his courage\\"by story's end; the tough-as-nails-female fighter with the heart of gold and the troubled past).This isnt even the most appealing incarnation of the Hulk himself -- he's kind of a cross betweena brooding, introspective, birkenstock-wearing philosophy professor at Hofstra University,and a frontal lobe-deprived MMA fighter.

Planet Hulk is a solid Hulk story with plenty of action and a touch of intrigue. I gave it 4/5 stars since quite a bit of defanging was done to the original story.

Eventually, Hulk ends up leading a ragtag group of gladiators, fighting to overthrow the planet's evil Red King.The movie races along like a runaway freight train, with plenty of SMASH and several very surprising emotional beats. Two of those beats were spectacularly dark; things that fit the story, but I honestly can't believe they went for...The movie stands on its own. But I hope this DVD does well, because I'd love to see a sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocrity as an art form","review":"Greg Pak wrote what is arguably one of the best story-lines in the history of the Incredible Hulk. It's kind of like Conan meets John Carter from Mars, with the Hulk as the main character. It sounds like it wouldn't work, but it does. This animated movie managed to turn a fantastic storyline into a dumbed-down, choppy, poorly voice-acted version of a much better comic book. I honestly think the Ultimate Avengers movies were better. The best part of this was the cover artwork by Alex Ross. My suggestion? Watch it if it's on TV or something, but don't shell out the money. I regret paying for this DVD. I really, really do."},{"rating":"1","title":"wtf were they thinking","review":"ok, lets say you never read the comic and have no clue as to this story line... then, and only then would this movie be good... otherwise WTF were they thinking?!?!?!?! it butchers a beautiful storyline and turns it into a shot story piece of crap... they loose so much depth as to who the charaters are, and who the hulk and and what he becomes. theres so much lost imagination put into the comic book in this movie it feels like a cliffnotes version. this movie should have been done in 2 or 3 movies and every line, scene, part of the comic should have been included... wtf were they thinking?!?!?!?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Digital Copy?","review":"I bought the Blu-Ray version of Planet Hulk with the added Digital Copy.

His most visible tenure recently was with the outstanding Charlie Haden-led ensemble \\"Quartet West\\". Now Ernie steps out on his own after a long time with a strong modern recording. If you had to describe Ernie it would be the big bodied tone of Dexter Gordon, with that flare for making strong declarative musical statement mixed with the lyrical modern sensibilities of John Coltrane.He runs the gamut on this recording. From modern bost-bop to a wild romp aggressive romp on \\"Angel's Flight\\".When Ernie plays a ballad it's memorable. He can improvise both souffully and still explore the intracies, never at the sacrifice of the song though. \\"You Leave Me Breathless\\" is a fine example of this.This recording is a good example of a player well steeped in the tradition but looking forward after all these years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short changed","review":"Excellent album, great songs, beautiful bluegrass voice and some really fine backing muscicians, so why am I left unsatisfied?

People about him start to die and the plot thickens.Anyway I waited and waited for the revelation but it didn't come. What happened was 174 pages of tripe. I waited for the humour, the paranoia that drips from each page but it never happened.This is one of a series, about number seven I believe and perhaps if I had been along from the beginning I might have got this but I don't think so.The feeling I got was that it was written to fulfill a contractual obligation because otherwise it is a waste of trees.If I read another one of this series it will be because it was a gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment","review":"i have read all the previous Aurelio Zen novels and found them well written with interesting plots that always contained at least a few clever twists. I was looking forward to this latest in the series, but I regret to say that I found it a great disappointment. There is a world of difference between a plot with twists and the wholesale substitution of improbable coincidences and bizarre characters for a plot. In the course of reading the book, I was tempted to put it down for good a half dozen times, but persevered because of my high opinion of the earlier books. I kept on hoping that somehow Dibdin would redeem himself, but the absurd coincidences and characters persisted until the end.

At times you understand the confusion surrounding any battle and other times you feel proud that folks just like you and me could acquit themselves so well in face of horrendous circumstances. You do not see the blood and guts but you know that it was there and awful.The bird may as well have been any other animal, but for some reason, the aura of the bird and, maybe, the name, created a situation that made Old Abe into a symbol of the war effort.

I know it's over used, but it really does. I compared to lab prints and you can only tell the different under magnifying glass. The main difference is that this paper helps reproduce colors accurately.

The lyrics are as deep and introspective as I expected, but the music was lacking. I applaud the guys for trying hard NOT to sound like dctalk, but their efforts came up a little short. Tait is the highlight of the cd, but the songs sounded like grammatrain+michael tait; decent, but unoriginal. KMax's songs were done in a techno-dance-over-the-top-artistic fashion that was almost insulting. Toby gave an AWESOME effort in \\"Extreme Days\\", but the attempt to old-school rap over a turntable and a loop were...well...white.

It is so refreshing to hear the individual efforts and ideas of these talented individuals. From \\"Solo\\" we can now ascertain who brings what to the table. With \\"Alibi\\" it is obvious Michael Tait contributes the harder, all-out, in your face facet. \\"Return of the Singer\\" from Kevin Max demonstrates the multi-layered, rhythmic groove. Finally, Toby McKeehan is clearly the \\"beat\\" and \\"rap\\" of DC Talk.

When it did I got it on my 14th birthday. I thought is was really good and the interesting thing is that this cd is a special edition of them each singing their own songs that will be on their own cds that are coming out. #2 and 3 are sung by Mike Tait and his music is more rock type, the next two songs are sung by Kevin Max(the one with the cool voice) and his music is more like alternative rock and the last two songs are sung by Toby Mac(Mckeehan) which is more like hip hop. But all together this cd itself is really good. All the songs are great. My Favorite song is Return of the Singer because the tune is good and plus because of Kevin's cool voice. Keep a look out for their seperate albums. Mike Tait's cd, Empty, is out. Get this cd though. You don't know what you are missing."},{"rating":"2","title":"DC TALK has won my support.... again","review":"Well I really wasn't expecting much when I bought this cd... I just had to buy it because I'm a big DC TALK fan. However, I love 6 of the 7 songs, which is a very decent percentage of the CD.

It simply fails in the approach to trying to put it all together. Some useful info [] - some not so colorful (black and white) pictures in the book - why would a teacher want this? - it isn't written for kids for sure.Some of the printing quality was lacking.

I really enjoyed this movie it really makes you think about what would God say to you if you and a few other people were alone in a diner one stormy night, what would he say to you? This movie is also about God's love and how he forgives us if we forgive and believe in Him. God who was played by Bruce Marchiano, showed one person in this film that he was not going to try to force His will on one of the characters if they did not want to believe in Him. This film is a great witnessing tool and I never get tired of seeing this movie.

There were times when the characters said something that was almost verbatim how I've expressed a particular sentiment or belief previously. I almost got the sense that God was confirming with me that the way I believed in certain areas was accurate, which really caused me to reflect on the issues being discussed and Jesus' responses to the diner guests comments.

All I want is a jump drive that I can stick into a USB port and use, thats it. Without getting technical, this item has extra software loaded on it so that it requires TWO open drives on your computer to be fully functional (i.e. I needed an F: drive and a G: drive in order to use this on my home computer) When I tried to use this at work it failed because most of the drives on my work computer are in use. Consequently I was unable to use this item without totally reassigning my drive mappings which is a pain to do. Therefore, I have an old PNY 1 GB that I use now because it is hassle free and plug and play. No pre-loaded software, no extra drives, no problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate the continious flashing (\\"breathing\\") light effect!!!","review":"I have used Sandisk usb devices and think that they are great. I like the retractable plug and the sleek design. I have several usb's that are a year old that the light stays on unless transferring data, the new one's apparently (according to sandisk)all \\"breath\\" when idle. I personally cannot stand the new \\"breathing\\" light effect. I find it to be distracting while pluged into my laptop especially in darker rooms. There is no way to stop this \\"breathing\\" and according to an e-mail from Sandisk they are quite happy with their new design change. I returned the one I just bought and will be trying Kingston next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"U3 is terrible","review":"Can't stand the U3 stuff; why do manufacturers keep wanting to shove software down our throats? The U3 stuff causes a delay in loading and it's an awkward interface for software that you don't really want/need anyway. The Kingston 4 GB USB drive is selling on amazon for $17 right now, so that's a better deal. If SanDisk offered this same product without U3, it would probably deserve a 4- or 5-star rating. U3 is really useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great drive, great price (get rid of the U3 software)","review":"The drive is fast. No problems, and the price is great.The U3 software, though, is a complete waste of time and a real hassle. Most people just want a flash drive to use on multiple machines, including computers that are not personally owned or maintained. Having to install the software is a needless hassle (and some XP machines have real problems with it). Just remove the software when you first install the drive. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as advertised.","review":"This is a U3 Flash Drive. This is important information which was not included in the seller's description. I had to do a Google Search to find a removal tool for unwanted and space wasting U3 software from this drive. The construction is flimsy, being very poor quality plastic. The slider is also not well constructed. I was afraid the drive would break every time I plugged it in or pulled it our. Definitely not what I had in mind when I saw the brand name SanDisk. That company can do much better. But as a Gift Certificate buy, these drives are not the worst thing I could have selected.Overall, you can do much better with other models/ brands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good flashdrive","review":"It works really good. Good price for a 4GB flashdrive. I like that the USB connector is retractable so there is no worry of losing a cap and it's small and compact. I didn't like that it didn't come with a lanyard and that it has the U3 software, which is useless for me. The body of the flashdrive is a bit flimsy though."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK product","review":"the flash memory itself seems to be OK, but than again there is no real way of telling in advance, since by definition flash memory is a very reliable product. the main differences between the manufacturers are the outer cover and/software. with this product, the plastic shell fills cheap, and retrospecting, I would have added the additional 7$ or so and get the titanium model. at least there is a 2 year warranty. the U3 software is really nice, and actually upgrades the unit from simple storage level to an almost portable PC. I only wish that there would be a free U3 anti virus. this is a basic tool on this kind of product (helping friends and family recovering their PC and so on). there is a free portable anti virus (clamshell), but it is not U3 compatible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good size on key chain","review":"I wanted a simple USB drive to attach to my key chain.

It works reasonably well (very slow) as a flash drive, once you remove the U3 software. That is, IF you can remove the U3 software. And if you need assistance removing the U3 software, you can call Sandisk Support. IF you get someone who understands the English language, you MIGHT eventually get the U3 software removed. Oh, and if the U3 software is why you bought the drive in the first place, tough luck. Sandisk will not offer you a refund because technically the drive is working, even though the drive causes an error whenever you eject it. Do yourself a favor, there are a lot of alternative flash drives. Don't risk your money on this one. If you do decide to risk your money, good luck if you ever need support from Sandisk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sandisk--Beware their Cust Svc","review":"Bought one of these a couple months back and had some sort of \\"pilot error\\" with the U3 feature.

Suppt. notes which wer not applicable to my issues.Bottom line: I finally tossed the POS and bought back in on a cheapo from another mfgr at $20 which works perfectly. U3 might be useful, but it's useless overhead for most data transfer uses. Plus, there are similar, more stable, and free, USB apps available--if needed.

I carry mine everywhere and I keep all my email on my thumb drive with Thunderbird.The only two things I could possibly complain about would be the fact that even though you can retract the plug it is still exposed to lint and other foreign matter. The other problem I have had is the Sandisk U3 slash logo after a while does not show anymore. Rather than the logo it shows two classic \\"Red X's\\" like it can't find the images on the system portion of the disk to load them.Other than that I am pleased with its operation and I would buy another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"SanDisk 4 GB Cruzer Micro","review":"This a nice little USB drive. It seems fast and mounts quickly in the 3 OSes I've tested it on. (BSD, Linux and Windows) The main feature I like about th e SanDisk cruzers is the sliding USB plug portion. I've always hated losing the endcaps and messing up the plug part of the drive. The case is plastic and solid. It's slightly wider than some other USB drives, and that occasionally causes it not to fit when I'm using more than one USB attachment in side by side USB configurations. I'm also suspect of the strength of the metal pin in the corner. I wonder if the metal pin that is used to connect a string or lanyard to, will break out of the plastic case at some point. I'd really prefer the titanium version, but it is much more expensive. Last, the plug in portion is always open and stuff like lint, dirt and small things can get in there and cause a problem. Now, for a really small, narrow USB drive, try the PNY mini attache. The issue there is that it tops out at 2 GB."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was great when it worked... only 3 months","review":"I was really happy with the performance of my 4 GB unit, with or without the u3, you can get used to it and actually find a use, it's a good idea that needs just a few tweaks.The problem here is that it workded only for 3 months of average use.

The U3 software cannot be uninstalled with a Vista machine. The same offshore SanDisk customer service tells me to uninstall the software on an XP machine. After attempting to get several customer service reps to understand I don't have an XP machine, I am told to take it to a neighbor.

It is extremely annoying when you're using a Mac, as someone pointed out, you can do anything with the U3 on a Mac but you do get the useless CD icon.This morning I read the comments where someone said you can remove the U3 from the SanDisk website so I decided to try it. I carefully followed the prompts only to watch in horror as it deleted the U3 program BUT it also deleted all my files!!! I immediately called SanDisk customer support who told me the only thing they could do was to offer a $150 U3 software that may or may not find my lost files.If I ever find the guys that created the U3 option, especially the removal software I'll give them a real piece of my mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Didn't buy this product, because...","review":"I purchased a PNY 4GB Attache' instead.

The strobe is water resistant, so if you're walking your dog in the rain, or he decides to go for a night swim, water won't damage the strobe. If the strobe gets fully submerged, I recommend taking it apart and letting it air dry, in case any water got into it.Negative: It is large--about the size of a squash ball--so if you have a small dog, this may overwhelm him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice.","review":"The Nazty North compilation gives us a taste of P Family Records' solid roster of Minnesota and Chicago underground artists, to overall good results.The album succeeds nicely in showcasing many different styles - toungue-twisting, club / bounce, hardcore, and meaningful.

This is Oates' obsession, recycled for the ten-thousandth time.What's new to this novel is Oates' ability to cause the reader to abandon moral outrage and identify completely with the main character, Corky Corcoran. He's shady and often crosses over into lewdness that embarrasses the reader. But - why is this? - you start to like him. You give in, not because he deserves your love, but because you want to give it to him. Only Oates could pull it off.I'm an avid reader of the novelist's work, and this book is by far the best. Months after reading that final line of that exhausting novel, I still miss Corky Corcoran in my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"OH! CORKY","review":"This is an excellent novel. Joyce Carol Oates takes everyday people and shows them in their glory and their faults, which makes you feel like you know them. WHAT I LIVED FOR covers a period in the life of Corky Corcoran, local bigwig, city councilman, and man-about-town. The book has a wonderfully vivid prologue which sets the mood for Corky's adult life. Fitted into the story, but not as a main pont, is the questionable death of a former, quasi-girlfriend and the ensuing police investigation. Corky deals with his married lover, his mentally-imbalanced stepdaughter, and his dearest childhood friend, all in an affable manner. The ending is emotional, but the epilogue is excellent, setting everything straight.

One pan already has scratches and I only use it for eggs which inexplilcably seem to be able to penetrate the non-stickability (yes, I only used plastic utensils and a sponge to clean.) Was really expecting more because the name. I let my roommate keep my Analon when I moved. I predict this Farberware set will be tossed, given away or gather dust. Guess I will be buying a new set.

The set I'm replacing had the same # of peices only they are the \\"typical\\" size you receive when you buy a set like this. When I first saw the size of all the peices in this set I was shocked. I didn't compare the sizes of each peice in each set before I ordered the Faberware and I wish I did because I think I'll be sending this set back. What am I going to use a one quart sauce pan for? Or a 7\\" skillet? They only things I can think of is warming a cup of milk in the first and scrambling ONE egg in the latter.The quality seems durable, so I'd only recommend this item if you're looking for peices in a set sized this small."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another timeless classic that even the kids will enjoy!","review":"This is another one of those favorite classic movies of yesteryear. I remember watching this as a child, yet I could only remember that the movie starred Don Knotts doing bird whistles, which I thought was hilarious. I actually found the name of the movie doing searches on Don Knotts movies. I was very pleased when I rewatched this movie to see that it's still fresh and funny. My 11-year-old also really enjoyed the movie and has watched it several more times on his own. This is a great one to own in your classics collection!"},{"rating":"1","title":"save your warranty","review":"I picked this item because I liked the price, the looks, and the brand.

I like the fact that it's extremly bright and has some little rings on it for him to piddle with . I WAS a little disappointed in the fact that it really looks like it would be more for a 1 year old instead of a older toddler. Overall I think it will be right up his alley and he can tote it around with him. I'm not sure how durable it really is as we will not be the ones testing it out. It seems to be made decent."},{"rating":"2","title":"sweet","review":"Gave it as a gift for new grandparents. Colorful.

Unfortunately, the screw holes are not properly drilled, so the screws get stuck about halfway through.When I complained, Lipper kindly sent me another table, which had the same issue.Perhaps the problem can be solved with a drill, which I don't own, but that's more assembly than I expect from premade furniture.The shelf on the first table was slightly off kilter as well, an issue I probably would live with if I could assemble the table."},{"rating":"1","title":"Table is too tall.","review":"The table is too tall for a 3-4 year old. I had to get out my saw and cut the table legs. I had a chair seat with a broken piece. I used wood glue and clamped it overnight to fix it. The chairs are not level. They rock back and forth. This purchase was not worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Looking Child's Table","review":"This is a great looking table. We wanted something in a cherry color and there were not many options. It was relatively easy to put together and it is of good quality. Our only complaint is that it was very tall for our 1 1/2 year old (who was off the charts in height). It is better for preschool age kids who are tall. If you want something for a toddler, I'd be inclined to get a shorter table."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recevied two, both were damaged","review":"I purchased this as a lightening deal over the summer and kept it for Christmas for my daughter. When puttin it together on Christmas Eve, multiple places of the set were damaged (although the box it came in was undamaged); the corner of the table was scrapped and the edges were missing paint. I called Amazone Customer Service, who was VERY helpful, and had a second set shipped out to receive in two days. The second set arrived as scheduled but now this table was damaged as well; pre drilled holes were missing and those that were pre drilled didn't match up with the parts. Called Amazon Customer Service again and again was VERY helpful. We will be sending both of these sets back and purchasing different set all together. I would not recommend Lipper International for any furniture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfect size - not the best quality","review":"Granddaughter loves the table. It is the perfect size for a 4-6 year old and should last until she is at least 10. The first one we received was poor quality with a bad finish. The 2nd one looked better but the finish is already starting to chip after 6 weeks of intermittent use. We will be stripping and refinishing ourselves to get a better quality appearance."},{"rating":"2","title":"great surprise!","review":"We were pleasantly surprised at how nice this little table and chairs were!

Would highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Table/Chair Set","review":"Product quality a disappointment. Flaws in finish require better inspection before shipping, and if incurred in transit, mandate much better packaging. Some work required during assembly to correct holes too small to accept screws.Would not order this product unless you have good tools and can do some repair to finished surfaces."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy Children's Table and Chairs","review":"I love this little table. It is just the right size for my 2 year old and 4 year old grandchildren. It is nicely finished and easy to assemble; and is very sturdy. If the children are working on projects and it's meal time, there are convenient little cubbies under the table to store their projects quickly and clear the table for dinner. After dinner, the projects are easy to retrieve."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing subject matter handled with literary grace","review":"Katherine Martin's Night Riding is reminisent of the work of Toni Morrison with prose that reads like poetry, concise, intense and allusively alive. Listen to this: \\"She stretched her mouth into a smile that didn't get to her eyes.\\" I loved that. Immediately, the reader knows something is profoundly up with Miss Mary Faith Hammond. Her depiction of the relationship between the mother, Ada Ruth and her youngest daughter, Prin, brought me to tears. My only longing was to feel more a part of the actual night riding. I wanted to be right there with Prin, but wasn't. Perhaps the tension of the other characters caught me up in its distress. I can only say the way it is handled at the end was beautiful. I finally put the book down at 2 a.m., content and wishing for a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and yet educational.","review":"this book is can be fun and yet also educatonal for youth.

The book shows the insanity and violence of the entire clan, including their attempts to forcibly seize a radio station, their successful attempt to forcibly seize a newspaper, and the physical and mental abuse they specialized in. Mel Lyman fathered 12 children among 7 women before he reportedly died.

It starts at the very bottom of all math and works it way up. Plenty of practice problems to try on your own too.

This game is a) Highly addictive b) Beautifully rendered c) Intellectually challenging...I could go on forever. I have not found a game that I can truly call my own for a long time, but this game is an inspiration. The funny thing is that it will easily work on my brand new system or my older piece of junk PC. The system requirements are not as bad as some games out there today - so for those PC gamers who are tempted to pick up a console based gaming system, STOP right there...Go pick up a copy of this game (I actually picked up the collectors addition which comes with extra scenarios aand a cool card-game based on the PC game).

I mention this because the writing in this book goes back to my skills around the age of ten. The characters are like little cardboard cutouts with no depth at all, the motivations seem false, the \\"I am a good guy\\" or \\"I am a bad guy\\" inner monologues are ridiculous, and the author commits a serious writing no-no by telling instead of showing.I am all about a good, brainless read, but this one did not keep my attention at all. Usually I can trust reviews, but it seems that the reviews posted here are a little off this time. I feel that I need to warn intelligent readers that this feels more like young adult fiction than anything written to capture the complex minds of adults.

One said it was made of soft italian leather and has beautiful stitching. Not! It is advertised as a leather brief case. I can't say it isn't leather but I can say it doesn't feel like leather, it doesn't have any flexibility, it definitely isn't soft and the stitching looks like relatively cheap white thread that wouldn't hold up for long under the stress of being stuffed with papers. Unfortunately it seems like companies can get away with claiming any material they want if it's been swabbed with that material before it is put on the market. The whole thing may be leather but it has more of a feel of plastic covered cardboard. Obviously, wanting to return it, i didn't dissect it to prove my point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great looking bag!","review":"Great looking bag! Love the color & finish. My 15\\" laptop is a snug fit directly into the bag. Can not use the padded sleeve provided for my laptop (could be useful for smaller laptops).

In addition to papers, I have plenty of room for my planner, wallet and a small makeup pouchNegatives:- As mentioned by other reviewers, it is heavy- If I carry my computer in the sleeve, there is little room for other essentials- The front pocket doesn't expand much upon opening, making it difficult to find my keysFor me, the bag fit the bill for my needs. If I was back in the business world frequently traveling, I think I might choose a different bag due to the slimness and weight (with no padded shoulder strap.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Completes your professional look","review":"I receive loads of compliments from co-workers.

I generally carry it over my shoulder and the handle is plenty long enough to be comfortable for my 5'9 frame. The front pocket has a nice organizer. My only complaint is that it could be a little bit deeper in order to accomodate more easily my medium sized water bottle.

Once you have read this you will be ready to do poses. Where you will go from there is up to you. Eventually you will want to shed the Ego and develop a yoga practice. Good luck on your journey.

For the first time in a month I had hope that my back would actually heal again.I have done yoga every day since then, even though some days I can only manage 10-15 minutes (still building up the endurance). For anyone who has back pain, I urge you to check this book out, and don't be afraid of the poses! Baron is very specific, and his modifications are truly aimed at beginners. This is yoga for everyone - all you have to do is take the first step on your own journey to power. I am grateful that I did.Namaste"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could he be more annoying?","review":"I have been practicing yoga for quite a few years now.

This is the case with this album. The trio, including sax, tubas and drums, produces a spellbinding trip into a strange and surreal world that presents with the likes of ghosts, long-lost fleeting moments or esoteric passages driven by a strong rhythm and textures that at once float and condense upon the listener. If you are into new and exciting atmospheres, try this album for measure.

Ohmae is prone to repetetiveness, and worse still, he turns a blind eye to any non-economic factors in play. His book can be regarded a typical representative of the globalization-school, along with the inevitble economic determinism. NO, man does not live for the mall and the multinational alone! On the positive side is that at least Ohmae tries to come up with an alternative for the nation state, so lacking in many other books on this subject.

The powder comes out fine especially when you tap it in the bottle, unlike what the other review said. Another review complained about the color, which I thought was kinda weird. The color looks fine for me. The dispenser is a bit large than normal, but probably because its a 4-divider dispenser.I did not give it a 5-star because it is hard to open and you are worrying you might spill the powder inside if you are trying to open it.

When I attempted to empty it into a bottle of water not all of the formula came out. The shape of the dispenser prevented it from emptying completely. The lid should be somewhat rounded to direct the formula out the hole. Instead it is flat, trapping powder contents before making it out the hole. Shaking & taping the dispenser didn't help.I bought another dispenser similar to this one that works much better. The inside dividers are removable leaving it a cup.

The opening on our Munchkin dispensers has a slightly funnel shaped lid that lets the formula slide out with minimal tapping. ONE STAR for the fact that it has 4 compartments instead of 3.

Despite the great hype surrounding the movie (largely generated by clever and misleading advertising), it fails on all fronts. The story unfolds in a slow and predictable fashion. Long periods of boredom are punctuated by scenes of gruesome, graphic violence that are much better suited for a horror film. The movie revels in this brutality to such an extent that the real message is lost. In as much, it becomes what it pretends to condemn - senseless violence.

The narrative is often confusing, and the movie is full of bloody scenes of murder and mayhem, none of which was very appealing to me.

It is a truly open-minded story based on the aftermath of the Munich Olympic massacre in 1972. It would have been easy to villainize the Palestinians for this act. And they certainly would have earned it for what they did. But Speilberg uses the atrocity to illustrate that there are in fact legitimate and understandable issues on both sides. And only when we really look at that can we move toward peace. Politics aside though is it a great film on it's own? Yes! Especially if you like femme fatales- that Dutch assasin- wow!

To me it felt disrespectful in many ways and didn't help shed any light on this complicated part of history, as I imagined it had hoped to. He should have stuck to the sensibility of Shindler's List.

He leads a cast of no-name nobodies in this immensely unbelievable movie. If you can watch past the ridiculous shootout at an hour and 16 minutes, give yourself a pat on the back. With so many liberties taken with history, it's ashame this travesty was even made. Dialogue rarely rings true, and characters never seem to develop any sort of rapport or even a hint of a personality. A tragedy that should've translated into a riveting movie just bored me to tears, and my eyes rolled back into my skull so many times I am permanently cross-eyed. Good shots of cities around the globe, and for capturing the look and feel of the early 70's, cudos. Otherwise, a shameful mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tough, sad subject matter","review":"Lotta graphic violence. Lotta graphic sex. Tough, sad subject matter.

But its just an average movie disguised as a masterpiece. Theres one scene in the movie thats particularly terrible towards the end when Eric Bana is having sex with his wife and they show flashbacks of the terrorists, then back to Bana humping in agony complete with slow mo sweat flying off him...that scene was so bad it was funny in the unintentional sort of way and just about ruined the movie for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Land Dispute","review":"When Tony Kushner sticks to actual events, he's got a fast, thrilling script for Spielberg to work. The trouble is, a fine action movie is saddled with philosophical meanderings. The obviously contrived debate between the Mossad assassin and the PLO guy, the same old hackneyed arguments about what is essentially a land dispute, well, come on, why didn't the PLO guy realize Eric Bana really was a Jew? All the PLO fighters tell you how much they love their Palestine and Allah is their leader. Of course, the barbarity that meets their aims, all praised in heaven. Jews prefer a settled life on Earth be as it may, but there's little peace in the Middle East.I must tell you, The Soprano's or Godfather movies were suggested by the Munich revenge assassinations. The Mossad is so careful not to knock off civilians, too careful perhaps as their foes could care less. Good versus evil, makes for a better story, but not if you're political liberal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spielberg is Back on Top","review":"After the average SFX thriller, War of the Worlds, Munich is another notch in Steven Spielberg's impressive career. The acting is great all around, especially Eric Bana in a break out role, and the direction is top of the line. The pacing was a little slower than expected and it did drag at times (hence the 4 stars), but overall Munich was an important movie that shows the pros and cons of revenge. I would wait for DVD, but if you have already seen everything out there (like me), this one is worth catching if you got the 3 hours to spare."},{"rating":"2","title":"Munich Review","review":"The movie is one of the best films I have ever seen.

A lot of the material covered in this movie deserves great deal of exploration but this movie totally failed.i like the book by Fred Burton \\"Chasing Shadows\\" which covers this topic in more detailed and factually."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agit Prop Film?","review":"Spielberg at his worst.

The author does not present Nouwen as a \\"canned\\" saint, but truly as a \\"restless seeker,\\" a real person with positive and negative traits -- someone who, throughout his life, tried with all his might to find a place, both within and without, that he could call \\"home.\\" I would highly recommend this book to those who have studied Nouwen's works as an excellent summary of his spirituality and theology.

Save your money, buy a better external antenna and just get a better signal for your standard radios."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this product","review":"I live in San Francisco and have generally good radio reception. This unit could not receive normal FM stations that table radios sitting right next to it could pick up... and I used the fancy \\"Dipole\\" antenna on the Boston Accoustics unit and the other table radios only had an internal antenna.The HD part of the radio is total junk. Sometimes the audio \\"skips\\" and sometimes the signal is lost and reacquired (meaning 3 or 4 second drop-outs.)All in all, there's nothing good about this radio.
