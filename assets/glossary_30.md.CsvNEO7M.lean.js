This is a particularly important book for Baptists in light of these current times in which many Baptists seem to have forgotten their history of being a persecuted minority religion in colonial America. As evidenced by the messages in this book, Baptist leaders today who claim that separation of church and state was not the original intent of the Founding Fathers are not being true to their Baptist roots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bowed Bottoms","review":"We purchased this to use on a glass top stove, and found that the pan was not flat.We assume that not all are bowed, but ours was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice nonstick","review":"For a family of 4, this pan is good size.

After being treated for an ulcer, Miles Monroe (Allen) is accidentally cryogenically frozen by liquid nitrogen. When he awakes his slumber after 200 years, he is a lone man in a time under dictatorship rule, only finding a sense of belonging in the company of a woman named Luna (Diane Keaton), whom he later becomes part of a rebellion with. Sleeper is a Woody Allen film through and through: it's witty; it's funny; and it's awkwardly tender in the best possible way."},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"party scene\\" is enough to make this a classic in itself","review":"Retro-cool, low budget, futuristic and ultra-chic, this comedy has it all. Not the typical Woody Allen film, and Allen is not for the typical audience, so the title is fitting. It's a glimpse of what Woody Allen USED to be ie \\"Without Feathers\\" and Take the Money & Run, but in his one attempt at science fiction. I'm definitely a Woody Allen fan yet there are a few of his films I will not watch. Annie Hall is my number 1, after that Manhattan, Hannah & Her Sisters (I've seen this one 10 times I think), but Sleeper is in a class by itself, so it's usually overlooked by most fans. To enjoy this film: relax, look for cheap yet clever special effects, the coolest sets, wardrobes, and dispositions you can ask for. The gay scene is hilarious. The party Diane Keaton throws could be the prototype of a subculture in itself. How this film has eluded cult status I do not know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Certainly Lives Up To Its Title!","review":"I found it very difficult to stay awake watching much of this film and it certainly was a \\"sleeper\\" for me although a few of Allen's one-liners were actually really funny even for today's audiences although the vast majority of the film and consequently the jokes do not age well. To call this Allen's \\"tribute\\" to Keaton and Marx would actually be insulting to both whose works although a lot older than this are a lot funnier.The picture quality is VHS quality and the sound quality is poor and there are no special features worth speaking about on this dvd version of the film. \\"Take the Money and Run\\" by the way is a far, far better comedy and film and thankfully Allen as a movie maker vastly improves his output over the years since this film.A real sleeper and certainly not Allen's or anyone else's for that matter better moments makes this not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?/","review":"I still am stumped as to why this is supposed to be good.

Sleeper is about a dystopian future world of 2173 where people are still just as screwed up as the progaganist from 1973. Sight gags for SiFi staples such as the jetpack, personal helicopter, space suits and home robots hit right on target. Add the really nice jazz scoring also starring Woody with preservation hall maistros is a big bonus."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like Woody Allen, you should love this.","review":"This is one of Allen's most entertaining and funny movies. He plays Miles Monroe, a man who goes into the hospital for a minor operation and wakes up 200 years in the future. Since the police don't have any identification of him, the doctors that brought him back want him to try to overthrow the underground political movement. He reluctantly goes out to do that and finds things to be quite different than 1973.The movie has many funny sight gags, slapstick, futuristic props, and one-liners. This is one of those movies that I can watch over and over again and never get tired of it. I recomend this movie to anyone that likes Woody Allen and movies with many laughs that never stop coming. I also recommend Take the Money and Run, Bananas, Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex but were Afraid to Ask, and Love and Death."},{"rating":"2","title":"Woody Allen's Genius of Comic","review":"Being a long time Woody Allen fan, I purchased this DVD to add to mycollection.

However, it is not even the best this album has to offer. \\"Body and Soul\\" boasts the soulful and unforgettable tunesmithing Tim Moore could probably do in his sleep. It is arguably the highlight of this polished pop-rock offering. One of Tim Moore's most covered songs, \\"Rock n Roll Loveletter\\" is redone here (it can also be found on \\"Behind The Eyes\\"). \\"Loveletter\\" should be the envy of pretty much every songwriter. Great lyrics, music, pacing and passion abound.

I understand that because she is 4, going a less expensive route is best. However, I wasn't expecting the guitar to look used and damaged. There was a big ding by the neck, a chunk of wood fell out of the guitar, the paint work was shotty at best, the strings don't stay tight and it didn't have a peg by the neck to attach the strap to, so the strap is useless.

There are some improvements I would like to see. Its closest competitor is made by JET. The below are features that you get with JET (maybe that should be their slogan) that I would like to see with this Delta drill press. Delta needs: A TEFC totally enclosed fan motor to prevent overheating from sucked in saw dust. A larger table. A deeper cutting depth. An improvement in the smoothness of sliding the table out of the way. The current configuration causes the geared rail to bind with the tool base.All in all I do recommend this tool as a contender. Some of the accessories could use some improvements. The mortising attachment fence setup is not very sturdy and difficult to adjust. The oscillating sander is not the easiest to setup and remove."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delta 17-965K 16-Speed 16-1/2\\" Floor Drill Press","review":"I just set up the 17-965 Delta drill press - overall very easy setup - just heavy...I found one person could do it fairly easily (hey, I am over 65) by assembling the base, table bracket, and column (without the table), laying this assembly on it's side, and sliding the column into the drill press head (the heavy part) still in the box (but with the styrofoam broken away to gain access and the box elevated with the wood blocks supplied in shipment) to mate with the column. The column slid very nicely into the head. I then simply lifted the head and tilted the whole unit to the vertical position. From then on the assembly was a piece of cake.Everything worked nicely, and I found the unit to be fairly quiet. The cost of this drill press (including the mortising jig) was very reasonable - the next step up is big bucks!After I have had a chance to use this thing for a few months I will submit a followup review"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Tool, Bad Chuck","review":"This tool is made in China.Well packaged, easy set up, easy to use.

I should have replaced it immediately, but I waited untill after the warranty expired. After two years of light use, the chuck was unuseable. Replaced it with a Jacobs chuck (about $...). It was like going from a Yugo to a BMW."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice press","review":"I've enjoyed using my drill press so far. I haven't really run it through all of it's paces but so far it's done a nice job. My only complaint about it is that there was quite a bit of rust on the part that you attach the chuck to. I was quite surprised by this and a little disappointed. I was able to remove most of it and it's not too big of a deal, but why would there be any rust on a brand new drill press??? Other than that, it's easy to use, powerful enough for my needs, and the free mortising kit is a nice bonus. If not for the rust, I'd have given it 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid The Delta 17-965 Drill Press","review":"The Delta 17-965 Drill Press is a piece of garbage. Avoid it. Your better off buying a drill press from Toys-R-Us. The table locking handles are rediculous. They do nothing to keep the table from moving. The vibrating plastic top is another kick in the pants. I'm sending mine back tomorrow. No more Delta tools for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my better purchases","review":"This drill press had the specs I was looking for: plenty of spindle travel and variation in speed. The speed is simple to change, and I've never noticed the rattle others complained about. There was a bit of rust on the table upon arrival, but a little wet sanding with WD-40 took care of it, and Top Cote kept it from coming back. The depth setting works like a charm! I've heard others complain about the mortising attachment, but I rout mine so have no experience with that.Read the instructions all the way through before beginning assembly so you know what you're getting into. Had I done that I would have mounted the base on wood before the drill was assembled. The head is a little heavy, so you might want to consider mounting it before you lift the pedastal up. Personally, I didn't find it particularly difficult to lift onto the upright...but if you do it make sure your support is rock solid and steady. This is not something you want to fall backwards with!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy with purchase","review":"I bought this product a couple of months ago.

The saw is vicious should u need it, good option there. The pliers work great and the wire cutters do it's job too. If u don't mind the tools not locking as in the older model leathermans, this is definitely a good choice to carry with u everyday as it is not so heavy. I really like the leather sheath with button snap to use on my belt or on the waistband of my shorts or jeans.

I cant even recommend it to a single friend in the industry as it really has nothing to say other that a lot of sweat went in this development, but again if you have been involved in any cutting edge development project they are not 9-5 jobs....so what is new. Sorry I spent my time. Perhaps it needs context to appreciate it.

Even a web search produced lousy instructions.Also, not only do they give you the idea for stenciled wall texture, but the stencils are included, just photocopy them to size and cut them out!

With the new turn around in the series, this was the season and onward in which I never got to watch cause of not being able to catch the show on in my area at this particular season. Although I wish that after this season set was released that the other 2 season sets got a release so that way some of us fans can have at least all the episodes amongst our DVD collections.

Jokes and insight and the whole story itself didn't seem, to me, to transfer very well from the book to the screen. However, I remember when reading this one, I wasn't too excited about it, either. I got this one and \\"Wyrd Sisters\\" for Xmas; I recommend the latter if you are looking for good Pratchett on American available video.Story: Death is trying to forget. So he joins the foreign legion and gets wasted. Susan, his granddaughter takes over and falls for an \\"Elfish\\" dude. Rock and Roll comes to Ankh-Morpork... The Death scenes are good; other than that, I'd skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed","review":"Having 'cut my teeth' on southern gospel with its simple arrangements and heartfelt vocals, I was so disappointed to listen to this slickly produced album of Ira Stanphill's music. His melodies were beautiful and his lyrics so meaningful, but this album with strange philharmonic arrangements behind the voices was just plain jarring. The effect was somewhat like the latest Gaither Homecoming videos - lots of production values but little sincere, real feeling. Wish they had recorded the album at some little Georgia church instead of a big production studio - it would have been a better reflection of the impact of Ira Stanphill's words and music on the 'little people'. As a comparison, listen to LaBreeska Hemphill sing \\"Mansion Over the Hilltop\\" on the \\"Down at the Tabernacle\\" Gaither CD and you will know what I mean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming book","review":"A tour of the members of an orchestra done with black and white drawings accompanied with poetic descriptions. The drawings are delightful and will warm the heart of any concert-goer. The poems are good, but a little dated. All together a lovely old book that will entertain the classical music lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Success","review":"Bought this for my Mum as a gift, as I'd heard her talking of reading Wilhelm Hauff tales during her primary school years in The Netherlands where she grew up. Great success for a gift as she totally loves it. Although this book is in English, it doesn't matter as the stories are the same and I can tell there's a lot of memories comming back for her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best hiking guide to MRNP","review":"For hiking, as opposed to climbing, I thought this was a great book. It was easy to read, well-organized, and informative. It was certainly better than Ira Spring's \\"50 Hikes\\" book.The two authors spent a whole summer just hiking all over Mt. Rainier National Park, and then wrote about what they found. Entertaining and informative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly short","review":"I purchased this book in the hopes that it would, in fact, be a book. NOPE. It's a bound collection of pictures with a small, gloss-the-surface \\"story\\" about the history of the originators--Black Sabbath. I'm still waiting for a \\"book\\" book. One without pictures and quotes from more than one band member (like the \\"Oral History\\" thing), much like one of the many Led Zeppelin books. (\\"Hammer of the Gods\\" was pretty good). Anyway, I guess I'll keep waiting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magazine-like book---Nice Photos","review":"This \\"book\\" is only 48 pages and includes color and black & white photos of early Black Sabbath & Ozzy solo. Good quality photos and limited information. Short background info on each of the band members and a selected discography are also included. Skims over the story of Black Sabbath Ozzy era quickly. I finished reading in less than 30 minutes. It's a nice item for the right price (I paid $4). If you're looking for a more in depth look at the band check outBlack Sabbath: Doom Let Loose: An Illustrated History. Each album has a chapter (even the ones where Tony Iommi was the only original member) and it's an interesting & informative read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have come with a coloring book!","review":"This book was written for those who are either brain dead or in the 1st-4th grade. Decent photos, but a lot of discrepencies with the facts. No real interviews from those who matter. If you are buying this for your young son or daughter, or someone who just learned how to read, this book is perfect, but it insults the intellegence for pretty much the rest of the world. It was a total waste of money, IMO. Skip it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Had a lot of good pictures.","review":"There was any info really. There was a lot but the same stuff you can get on the internet. The whole thing was practically pictures but they had some really good pictures so thats why i gave it a higer rating. If you want info don't get this book but if you just want to look at some sick pictures i would get it for an ozzy memorance thing when he dies."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is BLODDY AWESOME!","review":"Man, I've been an OZZY fan since TRIBUTE but I had no idea how much Sabbath affected metal music until I read this book! I took the author's advice and bought ALL of the Sabbath albums. Now I can't get them out of my head! BLACK SABBATH AND OZZY RULES!!Another cool thing is that the guy who wrote the liner notes for the KISS remasters wrote this book. He also wrote the copy on OZZY's bubble-gum cards that I bought at Spencers.

They can't. I can't believe I was suckered.I'll grant that the \\"scientific method\\" and \\"mythology\\" are very different intellectual pursuits. I'll even grant they differ in the prism of the world they see. I'll even grant that they offer complimentary perspectives, at least if one accepts polysemy.But they don't and cannot \\"merge.\\" The \\"fairy tale\\" is that someone believes that they can, namely Rigas. It was there in the title! The scientific method and resurrection of the body cannot merge. They are contradictions! Neither \\"FITS\\" the other. What a terrible waste I could have prevented.I'll look closer in the future. This is my error. I know better, and yet curiosity got the better of me. The subtitle should have been an obvious warning. Curiosity can sometimes overlook the obvious. I have and did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating","review":"It was about midnight in a hotel room on a business trip that I was flipping channels and came across this documentary and was immediately sucked in. It's just a fascinating story about an off-beat topic that most people have never heard about. I was so fascinated by it that I researched the PBS site until I found the producers name and contacted him to see when it would be on DVD (I never do that!).Well, that was about a year ago, here it is, and I can't wait to see it with all the extras. If you are a fan of oddball documentaries in the vein of 'American Movie', 'The Checker King', or 'Cane Toads', then this one is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Off the Charts\\" is off the charts great!","review":"As with most of the other reviewers, I first caught this on PBS several months ago.When I found out it was finally on DVD I happily bought it and am not disappointed.The wonderful stories told during this documentary are quite charming and actually very inspiring. Anyone interested in any aspect of music will adore this DVD...has many nice extras. Song-poems RULE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Incredible Film!!!!","review":"I was surprised to see how completely captivating and intriguing this film was. If art imitates life then this film is a perfect example. In this documentary, director Jamie Meltzer explores the bizarre and fascinating world of \\"Song Poems\\". In this obscure sub-culture, ordinary people with stars in their eyes are seduced by ads in the back of magazines promising fame and fortune for original songs. For a price anyone can submit his or her personal, heartfelt, and often times very bizarre lyrics/poems to be recorded as songs. Yes, the subject matter is strange but I found myself touched by these people lives and completely fascinated by the inner workings of the business end of the song-poem world. What I loved about it was that it was so completely human. There should be more films made like this one. You don't need huge special effects or some grand subject matter, all you need is a good story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really, it is","review":"\\"Non-Violent Taekwondo Troopers\\" is perhaps the greatest pop song ever recorded, better even than \\"In My Life\\", \\"What You Do to Me\\", \\"Lexicon Devil\\", or \\" Be My Baby\\". Caglar Juan Singletary (and Art Kaufman) have given something of real beauty to the world. Sublime."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book for all teens","review":"Leslie has always had an A+ life. But it all comes crumbling to pieces when Leslie starts trying to be the perfect person. And being the perfect person, means being thin in Leslie's world. It all begins when Leslie gets the flu. She loses several pounds and is then motivated to go on a diet. But her going on a diet would eventually turn her life upside down.Second Star to the Right shows what it's like inside the mind of a young teenager struggling with anorexia. After reading this book I was shocked that this happens to teenage girls like myself. I was aware that one of my classmates was anorexic and after reading this book I had an eye-opening view of what it's really like for someone struggling with this life-threatening disease."},{"rating":"1","title":"from a teenagers point of view","review":"Recently myself and three other girls in my eighth grade language arts class read this book for a report. The book doesn't start out very well and it was difficult to stay interested. It is a realistic view about anorexia and what happens to people with this disease and the consiquences but it didn't hold my attention. I think if more exciting things happened than it would have been better but it was boring. All that happened is that Leslie suffers from anorexia and goes to the hospital we never know what ever happened to her. There was no resolution. But if you want to know about anorexia and what ahppenes to people with them than read this book but if you don't have a long attention span than don't read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only if you're 9 years old","review":"This book offers the most naive perspective about ED's out there.I was highly disappointed by it, I expected a realistic view on the issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accurate, Precise, Wonderful Book","review":"Deborah Hautzig is a master of fiction and literature, and a beautiful writer. Her imagery and use of Dickinson's poetry rings beautifully. As a former anorectic and bulemic, I can identify with her main character; as a friend to many with anorexia and bulemia, I can identify with her other characters. The development of both plot and traits is absolutely marvelous, and possibly the best part is the fact that there is no \\"magical recovery\\" as many books would have. Life is never that simple, and people need to realize it. Anorexia is not about just eating.... Thank you, Deborah, for helping to spread this truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Novella that was just so-so.","review":"This is no a book- at 155 pages it is more like a Novella. Although the book covers the subject, it does not draw you in to the main character and at no point do you see her as anything other than a spoiled, selfish, self-indulgent child who thinks she is selfless. I did not empathize with her. Additionally, the book just ends very oddly. It really was not good by today's standards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simpily the best for women with anorexia & thoes who dont.","review":"I suffered from both annorexia and bulimia. I stumbled upon this book in highschool in a recomended reading list. When I finished the book I was emotionaly Overwhellmed at there was sombody like me and they felt the same way ant it wasen't glamorized or wrought with the overall message of you need to change this book delt with the topic in an excellent manner and did not engage in psycological games or intervintions as many other books on this subject.Thank you Debrah for not forcing change or patronizing us and thank you Soooo! much for this book.

DEAN HUGHES IS A VERY GOOD ATHOR. HE BRINGS YOU INTO THE STORY."},{"rating":"2","title":"This series is spell binding, very difficult to set it down.","review":"I have read all three vol. of this series. Its not quite as emotional as Vol. 2 was. It covers the war front on both the European and Pacific threater during WWII. I've read this book in a couple of days, and have several other people waiting their turn to read it. I highly recomend this book. I just wish that Vol.4 would come out sooner than a year from now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great continuation of the WWII saga.","review":"I really enjoy the vast exploration of the multiple characters in the novel. I felt that Dean Hughes spreads out the characters well and keeps you on your toes making for intense reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Remarkable Series","review":"I don't usually (in fact I can't ever recall doing it) give a 5-star review..but these books by Dean Hughes are amazing. They paint the picture of an LDS family caught up in WWII.The reader follows one son in a Japanese labor camp, another as a top-notch paratrooper..a daughter serving as a nurse in Hawaii...and more. As a younger person, I learned a lot about this particular time period. I love historical fiction..it really gives the reader a taste of a different era.The book may not have the spirituality of Gerald Lund's saga, but it's much more well-written. Hughes avoids all of the Lund-isms. His characters don't have group hugs whenever they get together. They don't grin sheepishly..or any of a dozen other phrases. Well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best book that I have ever read!","review":"The characters in children of the promise seems so real and I feel like I know them as my neighbors. I feel like I am going through their lives together. I have learned more about W.W.II from reading this book than I have from history class in high school. By the way I am from Japan and reading from the other side is quite interesting. Thank you for publishing this book, Brother Hughes! God Bless!

It is one of those that I packed and repack through more than 16 moves. My children and my riding students have all read it and enjoyed it. The horses and horsemanship are realistic and true to life. The story is about try and heart and commitment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"First I must say I'm not a \\"young reader\\" which is who this book is intended for. Also, I'm not really a horse person but decided to give this book a try anyhow. I was happily surprised after reading the foreword to discover that it's based on a true story. I enjoyed reading this book, I thought it was interesting and it flowed nicely without having any boring/slow parts. If you are reading this to or with a child it helps that the chapters are a good length--not too long or too short, they give you great starting and stopping points."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!!!","review":"What a disappointment! Actually, the CD is appalling!!!! This is the kind of music you hear in southern Spain, not Italy. I travel to Europe 4 or 5 times a year & usually to Italy or Spain. Music is my thing - & I plan my trips around musical performances. I have never heard music like that on your CD in Italy in the 40+ years I've traveled there. Makes me de-value Rough Guides in general...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a video with acceptable volume of Chinese","review":"I wanted my kids to truly learn Chinese, not a word here and there, which is apparently the case with Kailan, Walker and Ping Ping, and Culture Cubs (although these are cute). Little Pim actually teaches about 30-50 words per DVD. I gave it four stars, because the intonation was off on a couple of words."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away","review":"1) Ridiculously expensive.2) The idea is good (showing what's going on and telling what's happening in that foreign language) but telling it in a narrative way was a stupid idea. I wouldn't say stupid IF you would be able to see the person, and her mouth/lip/tongue moves.3) The toddlers get bored sooooo quickly.4) It's way too fast for a toddler to memorize the words.5) Sometimes (even with the drawings) it is not clear where the toddler should focuse. Is it the eyes, the face, the nose...6) Buy it for yourself, you can follow it easily, stop and rewind it, take notes then it works, but this is not good for a toddler.I recommend The Journey to the East: Thr River Dragon King and better Ni Hao, Kai-Lan series."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I am disappointed with this dvd set. I wish they would have included video of someone pronouncing the words as well. Seeing someone say the words is also important, and, no, an animated panda does not count. Maybe this is less important for older kids, but then don't say the dvd is appropriate for babies as well. I can still use the dvd's for all the positive reasons other reviewers have given, but this seems to me to be a major downside."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids Enjoy the Content","review":"This was purchased for two little ones, ages 2 and 1. The content features Pim, an animated panda, intermixed with footage of children and parents in everyday situations. Basic objects and actions are introduced then repeated several times before being used in simple phrases and sentences. There is a menu option to see English subtitles. It would be great (for adults) if there was also an option to see the Chinese vocabulary spelled out phonetically in English. However, the kids are obviously the target audience and they seem to really enjoy the videos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent mandarin language video","review":"My 1 1/2 year old has watches this video many times and still wants to watch it. Better than most mandarin videos as it includes no english and captures a toddlers attention throughout the program. I bought the three pack and consider it well worth the purchase. $50 dollars cheaper through Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ines of My Soul (not Allende's best work)","review":"When I received this book as a gift, I was so happy and grateful. I have read many of Isabel Allende's books from House of Spirits, Daughter of Fortune, Tales of Eva Luna and others. I couldn't wait to start reading this one. I was so disappointed. Perhaps because Allende was trying to stay true to this historical character rather than letting her imagination take her where it wanted to go. This book is just plain boring. I'm sorry to say it about one of my favorite author's work. I wish her editors would have been honest with her and stated the truth. I read half way through the book hoping for it to get interesting. But it never did. I finally had to abandon it and picked up another book to read instead. Will it put me off reading Allende? Definitely not. She's done it so many times before, she can do it again. Besides, she's entitled to a dud or two. And who knows. Maybe it was just me. Others, evidenced by the other comments posted, loved this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"An amazing story of a woman with great courage, fortitude and stamina who helped to settle Chile and gave so much of herself to helping others. Isabele Allende is a wonderful writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot Chile!","review":"Another good story by Allende, but with lots of interesting historical background. It suggests that the Spanish were courageous and visionary, but also cruel and determined to stir lasting enmity among the Indians. Ines, the heroine, was more enlightened that her male contemporaries and was a courageous, heartwarming character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad to Say","review":"Sad to say this is not our usual Allende. The subject is fraught with violence and inhumanity. These are not admirable people. Their motives and actions reek of shallowness, self-serving, and ubridled egotism. Ines is a remarkable woman, but she canot be divorced from her time and place.Allende's narrative skill and characterzation are not up to par.I will still look forward to her next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing","review":"Having read most of Allende's works, I found 'Inez of My Soul' very disppointing. Her characters were not to be embraced; flat and not endearing and/or people you can hate. Ines takes off from Spain in search of her husband... (remember her character in Daughter of Fortune?) sounds familiar to me. Ines becomes the main backbone of the settlers while searching for Chilean settlements.. nurse/doctor, provider of food/crops, wise and compassionate yet turns a blind eye to suffering of the Indians. What do you think the reference to 9/11 was all about? My book club LOVED Dauther of Fortune and Portrait in Sepia, but I certainly will NOT recommend this book. I felt she recreated too many instances from Daughter of Fortune. The book is tedious and violent beyond necessity."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much war","review":"This is a disappointing book. I liked several of her earlier books which led me to pick up this one but it is one big bore. don't waste your time on such popular fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"Inés of My Soul is blandly written (or translated? or both? I'm not sure), and its plot extremely contrived. I enjoyed the history lesson, but that's not what you want your novel to feel like. And it suffers from that really obnoxious phenomenon where historical novels focus on ideas and details specifically of interest to and which reflect the values of the modern reader. Bleh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Allende Writes a Book for Men","review":"This is a really fascinating book that gives insight into the native people of South America. The indian boy who mingles with the Spanish to learn their ways, then becomes the great warrior leading his people is an amazing touch. I don't know how much historical accuracy there is to his character, but if it's close to correct, it's one of the most amazing stories ever.I'm guessing that the reviewers who weren't thrilled with the book were women. This Allende book has a female main character, but I'm guessing men will identify more with her than women. Even for today, she would have been an amazingly strong woman. In her time, she was truly remarkable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Magical Realism or Tiresome Bodice-Ripper?","review":"Anyone who has enjoyed the beautifully written Eleanor of Aquitaine by Historian Alison Weir will find this a painful and tiresome read. There are details that ring false, and after awhile it was hard to stay interested. After trudging through the Chilean deserts, almost dying of thirst, the troop still has wine to give their wounded warriors? In the springtime, she reports they at last have fruit to eat--what fruits ripen in the spring? An entire battalion of soldiers disguises themselves in sheets--where would there be that many precious and costly sheets in the 16th century? I suppose all of this can be attributed to poetic license or \\"magical realism\\" but it just rings false and silly. Perhaps teenage girls will enjoy it as a spicy fairy story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Isabel's novel is not alltogether credible","review":"Allende's imagination took incredible leaps based on non-historical documents to describe some South American early civilizations as extremely cruel and corrupt (Incas) while others were described as peaceful and loving (Mapuches). Probably untrue en both counts, based of textbooks. The book was wordy and tedious and could not even get to the end, somewhat boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Historical Novel","review":"Isabel Allende is a great historical fiction writer, she truly is a master at her work, great writing, great story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best.","review":"I was so excited to purchase and read this new book by Allende, that I may have put my expectations too high. Unlike Daughter of Fortune's Eliza, Ines lacks grace and integrety. Towards the middle of the novel, I had started to skip pages because I could guess what she was going to say and do. Her, \\"I am a 16th century woman, hear me roar\\" routine got very old after the first few chapters and I wanted something more from her. Humility? Softness? I'm not sure, but what I do know is that with the rich historical tapestry that Allende has proven she can weave, I am disapointed that she didn't try harder in convincing us that Ines was a flesh and blood woman and not just some Amazonian slayer of Mapuche. Ines is too proud, too sure of herself. I regret not being introduced to this historical figure properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ines of My Sout","review":"This book is difficult to read. I want a story but the history is foreign and gets in the way. That is not Allende's fault. I need to know more about the setting, the history in order to understand it. She writes well, but this does not rank among the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ines of my soul.","review":"This is one of the inferior novels that I have read of Isabel Allende. I could not finish it to the end. The protagonist is a strong female character set on an arduous journey with conquistadors and natives,from Peru to Chile. The part of coursing that distance was tedious reading which had to be skimmed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book Review","review":"The book contains the concepts of the most recently researches in the area of formal hardware verification .I read a lot of journal publications, and I couldn't get the expected benefit from most of them, because they assume a high background in formal techniques.

Mr. Tribbe could have done so much more with this concept, but instead attempts to sermonize, and the more sermonizing he does the more theologically shaky ground he gets on. Had he stuck to what is known about Jesus' words instead of trying to paraphrase Jesus or worse, twist the intent of Jesus' words, the book would have been more enjoyable and maybe more believable.There certainly is a lot of jibberish out there, and unfortunately I would heap this book amongst the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Everything I buy fromAmazon is great.

They are the right price in this economy, have a range of sizes and let the yarn, be it acrylic or wool, slide on the needles. The points are more angular than the more blunted bamboo. The joints are tapered. Bamboo can have a tendency to \\"stick\\", some people like that. What ever, the case. These are good go to needles if you are trying to build up your needle stash, or like to knit more than one hat at a time and are a penny pincher like me.

I love how much easier circulars are to handle compared to the old fashion 'stick' type needles. Unfortunately these replace the stick problem with a hard to handle and in the way plastic cable. It's in the way, it won't move, the stitches don't move smoothly from the needles to the cable. It's just cheaply made and it really takes away any advantage of circular needles over the sticks. I guess I'll have to save up for the $55 Denise needles. You get what you pay for!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to handle","review":"Super easy to use and very durable.

I find this to be blasphemous and heartbreaking. Yes, it does have a good number of the Clash's songwriting peaks captured live on it. Yes it is amazing as a whole. But damnit, buy the other albums. And listen to them, not once, not twice. Drill them into your gray matter until you realize the true mastery the Clash had over producing an ALBUM. That's right kids, an album. People don't seem to focus on this as much anymore, but the flow and feeling of an entire collection of songs is very important as compared to the disposable pop single market of our current era. So go out and get London Calling, and the self titled (US and UK) and the rest and sit and listen, you'll understand later."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-have","review":"63 songs, lyrics (not complete -- the lyrics of I Fought The Law aren't there!), a few new tracks, a few live tracks, a photo album... this boxed set has everything.

Yeah: this box set covers all the bases and, with the exception of London Calling, virtually makes the individual albums obsolete. The highlights of the band's studio albums are presented here (including around 90% of The Clash's awesome debut album), so you get all the good stuff. Sandinista! in particular sounds much better when the very best cuts are lined up back-to-back; skipping isn't necessary here. The box set also includes singles and B-sides, making it a valuable set even for collectors. And if that's not enough, this long box includes a cool book stuffed full of photos and quotes. Unless you are a die-hard fan of the band this box set, along with London Calling, are the only two purchases you need to make. And if you own all the albums, get this box set anyway. The outtakes and singles are worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have","review":"This set captures a lot of essential Clash. This band sadly left us too soon as a group and their body of work is not that extensive. But as a music lover and not a completist for this band the set works.Enjoy the box for what it is. A strong compilation of great band without buying the whole catalog. There area few live cuts, unreleased stuff and singles but once again you get all the essentail stuff. To be picky the reason why I gave it 4 out of 5 stars there are maybe 3 cuts I would have liked included that are not there but those are only personal favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS SET ROCKS!

I thought this CD had various artists which added potential. The music, if actually produced by United to Divide was not all that bad, but the singing?!?!? They were horrible. Part of Mudvayne's greatness is that the music is so amped that when the vocals begin it explodes with heartfelt metal. Not so with United to Divide, they either tried to hard or not hard enough.

Quite literally, this is music by cavemen for cavemen. I was going to compare Nickelback's songs to \\"Bah Bah Black Sheep\\" but I think that would be a misrepresentation -- \\"Bah Bah Black Sleep\\" is far more musically sophisticated. Actually, if you give a caveman an electric guitar, he will probably write better songs than the Nickelback guy because he is not chained to the modern Zeitgeist of three-chord gorilla-rock, three-note vocal melodies, and pathetic drummers that barely navigate an eighth-note rock beat (and even then with zero variation). It's not even a matter of the music being pathetically basic (it's a contingent relationship rather than a necessary one) -- the music is just flat-out crappy. The lyrics approach new standards of verbal diarrhea, and yet with the way certain lines are emphasized you just KNOW they *think* they write really clever lyrics.

Same chord progressions, same lyrics, same music for EVERY SONG. Don't believe me? Last month Y100, my local rock station, played two Nickelback songs one on top of the other, to prove the same point. The songs had the exact same guitar, bass, and drums. The only thing different was the lyrics. It's hilarious how people can get rich playing the same song 10 times on a CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Formula rock for the masses","review":"Nickleback is Clear Channel's best friend: their music is ordinary, dull, and absolutely defining mainstream. The songs here are all the same, with poor lyrics, and Chad's standard, ordinary singing style. Sorry about using ordinary so many times, it just defines this band so well.I find it hilarious that \\"A kid's review\\" was chosen as a spotlight review, because he/she defines the average radio-listening, Nickleback fan. What I hate about bands like this is that they take away radio time to expose bands that deserve our attention.Anybody with brains should turn this off and listen to real talent like In Flames. If you must listen to a radio-dominated band, at least listen to A Perfect Circle, Tool, Nine inch nails, Muse, Metallica (pre-St. Anger), or anything elsewith substance. By the way, try looping \\"Someday\\" alongside \\"How You Remind Me,\\" you'll see how Nickleback has produced two almost identical songs, caused by their radio-friendly formulaic song writing skills."},{"rating":"1","title":"Proof That The Radio Is The Black Hole Of Music","review":"I noticed that almost every band on the radio sounds alike. All rap sounds alike. All diva-pop sounds alike. And all radio rock sounds alike.I decided to download the \\"How You Remind Me/Someday\\" mp3 onto my computer for the fun of it, and I was laughing. Both songs have the same BPM, the same chord changes, wow, and I thought Creed was terrible enough.The rest of the CD isn't any good either. \\"Because Of You\\" sounds like something ripped off Metallica's \\"St. Anger\\", and \\"Figured You Out\\" has some of the most mundane lyrics ever.Nickelback's new album, \\"All The Right Reasons\\", hits stores really soon. Expect one of the songs to sound exactly like one of their older songs. Nickelback is a joke and a disgrace to Canadian music. Hopefully they will realize how terrible their songwriting skills are and retire from the music business."},{"rating":"2","title":"Same great music, but less angry and violent lyrics...","review":"The first time I listened to this disc the time flew by! It was very good. They took a little edge off the guitar licks, a lot of edge off the vocal anger and melded in some very consistent and pleasing melodies. The album still qualifies as a rock recording, but I think it will appeal to a more mainstream audience than their previous album.Kroeger's lyrics are again stunning. He has a great voice that's just rugged enough to deliver the song's message - damn, I wish I had his voice.I was a little disappointed that \\"Hero\\" from the Spiderman soundtrack wasn't included. Afterall it was a Nickelback collaboration and would have rounded this disc out nicely. The limited edition casing is cool, done with a tri-fold cardboard sleeve with nicely done liner notes.The songs on here won't chart like the songs from \\"Silver Side Up\\", but it's still worth the money you'll spend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Man, i want my nickel back","review":"This is pointless generic radio rock.

Crappy modern-rock with a cocky lead singer who can't sing if he had to save his life. This is an insult to rock music. I shudder at the thought that this is not their first album ... ugh, and we all though Creed was bad...this is by far the worst rock band ever.

Overall, the sound of this album is much harder than the last. The songs on Silver Side Up were too much alike. And I got so sick and tired of hearing How You Remind Me every time I turned on the radio!! But on The Long Road, I like pretty much every song on here! The only song I'm not too wild about is See You At The Show. That track almost seems juvenile in a sense. I hear it and I think of the teenage garage band playing by my friend's house after school."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of the same","review":"Other than better production, this disc is too similar to the band's previous output. Like Puddle of Mudd, Linkin Park, and a dozen other bands, Nickelback talks the talk but keeps repeating the same old steps when they walk the walk. For those who think this is great music, I'm glad you found something to indentify with, but don't get stuck wallowing in the angst."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nickelback...Back and better than ever","review":"Man I thought that silver side up was a good album. I hadn't heard the Long Road. There literally isn't one song on this album that i don't care for. Some I like more than others, like Satruday Nights Alright... and Yanking Out My... are amazing songs. But the list goes on, Flat on the Floor, Someday and Believe It Or Not.

These are the type of songs I can listen to to cheer me up, get me through or just sing along with.

This song is degrading to women - it promotes sexual violence and applauds a female who is submissive and has low self esteem. How can we as a society say it's okay for radio stations to play a song like this, especially during hours most children could be listening.

I was over in Canada a little while ago and on one of their rock stations a poll took place, their \`rock world cup', this match up was Nickelback vs Pearl Jam, and you guessed it, Nickelback stormed it. Such an insult to Pearl Jam, an original band that Nickelback completely rip the sh*t off.Quite simply Nickelback's music is mediocre, there's nothing worth listening to.

Nickelback must have very poor relationships as that's all they ever seem to sing about, God, they're SO miserable! I thought we would see a new side of 'em when they released 'Feel'n Way Too Damn Good' or whatever is was called, and I was think'n \\"for the sake of their music, I hope they ARE start'n to feel good about themselves!\\". Alas, my hopes were shattered when they went back to their turgid, woe-is-me, boring chart-friendly pop rock that offers no real meaning at all!Layne Staley = dead.

ALL music heard on commercial radio has been extensively market researched using focus groups. So the music you hear on radio is deliberately chosen, if not designed, to appeal to the most people in the demographic that is being marketed to. Because so much money is at stake both in terms of profit and promotion, major record companies are interested not in music, but in moving product. Art and integrity don't matter, only sales. That is why we have bland, musical junkfood like Nickleback's The Long Road clogging up the airwaves. And it's only going to get worse as more and more radio stations or marketing outlets are owned by fewer and fewer corporations. Art by committee sucks folks. As a marketing device Nickleback are brilliant, as music they stink on ice. This is about as mindlessly commercial as it gets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Recorded","review":"This CD and the other Nickelback CD's I've bought are heavily compressed.

I still think The State is an OK disc. But like most bands, once they sell out and find fame, the quality of the product goes down the tubes. Besides being musically bland, and never changing...the lyrics are just about as deep as a rain puddle after a drizzle. \\"Figured you out\\" has to be the worst...any 8th grade dropout could write that, its just plain dumb, as well as vulgar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Despicable","review":"Alright Nickelback fans, please, Im begging you. Before you buy this album, before you give a four or five star review or before you automatically click the \\"no\\" button at the bottom of this review, do something for me. If you happen to have 2 cd players handy, listen to \\"Someday\\" and \\"How You Remind Me\\" at the same time. Beat for beat, line for line, they are the EXACT same song. These guys have absolutely no originality; from the start theyve been ripping off grunge bands such as Pearl Jam and Days Of The New.

No, I'm not talking about talent, they can obviously play repetitive annoying 3-chord riffs over and over till you feel like committing suicide. If you plan on killing yourself for listening to this corporate garbage, barring that you don't go deaf first, I don't blame you. There is no melodic value to this whatsoever. It is sad that Nickelback is a success in the music industry along with other weak bands like Saliva (Josie Scott is the ugliest elephant I've ever seen). They're both pseudo-country. No wonder why the only people who like these bands seem to be the ones who are looking to \\"rebel\\" their parents' preferred tastes of country. Go get 'em cowboy...yee haw.

All the songs sound exactly the same and Chad Kroeger may possibly have the most annoying voice in the world. This band defines so many terms perfectly. Boring, Generic, Bored to Death (you'll wanna die after a minute or two) lame...etc. All come to mind when I think of this. I can see why Fear Factory, Deicide, Type O Negative Cynic, and all the other smart bands left Roadrunner. I wouldn't want to be in the same building as Nickelback, much less associated with them. Finally, no I'm not just saying that cause I'm an ignorant American and hate Canada. If you wanna support Canada at least buy something that deserves to be popular like Devin Townsend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Making the Beast with Two Nickelbacks","review":"If I had two nickels to rub together, I'd probably use them to buy something. I dunno what, maybe a piece of bubblegum or something. What else can you buy with two nickels? Time was when you could buy a cup of coffee with that kind of money. But that was before my time. It is for these reasons alone that I can't give a rave review to this album, even if I wanted to, which I don't, but wouldn't nonetheless, unless my life depended on it, for instance, if the record producer was holding a gun to my head and I truly believed he was going to pull the trigger if I didn't give a rave review, my sense of self-preservation would supersede my fine critical acumen and against all the musical instincts I possess I would then have to give it a rave review under duress and therefore it would not be legally enforceable as an accurate testimony regarding what I would consider its true worth.

You won't hit the skip button too much, which is the mark of a good CD. Nickelback gives you what you liked in Silver Side Up(crisp guitar riffs, catchy coruses, social commentary, angst, etc.) and then some. This is solid hard rock in the vein of 3 Doors Down, Saliva and Ra, not harsh rock(i.e. Korn, System of a Down, etc.) Standout songs include Believe it or Not, Throw Yourself Away(with a disturbing topic ripped from recent headlines) and the first single Someday. If you're a fan of hard rock then The Long Road is well worth owning."},{"rating":"1","title":"A few good songs BUT","review":"After reading so many reviewers saying that The Long Road is the best CD by Nickelback yet, I was slightly disappointed when I got it home. Too many of the songs sound the same. Actually, I think the best song on the album is their \\"cover\\" of Elton John's Saturday Nights Alright (for fighting). Now that song rocks!And I must agree with the reviewer that said the packaging sucks. It does. Who the hell wants packaging like that?So in my opinion, Silver Side Up is still (by far) Nickelback's best album. The Long Road and The State are OK albums but, song for song, they just can't compare to Silver Side Up.But HEY... if you haven't checked out the DVD of Nickelback in concert, THAT is what you need to get. It is absolutely first rate. The filming, the playing the song selection... everything is just stellar. (There is some cursing on it but who the f#@k cares!) So if you like Nickelback, buy that next.FrancoPennsylvania"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nickelback does it again","review":"When I bought the cd, I was expecting a similar to Silver Side Up(their previous cd which I enjoyed very much). What I got blew me away. The music alone is more heavy(which I prefered), and when I listened to it for a second time, I found myself entranced by the lyrics. And whats best is that no two songs carry the same beat so you get a refreshing sound.

If you want real Hard Rock/meatal go treat yourself to an AC/DC , Guns N Roses or Iron Maiden album !"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Thrifty Nickel","review":"The only thing that is remarkable about this band is Chad Kroeger's consistency in writing 4 consecutive albums that all sound amazingly the same. I also admire his unbelieveable confidence in these ordinary songs. Don't waste your time with this type of music. It reeks of insincerity and has nothing to offer musically that 10,000 post grunge bands before haven't done. Where are the riffs? Where are the melodies that ring in your head? There are none. If you want some real Canadian rock check out RUSH's new one or check out Audioslave, The White Stripes, and The Vines.

Being a fan of their first album The State, I gave their newest release the benefit of the doubt. Unsuprisingly the bulk of the album tries to cash in on the popular sound of How You Remind Me and comes off as another stale compilation of the same guitars, song structure and boring lyrics. If you're looking for something fresh try Seether or Shinedown. But if you still can't get enough of How You Remind Me, then here's at least 5 songs that sound exactly like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"And on the 7th day, Chad Kroeger created The Long Road.","review":"This is perhaps the greatest album of all time, with the gods of music smiling down and accepting Chad into their group. All the songs are raw, radio friendly, and diverse, and Someday is an underplayed, underrated masterpiece of all. Even though it is hard to say which Nickelback album is the best, as all of them are classics.And for those who hate this all-American band, I must ask you, if Nickelback suck so much, how come they get so much radio play? Only the good songs get on the radio. So you can take your indie crap and stick it where the sun don't shine. Because everything is better with Nickelback, even crappy anime, as seen here: http://www.youtube(dot)com/watch?v=_E3nbtIFnhYReplace the (dot) with a . and prepare to be blown away.Overall, you must get this epic masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good songs for \\"The Long Road\\"","review":"This may not be as deft as their current album \\"All The Right Reasons,\\" but it's no loser either. Nickelback is refreshing in comparison to most of what's out there that's considered to be Rock music. But to clarify, this album only has 11 songs. So it's definitely not \\"too long.\\"What's great about Nickelback is they have their own style and sound. No one is making songs like FLAT ON THE FLOOR or FIGURED YOU OUT. A lot of people try, but the result isn't nearly as catchy. Nickelback is good at what they do.Other standouts include: DO THIS ANYMORE, SOMEDAY, SHOULD'VE LISTENED, BELIEVE IT OR NOT, FEELING WAY TO DAMN GOOD, BECAUSE OF YOU."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe the best","review":"When I first purchased \\"Silver Side Up\\", it was probably one of the best overall CD's I ever purchased. I could listen to it straight through without having to skip tracks I didn't like. It's only once in a blue moon that I find a CD like that. Nickelback's latest release \\"The Long Road\\" tops their previous release in my opinion. This CD flat-out ROCKS! If you even slightly enjoyed \\"Silver Side Up\\", this CD is a MUST buy!

In doing so, they sacrifice making any original or creative music.

Right through the album the tone changes constantly and is balanced to perfection from rock to metal and more deep, dark lyrics from Chad Kroeger. Some fantastic dirty rock n' roll guitar riffs punctuate the songs and Nik's drumming is definitely much more apparent.

The author clearly lacks professional ethics, letting her bias affect her work. Plus, the poetry was for the most part mediocre, and some Arabic women poets from the Middle East who have friendly ties to Israel are omitted.

Reading through this book provided so many \\"that makes so much sense!\\" moments, one automatically feels that they have much more solid grasp of the language after only a few chapters.

Gigi will be your new best friend and you can only love Billy and Spider more after the heartache they go through. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in reading Krantz.

Each vignette frames a different aspect of Zen practice and connects it to an aspect of running a business. The idea is to bring the concepts of Zen into the business world, to help the reader become more adept at dealing with the daily challenges of work, while integrating the spiritual into the business realm, where it is not usually welcomed. I connect with these ideas and could imagine how useful this book would be on the bookshelf next to my desk, to consult when I face a new challenge or stress while I am working. Each vignette could bear multiple readings and reveal something new every time, in light of the context in which it is read. I particularly appreciated the Nine Practices for being more in connection with yourself while at work and the Z.B.A. Manifesto at the back of the book, and plan to consult both regularly."},{"rating":"1","title":"typical feel-gooder","review":"when you think someone has applied zen to business practices you think maybe someone has been able to put the zen into some perspective through the real world not just again put the real world into some perspective through zen. people in the real (or should i say ugly) world need to have a bridge built to get them half-way there with some new and very straight forward practices that can be applied.

Don't get me wrong, it was really good, expecially the last 300 pages. Definitly read it if you liked Perdido or the Scar, but read one of those first to smooth into Mieville's style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will it ever end...","review":"I absolutley loved Perdido Street.

It seemed to drag on forever, and I couldn't wait for it to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"Not as good as the first two, not that that means it is bad. The whole golem thing is just not as interesting to me. Perhaps a little bit more overtly political, too. If you like trains and railroads, you may well enjoy this book a lot more, but if Mieville set out to make concentrated urban fantasy, it is odd that he took it to the bush."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Mieville's best work.","review":"I'm a big fan of both Perdido Street Station and The Scar, compared to these earlier works Iron Council was a huge disappointment in both the writing and story.

Everything good in the first two books falls flat in this one. I suspect Mieville was dissatisfied also because he completely changed gears with The City and City. That book is a must read and succeeds on all the levels Iron Council fails at. The City and the City isn't really even a fantasy novel but it seems so much stranger and deeper. It takes you to a place you've never been but will recognize-Iron Council takes you to a graveyard of elements of other, better books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but tedious","review":"This is my first Mieville book, and it was less thrilling than expected. I couldn't get into the characters or the plot, at least til the very end. I found the language almost trying too hard to be \\"unique\\", and it made it less pleasant to read. I'll try it again after I read Perdido Street Station, however."},{"rating":"1","title":"struggling to finish it","review":"Only about 1/4 of the way through, so mabybe this is premature, but jeez, Perdido was so amazing (5 stars) and Scar was nearly as good (4 stars).The incredible prose from the prior novels seems watered down here. And the obsession with the sexual proclivities of Cutter don't add to much of anything [to the story] that I can tell. I'm no prude and not biased; just seemed overdone.I'll finish it, but unlike the other books it's not a story that I just can't wait to continue reading.Perhaps it's time for Mieville to drop New Crobuzon and start afresh.For those that would say I'm missing the point (yes, I know about the socialism and my political leanings are likely close to Mieville's), I don't care about that if it's not a good story. I bought this to be entertained, not for socio-political lessons. I buy different books for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Bas-Lag Book","review":"I read these books in order (Perdido Street Station, The Sar, Iron Council). I have to say the third is my favorite. Great story.

His past two books, \\"Perdido Street Station\\" and \\"The Scar\\" were much more coherent and stronger stories.Luckily, this book does have a good ending and I hope the author will continue to write these very unique stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"lacked the texture and drama of earlier mieville","review":"I keep finding myself wandering away from this novel after devouring the first two bas lag novels. For me, his description of the outlands really lacks the texture of New Crobuzon and the story is missing the drama of the earlier titles. While the novel tries to dramatize revolutionary impulse growing at the edge of a civilization, I think it may be too intellectual an exercise - too abstract."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Well Crafted...","review":"I loved Perdido Street Station, and thought the Scar was quite good, but this one is a real slog. There's very little suspense, and it seems more like a musing rumination than a novel. I sure hope his next will be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A step down from Perdido and The Scar","review":"This is a good book, however there are some weaknesses in it.1) You need to have read Perdido Street Station before reading this book. The explanations and background that he has in his first two Bas-Lag books are not included in this one.2) The first one hundred pages or so are on the weak side. Get through those and the book finds its legs.3) The characters in this book are not as developed as those in the first two Bas-Lag novels. In both PSS and The Scar he focused on one main and one supporting character. In Iron Council he splits his attention between three characters for the duration of the story.That said, it is a good novel. The world is richer than ever, and the setting is well integrated into the events from his other novels. If you enjoyed the first two, you'll like this one, and if you didn't like them avoid this like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"What, exactly, is the point?","review":"Almost completely unreadable. The author's prose obscures the landscape rather than describes it. The characters are stock figures from role playing games. The rhythm of the prose never varies, always landing on the downbeat. The author doesn't seem to want to share his vision as much as he wants to impress the reader with his vocabulary. He neglects the purpose of storytelling.The novel is filled with scenes of vividly described violence that do not further the plot, and sometimes characters seem to exist simply to provide bodies for the author to mutilate. The reader is left with a hazy landscape populated by two-dimensional characters that die in awful ways for no discernible reason than to acquire experience points.I agree with another reviewer - this novel should never have gotten past the editor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bas-Lagomorph","review":"The review by stnmikita almost exactly reflects my own view of Iron Council. Perdido Street Station and The Scar are exsquisite (PDS being the best). But I bogged down in Iron Council and did not finish it. I am re-reading PDS and enjoying it more than I did the first time, if that is possible. Out of my respect for Mieville I will go back and give Iron Council another go."},{"rating":"1","title":"As bad as \\"The Scar\\" was good","review":"If this had been the first book I had read by Mieville, I would never have picked up another. Plot-driven, with a handful of poorly sketched out characters we never come to care about, and a plot that is deliberately left murky long past the point where the reader no longer cares. Every sentence has both a metaphor and a made-up word in it, making for hard slogging through pretension. I put the book down with 40 pages left to go and almost didn't pick it up again; however, I finally relented and read the purported climax when stuck in an airport. If this book had been better written, it would have been a Stephen King novel -- which is still about 30 levels below what Mieville is capable of.All that being said, \\"The Scar\\" is a jewel, surely one of the best books in the genre that I have read in fifteen years. Mieville is a young writer and some unevenness is to be expected. I'm looking forward to his next book and hoping that he recaptures some of his magic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have the German version of this book and it is really, really fabulous.

It seems to assume rather advanced knowledge, and thus might serve as a review for advanced students, but not a learning tool. For example, in working through the fill in the blank exercises for person pronouns, one has to pick the proper pronoun by picking the one that matches the verb tense in the sentence. But how could one have learned the verb tenses without knowing the personal pronouns in the first place? Think about it. I just tossed my copy in the trash out of frustration.

He was with the Tarriers, The Weavers, The Rooftop Singers, plus a couple of 1 album groups. He was one of the most influential performers in the early sixties - playing banjo on dozens of records, opening up new musical vistas on his solo recordings, bringing the 12-string guitar into the limelight - inspiring a mob of aspiring folk singer/players. This album is a lovely mix of old and new - old songs like \\"Sail Away Ladies\\", \\"Old Ben Johnson\\", \\"Jay Gould's Daughter, ..\\" and some of Erik's own songs, \\"A Place in the Hills\\", \\"It Doesn't Matter at all...\\" and especially the title song, \\"Child, Child\\". Erik provides his own harmonies, plays both guitar and banjo - this is him through and through. All of his musical abilities blossom on this one - you'll listen to it over and over and find yourself humming the last one you listened to. A must for old Erik fans and great introduction for new ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"this cable does the job","review":"used this cable to run from my router to my netgear switch, which I have my ROKU plugged into.

The problem I had was the style of story telling and the endless droning effect it had on me. And, the stories themselves were often comprised of various people going about Ireland or the world whacking each other over the head.

My neighbor is a ski resort, so you can imagine the pitch of the roof that lets all that snow slide off! Thanks to the PC roofing nailer I was able to complete the entire roof in two weekends. I had a single jam, which cleared easily, and a couple of misfires when there were only a few nails left in the coil. Reloading was a cinch, as was changing the depth setting. The protective carbide on the unit's side was a nice touch. Not only did they prevent abrasive damage to the nailer, but they provided just enough of a nub to keep the unit from sliding. We had two falls during the job. In one case the nailer slid off the roof and banged down the rungs of the ladder. The second time my wife grabbed it by the airhose coupling and uncoupled it; the nailer fell 16 feet to the dirt. Both accidents resulted in cosmetic damage only; the nailer kept plugging away!A very impressive piece of work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"do NOT buy this get the senco","review":"I noticed about 50% of the reviews on this thing were bad and I bought it anyway.

I think I actually broke it while unjamming it the 3rd time - the nails were stuck half out and I had to really pry them out hard. Not only that but when it did work about 30% of the nails were not flush. So I returned it to home depot and got the senco 40R and so far it hasnt jammed and all nails are flush.

It's weird for me to like these movies because I'm a 14 year old girly teenager. I keep it a secret that I like these.It's about two guys named Slats and Oliver who get enrolled in an all-girls school and try to save it from being closed. To do it, they end up having to raise a certain ammount of money, I think. OK, so I can't remember all of it. But I remember it in general. ^_^; It was still funny too. It was pretty good, overlooking that horrible scene near the end where there's a choir performance or something, and one of the girls lipsinks(or tries to lipsink) while a male voice is playing. It's so unbelievably bad that it's funny.Overall, if you like black-and-white slapstick comedies, you'll probably like this one. :D"},{"rating":"2","title":"Caretakers","review":"Down on their luck Abbott & Costello manage to find jobs as caretakers for an all girl school.

Including when they first arrive at their room in the school and are told to clean it up, Costello manages to find himself in a very \\"sticky\\" situation presenting itself as one of the funniest scenes in any of the Abbott & Costello classic...also not to be missed Costello recreates one of the most popular 3 Stooges scenes in which Curly wrestles with some raw Oyster soup...Costello does fairly well in his imitation.

Rather, much like every character in this book, you have to completely deactivate your brain, because that's the only way you're going to accept the initial premise of rogue Israelis nuking New York City, probably the most stereotypically Jewish city on Earth outside of Israel, resulting in a Fox News pundit's nightmare of the US somehow converting en masse to al-Qaeda-style Islam. Seriously, why would there be a complete transplanting of Arab culture here like some bad episode ofSliders - The First and Second Seasons?Unless this is a satire and I completely missed the joke, this comes off as pandering to a crowd that uses the term \\"homicide bomber\\" and still hasn't figured out that acting like a bloodthirsty, trigger-happy berserker isn't the best way to sell Christianity in all its variations to the religiously unaffiliated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I give it no stars?","review":"The work of an ambitious teen, this novel sets out to capitalise on an incoherent American foreign policy.

And a shameless writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Hooked Me","review":"I kept waiting for the story to draw me into the book, but it just never happened. If I were to attach a label, I would designate this as a 'concept' work. In other words, without the underlying concept of an Islamic nation governing on U.S. soil, the book really did not offer anything to make it stand out.I'll give the author credit for attempting to tackle a topic sure to make many Americans uneasy, but the characters simply did not lift a run of the mill story. Behind the curtain of the Islamic concept, the general plot could have been easily transformed into countless other political storylines.With a relatively bland storyline, the characters need to shine. In this case, with the excpetion of Darwin, all of the characters have been done before in different settings. I may still give the sequal a chance, as the concept is an interestine one. But, I'm hoping the characters develop some depth and the plot adds some true intrigue."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll be Burning the Midnight Oil to Finish It","review":"If you have ever wondered what a page turner is-- read this book. Others, and the professional reviewers, have summarized the plot. The details of the background are chilling-- chadors in many colors and designs-- but all chadors designed to cover a woman's face, Disneyland in ruins, the woods outside of Seattle home to renegades and unsafe to pass, the destruction of Mount Rushmore. the details are chilling because the well-informed reader will know they are a faithful reflection of the way things are today in some part of the Muslim world.

Harrison is being too modest: he's far more talented (at least if this book serves as an example). It had some potential, but the whole Muslim America things started to feel stale and forced by the end of the novel, and the action was pretty sparse. Lots of descriptions of American cities under Muslim thrall, but the descriptions never \\"came to life\\". It had none of the resonance of The Handmaid's Tale, which everyone loves to compare it to. It's a tired, rehashed story of a bad guy chasing a good guy chasing after a girl, with an uneven plot that wears thin about halfway through.

The bands are also quite terrible. God Called in Sick Today had to be one of the worst covers on the album. I Wanna Mohawk was terrible too. Not because it was too different from the original song, but because it was made by sluts! They also changed the lyrics, which is something you shouldn't do in a \\"Tribute Album\\". Weeb stayed pretty true to 31/2, but it was much weaker than the original. I mean, 31/2 was one of the most intense and vicious AFI songs. The band that did Ever and a Day, although weaker than the original, actually knew how to sing! (SURPRISE) Don't buy this album, and don't buy the \\"Best of the Nitro\\" CD either. It doesn't even have the best nitro songs on it!(It's also another attempt to rip off AFI)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only one star because there isnt a Negative","review":"Where on earth can anyone begin to decribe this horror!!!!

Not one of these bands could carry a tune if it was in a freakin basket!!!! AFI music should be left for Davey to sing. His voice is far too beautiful to be butchered in such a way as these bands did. My boyfriend and I were both even offended by this CD. It is really that bad!!!!

I would love to slap the moron that decided to put Totalimmortal on there. Don't get me wrong, it's an awesome song, but you can't put a cover of a song that AFI didn't even originally do on a tribute album.

AFI is one of the best bands out there, and this CD just ripped their songs to shreds. all the singers are untalented, and can hardly hold a note to save their lives. the remake of \\"I wanna mohawk\\" was just... crap. i dont even want to know what these singers were thinking when they thought that they could pull something like this off. i think the only track on this album that was halfway decent was Now the World, and even that was incredibly annoying to have to sit through.save yourself and please STAY AWAY FROM THIS CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"GCIST...pretty goodI Wanna Mohawk But Mom Won't Let Me Get One...butcheredMalleus Maleficarum...pretty goodHigh School Football Hero....I couldn't even last through all 30 seconds of the demo, it was so badly murderedTotalimmortal..not badGNG....oh God....Let It Be Broke....God no!Ever and a Day...okay I guess3...NODays of the Phoenix...alrightPerfect Fit...BAD BAD BADNow the World....pretty goodFor the record, that Merily Weeber singer is terrible.

This album was supposed to be another artists rendition of the album, not a complete copy of AFI.That being said, the album is terrible anyways. Some reviewers were just lieing to themselves; the selection of artists for this compilation is horrid, and the CD should never have been published. There are a few notable exceptions: GCIST cover is well done, I don't mind it; Now the World COULD have been better, but I think it was descent. That's about it though, everything else is just not worth mentioning.I hope some of you find this review helpful.

I don't even have the album; I just listened to the samples. Wow. The singer in 'God Called in Sick' sounds like he's puking the lyrics, and the backing vocals are way out of tune. Malleus Maleficarum-what's with the guy whispering the lyrics?! Did he listen to the AFI version? And Totalimmortal-that is a DISGRACE. AFI songs are not to be done by Josie and the Pussycats imitation bands. That song was slaughtered, quartered, and torched. I have never cringed so much listening to music...even my school's lab band plays better than these bands do. No one can cover AFI (The Offspring were the only ones who came close, with their version of Totalimmortal); you have to listen to the real thing itself.

They butchered most of the AFI songs but the main reason I wanted to write this review was to comment on one of the previous reviews. First of all, \\"The Days of the Phoenix\\" isn't a hidden track and it's not an Offsring song, it was written by Davey Havok. For that matter \\"Totalimmortal,\\" is not an Offspring song either. Another thing, don't call \\"Very Proud of Ya\\" the undisputed masterpiece. \\"Undisputed\\"means that nobody disagrees and people STILL argue over that. The Art of Drowning is my personal favorite. Also, \\"Black Sails in the Sunset\\" has no racial messages and there is no swastica in the art.

I love AFI as much as the next guy does and I can see why you would want to buy this but please do yourself a favor. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT waste your money on this. The singers from these bands are horrible, at least when doing AFI covers. The singing was probably the worst part. I actually kinda liked the Mohawk song but her style of singing did not match what the song was trying to convey. So bottom line, horrible tribute album.

It was bad enough that the bands were lacking in talent, but the fact that they attempted to re-create worship-worthy songs was a huge mistake.

Honestly, though, it is truly horrific. The covers either sound like poorly-played note-for-note reproductions of the originals with a different vocalist or they completely abolish any spirit of the original that they could have had, turning the experience of listening to it to a drudgery. What's more, at least one of the bands (the Independents) have been quoted as saying they don't even like AFI; they just did it for the money.

No extra content and all the old enemies to classic TV are in this boxset, or are not in it, but I'd rather have half this set with no extras than ALL of every single show currently in 'sin'-dication with tons of extras. Jackie, Art, Joyce, and Audrie have touched my life forever and 'interviews' wouldn't make this boxset any sweeter.All I can hope for is a similar attention be paid to the Lost Episodes, as it stands now, I'm sticking with the VHS tapes on those.

There is no need to say what I think about the series. It is outstanding. The classic 39 episodes have been around in syndication since the 1950s, which speaks for itself.If you are a fan of this series, then this is the ultimate way to view them: crystal clear, in airdate order, unedited, and in a compact and very attractive box set.I also own the entire LOST EPISODES series. Although there are some fine scripts there as well, none of them truly compare to these classic episodes.The honeymoon lives on and on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Right Price for an amazing collection","review":"While it's annoying that the audio on the pilot episode is sub-par, the rest of the series sounds great. Consider that they are charging three times as much for the first season of I Love Lucy (that was only 36 episodes instead of the 39 for the Honeymooners), I have no qualms with the quality on this boxset.Long as you can see Alice's eyes, hear Ralph's promises, and watch the strange motions of Norton, that's enough remastering and quality control that I need.What really sinks in rewatching these episodes is how there was a class warfare between Ralph and Norton. Ralph and Alice lived in poverty while Norton and Trixie had a middle class life a floor above them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"This dvd collection will keep you busy, so many classic episodes to watch!

It is good looking,well laid out and has inputs for the common flash memory types including xd and a regular usb input for flash memory modules. The picture is good at normal viewing angles, the 800 by 600 screen a very big plus, and it handles 640 by 480 videos fine. I think these are the basics for a good \\"frame\\".The sound, which is not crucial to me is not very good. You do have to reduce the size of large jpg files to something more moderate or the slide show feature will slow down a lot. The remote is not intuitive.Despite these drawbacks, which I regard as relatively minor, I think this is a nice frame and a very good value."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice","review":"This digital frame is very attractive.

It is more than I expected. The picture quality is great for an 8\\" display and the sound is very acceptable. It came with an earphone jack, though that wasn't clear in the specifications but it is definately there. That it does not have it's own internal memory may be one of the best attributes because it is so easy to load what you want on a flash drive or other memory device that it accepts and the device \\"takes it from there.\\" I would definately recommend this. My Mom has it on her night stand where she can turn it on or off and there is never a worry that the batteries will run out because it neatly plugs into the wall outlet. I can see another one of these in my not to distant future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy at your own risk!!!","review":"I had high hopes for this Coby digital picture frame.The specs looked great, and the price was right.Unfortunately, I received this product with a major defect.

There are many talented singers in the choir, all versatile in their ability to touch or excite or involve the audience. This CD does a nice job of involving most of those singers, with a number of solos highlighting their individual strong points. \\"Much More Than This\\" displays Chadwick's talent to croon, Margaret's spine-tingling pitch and push in \\"Can't You See I Love you So,\\" Carolyn's sweet but rootsy voice in \\"Everything Will be Alright,\\" and Porter's versatility is seen in many of the tracks. This album is a collection of good singles, illustrating the church's focus on love and high spirits, and takes a more modern - almost pop/R&B - take to the traditional subject matter and instruments of gospel. Also a bonus, all the tracks are live - so you can get a feel for the involvement of the crowd."},{"rating":"2","title":"No better snack","review":"I recently learned about this product and tried it, and I love all of the flavors.

My disappointment grew as I made my way through the book. I did not once stop to ponder on advice that was given, I read about simplistic rules, \\"the use of space is important\\", \\"functionality over conventionality\\".

I look forward to reading the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A glimpse into what made Longmire into the man he is","review":"I only have one complaint about this book and that's that it was just too short on the flashback end. It felt like a teaser, a quick gloss-over, of a fantastic story. The modern day storyline was an interesting and sad one too. Human trafficking is a touchy issue that Mr. Johnson handled well. I love the characters in this series and can't wait to go back for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Past and Present","review":"I enjoyed this story, although I thought the identity of the killer was never even a question. The Wyoming setting is beautifully depicted. The characters are consistent from book to book. In this particular story, a young Vietnamese woman is found murdered in Walt Longmire's jurisdiction. In her purse is a photo of Walt when he was in Vietnam, more than thirty years earlier. The story contains Walt's flashbacks to Vietnam. These are few and short, but they tell a story within the main story. As always, the dialogue between Henry Standing Bear and Walt is the highlight of the book.The characters in this series have always seemed too stereotyped to me: the good-hearted cook, the absent-minded former sheriff, the foul-mouthed female deputy from Philadelphia, and so on. I wish they had more complexity, less predictability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Phenomenal Book","review":"This is another phenomenal book from Craig Johnson. This one takes us back to Wyoming, and to Walt Longmire's experiences in Vietnam. And, the two are related. As the story unfolds, you understand the relationships between a case in Vietnam regarding a drug dealer and a case in Los Angeles... Well, I'm not going to hint the ending because it will ruin this book for you. Because, as usual, what makes Craig Johnson's books so good are the twists in the story and the larger than life characters. In this book, there is still of course, Henry, the \\"Cheyenne Nation\\". But, then we also get to meet Virgil and the \\"Crow contingent\\". It's that sort of Western humor that keeps bringing me back to Craig's books and also it's the story line and the characters. I highly recommend this and every book of Craig Johnson's and I look forward to his next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shoes hard to fill","review":"Craig Johnson is at the top of his genre with characters who feel like family and believable intricate plots. His dialogue is sharp and entertaining and rings absolutely true. He likes BIG men, physical giants, powerful in every way, capable of wreaking havoc and taking incredible physical abuse, but they're sleepers - quiet and self-deprecating and wry. Because each plot occurs on the heels of the previous, there's a continuum in the lives of his ever-expanding cast. This novel's crime leads Craig's sheriff Longmire back in time to Vietnam."},{"rating":"2","title":"Walt Longmire Series","review":"I love these books, they are well written, truly reflective of the area and great reads! I can't wait for more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Walt Longmire is a hero","review":"Craig Johnson is the best kept secret in mystery books. Thankfully the Longmire television show lead me to his books and each one of them captures you and takes you to Absaroka County. I am a strong reader but still find that I can reread this group of books, learning more and enjoying it all over again. Don't miss Sheriff Longmire's stories of murder, love and life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable mystery with intriguing characters","review":"He is an excellent writer. He captures the nuances of social relationships in a small western town very well while writing a good mystery as well. I think fans of the mystery genre who enjoy say Louise Penny or Elizabeth George would enjoy these. There is more humor in these though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Man's Moccasins","review":"I like the Longmire series and plan to read them all. Johnson's style is witty and his characters well-developed. He uses flashbacks and sometimes shifts time frames but it all works out and readers are pleasantly surprised. He builds on what has happened previously and his characters interesting. You never know what the usual will be at the cafe."},{"rating":"2","title":"sheriff","review":"the tv series introduced me to walt longmire and i really liked it-then i found the books and i absolutely love this tough and sexy yet softhearted sheriff.read one and you can't wait to read the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Bad","review":"I loved the first three Sheriff Longmire series but I think this one fell short. Too much in Vietnam and too much foreign language, the new charachters were slightly flat, and I am hoping that the next book will be more in the line of the first three. Disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sequential Series","review":"The author's books seem to be sequential, so you'd better start with the first and work your way up to this one. This one had a confusing story line because it assumed reader knowledge about the book's characters. Flashbacks throughout and a required a suspension of disbelief had me racing to get to the end, the last two pages of which I didn't even bother with. Go with C.J. Box or Ridley Pearson instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"My New Favorite Author","review":"If you haven't read any of Craig Johnson's books yet - pick one up. You won't be disappointed.

Was hoping to get a play costume instead of just something for trick-or-treating that he would never wear again. The size was correct. The first one I received seemed dusty and my son had it one for all of 5 minutes before the inseam in the pants just totally separated. I called Amazon because it was Friday the week before Halloween and I couldn't wait for the return. As has always been my experience, they were fantastic and shipped me a new one with Saturday delivery immediately. I returned the defective one and it all went smoothly. The second one was cleaner and I tugged on the inseam to test it. It held up just fine. He wore it trick-or-treating, to school and multiple times since to pretend to be a police man and it is still going strong. We lost one button, but that was mostly due to the belt we had put around the waist rubbing on the thread for the button."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality is very low.","review":"Got this for my son for Halloween.

The costume was very durable. The badge that was on the costume did not look at all authentic, so I bought a separate badge and pinned it on over it. My other disappointment with the costume was the hat. I really had to work with it to make it somewhat resemble a police officer hat. It is soft, and not like a real hat. Plus the brim was made of vinyl and was bent during packaging. I DO NOT recommend the police belt that is sold separate from the costume. It is extremely cheaply made. The belt did not stay buckled so we had to tie a knot in it so he could keep it on. The packaging boasts a working flashlight which was a joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripped","review":"My grandson didn't even get to wear this for halloween because it ripped really bad when he put it on."},{"rating":"1","title":"too bad","review":"I bought two of this costume one is for my son second is for my niece but the quality of this costume is soo poor.

It teaches that moms and dads may leave you and be fallible and that divorce is caused by living in a sinful world. Our situation was an abusive situation, and my kids don't need more fear that now mom is going to leave them too, just like dad. That some spirit is going to take care of them, not some real person. I just think that people need to know that this is a religious book, if you are religious you will probably like it, but for those who are not, you will feel like it is warping to a young mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"a waste of an evening","review":"I was very disappointed in this book.

But it seemed like one of those movies that just fall away from you once you leave the theater.

The characters were just tossed in and nothing was delved into. It bored me to tears. The inside jacket of the book was more entertaining than the entire novel. I would NEVER compare it to Bridget Jones because those two books are far more amusing than The Perfect Elizabeth. I was extremely disappointed by how shallow this book was.

Here we have another 20 something novel that starts off all fun and funky and then drizzles out to a boring 100 page essay. I was really pumped when I began this book because it had some fun quirks. One sister spends all of her time working on a thesis about British comfort foods, whilst the other sister hops from job to job (a dog walker to a pool cleaner). Doesn't that sound like this book could have some excellent comedic appeal. Well it's all a facade because half way through the book just lost it's charm and I struggled to finish the hardback I had stupidly purchased.

I am glad to see character-driven works like this make it into book form. Reading it over the course of one or two days (short-punchy) feels like making a new, entertaining friend. Written in first person by Liza, the younger sister, she simply babbles on and on about her boyfriend, her coworkers, her career crises, her parents and, of course, the other half of her \\"perfect Elizabeth,\\" her sister Bette. It's similar to Bridget Jones, but Liza is not quite as self-loathing-or as funny. While it failed to make me laugh out loud, it is light and humorous and I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"sniveling","review":"OK.. this book is certainly not worth the price on the cover. It is written in a disjointed forced humour approach, sort of like a poor rendition of a bad Seinfeld episode (and I liked the earlier Seinfeld episodes)!

It's flimsy and loose at the joint so you can't really adjust the height or angle very well. It's only one sided so there's no full view side. I wouldn't have minded that so much, but the worst part was how dim the lighting was. Just a little 4 watt bulb lights this thing and it's a joke. unfortunately, the poor lighting makes this mirror useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good sampler","review":"If you're unfamiliar with the who's who in melodic metal nowadays, you owe it to yourself to pick up one or two of these Metal Dreams CDs, courtesy of Nuclear Blast, the best metal label on the planet. Vol. 1 features 17 metal ballads, branching into the genres of neo-classical power metal (Hammerfall, Stratovarius, Sinner), symphonic gothic metal (Therion, Amorphis) and melodic death metal (Hypocrisy, Dismal Euphony). Personal favorite cuts come from Primal Fear, Love Like Blood, Therion, Lacrimosa and Hypocrisy. Crematory's \\"Tale\\" is probably my overall favorite, with its beautiful keyboard intro and soaring vocals. A few weak tracks prevent this compilation from besting its successor, Metal Dreams Vol. 2, and I think it could have included a few songs from Nightwish or the Gathering. All in all, a very solid effort from Nuclear Blast. I also highly recommend Vol. 2, which is significantly better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good General Purpose upholstery staple","review":"These staples work well in the US58, feeding with no problems.

You may want to avoid using this staple in applications where you are attaching fabric to very densely grained woods or very thin plywood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great staple, poor packaging.","review":"I would give the staples themselves five stars - they perform as expected. I'd rate the product four stars overall due to poor packaging. The small paper box the staples come in (from the factory) opened inside of the much larger Amazon box. Result: broken strips of staples all over the inside of the box. The ends of the box should be taped. I was still able to use most of them, but it was a pain.

It has a narrative that explains the nuclear power industry, and an overview of how the plant operates: Its key components, etc. However, this is not a scholarly work, and seems to be geared more toward a jr high student level. I used it to explain nuclear power to my children. The pictures are also excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thorough description of Gaudi's design methods.","review":"If you are reading this, you are either an architect, an aficionado of architecture, or you are fascinated by Gaudi. Sure you already know that Gaudi used hanging weights and strings to design his structures. But did you ever notice that of each set of towers of the transept, two are closer together than the other two? Do you know what a hyperbolic parabaloid is? Have you ever seen computer drawn cross sections of the columns of the nave? Did you know that the column surfaces are made of interfering geometric shapes? Mr. Burry, an architect on the Sagrada Familia staff, describes this, the history behind the construction, and more about this magnificent church-to-be. The book includes sections with detailed photographs and drawings of the nave and the two facades of the transept."},{"rating":"2","title":"If You Like the Blues This is for you...","review":"I had heard Charlie in a few songs and decided to pull this down.

I see a great potential in this book to teach anyone Solid Works. I bet no one shall need a teacher if using this book. Designing a part to assembling it and creating detailed drawings, everything in a single book with such a clear explanation and self explanatory graphics is extremely commendable. I recommend this book to every user of Solid Works.Martin LambMechanical Design EngineerStafford, UK"},{"rating":"2","title":"Soildworks the Typo","review":"I found the book to be far more instructional than reference, but then so is the Bible. It will make for a good learning/transitional vehicle for those already in the industry shifting from wireform composition to the more customer friendly \\"Solid\\" format. Solidworks for Designers will also be a valuable tool in the education of future designers. However, textbooks rarely make for quick and efficient referencing. I'm sure the answers are all in here, but are described in detail as a series of gradual steps not abreviated down to if-then statements.The typo, on my copy and to my horror, finds \\"Soildworks\\" written down the spine in the title. Of all the possible misspellings I think they found the worst. In my workplace we've written SOLIDWORKS down the page edges and have the spine facing inward on the shelf to keep customers from seeing the defective literature from whence we draw information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I spected","review":"The autocad book of this author was great, and that was the reason I purchase the solid work one , but I am disappointed because I don't learn anything o this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not use this book for reference!","review":"This book has very limited use for reference.

Besides the large defect on the outside, the text doesn't seem to contain anything that breathtaking, the SolidWorks tutorial in the program seems to cover what I need(and my job is mostly solidworks modeling as an engineer at a startup).

It sounds excellent with classical music. I played a recording of the Alpine Symphony of Richard Strauss and It masters symphonic music quite well. Every detail of the music is heard. I am impressed. It tracks very well in the inner groove. Distortion is minimal. This is an audiophile turntable and is comparable to tables of much higher price range. It is the best table in its price range. It also has the look of elegance because of the wood casing and makes it look like furniture rather than electronic equipment. I highly recommend this turntable to anyone who is seeking to upgrade the sound of their record collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank goodness for the library","review":"Just when I thought things couldn't get any worse, another of my favorite romance authors moves further into the realm of \\"mainstream\\" fiction.

I usually read her books in one/two days - I can't put them down. The sensual side of the relationship was missing (basically a fade out). Her main characters did not set off sparks.

Hope Jayne reads her reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"IS THIS BOOK SUPPOSED TO BE A ROMANCE NOVEL?","review":"I think Jayne Ann has gone more in the General Fiction market than romance. I have been reading her books for years since her Stephanie James days and have always enjoyed her.

This book was to be romantic suspense, but where was the romance?

Many other reviewers have covered its benefits, but let me add two.First, its very well written and easy to understand. No matter your level, you will gain from this book.Second, the author has a discussion web site and has been great at answering questions about RS. You usually get an answer within 24 hrs.Definitely worth the money and time to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect companion to a new product!","review":"The best feature of this book is the example apps, and the realistic business problems being discussed. Chapter 2 goes straight into a discussion of RDL and uses an ad-hoc reporting tool for the example! Excellent! This was just what I needed! The chapters on custom code, security, and extending RS are also very well written and informative. So many early books on a topic are loaded down with fluff and/or a rehash of the online help, this book is so much better than that! The author obviously has spent a lot of time solving real problems with RS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Logical with a practitioner's perspective","review":"The author does an excellent job of presenting the information from a practitioner's standpoint instead of a purely academic standpoint.

I got the action figures, saw the movies dozens of times, all that stuff. I'm definitely a STAR WARS KID.But the truth is, this Robot Chicken episode just isn't all that funny. I got way more enjoyment out ofFamily Guy - Blue Harvest, because it was a straight-up parody, not this disjointed rapid-fire collection of random sketches. I've always found Robot Chicken to be hit-and-miss, but I expected more from this highly-touted episode.Now, if you find yourself among the folks who DID like it, you'll be thrilled by all the extras. Personally, I don't think this very average piece of work warrants so many bonus features."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Yo Ma-Ma Fight !\\"","review":"I, as a Robot Chicken fan, bought Robot Chicken: Star Wars with little haste. I defiantly do not regret that. I have watched five times and I still laugh. My only problem is lack of story, though it can be forgiven for this is Robot Chicken.

I'm familiar enough that I get most of the (obvious at least) jokes, and its certainly given me a new found respect for Admiral Ackbar. This special has some of the funniest bits they've ever done on Robot Chicken and is well worth the price. The extras are amazing, it even has 7 different commentaries. Bottom line, if you love Robot Chicken, you need this DVD and if you've never heard of Robot Chicken then this is a great introduction to it.

I may not necessarily agree with everything the book has to say about this or that, but if you dislike a book because it doesn't back up everything you believe then you've got a problem. In fact, if that describes you, if you are the kind of person who gets all freaked out every time somebody disagrees with you to any degree, then don't buy this book. Because you won't get it.But if, on the other hand, you are the kind of person who actually thinks about his or her life and the consequences of your ideals and beliefs, then this book is right up your ally.

This particular one, however, is just not to my personal liking. I'm sure those who like blues/jazz types will like this, however. I'm just not that type. Even the Amazing Grace song is so jazzed up that I would have to call it secular music style. At any rate, my 2 stars would be zero (for my own personal taste) other than that the artists are excellent musicians.

The paucity of exercises is NOT a weakness of this book. On the contrary, the exercises in the book are carefully chosen and serve to illustrate and reinforce the theory really well.

Quite apart from his personal ties with this history, however, the story is worth telling-- and he tells it well. Killian was tri-lingual, a theologian, a poet, an intellectual, but he became displaced, trapped, on the Texas frontier. He is remembered as a village pastor, but his parishioners hardly knew what he could have been. Surely such stories were common among immigrants. Some, found it possible to express their genius in new and creative ways. Others felt they had misread the opportunities in this new land and never realized their potential.

The plot twists kept you guessing until the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that great","review":"I just finished reading the book by James Patterson, which was great, so I had some high expectations for the movie. The movie wasn't all that bad, but it was lacking. There is so much action in the book and I just don't understand why they didn't put more of that action into the movie. If half of the action scenes from the book were included in the movie, I guaruntee I would have given it at least two more stars. The worst part of the movie, in my opinion is when Alex Cross just so happens to guess the completely improbable password for Jezzie's computer. Not only that, but she has a picture of her rental house and all its information on her computer. Who does that?! Since he got all the information about the house on Jezzie's computer, he goes to the house and saves the day. That scene ruined the movie for me. If you liked the movie and haven't read the book, I strongly recommend reading it. The book truly puts the movie to shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Kiss The Girls","review":"I think Morgan Freeman was superb, as always. I was pleasantly surprised with the acting of Monica Potter though. I think that the suspense was great, with plenty of twists through the movie. It was much better than Kiss The Girls in fact, a movie I could figure the \\"bad-guy\\" out before it was half over. The only bad thing I can say about the movie, is the car crash in the beginning. It looked terrible, and was too obvious it had been done on computers. If you enjoy drama/suspense films, you'll surely enjoy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak, hurried, unbelievable","review":"This was a thrown together movie to get on the screen and look good and make some money...quickly. At least it sure seemed that way to me. They did not challenge the audience to think, they just threw some ridiculous twists in. Could have been much better and it does NOT compare with Kiss The Girls except the Freeman is in both. KTG was much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the two worst movies I've paid to see","review":"I am more than game for willful suspension of disbelief, but this film exceeded even my limits. Despite the great Morgan Freeman, the complete implausibility of the story and the wretched Ms. Potter overwhelmed. Even Freeman seemed to be phoning this one in.The other was The Lawnmower Man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Terrible","review":"Alright, alright, let's begin. I love Morgan Freeman, but this movie was horrendous. I've read the Alex Cross books. I understand you can't make a movie perfectly from the book. Unfortunately, James Patterson sold his soul in order to make a buck. The plot is basically the same, but the sequences are far different. The outcomes are different. The inability to use the names in the book? I mean Megan Rose instead of Maggie Rose? Is it really that big of a deal to use the name that was written in the book. Is it going to effect the plot of the movie? Later on, something happens in the movie that makes it IMPOSSIBLE to create the motion picture for \\"Cat and Mouse\\". It just keeps getting worse for us fans of the books.Besides that, the acting wasn't anything up to Morgan Freeman standards. The twist was decent, but could have been written out a little better. It's just not a movie I would recommend to anyone who likes the books. Unfortunately, I have a bias opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst thriller ever? It's a contender!","review":"This is a contrived, goofy, badly-made film with no suspense or surprising twists.The story opens with Morgan Freeman witnessing the Death of His Partner. The manner of this death is more laughable than sad. A rapist decides to engage in sexual assault while cruising at high speed along a dam. In a convertible. (what could go wrong?) And this establishes the logic-defying mayhem which ensues.The villain (or is he?) of the film is a wackjob with a penchant for bad disguises. ..In point of fact, this movie is similar to The Jackal remake, and not in a postive way. Morgan Freeman does what he can with the material, which is admirable, but even he seems moronic when he can't spot the Traitor In the Police Force as quickly as the audience can. (Specifically, Scene One.)One of those worst movies I've ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing but curds and whey","review":"Morgan Freeman returns as Det. Alex Cross and teams with Secret Service agent Monica Potter to find a senator's kidnapped daughter. Hollywood churns out yet another safe adaptation of a blockbuster best seller. The plot lurches along, introducing characters and abandoning them (Jay O. Sanders), and wrapping itself up with a tidy conclusion. Freeman is outstanding, as always, but the rest of the cast cannot back him up. Tamahori's direction is fine, except for a terrible CGI car crash in the opening minutes. The surprise ending is okay, but I read the novel and knew what would happen. No vision, no suspense, no repeat viewings. The little girl is filmdom's smartest kidnap victim, but Michael Moriarty and Penelope Ann Miller are utterly wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Morgan Freeman play any other character?","review":"I mean really...all of the movies I've see him in. He plays the same damn character. Staunch and starchy. I guess you always know what to expect in his movies.As far as this movie goes. It's definitely a rental. Story lags at times and the surprises arent really surprising."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could this have been more boring?","review":"I saw this movie at the theater when it first opened and thought it was a snoozefest.The acting was sub-par, the plot was predictable, the \\"twists\\" weren't twisty enough. In short, this is a so-so movie that just happens to have one of today's best actors wasting away in it: Morgan Freeman.Normally, the presence of Mr. Freeman is enough to elevate any movie to a level higher than two stars. However, if it hadn't been for him, I would have given this movie one star. I thought it was that bad.In fact, all back-of-the-box blurbs regarding its \\"suspense\\" and \\"mystery\\" and \\"surprises\\" aside, this is the kind of movie you'll want to rent before you buy it. And rent the VHS, too, spending the least amount of money you can. For heaven's sake, do NOT buy this movie -- especially on the more expensive DVD format -- before you watch it. You're likely to sorely regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the Book please! The movie is a bomb!","review":"Along came a spider was the first book from James Patterson that set me on my coarse to reading all his books. I couldn't wait to see the movie.

It is a mystery/crime drama that by the very nature of its plot would seem to bee ho hum, seen them all. But with the performances of Freeman and Potter it is raised quite a few notches.Not your first movie to rent but certainly not on the bottom of the pile either, maybe 70% of the way through the \\"view list\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hitting Twist","review":"This is another of Morgan Freeman's hit movies.

There were so many possible suspects and so many twists and turns that pretty soon you didn't know who possibly did it. Now, this wasn't even as good as the book was, but that's pretty much typical. Theres too much in a book to get it all in the movie and have it all make sense (those who read the book will understand, especially one of the characters in the movie from the book). But they did a good job in this movie with what they did do.How good book and good actor make a good movie.

Typical James Patterson story. He captures your attention from the beginning. Streaming of sound was jerky throughout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Was on the edge of MY seat","review":"This movie is typical James Patterson, which is not to say its bad or predictible. In fact, the only predictible thing about this movie is that it is unprecdictible. And although this is an edge of your seat, suspense filled thriller, if you've read (or seen) one James Patterson book, you've read them all.As far as comparing it to the book, I couldnt say because it is the one Patterson book that I havent read, but I did read and see \\"Kiss the Girls\\". Of course the book was a thousand times better.All in all, this is a very good movie. Very suspensful and well worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saw it coming a mile away!!","review":"Good acting, fare story line, some what predictable.

I was pleasently surprised to find that the movie was a lot more complex than that. The story takes on a few twists and turns and the ending is great. My only gripe is Monica Potters acting near the end of the movie is a little weak and unconvincing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Well, it's hard to completely blame the filmmakers for this stinker when the book that it came from isn't well-written either. However, there's so much of this movie that doesn't make sense and, when you're making a suspense/thriller, it helps if the situations are plausible, and audience members don't shake their heads in disgust upon the denoument. I won't tell you who did the crimes, but I'm only saving you about five minutes of time: once you're that far into the movie, you'll have it all figured out. The movie borrows heavily from \\"Seven,\\" \\"Silence of the Lambs,\\" and another, much better Morgan Freeman movie, \\"Kiss the Girls.\\" That was also written by James Patterson, but the director managed to make it a decent movie anyway. Watch any of those, they won't insult your intelligence quite as much."},{"rating":"1","title":"An overall bore..........","review":"This movie was so dull! I'm surprised by this, as I liked Kiss the Girls, and Morgan Freeman is usually in pretty decent films. I have to say, though, that this was really horrible. Monica Potter was utterly unconvincing and her character pretty unlikeable. Come to think of it, I really didn't like any of the characters....or I should say, I didn't care one bit about them. Considering the story is about the kidnapping of a senator's young daughter, one would at least anticipate feeling sympathy and sorrow for the innocent child, but this film can't even deliver a \\"gimme\\" such as that! The plot was mucky and I honestly could have turned this movie off at any point and not given it another thought, such was my unconcern for the ending. However, I did endure the movie to its long-awaited end, so I can reliably express to you that it's not worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak and Predictable","review":"Should have read the reviews before I got this video. About five minutes in, I already knew what would happen. Totally predictable. Freeman is good, he always is. But the plot is more suited to a made-for-TV movie. The plot devices are all wrong (two secret service agents posted full time at the school of an obscure Senator's daughter?; the Russian president's son attends a US private school??; the Washington metro line that runs under Union Station doesn't come out of the ground in Virginia; nobody could run from the Watergate to Union Station in a few minutes in street clothes like Freeman does). Just weak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Along Came A Horrible Movie","review":"Fans of James Patterson's suspenseful, clever book Along Came A Spider will be deeply disappointed with this tepid thiller. The screenwriters seem to have cut what they wanted out of the book, then added their own twists and turns to the hacked-up remains. Morgan Freeman, while a great actor, is entirely too old to be playing DC detective Alex Cross. Monica Potter was also a bad choice for FBI special agent Jezzie Flanigan. If you haven't read the book, it's entirely possible that you may like this film, but if you have read it, then avoid this movie at all costs. When leaving the theater, you could definitely tell who had read it and who hadn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"read the book instead","review":"You may think that this movie is good, and has a creative plot, but if you read the book then see the movie, you will be very disappointed. the ending is completly different; it comes off like they just got sick of making the movie to they ended as fast as they could. Another I dont like about this is that Morgan Freeman plays Alex Cross, in an official book review, he is compared to Denzel Wshington...no offence to Freeman, but he's no Denzel.

I had to re-read the book after seeing it. The only things taken from the book are the names and the title. The book fleshes out the character of Gary Soneji. The movie not only does the movie keep Soneji character in the background but they kill him off at the end. Fans of the Alex Cross books know that Soneji is in two other books after this one. If you haven't read the book, you will enjoy the movie. My advice is to read the book.

It's one of those thrillers that try to be creepy by alluding to childhood stories and weaving unsettling nursery rhymes into the soundtrack. Little Megan is the daughter of a senator who gets abducted by her history teacher; luckily, she is a graduate of the Macauley Culkin School of Hi-Jinks and Shenanigans and is smart enough to outwit her captor. Aside from a few unexpected twists, the film is basically so predictable from the start that it's pointless to even sit through it at all. The stage is set and, like robotic toys, the actors march dutifully through their motions. Scenes progress as they should, it all happens as it's been programmed to, and we walk out of the theater none the wiser."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it!","review":"If you've seen Kiss the Girls, You've seen this.

Greenwald makes his own religious ambivalence abundantly clear, even as he opens each chapter with a buddhist lesson which, one presumes, has somehow affected him. Careful to always capitalize God to the point of sanctimony, I was distracted by his ego-centric sidebar willingness to poke fun at all the other gods he encountered on his travels. Finally, in the end, I concluded Mr. Greenwald, apparently an anxious, scorekeeping traveler, elected to commercially trade on his knowledge of this part of the world in a way which left this reader feeling trespassed."},{"rating":"1","title":"consumerist hippie buddhism","review":"This book starts out in a very promising manner and during the first 20 pages or so I was looking forward to a good read. But it soon degenerates into trivialities, and anyone with an interest in Buddhist art will soon realise Greenwald doesn't have a clue about Buddhist sculpture (this wouldn't matter except that in the writing he pretends to).The hash-intoxicated epiphany that serves as the book's ending is the most disappointing of all. This might have made a good stop along the way, but the early buildup raises one's expectations and it feels rather unsatisfactory to say the least. (Greenwald's Size of The World suffers from a similar balance problem.)Readers who like this book will probably be those with limited exposure to travel in Nepal and to Buddhism/Buddhist art.

If you want a book that will let you look like you're interested in Asian philosophy without actually challenging your fundamental beliefs, I suppose this book will do.There were some interesting vignettes on Nepali culture and it's religious history, but they were never developed beyond the level off \\"hey this is cool and it happened in Nepal.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A Perfect Buddha Does Not Make a Perfect Book","review":"The book is a poorly crafted story about a man so self indulgent and arrogant that he equates a pot induced stupor to enlightenment. The author's irreverence to Buddhism might be excused if there was even some small acnowledgement of the validity of others' beliefs. Greenwald was determined to write a book no matter what it took. It is not surprising that he wrote a book about himself. This isn't a book about a man searching for the perfect Buddha.

High school groups have produced more rhythmical and in-tune recordings than Eton has with this CD.

It is a shame that I had to rate this album with ONE star. There are no redeeming qualities about this album at all. If you read the liner notes, you expect to hear an excellent musician. Mr. Lawrence even goes so far as to say that he plays better than any saxophonist before him. He must be very ignorant.

After trying nearly every kind of sugar replacement, I have finally settled on this one. It measures cup-for-cup like sugar, making it easy to adapt recipes and it acts just like sugar when it is baked. Other artificial sweeteners turn baked goods dry or cakey or crumbly, but this stuff is PERFECT.It does have a slight \\"cooling\\" taste; not exactly minty.

As a type II diabetic I have experimented with many choices for sweeting foods to live a normal life"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet like sugar, just less so.","review":"I like this product because it tastes just like sugar. It is non-clumping so it flows very freely. It doesn't attract water like sugar does so it stays dry even in very humid air. Some have said that it has a cooling effect like xylitol, which is sometimes undesirable, but if it does, it is very mild to the point that I was not able to perceive it. To my taste, it is about a half as sweet as sugar so it takes more but I've detected no digestive upset whatsoever, which is not true for many other sugar substitutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't know why more people don't use it","review":"Although it has less sweetness than sugar, erythritol is far superior to Splenda and all the sugar alcohols (xylitol, maltitol, etc).

The problem I find with erythritol is its lackof flavor. On cereal, I barely notice any real sweetness, evenwhen I put as much as a tablespoon and a half on a normal sizebowl. When I use Ideal, the name of the xylitol brand I use, ithas the same sweetness as sugar in the same proportion. Don't getme wrong, erythritol isn't unpleasant, it just has very littlesweetness relative to how much you use.

I am so glad I do not have to use this in place of sugar I was just trying to cut some calories. I am so glad I have alternatives to choose from. It's Splenda for me.

I tried TruVia's erythritol/stevia sweetener when I ran out of the stevia sweetener that I used before and wanted to get something instead of plain sugar. I figured that I liked the mix and wanted to try this powder because I had already ordered stevia from amazon. When it got here I used it right away, and did not taste the difference. I was very conservative in adding this to my coffee because I didnt know how sweet it was. After adding 3 large spoonfuls into my coffee I gave up, and I usually add 1 spoonful of sugar to my cup. if you want a sugar free sweetener that you can even make at home, get stevia. I have used it from local health food stores and always ended up with that funny aftertaste from stevia. the one I ordered from amazon, sweetleaf vanilla creme didnt have that aftertaste, and I used 12 drops in my coffee looking for it, typically I only use 4 drops in my coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"No gas, my ass!","review":"I purchased this product based on my research on the internet and the reviews on Amazon regarding this product's lack of aftertaste, low glycemic response, and mainly because people stated it had no gastric effects as Xylitol does. I used it this morning in a banana bread recipe. This afternoon I began paying the price and a few minutes later everybody near me began paying the price with me.

The lines are more clumsy than a 16-year-old scrawling in the corners of her notebook; the subject matter is some kind of haute bourgeoise apologist thing that either I just don't get or I don't want to be a part of.

Most of the time I pictured a mousy woman afraid of her own shadow, throwing her voice like a stuttering ventriloquist because she was afraid to claim ownership of her own declarations.

Garrison's stuff (I won't dignify it with the name \\"poetry\\")floats like dust on a dingy supermarket tabloid rack.

The main emphasis is on working women, but many of the poems are about relationships. There is a range in style, length, and subject matter. The style ranges from the crude \\"Fight Song\\" to some of a more sentimental nature. Their length varies from one to three pages in an easy to read typeface (Palatino).Overall, it is a collection of 28 poems previously published in \\"The New Yorker\\" (where the author is an editor), \\"Elle,\\" \\"The New York Times,\\" \\"Open City,\\" and \\"Slate.\\" Like other collections, most readers will find some poems they like more than others.

It was as if they said, we don't have enough pages let's through in a completely unconnected chapter.

While the storyline of the two main characters is cute, its subject matter (often involving one man trying to pick up a girl) is more appropriate to older students, not those between the ages of 11 and 13. Because every lesson pulls things out of the dialogue for study, my daughter's class has less of an understanding of French than they might have with a more methodical approach. Concepts are taught seemingly at random,and since very few practice exercises are given, and the instructions are all in French, comprehension is low. This might be a good way to study French for older students or adults, (particularly those who expect to be going to France in the near future) but beware of using it as a method to teach French to anyone younger - it isn't effective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ms","review":"I have not received the workbook yet, its been more than one month...

It has plot, good character development for Naga and Lina and overall everything that is to be expected of Slayers except for one thing. That is consistancy in subtitling between Software Sculptors and ADV Films. For instance, Explosion Array is actually called (gasp) Dill Brand. How does ADV plan to explain how the spell Mega Brand is not translated as Mega Explosion Array? They can't. Furthermore, Gaav Flare is not Guard Flair. Gaav is one of the primary antagonists in Slayers NEXT. ADV would have known this if they had watched the original series, but apparently they didn't. In the end, I believe this movie deserves 5 stars. It has everything that a good comedic anime film should have and more. Unfortunately, because of how much the bad subtitling bothered me, I only gave it four stars.

If you like Sin Bandera because of their gorgeous heartfelt ballads, then this album is a winner. \\"Tocame\\" is one of the most beautiful songs Ive heard in a long time, and the others are not far behind. The duet with Brian McKnight was surprisingly good as well, not a bad crossover song. Im not so much a fan of the more edgy/hip hop songs that Sin Bandera tries on this album. Theryre ok, and not bad by any means, ( I actually dont mind \\"Lo Que Llamas Amor\\"), but they should stick to what they know best- writing beautifully harmonized and lyrically eloquent ballads. Overall, this album is amaaaazing, and I havent taken it off repeat since I bought it!There is also a nice live version of \\"Sirena\\" (not available on this version of the album, but is available on iTunes) which i recommend downloading.

It might be good for a 50 foot extension cord, but that's about it. The Bucket Boss model 06100 bag might do the job since it appears to be larger, but check before you buy.

This cd was available brand new with shipping at the official Society of Seven website for an amount much less than what it is being priced at here. I am not a fan of the Society of Seven as I find their act to be rather corny. I wouldn't go out and purchase one of their albums if they came out with one. They are exclusively a cover band. If you are interested in a local Hawaii act who has an album that is worth purchasing, you should try The Krush's Best of The Krush.

A distance picture is featured on the cover of the DVD case but they showed much more of the Water Park from the Hot Springs. The Music is far from conservative, with a rock beat (soft and medium) mixed through the film. Somewhat minor, but David Nunn has a little bit of a quirky personality. Other than reading from Revelation 2-3, Nunn used no other scripture. It was very obviously recorded while on a tour group. Adding to the problem of attire in the group there was really no discretion regarding the crowds at each of the different sights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this deck","review":"I have worked with the tarot on and off for over 25 years. I moved away from traditional decks as I didn't like the energy they connected to. I moved toward the Animal Medicine cards, which I love, and even got some angel cards. Then I found this deck. I wasn't planning on ever getting another tarot deck. But this one spoke to me. It connects to universal consciousness and truths and less of the \\"psychic\\" polarized energy other decks tend to connect with. This is a great deck. The imagery isn't the most beautiful but the explanations are great and bring context to the creators image choices. I think it's a brilliant deck and find it very insightful.

Reid tries everything possible to escape but her pyschotic new hubby wont let her leave the little island.

Everyone knows Holleys, but few know Carters and Edelbrock Performers (which are just dressed up Carter AFB's). They're not as complex as most are led to believe. The only downside is that the chapters aren't clearly titled. Chapter 6 \\"Carburetor Tuning\\" isn't at all carburetor related, although the information is still good. It gives tips on other components of the car. For carburetor tuning procedures you have to look under Chapter 5 \\"Modifications\\".

A good 'holiday read', if you don't mind a silly plot, shallow characterisation and a story that plays fast and loose with history. If so, you'll probably think this book ok for a momentary diversion. And that's about it. If you want to read excellent Titanic fiction, try Beryl Bainbridge's 'Every Man For Himself'. For an introduction to the real Titanic, read Walter Lord's seminal work 'A Night To Remember'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you're expecting.","review":"Unlike most of the other reviewers, I really REALLY disliked this poorly-written novel about one man's dream to re-create the Titanic (in ALL respects) exactly 100 years after the original sank beneath the waves. This book is not uplifting, moving, or even remotely enjoyable. It is full of sadness, depression, and misery--it lacks all the power of Cameron's film and takes away from it by claiming it was the \\"inspiration\\" for this book. Steer clear of this one and try an original novel about the REAL Titanic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the rest of the story??","review":"The story was a good book but was quickly ruined by a terrible ending.

I love the portraits in the rooms of the original passengers and all the detail down to the china and even the workout rooms. I also enjoyed the banter among the Harvard grads. It did seem a bit rushed though, and I dont know if that was the authors intention to mimic the urgency of the story's interviews/book or not, but we jumped from Trevor exploring the ship to being best friends with the captain, from just seeing Maddy to being in love with her, and some of the dialogue was flat and forced, like the author might have been trying too hard to come up with something to fill the gaps. There could have been some headlines after the explosion too, something that would make Trevor and his buddies really absorb what happened, like maybe in the end they could have been sitting around the club reading about the voyage on the front page of the NY Times.

The band has a mixture of emo stylings coupled with Sonic Youth influences. Such a combination proves an excellent listening. Though somewhat underproduced, sustained interest was still able to (gasp) sustain my interest. Fitchburg, MA is the superior track on this album, though all are pretty decent. The last several songs are recorded live in a basement or something - so be forewarned, if you like sound quality. Go see these guys live if you ever get the chance. They rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Acoustic roots","review":"Well, to start off with, this is a totally acoustic album, in case you were fooled like the other guy who wrote his review and was shocked it was acoustic. Miles(bass) and Kyle(guitar) have been playing together since they were kids and this concert really demonstrates this; apparently two weeks before this show, their drummer left the band leaving them to either cancel the show or go on and play without a drummer. Overall, this album is one of the best things you can spend your money on; the innovative way they changed their songs to suit their two acoustic guitars (I believe they both play Seagulls) will leave you reeling. From the opening reggae shout on Fireshot to their cover of Used to love her, this album surpasses all expectations, and it gets better every time you listen to it. The live feel is what really brings out the magic in Slightly Stoopid, so do yourself a favor and buy this album right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Well, have got to say this album has opened up a whole new dimension to the tunes of Slightly Stoopid - its so effortless and yeah so satisfactory!

Gorgeous melodies await you, such as the stunning \\"Doll Song\\", where the soprano is a lovely doll who needs to be wound (you'll hear a mechanical winding noise) in order to continue singing...The famous \\"Legend of Kleinzach\\"...This is great music. If you're okay with a 1965 quality recording, then go for it! And this performance captures the lovely French style quite well.

I felt as though a lot of them had background stories that were necessary to understand what was written, but, alas, since they weren't included a lot of the poems just fell flat or didn't stand out.

Scott Fitzgerald","review":"I found Jeffrey's Meyers' biography of F. Scott Fitzgerald dismaying. Not that Meyers' doesn't write well (he does), or capture the essence of Fitzgerald's dissipation, but the book seemed a deliberate hack job. It is largely a continuous stream of references to Fitzgerald's obstinacy, egotism, inferiority, outrageousness, drunkenness and worse. I don't know where anyone got the idea that Meyers' wrote with any compassion in this biography. This work only makes Fitzgerald look pathetic. Of course, in many ways he was...but I see no scholarly effort to recognize the quality and enduring value of much of his work. While they pull few punches themselves, I'd recommend Mizener's The Far Side of Paradise, and Bruccoli's Some Sort of Epic Grandeur for a more balanced perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"A profound disappointment","review":"While a good biography should give us insight into what a person was like, Meyers apparently thinks himself qualified to tell us what Fitzgerald was thinking and feeling throughout his life, and those mind-reading attempts ring false.Fitzgerald once said that all the characters in his novels were based on him. Meyers seems to believe the reverse - that Fitzgerald's personality can be illustrated almost entirely by the characters in his novels. Thus, Meyers provides the reader with a shallow caricature of Fitzgerald - where all his faults are enhanced and the real person underneath is passed over completely.For a better glimpse of the person F. Scott Fitzgerald was, I strongly recommend F. Scott Fitzgerald: A Life in Letters."},{"rating":"2","title":"good picture, slightly overpriced","review":"I found the product to be of good quality. however, I think the price $2.99 per episode is too high.

While some people tend to say that the songs are performed not as emotionally here as on the Live version, I just can't say that for Noa and Garou, who are absolutely amazing here. Noa is by far the best Esmeralda I have heard. Most of the other performances are flawlessly perfect in only the studio-recording kind of way. (Although I have to say I think Daniel Lavoie and Patrick Fiori gave better perfomances on the Live version).I guess you should buy the live album: it's complete and the performances are mostly outstanding.

Notre Dame de Paris singers have very weak voices that do not carry well at all. Some of the singers sound as though they have sore throats!

It's like listening to a description of the surgery by two of your closest girlfriends. Chapters written by the doctor give additional information from a reliable medical perspective.

The authors nearly scared me out of the procedure. They made it sound as if I would suffer from each and every possible malady including some that they have clearly made up.

I can definitely confirm that I have not used any metal cookware with these and I have not put them in the dishwasher.

I received the first set and found that the 3-quart saucepan was warped. As a result, the lid would not fit correctly and I sent that set back. The second set arrived a few days later and this time the 3-quart as well as the stockpot was warped. So I sent the second set back and requested a 3rd set. To my surprise, Amazon just simply refunded my money without my approval and canceled my request for the third set. I was hoping that the third set would have been in order but I guess I will never know. Now it is back to doing some more research before I buy a different cookware set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cookware","review":"Cooks great, Looks great.

My 1st full set of matchig cookware! Very, very disappointed with this cookware, considering the cost!!!!! Finish wears off & food begins to stick, like any regular cheap cookware. Only problem is, I can't bring myself to throw it out after spending that uch money! If I'd bought something cheap & a-la-carte, like I'd done my whole life, I'd feel much better.

However when I received my set and read the proper cooking utensil it clearly stated we recommend using plastic or wooden utensil refrain from cutting foods or using sharp utensil such as FORKS, KNIVES, MASHERS OR WHIKS. The only one they didn't include was a spatula. I was SO disappointed because I spent a lot of time researching which set to buy. I only wanted a set I could use metal ultensil with. I call Cuisinart customer service number and the representative that was helping me spoke with a supervisor and was told to tell me that the Cuisinart Advantage is the set that is METEAL UTENSIL SAFE and that I could still use metal ultensil with the set I got just try not to scratch the surface.

It really shows how awesome each of the guys are and that they arent just some ridiculous fad like a lot of things that are around now. The day after I saw it I went and bought it, then it was in my DVD player and didnt leave. I watched it multiple days in a row and still am, its just awesome.

I became a changed person after I started to look up the truth about our people that had been suppressed and the attempts at advancements for our people that had been oppressed.

It combined a Victorian setting with a classic Gothic plot, and it had a heroine who had been unfairly tarred by scandal. All elements I love to read about.However, you can have all those elements and still have a book that simply does not work. Why? The heroine. Sometimes, she's clever -- but most of the time, she does stupid things. She yearns for the cad who almost took her virginity. And worst of all, she suspects the charming hero of murder -- even though there is no evidence at all.

In fact, if one believes (as I assume the Orthodox do) that the Torah is the divine word of G-d which is \\"for all time\\" and unchangeable, then it's \\"All or Nothing\\".

Her development from young, innocent geisha to mature woman full of heartache and longing is not only dramatically perfect, but vocally beautiful and poignant. The her masterful artistry is untouched by anyone. Callas had the drama, but the vocalism was never this flawless. The final scene will bring you to tears every time. Bergonzi is a great Pinkerton to her butterfly. Don't waste time on any other recording except this one. You'll never want another after this."},{"rating":"2","title":"cheap, light, and high powered.","review":"I was worried the product would break easily and the optics would not be that great.Happily, I was wrong. Granted it is made of plastic, be careful with it.But its light and outside, not viewing through window, it is sharp.I used it the see Jupiter and its 4 largest moons, even a few if it's bands were visible.Saturn was small but I could see its rings. Its great for looking the moonas well.Of course viewing things here on earth is what it's really designed for.Still too cold for that, will have to wait for spring and the birds return.tripod works well enough but you will probably want to get another one for better stability."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can do better than Yukon","review":"The Yukon 6-100x100 is better priced than equivalent spotting scopes, yet this item is not worth any price. The Yukon spotting scope has multiple problems. The most annoying is the view lense. One has to keep their head unnaturally still to keep the image in sight. Once the user achieves finding the image they need to use three controls to zoom and focus, two for the zoom options and then focus. With the weight of the front lense keeping the scope on target while selecting the zoom and focus, only exceptionally well disciplined people will be able continue to keep their head and the unit steady so as not to loose the image in the view lense.For those who visit the Yukon website, it shows some incredible capabilities of a spotting scope, but it can't be the the Yukon 6-100x100. There is no plausible way it can magnify as demonstrated. The Yukon company should be investigated for false advertising."},{"rating":"1","title":"Claustrophobia","review":"Not a good story line at all I was waiting for the movie to come together at the end but it never did.

This may very wellbe the worst concerto recording that I have ever heard in mymore than 30 years of listening and collecting!! Krystian Zimerman should have insisted on another go at it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I deaf?","review":"It took a great deal of searching at this site to locate this album and read its reviews. I bought this CD on the basis of readings elsewhere than at Amazon.com and, unfortunately, I didnt look through the review space here. I have to react in the same way as Shane Saunders - it is certainly the worst CD recording of the Second Concerto, or any other concerto, in my 30+ years of listening. I am unimpressed by the favorable reviews. However, I must admit that the First Concerto is a fine and novel interpretation by Zimerman supported by impressive gusts of deep-throated orchestration by Ozawa."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indispensable 1st concerto","review":"For the 1st concerto, this is my favorite interpretation and will always be. Zimerman presents near flawless technique combined with the power and virtuosity Rachmaninoff demands, especially in this concerto. I have learned numerous sections of this concerto and understand the technique it takes to fully display Rachmaninoff's passionate beauty intertwined fire (usually a pianist takes either side; fire or beauty); Zimerman balances both perfectly.The for the 2nd, I actually prefer Entremont recorded with the NYP and Bernstein, however Zimerman's recording is nonetheless brilliant. I mainly suggest this CD just for the 1st concerto (his 2nd feels slightly stifled and less \\"romantic\\" than Entremont, however Zimerman's is near equally as wonderful)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the finest of recordings...","review":"I have over ten different recordings of the first and second concerto played by many pianists from Ashkenazy to Horowitz. I have to say that these recordings are among some of the most amazing I have ever heard. First of all, I am not sure how anyone could rate this with one star. Just simply by listening to Zimerman's playing alone should make you think twice about what you just heard. Zimerman provides one of the most amazing and fluid recordings of these works and the orchestra led by the legendary Seiji Ozawa provide nothing less than spectacular sound. This is among my favorite recordings ever made, up there with the Goldberg Variations by Gould. If you found this recording to be anything but spectacular, you probably didn't go into listening with an open mind. Throw away everything you know about Rachmaninov's works and pop in this CD and relive these concertos. You will be blown away.

Many other books seem to contain only a few ingredients, while \\"The Joy of Failure\\" has them all. I used each and every one of those ingrediates... I now earn over six figures, have more time to do what I want and enjoy life. There is no rocket science or majic here. A lot of basics, but packaged and delived in a way to realize success.

They hire two young women to take notes during the brainstorming questions. Before long, sparks start to fly and love interests between them become blurry.There is a mix of dreamlike fantasy, reality and secret desire. But film looses its heat very early and watching it is a serious effort shortly after the first 10 minutes of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless","review":"This movie has little to do with either intimacy or affairs--or at least not with affairs of an intimate kind.

When I searched for \\"liquid sucralose\\", this stuff showed up, which is misleading, because this is saccharine. And it's called \\"Superose\\" which sounds deceptively like \\"sucralose\\". It never actually CLAIMS to contain sucralose, and if you read all the information, it is clearly saccharine, the bitter sweetener that became popular in the 1920s and was unfairly nearly taken off the market in the 1970s.This is the same as the generic liquid saccharine or liquid Sweet+Low found in every grocery store. Like most people, I don't like the bitter taste of saccharine as much as aspartame or sucralose. This mistaken purchase was my own fault for not reading the ingredient list more carefully. Now I will have to find a use for 12 bottles of this muck.A much better tasting product is the sucralose-based EZ-SweetzEZ-Sweetz (2oz - Liquid Sweetener 800 Servings/Bottle)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"I am diabetic and have been using this product for 12 years, at my doctor's suggestion.

For those who have notice no after taste like the packets it's because the packets contain the caking agents which is what you are tasting.

Still, this book is all the more incredible for it. This was published at an age before religious \\"tolerance\\" was politically correct, for the sole reason that the author felt that a grasp of religion is incomplete if you feel only one religion is the one for you (and it proceeded to point out the individual faults of each main religion), and only by learning from the strengths of each can one become better at one's patron faith.Plus, they included Taoism and Zen Buddhism on the list, which typically gets blown off as minor faiths. All in all, a very fine book for my dad, a retired priest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to make copies of movies","review":"This software makes it easy to make copies of DVD movies.

Who needs those Spinners anyway!

My daughter was in public schools for kindergarten and 1st grade. We began homeschooling for 2nd grade and I felt the Charlotte Mason approach would fit our family and my daughter's needs better than other methods. I bought this mainly because it was CM and because it was listed in Cathy Duffy's homeschooling picks book. It is MUCH too easy for my daughter. It includes work that I feel is unnecessary: memorizing poems, copywork, dictation, etc. My personal opinion is that much of this is unnecessary. I am having to supplement heavily. My daughter is easily bored. It explains capitalization, definition of a sentence, definition of questions, punctuations, etc. These are all things she learned in 1st grade. As a first grade book I would give it more stars. I hope this helps some of you."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth buying or using","review":"By the time my child was able to manage the writing involved, she was far beyond the concepts taught. While we enjoyed a few of the first lessons, the end of the book makes very heavy weather of what should be simple, intuitive grammar. Any child who reads will pick up on the basics being taught here -- the difference between a question and a statement, paragraphing, what a noun is, etc, without needing to be taught the specific terminology. Later, when more formal grammar is taught, these concepts will be second nature. However, if you have a young (5 - 7) yr. old child who enjoys doing lots of writing, this might be very enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Preschoolers LOVE this video","review":"This is a great purchase for any preschooler!

The other two lav scenes aren't any better. The woman in the first scene is also ugly, especially when you see her teeth, yuk! There is one scene with a couple doing it in a hotel room.

The level of songwriting and craftsmanship on this CD is beyond belief! You really must hear this stunning work of art to believe it. The variety and depth of this music reflects a maturity and approach to songwriting that is lacking in most music nowadays. This CD is songcraft at its absolute BEST!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Marty Willson Piper -- Does not get better than that!","review":"What can I say? Marty Willson-Piper (MWP) has been around for 20+ years doing solo work and, of course, the CHURCH. This new album featuring Dare Mason is absolutely magical. I was lucky enough to see Marty in Sydney for a couple of shows recently with Tim Powles, Church's drummer plus Tracey \\"bassey\\" Ellis, and guitarist David Skeet. They sound cool, smooth, and eclectic.This album has it all. Great vocals, major guitars, electronics, engaging lyrics, and excellent production that just \\"WORKS.\\" This one is for MWP and Church fans, but newcomers are welcomed and will not be disappointed. It will make you, however, drop some cash on other MWP CDs'-- I guarantee it. The good news is that you will be making a wise investment in your CD collection.

Just don't even bother reading this, if you love The Church, or even if you don't, this is going to blow you away, so go buy it now. Dare Mason and Marty Willson-Piper have created one of the most perfect albums in a very long time: it sounds new and refreshing, but at the same time very familiar and comforting.

You really don't get to know what this king's life was like. There is no detailed history of some of his greatest battles in France (Crecy and Poitiers), and nothing that tells you who he was. His son, the Black Prince, perhaps the greatest Prince of Wales there ever was, is hardly mentioned. I'm just glad I got this book at a discount. If you want to know more about Edward III, Froissart's Chronicles goes into more detail."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sketch - Not a History","review":"I assume that this book receives some praise only because of a lack of modern histories on Edward III. Unfortunately, the book is totally inadequate to its task - barely scratching the surface of Edward and the impact of activity in both England and France. Its complete lack of primary sources from France (except Frossiart so one should say reliable sources) and the lowlands is startling in a text that claims to study Edward III. It is excessively anglophobic in its view of Edward's reign and so cannot help but present a skewed and incomplete picture. Its organization makes the presentation even worse - by considering each estate separately, it makes a tricky history because of the time scale even more disjointed and trivial in scope and coverage.

They output pure quality sound. The High and Mid range tones are my favorites. I think the lows could have been a bit better, but pairing them with a sub-woofer compensates for the very little gap in bass. If you have or are planning on having a surround system or home theater, than you'll have a great balance once you add a sub-woofer to your speaker set, but if you plan on having these two floors speakers as your main speakers for both music and movies, then I would recommend you go with the NS-777 which output deeper lows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cannot beat for the price","review":"Somewhat of a biased review because I've only used these paired with a subwoofer. I actually bought these over the NS-777's to save money because I knew my lower frequency range would be covered my my subwoofer and A/V receiver's built-in tuning algorithms.Having said that, these speakers are excellent for the price.

Other reviews of these speakers mention that they are a little low on bass, so I just recently added a Yamaha YST-315 powered subwoofer. This actually enhances the Yamaha towers to the point of perfection. These speakers are an incredible value. Bravo to Yamaha! Good to see and hear you don't have to pay a fortune for beautiful music.Oh, the piano black finish is the finest I've ever seen, and these towers and sub make dual use as home theater speakers that will put you right in the middle of the action.

I got it for my history class (we had to write a paper on it) and overall it was very informative."},{"rating":"2","title":"LAST DAYS OF A GREAT CHRISTIAN CITY","review":"Over five hundred years have passed since Constantinople became Istanbul. It is difficult to imagine the city was once a Christian metropolis known as the capitol of the Roman Empire in the East. Runciman tells the story of this city's last days before the Turkish conquest. The book does not aim to cover everything of relevance to the subject and can be read at a sitting.I particularly enjoyed the descriptions of the last days. For a time, neither side could be sure who would win and strange signs and omens could be interpreted as favoring either side. When the end is certain, the reader feels the blow almost as clearly as the defeated Greeks. Perhaps the worst thing about it all is how little interest Europe took in the matter. It all goes to show how powerless groups are when divided."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Multilingual dictionary! Only set bilingual dictionaries","review":"The is not Multilingual dictionary.

I reccommend you not try to use this for any extended period if you have a smaller oilless compressor, you'll want to use a larger compressor if you don't want to burn up the motor.

This cd was a labour of love to finally capture the true diversity of Cristan's music. Ther is a wonderful mix of styles in this record ranging from romantic latin ballads, to fun rock, to trippy soundscapes, to fun Cumbia. It was a real pleasure working with the production team to make this magnificent collection. I brought my classic progressive rock, and experimental influences into the mix. Early genesis inspired 12 strings, ebow, theremin, floyd like slide passages, queen harmonized guitars, and chunky rythm guitars. Enjoy my work.

Other influences on the CD include Madonna's \\"Ray of Light\\", Everything but the Girl, celtic sounds, trance, hip-hop and r&b. This CD was a real surprise to me.

Save your money on this one and pick up the new Kathy Lee Gifford or Britney Spears CD's as alternatives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sinead at her best!!!","review":"I was drawn into Sinead after seeing the \\"Nothing Compares\\" video and so I bought this album and all her other studios. This album outplays them all. This CD is always in my constant CD rotation. This CD has Sinead finest work... a happy album!!! My favourites on the album include the single \\"No Man's Woman\\" which is just awesome. \\"Jealous\\" is a very heart felt ballad that I just love. I always listen to that song. I also love \\"Dancing Lessons\\", \\"Daddy I'm Fine\\", \\"The State I'm In\\" and \\"The Lamb's Book of Life\\". Overall, this album is her best album and a must for ALL Sinead fans. If u loved her other work, you'll love this 100 times more..."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Far The Best","review":"I am the biggest Sinéad O'Connor fan on this side of the panet and for those of you who did not know her music, when you listen to Faith & Courage you will understand why, and for those of you who have listen, listen closely to this album and tell me if any other artist out there is this talented at writing, singing and being truthful. I hear she is retiring from the biz, I guess we will be forced to listen to the unintelligent wave of Beyonce and her camp of trampy non-talented morons from no on. Or maybe SO will change her mind. Lets have faith & courage...."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed this album!","review":"I picked this CD up after I heard the song \\"Jealous\\" figuring I would only like the one song...I was wrong! I decided to give Sinead a shot and really listen to the whole album. Its one of the best albums I have recently purchased. I have never been a die-hard Sinead fan, but I haven't been able to stop listening to this album! The songs each have their own personality...Besides \\"Jealosy\\", I love \\"What Doesn't Belong To Me\\" but all the songs are great. Give this album a shot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to her roots","review":"This is a fantastic CD from an artist that always seems to produce fantastic music. In this album, she returns to her roots of traditional Irish music and takes those reels and blends them haromicly into contemporary beats. This makes the CD work fantasticly as it has a true spiritual feel to it. The subject matter is rather serious at times which is refreshing in this period of vacuous music. This is one of her best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Faith and Courage is a Masterpiece","review":"I've been a fan of Sinead's since her debut with The Edge on the song Heroine, and have followed her career and bought all of her CDs since. This CD is her first collection of new songs since 1997's fabulous (and under-rated) ep Gospel Oak, and it is a complete masterpiece. Her voice never sounded better-in fact, is there any doubt left that she is the best female vocalist out there?-and the CD has a modern edge to it, and excellent production. Thanks Sinead!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Faith and Courage","review":"A couple of years ago I was looking through my sister's tape collection and saw that she had Sinead O'Connor's \\"I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got\\" album. I remember whenever I would see Sinead's video for \\"Nothing Compares To U\\" I would always make fun of it and call her \\"Skinhead\\" O'Connor and names like that, although I secretly liked the song. I enjoy new music and borrowed my sister's tape and found out that what she had was a great album. I soon became a fan and now own all of her albums. Due to controversy, Sinead's work has always been overlooked. How many people have heard her excellent \\"Gospel Oak EP\\" from 1997? \\"Faith and Courage\\" follows Sinead's high standards and hopefully will allow a wider range of people to give her music a chance. Each track is powerful. Favorites include: \\"Dancing Shoes\\",\\"\\"Jealous\\" and \\"Emma's Song.\\" This is definitely the best album of her career and is worth a listen. I hope people will forgive Sinead and give this album and her music a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cynics, beware!","review":"Cynical people won't like this album. Anyone who's ever waved a cigarette around while being The Music Critic at a trendy party will hate it....Sinead reminds me more and more of John Lennon--growing up in public with your pants down. 20 years from now, some idiot will probably kill her for dissing the Pope on Saturday Night Live.This is a good record. Too early to tell if it's a great record, but I've listened to it about a hundred times in the last couple of weeks without anyone getting annoyed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Strong Record","review":"This record has proven a very pleasant surprise. Not that Sinead's catalog has ever lacked strength. But this record brings out all of the warmth and depth that the wounded, confessional current of her previous records always implied.I'm not quite ready to declare it a masterpiece (it's far too derivative to justify such hyperbole). But it's a keeper that's already earned heavy rotation at my house. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sinéad O'Connor: Faith and Courage","review":"After waiting years for this release, I'm not in the least disappointed! This album is a wonderful combination of Sinéad's ethereal singing and touching lyrics, a departure from both the angst of the early albums and from the cuteness of her more recent work. The incorporation of electronica/techno music is well done; it neither overwhelms her voice or detracts from the often gentle lyrics. buy this album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Many Things Compare to this LOL","review":"I loved her old song, \\"Nothing Compare 2 U\\", but I didn't hear anything on this album that captured the same heart and soul. I am sure she is trying, but maybe to hard. She gets an A for effort, but a C for this album. (If there were 6 stars I would give a three, but there are only five, so I give this one a 2 and a half --- right up the middle--- but the half is implied here by lack of that being a choice)"},{"rating":"1","title":"lacking everything that made her great up to now","review":"I have all her albums which are brilliant, eccentric, unusual, imaginative, moving and adventureous. This album is none of these things. It's Sinead desperate to make a buck by producing pop music appealing to the lowest common denominator of the music buying public. This album has no spark, no creative edge, nothing unusual or personal. Has-been Dave Stewart appears and probably turning possibly interesting Sinead music into muzak. Boring. Disappointing. It could be anybody, this isn't at all like her previous music. She's capable of much more and much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, boring and more boring.","review":"Is this a joke? Everyone is praising this album which is the most boring thing I've ever heard from her. Shame on Sinead for releasing this dreary mess with very few interesting elements. This album lacks everything that was enjoyable in her earlier releases. She belongs on VH1 now along with Whitney Houston and Winonna Judd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Before you buy, realize this is NOT the Sinead you knew","review":"I know some of the charms of Sinead are her ever-changing styles and themes, but at least she was always original, always interesting. This album was very disappointing--over-produced, radio-hopeful....more like background music than the kind of thing where you used to position the speakers *just right* so as to concentrate on the music, on her voice.I'd recommend listening to a friend's copy before buying. If you think you can handle a barely-recognizable pop Sinead, go for it. If you're like me, and you can't imagine why people are going bananas over an album that is easily her worst, don't bother. It's hard to resist new material, new songs, but don't fret-- for the fans of \\"I Do Not Want...,\\" \\"Universal Mother,\\" and her other albums, this is NOT Sinead O'Connor."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hesitate to say this","review":"but after one listening, I don't want to hear it again. I got two of these for Christmas, and was looking forward to my first time hearing her new work. A longtime fan, I love \\"I Do Not Want What I Have Not Got\\" and the entire message of \\"Universal Mother\\". Her lyrics are always the most moving to me. But not this one. The lyrics are beaten to death by the irritating music. There was just no respite. All the reviews give it such a high rating that I expected so much more. While others applaud the new Sinead, I cannot agree. I want to see Sinead grow with her music, but I'm not prepared to believe in this one. Even the title seems wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"An AWESOME C.D from an AWESOME woman...","review":"Controversy aside, Sinead O'Connor is an amazing singer/songwriter/performer. Fans of her previous albums may be a bit surprised when they first listen to Faith And Courage. Her new material is easily more pop friendly, but this doesn't take away from her great lyrics...Nearly every song on this album could be a potential hit. I think the weakest song on the album is the opener \\"The Healing Room\\" It starts out really slow and drags on for a while..It eventually gets better, but most people will have skipped onto the next track before that happens...Every other song on the album is AMAZING...No Mans Woman is a catchy rockish anthem, followed by a beautiful song called Jealous. While every song on her stands out, my favorites are \\"No Mans Woman\\" \\"Jealous\\", \\"Daddy I'm Fine\\" And \\"The Lambs Book of Life\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"faith and courage....and all things Sinead","review":"FAITH AND COURAGE is Sinead O'Connor of the past (angst and hard rock) and the present (more introspective lyrics and a more diverse mix of musical styles). If you look past all the \\"controversies\\" surrounding her personal and public life (the Sister Bernadette affair comes to mind), you'll hear a woman who has found her sense of self. It's not that she's older and wiser, but that her lyrics speak of things universal to all of us: religion, love, change, etc.The many guest artists have helped create the myriad styles on the album, especially Dave Stewart and Wyclef Jean. KYRIE ELEISON, JEALOUS, and LAMB'S BOOK OF LIFE are my favorites, as well as NO MAN'S WOMAN and HOLD BACK THE NIGHT. What's great is the album is a mix of soft and loud, ballad and rock anthem. There's something for every Sinead fan of old and many new fans to come!YOU GO, GIRL!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This is a real disappointment. I like Sinead O'Connor's voice very much. Her track on \\"Tears of Stone\\" with the Chieftans is one of my favorites. But there's too much \\"I'm ticked off\\" on this CD and not enough real vocal expression. About three of the songs work, the rest are just repetition of the same theme: People are out to get me because I'm a strong Irish woman. Sorry, I need more than that to stay interested. This CD goes straight to the garage sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sinead is gone to... heaven?","review":"I know we're not to judge an artist (or any person, for that matter), by their religion or personal beliefs. But O'Connor's status as a pagan lesbian catholic priest is way too much and probably just a marketing scheme. The same inconsistency can be heard in her new album, an overproduced, calypso-ridden godfest for the new age. Long gone is the fierce woman with one of the strongest voices in the world. Too bad..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I SWEAR SHE WAS GOOD!","review":"I don' t know what's wrong with her. She used to compose the most beautiful songs in the irish popscene, blending traditional irish themes with pop melodies. Now, she's back with a new album, after 5 years of EPs and singles, and it sounds unforgivably shallow.The lyrics are stupid in a way I never expected she would be (listen to \\"Daddy, I'm Fine\\" and \\"Lamb's Book of Life\\") the melodies are too poppy and even her voice seems to lack her original power.She co-writes most of her new songs with her producers and the results couldn't be worse. Dave Stewart (from Eurythmics) proves that he became a specialist spoiling mature women, writing and singing with her in \\"Jealous\\" and \\"Whisper You Something\\".Even the best moments (\\"What Doesn't Belong to Me\\", \\"Healing Room\\") are just ok, compared to O'Connor's old songs. Please, listen to \\"Universal Mother\\", \\"I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got\\" or even \\"Gospel Oak\\" and you'll understand what I mean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Passion and Soul","review":"I have always appreciated Sinead for her passion and willingness to reveal her soul in all its darkness and light. This collection is Sinead at her best-angry, passionate, defying, yearning, romantic, searching, discovering. The music well matches the messaage in each song. Enjoy an old friend who has been to the dark place and returned to share her learning. We should all be so open."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is possibly the best movie I have ever seen.","review":"In case you couldn't tell, I absolutely loved this movie. In fact, I watched it like 12 times in a row. It was the first Dutch film ever to win an Academy Award for best Foreign Film.It's basically a story of the effects of trauma onthe human mind. At first it's set in Nazi-occupied Holland in 1945, but the movie basically deals with the entire life of one boy, Anton Steenwijk. In 1945 his family was murdered, and not surprisingly, it affects everything in his life afterwards.This movie is full of extremely talented actors, namely Derek de Lint who plays Anton as an adult. To really understand this movie, you have to pay attention to details, because it's got an intricate plot. But it's a wonderful and touching story.I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone, no matter what their interests, because it is such a beautiful film.

So it's not like it takes excessive force to damage these things. They just break right down the center every time. Plus, the bowls and mugs get EXTREMELY HOT just after a couple of minutes in the microwave. If you scratch off the paint, you can see a shiny, metallic surface underneath.

Of all the new-wave power pop releases of the era, that collection continues to impress me with its well-crafted, energetic and insanely catchy tunes.Well, the guiding forces behind Quincy, brothers Stephen and Brian Butler, have returned in grand style to the Beatlesque pop genre with this fine CD.Every song is lovingly performed, with the kind of tunesmithery younger bands can't seem to achieve. The brothers' harmonies are to die for.Occasionally I wish the performances weren't so laid back. At the same time, I wish the lyrics reflected a bit more of the creators' experience and maturity. I guess I'm trying to have it both ways: wishing it was 1980 again, but not wanting to relive the confusion of being 19 years old.To the Butlers, well done! To the rest of you, buy this CD.

Not to mention it was the first Hong Kong movie to be imported to the U.S. to become so popular and loved among the ofreign public. The director obviously had innate sense of what the public wanted including WOMEN. No wonder Tarantino has adopted so many scenes and music from this movie to be part of \\"Kill Bill.\\" It really is a movie you need to see at least once before you die.

This is a fun film which helped start the Kung Fu craze in the pre-Bruce Lee period, and is quite entertaining despite its creatively dubbed dialog -- lots of outrageous martial arts stunts probably achieved by off-screen trampolines and in one case by running the film backward. A great romp, spoiled by lackluster color and focus and a grainy, muddy tinge. Not terrible, but very mediocre DVD technically speaking.

After eating about half of it, I noticed the soup base had turned watery. I would have liked it better if it was thicker.I couldn't get over the amount of sodium in it. It has two servings with 830mg (35% of daily serving) in each serving. That's 1660mg of sodium per can, 70% of your daily serving in one meal.

Now that it's installed, I find that me and my family are turning off the fire place in about half the time we normally would because of the extra heat that we get. Becuase we off the fireplace in half the time, I think the unit will pay for itself in the gas that we are saving. Plus it's easy to install.

Yet I sat glued to the television for the entire program (it aired without commercials) because of the performance of Gene Wilder. Sure, I loved Pete Duel (and still do) and Blythe Danner was marvelous, but Wilder was absolutely stunning, mesmerizing, and all those overused words. Watching this show, I learned the power of a comedic actor in a dramatic role and have never forgotten it. Jackie Gleason in The Hustler...Judd Hirsch in Ordinary People...Robin Williams in Dead Poets Society...Tom Hanks in Saving Private Ryan. I was willing to watch them all because I believed I could be transformed by their performances as I was by Gene Wilder's.

I was disappointed when it didn't have sufficient torque to drive a 5/8 auger bit through a floor joist. Went out and bought a Dewalt which had no problem. The Dewalt isn't reversible but doesn't need to be for drilling since it has enough power to drill through without getting bound or stuck. I don't know if I got a defective drill (other reviewers said they've drilled joists), or whether it's just an underpowered tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great compact drill","review":"This drill is great, I love the fact that it is variable speed as well as reversable. Plus the way the paddle switch is set up it is easy to activate yet doesn't easily go off unintentionally. I recently used mine to drill out the back most manifold bolt in the head of a 454 chevy. It worked great for that. I could barely get my arm down there to reach the area but getting the drill in there and working with it was absolutely no problem. I owned a Dewalt dw160 and even though it is slightly more powerful it is no comparision as far as ease of operation and overall tool design. Even the chuck on the Makita is 10 times easier to use than the Dewalt. The Makita is all open all the way around while the Dewalt has small slots you have to try and fit the chuck key through to reach the chuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"High Quality, But Wimpy Motor","review":"Very nice quality and ergonomics.

There is no mistake that Kid Rock had a lot of influence on this CD. People have asked me about the CD and how it is, I have put it this way... It is basically the lighter side of Kid Rock. However, it still rocks and is really good. Some say that it is Kid Rock singing the whole time. True that he is on a lot of songs, but Uncle Kracker sounds very similar to him. Don't be fooled. All you Kid Rock and Twisted Brown Trucker fans will definately like this one. Those of you who think Kid Rock is too hard, definately get this one. It is a good CD. My only complaint is that it is not long enough. A few more songs would really kick. Good songs include, \\"Heaven\\" (which is my favorite), \\"What'Chu Lookin' At\\", \\"Better Days\\" and \\"Yeah, Yeah, Yeah.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Sample it first....","review":"While I like the single released for radio, the rest of the CD is \\"Kracker\\" rap.

I like all kinds of music. So why is it that I absolutely hated this CD? The lyrics were awful. It was as if Uncle Kracker couldn't make the words fit into the song so he added F***. You can't substitute that for creativity. This CD is so bad that I won't even put it in to listen to \\"Follow Me\\", which is one of my all-time favorite songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average Album","review":"I picked this up as soon as it came out. I had high hopes; however this was a big letdown. This is an average disc at best and one of the few that I look back and think, \\"What was I thinking?\\" There are only a few decent tracks on this entire record. The quality suffers somewhat from the fact that this was recorded out of the back of a tour bus.There is some talent in there somewhere, but it is marred by bad lyrics and low production quality. I hope the next one is better, but I will listen before I buy next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who's Your Uncle!","review":"This is a VERY fine effort by Kid Rock's DJ. If you like Kid Rock's music this should be right up you ally. He is a bit mellower than K.R. and less vulgar (but he's no angel). Like K.R. the boasting is a bit much at times but the beat's and rhymes are soooo goooood it's hard to resist. My favorites are Heaven (I'm from Detroit so this one's naturally my favorite) and Who's Your Uncle. But the whole thing rock's from front to back. A classic summer record to open the sun roof and cruise down 8 mile to. Highly Recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pop? It's not.","review":"Why is every teenie bopper trashing this albulm? Its because the radio only plays what they want you to hear, along with MTV,and for those teenie boopers this is, sadly, the only song they would be interested in listening to. Follow Me is one of the worst song on the CD. Thnk God I listened to the entire albulm from a friends collection or I would have missed out on owning a great CD. So if you want to hear awsome music that blends rap,rock and country ( yes, thats right, country), Buy this CD for sonds like Aces and Eights, Heaven (feat. Kid Rock), and Steaks and Shrimp, Not for that teenie booping song Follow Me, otherwise you will be just as bad as they are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depends on what style were looking for","review":"As for me I was looking to find more songs along the same style and tone as \\"Follow Me\\", the rest of the CD is more of a rap rock style with obscenities up the ying yang that isn't as catchy or singable as \\"Follow Me\\" When driving down teh road I prefer to crank up the Cd player, roll down the windows and sing with the music like a fool. If I do that with the rest of the rest I'll look like some prep trying to be putting it politely something I am not. Uncle Kracker should stay with that softer style I like he will sell more records and gain fans that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Interesting.","review":"I have to admit my first impression of Uncle Kracker was not good. He came on when I was listening to my new MI2 Soundtrack, and it didn't take long to hit next. The next time I heard him was when the \\"Follow Me\\" video came on. It was fun, upbeat, and popish without the backstreet boy persona. I waited to see who sang it and was shocked, thinking that there is no way it's the same person. Well, it was and to say the least I was disappointed. I checked into him and realized he was too much Kid Rock. Now, I like my metal and hard rock, but I'm not a Kid Rock fan at all. This cd has some good points like \\"Follow Me\\" and \\"Better Days\\". The songs without Kid Rock are decent, but I think he almost sounds like he's trying too hard to rap. In my opinion he'll be like Sugar Ray, if he wants to sell albums the popish way might be better. If he's in it for the music he could stay with rap and do ok, but I don't think great."},{"rating":"1","title":"ICK","review":"I feel tricked by \\"Follow Me\\". What a great song Follow Me is!

Uncle Kracker just swears his head off for no apparent reason. \\"Follow Me\\" is the only thing saving his CD.

That really gets monotanous. Kid Rock comes in as producer and sings one with Uncle Kracker, but doesn't really work magic anywhere. Kracker constantly tries to build himself as some bad a**, but just strikes me as a slightly chubby nutcase. Who knew he had a wife and 2 kids?

The cover statement \\"Features 'I'll Fly Away' (from the film 'O Brother Where Art Thou')\\" is deceptive; all it means is that a completely different group, the Kossoy Sisters, is singing the same (traditional) song. 'I'll Fly Away' is one of my favorite songs, so that I was completely unmoved by it is a good indicator of the rest of the album. Overall, the playing is competent but generic and uninteresting, as are the lyrics (though 'Darby Ram' stands out for being an impressively weird story set to very ordinary music).

Although the written content is excellent, 10 of the meager 18 photos of Motherwell's work are problematic -- nine have been inadvertently cropped during the printing, and one is both cropped and printed upside down. These books should have been withdrawn and reprinted, but instead, Columbia University Press tucked a little sheet into the dust jacket explaining their regret. It's hard to believe they proceeded with the distribution of this book, and retail it for $46. This is unconscionable in any book, but especially an art book on a noted figure like Motherwell.

At first blush the book was tight, a lovely physical thing. Then, immediately after page xi in the Preface came page xxi. Quality control at Columbia University Press, from its editors down, must be in the bottom tier of shabbiness for university presses. Shame on them. Shame, shame.

The power and sincerity of her singing really has a strong effect on me. I heard her first on TBN on tv and from then on I was hooked.My favorites on the album are \\"Lord God of Abraham\\" and \\"Almighty Reigns\\" because they are so upbeat. But I also enjoyed \\"Worthy\\" which is a much slower tempo. The other songs are good as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't sleep at night","review":"This is great! We get almost all the really great tracks, plus a few new ones. The best of those being 'I cant sleep at night'. Its the single that SHOULD have been released over a year ago. Yet because of online leaks, it was replaced with 'Perfection'. That isnt such a bad track either, in fact, this whole set has a few really good standouts. All the hit tracks from her 1997 'Girl' album are here, as are the ones from 'Neon Nights', with the exception of the German only release 'Come and get it'. She could've thrown in some rare tracks, like her hits with Eurogroove or 'Everlasting Night'.. still a great deal.

However, it is not at all faithful to St. Josephine Bakhita's story. We watched the movie and we wanted to know more about this wonderful saint. When we looked her story up, it was COMPLETELY different than the storyline of the movie. The movie was very touching, but we felt \\"ripped off\\" by the creative license the director took. A lot of the people mentioned and portrayed in the movie didn't even exist! Bakhita had many owners, as a slave, but in the movie she just had two! Marin and Aurora, two influential characters didn't exist in real life. We felt that if the movie had to be such an emotional roller coaster, it should've been a true story. We are extremely disappointed and we don't plan on watching this untrue movie again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for Jennifer fans","review":"OK...I think this lady has the most beautiful singing voice of any female singer...period, so I'm prejudiced from the start.

I've been a listener/fan since her \\"Hair\\" days and find this double album set of her earliest recordings a delight.

The main reason is that it's easier to change the gears, or something like that. But you'll probably have no problems, as it's an obviously well made tool with all of the important features. Consumer Reports also rated it high. I'm certainly no tool expert, yet this tool is great for the do-it-yourselfer doing odd jobs around the house.

One reference to a software extension was misnamed, leaving me to search and experiment till I discovered they did not mean \\"Grid Data Source\\" but rather \\"Image Data Source\\". And we have not yet left chapter 1! Chapter 2 was no different, View Projection Utility does not work. Oh well I give up. I do not recommend this book as a way to learn GIS--maybe as a reference but not as a tutorial."},{"rating":"2","title":"UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!!!","review":"This is an awesome guitar cd regardless of the players age. The fact that RANDY recorded this when he was around 14 makes it simply unbelievable. In no way does this sound like the musik or playing of one so young. Forget RANDY's age, this kid is for real. A monster player already, he is also an excellent composer. These are not pieces to show of endless noodling, these are excellent compositions that span a wide range of styles. His playing would sound at home on any CD by any of the top 10 guitarists you care to name. He is without a doubt the greatest talent the guitar has seen since a very young HENDRIX played with LITTLE RICHARD.Buy this for the exceptional instrumental musik this youngster creates. That you get a glimpse into the future of the guitar is a bonus."},{"rating":"2","title":"not quite as good as the body","review":"this collection of photos isn't quite as good as his selection for the body. but there are many good photographs in it. the text of the chapters is well written and informative. some of the placement of the photos is confusing. all in all, a good book to have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After reading all the rave reviews I ordered this book and after flipping through it, decided to return it. Nothing was remotely inspiring. Supposedly pro, but book design and layout design amateurish. Like 2 spaces set between sentences? Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"The book should have been excellent. It was very accessible and easy to follow, taught concepts in a logical manner (Basics, then algebra, then various aspects of geometry, then trigonometry, etc.), and gave useful tips on problem-solving and SAT traps to avoid.However, its undoing was that apparently no one had bothered to proofread it before its publication- there were tons of errors throughout the whole thing. Many were simple calculation errors and algebraic errors that, while being incredibly annoying, were easy to spot and ignore. However, I found entire formulas that were improperly stated (leading to severe confusion on my part until I checked other sources), mis-naming of quadrants, parts of polynomial equations that randomly disappeared while the book demonstrated \\"solutions\\", and so many other major problems that I really think that the book did more to confuse than to help me. Until the book undergoes a major revision, I would suggest turning to another source."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Errors","review":"I'm no math genius, but I remember enough about the concepts to spot mistakes in the math.

Here he opens with a soft, beautiful tune called \\"The Because Of,\\" which wonderfully frames his more lyrical playing. From there it devolves into more standard jazz tropes... whirlagig loop-de-loops, swingin' drum solos... the whole works. It's a bit too jazzy and downtown-New York for me, but Goldberg's pure tone and bright presence certainly stand out.

It was curious that Amazon did not offer a chance to pre-listen to his The Libertine score, but I bought it anyway. When it came, neither the cover or inside art connected it with the film at all. I thought I had bought it in error. When I listened to it, I was sure of it. No resemblance to the period (Baroque) exists on any of it's tracks. True I have not yet seen the film, and considering the reviews, it is not likely to come to this market. But the music is evocative of nothing. It has no style or period. Just track after track of gloomy, meandering fingering exercises on piano with odd and really annoying staccato accents.

When the author did offer specifics, she assumed the reader already knew the steps (she said to tie a square knot then a half hitch knot but didn't describe how). The author emphasized continuous machine stitching, yet most of the designs featured parallel lines. Doesn't that mean a lot of starting and stopping? The projects were attractive, but there were few step-by-step illustrations for how to make them.In short, if you're an experienced sewist, you'll probably get more out of this book than I did.

I Love the solid, balanced feel. They work all day.They really are superior tools.For instance,with heavy use the output shaftof many cordless drills gets loose and floppy. Makita chose a metal gear case with a large ball bearing support for its massive output shaft. This means no floppy chucks and smoother operation. The motor is physically larger,also supported with ball bearings.This enables the unit to produce higher torque with more efficiency than the others.This means longer life,But more importantly, it means MORE POWER !The saw just walks through 2x10's.

I did get some good news when I called cust service today. They are shipping me a brand new unit free of charge. When I asked if I had to return the old one first they said that I didn't have to return it at all. They obviously recognized that it is a complete set of junk as they told me to throw away the old one entirely as it is not compatible with the new one and its new circuitry.I also found it strange that I didn't have to do anything as far as provide a receipt or proof of purchase. Sounds like they have completely given up on this item and are starting from scratch. So if you have one of these call customer service. Even if the new one works I don't think I would pay money for it again. Apparently the old model is still on shelves in stores and online so wait a couple of months before you even consider."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good buy","review":"I purchased several of these at Wal Mart - none of which \\"worked\\".

In the last month, I've had to replace all the batteries, but I can't complain about that, as the originals lasted for 2-years. Windspeed is very accurate, even in gusts over 40 mph. Pressure and temperature are accurate as well. I did take the time to set my altitude when I first installed it, and I believe that makes a big difference.The forcaster isn't very accurate. If you're relying on this unit to decide whether or not to carry an umbrella, you might get wet. Other than that, I have no complaints.If you take the time to read the manual and follow the steps in set-up and installation process, this unit will serve you well for years.

The vinyl records used for transferring these songs onto CD were obviously in terrible shape and (as such) the music suffers.

Based on that fact alone, I'd say that this CD is quite a bargain. The audio quality of The Autographs' song on this CD is far superior to that of the original record that sold on ebay for so much money. And it's the best soul ballad I've ever heard, worth the price of this CD even if the rest of the songs were bad (but they're not). Buying this CD is probably the only chance most of us will ever get to hear a $587 record, so get it before it's discontinued."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful !!!","review":"Gary's cd is Wonderful.I thought Gary's first cd would have 4 or 5 songs on it that you would like and then you would have to skip the rest.BUT no way this cd is wonderful.this is diffently a CD you can play from start to finish and not get bored.But if i had to pick just one track from the cd it would have to be track 3,say it all.That song is so truthful and say's it all.I know in Nova Scotia there may be a wait for the store's to restock the cd so if you have to buy online to get it do it.

Either way t was hot and so was his second single \\"Sunshine\\". This single was what had me go out and get the album. Overall all I do listen to is Sunshine and I could have just download the single instead. I'm into hip-hop but this isn't hip-hop in my opinion.

I only gave it 2 stars because with so few lyricists from the south Flip brings something to the table (come on we're dying down here) but 'king of the south?' don't make me laugh. The guest appearences like Cam'ron, Three 6 mafia and even Jim 'sorry' Jones are well welcome because Flip can't hold his own for one cd, forbid sitting through two and his baby voice gets annoying kinda annoying. Production also isn't to hot. Basically the cd is pretty weak. But if your looking for good rappers from the south try Scarface, T.I. Ludacris or UGK (in that order) and Young Buck, Slim Thug, and Stat Quo are shaping up nicely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flip, flip, flip....","review":"First off T.I. was the one who called off the beef after he started it. Now back to the review this Cd is not that great as people doing the reviews here are not even from the south whichunderstand why they get confused with Flip's slang. That's a part of branch of hip hop spreading the slang and representing where you from. The underground Legend and the Leperchaun where way better than this album but it still got some dope beats in this album. Some of you don't even listen to what flip is trying to say and get dragged over by beats it so sad. Im not brainwashed by producers unlike most the post here Over all its a decent album.

Flip, who lied to you folk?? You are a country singer compared to TI... The only good song on here is We Ain't Playin and that's only cause Pastor Troy made the song. I mean yo, free stylin might get you paid on the streets, but that's where it should stay. If you do a song talking about YOUR girl being your Sunshine, why would you talk about your rims or how you can walk in a room and just take your pick of girls?? Confusing... But for real, don't waste your money on this mess. If you do anything, download We Ain't Playin and leave it at that.

This is not real hip hop, sorry to burst your bubble. This is garbage put together solely to get people that follow the crowd to purchase this cd. Lil Flip may be regarded as an underground legend but with his commercial releases I am not impressed whatsoever. Real hip hop is an art form like: De La Soul, Tribe Called Quest, Talib Kweli, Mos Def, Rakim, Common, 2pac, Biggie, Nas, KRS. There are many that fit into the category of real hip hop, but this is not. Flip is popular only because MTV plays it all day, if you listen to his rhymes compared to a Kweli or Eminem he doesnt come close. Show yourself some respect and explore hip hop for what it is and not what MTV wants you to think it is. Lil Flip put the mic down and go work at McDonalds cuz thats about the only thing you're good for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wack","review":"When he did that song \\"Game Over\\", I thought I'd give him a chance.

But he did this song with Sunshine that I saw five minutes ago and he was bragging about how he did his rhyme in 10 minutes and how other rappers are slow if they do theirs in 30 minutes...but the rhyme was so wack. He basically talked about how he gets numbers, he has money, he got bling...blahzay blah. The way he was bragging on doing this rhyme in 10 minutes, I'm thinking...wow! This is gonna be raw. It sounded like he did it in 10 minutes.

I have his underground legend cd and it was pretty impressive, but he really went over the top with \\"u gotta feel me.\\" In my opinion, this one goes down as one of the best ever.First of all, \\"game over\\" is such an outstanding song that the 15 dollars were worth it just to play that song over and over. The two disk set is packed full of bangin' songs all of which have quality lil' flip lyricism combined with ever better production. \\"All I Know\\" featuring Camron is a nice song as well as \\"bounce\\" and \\"throw yo hood up.\\" I think that out of the 21 songs, 19 or 20 out of them are completely awesome.

This has to be the laziest double disc effort EVER put on wax. For starters, in all actuality, this is a single disc cd, just take of the chopped & screwed songs and the disc clocks in a a little under 80 minutes. Another flaw is the production (with the exception of David Banner's production on the album) sounds just like a nintendo 8 bit system did the layout for certain songs while other songs sounded half assed. Behind Nelly, Flip has the worst flow than anyone in the rap game. I wish I can tell you what songs to listen to on the album but unfortunately there were no standout songs.

The vast majority of the album is complete filler, and it doesn't even serve THAT purpose well. \\"Game Over\\" and \\"Sunshine\\" are worth a listen or two; the rest of it gives the rap genre a bad name.

The beats are almost exclusively sampled from better songs, the lyrics suck (shooting guns in the hood ad infinitum), and it's pitched as a double album but is the same length as a single CD (shorter if you consider D12 World at 79 minutes). There is absolutely nothing new or worthwhile in this album. The single, Game Over, is mediocre at best, although many think it is appealing. Obviously, it was meant as the \\"3 minute hook\\", which would make people buy the album, the rest of which is all filler material. The worst song, though, has to be The Ghetto. It takes a sample from the classic song Is It Because I'm Black (by Syl Johnson)...and butchers it completely. You have to listen to it to understand, but believe me, it should be a crime.

I used it a grand total of 4 times, each time, it smelled like something was burning when I turned it on, and the fourth time, it stopped worked and never worked after that.

I have built one set of lower kitchen cabinets and set up forms to pour a garage floor and have primarily used it to drive screws. For the past year it has been trying to quit. Approximately 1 year ago it wouldn't go in reverse. Then it magically repaired itself and worked fine. About six months ago it wouldn't go into high speed. Again it straightened up and worked again and today I took it out to drive some screws and the thing was dead. And the batteries were fully charged. I had to break out the Bosch 18 volt. For a contractor grade tool it isn't as good as it should be. I am disappointed in the quality for a fairly expensive drill. I doubt that I will buy Makita again. Milwaukee or Bosch for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good drill, bad repair","review":"I have two of these. One I bought new. It has performed flawlessly - no, superbly. It is a five star tool.

The switch went out - wouldn't reverse. New switches are not a big deal. You can put 'em in yourself, but it voids whatever warrenty is left. ...the Makita is one well-built drill - ball bearings, steel gears, a little plastic, but not much. The only thing it couldn't stand was an abusive first owner, and some idiots at the repair place. Overall, I'd give the drill 5 stars, and the repair joint a zero, hence only four stars overall.

Bill Bellemy is still playing the same role but I was glad to see that he has been working out. Sheryl Underwood must be trying to promote herself since she was in this and Something New which is way better than this movie. I wouldn't have released this in the theatre too.

Tiptoes is none of those things.The acting was bad and that was surprising given the cast. I could not feel any sort of connection between Matthew McConaughey and Kate Beckinsale - much less that they could be living together and expecting a child.Gary Oldman is painful to watch - he hobbles around cramped into a dwarf outfit. Very Dorf-ish.And I have no idea what Peter Dinklage and Patricia Arquette added to the movie. They seem like they are from a completely different movie.The acting seems like it was done in one take. It was very painful trying to make it through 90 minutes of this trainwreck. All and all, a total disaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ack!","review":"From the box, this film looked interesting, and I've always liked Kate Beckinsale (plus it had some other big names, so I figured it couldn't be too bad), so I thought I'd get it. Gary Oldman's character seems to have two emotions: grumpy and sweet. Matthew McConaughey is always pissed about something, Patricia Arquette and her boyfriend have no real reason for even being in the movie, and there are so many plot holes it's distracting.

Only, his brother is played by a guy pretending to be a midget. He walks around on his knees the entire movie and looks so weird. Then guy and girl have a baby, it is a midget.

It is through and through awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"One of the worst, most absurdly scripted movies I have ever seen. The film takes what could be a very interesting topic and makes it utterly ridiculous.The characters played by Beckinsale and McConaughey are idiotic, their relationship is uncompelling, and their dialog is insultingly simple.The plot wanders with no focus on the crux of the issue.And can someone please tell me what being possessed Kate Beckinsale's hair throughout this waste of two hours?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tip Toes","review":"This movie is about a guy, named Steven, who is the only normal sized person in his family. The rest are all dwarves, including his twin brother. He only decides to tell his girlfriend, Carol, when she becomes pregnant and they have to discuss the possibility that the child will also be a dwarf.I liked this movie until the end. I could understand when Steven reacts badly to the pregnancy and when the baby turns out as a dwarf. But I hated that they had Carol, after Steven left her because he did not know how to deal with it all, starts a relationship with the brother. Not because he was a dwarf but because it seems the only reason she does it is because the brother is willing to help raise the baby and act like a father figure. In my opinion this ruined an otherwise pleasant movie about overcoming hardship and growing up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted potential","review":"This movie could have been something, but it blows every chance it gets.An example: The full-grown man who can't accept his son's dwarfism proclaims, \\"I am a dwarf!\\" A very powerful statement of his self-hatred, but the movie skims right over it -- No pondering, no exploration.Peter Dinklage is the one stand-out performance here. He's talented and full of life.Gary Oldman was wasted. His character was this guy that just waddled around. He and Dinklage should have been the main focus of the film. The \\"love affair\\" between McConaughey and Beckinsale is what ruined this film.This movie opened my eyes to what a terrible actor Matthew McConaughey really is. All cheeky grins and no substance. It's not all his fault; there are writers and editors and a whole cast to blame for this stinker!When it comes down to it, there is no mesh between the elements of this film. Stick with the classics and watch \\"Freaks.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst I have seen of Matthew McConaughey","review":"This movie is different and if you are a Matthew McConaughey fan like I am don't bother with this movie. It's about him being from a family of midgets and is ashamed of it and when he gets married and his wife becomes pregnant he leaves her because he is afraid that the baby will be a midget too. And to top it off the ending even sucks. I would reccomend, \\"How to loose a guy in 10 Days\\"; \\"A Time to Kill\\"; \\"Amastad\\"; \\"Failure to Launch\\"; \\"Sahara\\"; \\" Two for the Money\\" ect. Any of these movies are great and he shows his awesome acting skills, and great views of him as well :p ! But this movie was very disappointing and the message sent wasn't great at all.

McConaGay can't act and beckinStale is just barely decent to look at. At the end she ends up with the midget brother instead of being with the full sized mconagay character. I fell asleep and had to watch it two times to catch the funny ending. Then ending makes me thinkt he producers and directors and writers were playin a big joke. Its a good movie if you like mockin lil people. I think willow and LOTR are good for laughin at the under-priviliged.

I'll need to watch it again in case it was supposed to be a black comedy and I just missed it. If the movie is indeed supposed to be a drama, it is indeed the worst I've seen.

Don't bother watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gary Oldman is the only reason to see this...","review":"This is a train wreck of a movie. The only redeeming quality is seeing Gary Oldman playing the dwarf brother. That man can do anything onscreen. From Dracula, to Sirius Black, Beethoven, Joe Orton, and the Lt. in Batman--he is simply amazing with an incredible range. However, his talent overshadows all of the other BAD acting in this film. I mean BAD. Matthew McConaughey CANNOT act. Kate Beckinsale was great in Serendipity, but here she sports an unnatural American accent and fake-looking tattoos. Patricia Arquette is an absolute disaster and a totally unnecessary character. Peter Dinklage is talented--but why the French accent? It is unfortunate, but I think that this film does the exact opposite of what its intentions were, which was to get the viewer to understand and root for the little people. It doesn't do that. They are very much exploited here."},{"rating":"1","title":"An absurd movie with no resolution","review":"This movie could have had a very important moral lesson, but it fails on many levels. The characters are very artificial and quite lacking in real-life characteristics. The dialog is stilted and none of the characters seem to have more than one emotion throughout the movie. The ending is what really kills this movie. Drama is built upon conflict, good movies have some sort of resolution that the conflict. This movie resolves nothing; it ends with the wife kissing her husband's dwarf brother. All the ending seems to imply is that the husband cannot change, but the repercussions are not explored. The wife never actually tries to convince or help the husband change; she just pleads. On a side note, this movie is rated 'R' for the use of the \\"F\\" word."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible movie.","review":"I received the movie quickly and it's well packaged.

The inventor of modern printing was a fascinating,wide-ranging genius in constant need of lawyers and lenders.

One cannot tell which is which without prior knowledge of Gutenberg's story.

It depressed me. It enraged me. I never saw the 3 guys ever do anything back.What they did to those guys was just plain mean. I mean, what the hell did the death of their 4th friend have to do with their ex-husbands cheating on them? I mean, it's one thing to teach them a lesson when they're still married, but when they're divorced, that means they are ENTITLED to have the freedom to go for other women.Men get dumped by women all the time for better-looking guys, but you don't see these guys putting their ex-wives through that kind of hell.I don't understand how women can actually like this movie.

What a funny, poignant movie about friends drifting apart, relationships that go bad and the importance of building something together with those who you truly love. As Cynthia Swan (one of four friends who commits suicide when left by her husband for a younger woman -- a great performance by Stockard Channing) says, \\"perhaps the problem is lonliness\\" in her notes to her three best college friends (played by Goldie Hawn, Diane Keaton and Bette Midler). A real delight, with a great sound track, esepcially the closing rendition of Lesley Gore's \\"You Don't Own Me\\" by Hawn, Midler and Keaton. I especially like that the three women (after exacting justice on their own philandering husbands) have formed a strong bond, and that the film ends with them together, singing and dancing up a storm!"},{"rating":"2","title":"First wives Club","review":"This is a wonderful woman's movie!

As many times as I've watched the movie, it drives me crazy that she didn't \\"get hers.\\" However, the most distracting aspect of the movie? Diane Keaton's costume. Why was she dressed as a gestapo agent, even down to the eyeglasses. This is the worst costuming I have ever seen. Who doubted that Keaton couldn't carry off this role without this bizarre uniform? And, even her hair is in keeping with this ridiculous appearance. I'd give anything to get an explanation for this travesty from the costumer or whoever is responsible for this travesty. (Her character absolutely did not require such outfitting). It makes it very difficult to enjoy Keaton's acting.It hadn't sunk in that the center the women found has nothing whatsoever to do with wealthy, despairing women like the friend they lost.

But madcap and zany? No way. For years, actresses have been complaining that strong roles for women are limited--if not absent--in Hollywood. I couldn't agree more, but the dearth is by no means aided by the dumber than dumb rampage of Brenda, Elise, and Annie (Bette Midler, Goldie Hawn, and Diane Keaton).If white men can't jump, white chicks can't dance, and try as it might to be hip and topical, The First Wives' Club instead becomes Waiting to Exhale for white, middle-aged, housefraus.

The author wanders far far afield repeatedly wasting pages on too much detail about such things as Viet Nam and the bossa nova...when a few paragraphs would have sufficed (the book is about Jackie, remember?).

After all, she is semi-barbarian. Maybe if she weren't semi-barbarian, she'd choose the door with the lady whom she hated behind it. She chose the tiger's door because she was jealous. She saw her lover and the woman speaking and trading glances, which obviously creates jealousy. Ultimately, jealousy makes everyone seek revenge, which is why the princess chose the tiger as her lover and the woman's punishment. This short-story was a good read. However, the movie that compliments the story is absolutely horrible. I wouldn't recommend it.

The filter does a good job catching the shaved stubble and must be replaced with the fluid.A major problem in the design is the impeller shaft that pumps the cleaning fluid from the reservoir to the cleaning area. I've had to replace the entire cleaning base three times because the impeller shaft becomes rusty and breaks off, rendering the cleaning feature unuseable.Gunk tends to build up in the shaving head and this needs to be disassembled regularly and cleaned by hand.

I really gave this razor a chance, and suffered through the pain thinking it would eventually subside. It hasn't. This sucker just plain hurts.I get bad razor burn on my neck when I try to get a real close shave, and the shaver loves to yank the hair around the chin and mustache area (which shouldn't happen with brand new blades, and a fully charged unit!). It hurts really bad.Getting up to go to work or school in the morning is painful enough, but this shaver just adds to it.The ONLY good part of this razor is the nice smell of the cleaning solution. Does that count??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Design","review":"The shave is not nearly as close as their competitor's with very similar design, and it does leave more of a burn than the competitor. I had one of these for 20 months, and had to have the cleaning system replaced 4 times under warranty! The pump just quits and the system doesn't work after 5 or 6 months. The last time, they replaced the entire thing, including the shaver, with a new (more expensive) model R-1000. They don't seem to have learned anything from the previous design, and the angle of the head on this new one makes it nearly impossible to use. The switch is located right where my thumb rests, so I inadvertently turn it off frequently in mid-shave. I'm going back to the other guys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"glad i ignored negative reviews","review":"bought it off ebay for $50 new. yes, it does take a little while to get used to---there's a good chance you will feel a little irritation at first-probably on your neck. But let me tell you something: this thing shaves a gazzilion times faster than my Braun did. I used to dread shaving, especially if i missed 2 or 3 days. This shaver is a breeze to use. I use the self-clean once a week so far. If you've ever used a Norelco, you know what a collassal pain in the butt it is to keep it clean. And it never seems to stay clean. This system is such a breath of fresh air. just push the clean button, and you're done.p.s. I almost wonder if some of the horrific revues were written by the competition. seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"An outstanding shaver","review":"This is by far the best electric shaver I have ever used. If you use it as directed (not pressing it too hard into your skin), there is no way it can cut you or even irritate. I have sensitive skin, yet I can use this without any pre-shave products. The self-cleaning feature is outstanding as well. The shave I get is also much closer than with any other electric shaver I ever used-- I used to avoid electric shavers because they always left me with stubble; this one doesn't. If you're looking for a premium shaver, get this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money, use a wet razor","review":"I bought this shaver about a month ago. I been using it fairly regularly to let my face get used to it. After that month I still get massive razor burn from it. It takes me at least 7 minutes to get a decently close shave with it and by 5PM I got shadow all over. I can do a better job with my Gillete Atra in half the time. I have tried pre electric shave lotions and after shave lotion but nothing helps, my face still gets red with razor burn. What is also bad is that the cleaning solution only lasts about 4 weeks and when I tried to order it from Remington directly they said there was a 3 week backorder wait time, they were out. No store seems to carry the cleaning solution at this time either. I guess if you have to have it, get it, but I prefer my old wet razor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery life is dead","review":"This electric razor does the job when it comes to shaving. However, my one major reason for purchasing an electric razor was so that I could shave on the go. Unfortunately, this razor does not live up to the job because it never keeps the charge. When fully charged, the razor reads \\"60 minutes\\". So after a full day charging, I grab my razor and take it off the charger (stating 60 minutes) and as soon as I turn it on, it falls to \\"0 minutes\\" and does not work. Then if I plug it in, it still doesn't work. Now, please understand that this did not used to be a problem; this only happened after about 1 year of ownership. But, I would not expect this to happen after only one year, maybe after 5-6 years. Good luck to you, gentlemen."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst purchase that I have made.","review":"When I purchased this shaver, it was with the understanding that it was new. When it arrived it had scratches on the chrome surface, the on off switch was obviously worn. When I shaved with it my neck was not red from irritation It was red with blood, not just one spot. There were at least 30-40 places that were bleeding. It was delivered with no paperwork. I have no idea how to return it.Ken Maxwell"},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent shaver, poorly designed cleaning base, good customer service","review":"I purchased this for my husband 2 and a half years ago. HE changed the solution and filter regularly. There is a clamp on the pump that starts rusting pretty quickly. Why the design was not updated to a stainless steel clamp is beyond me. The base was replaced after a few months when we noticed the problem with the rust. Customer support was great. The entire system was replaced when the rust got really bad again and we suspected it was affecting the shaver head. The third base quit working a couple months ago. My husband has been cleaning it by hand since. We're surprising him with a new Norelco 8245 XLD for father's day.

I read the entire book only to find the story finishing in 1954. The notes at the end said that shirley was working on the second instalment of her biography, and seeing as that was in 1988, I can only guess that she would have completed it by now - but it appears never have made it to publication. I was very disappointed that the biography only covered her life as a childhood star and then as a wife and mother. So I would hesitate to recommend the book as it is only half a biography, and would suit fans of the silver screen only."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Can Relate to Holden","review":"As a fifteen year old, I understand the problems that Holden Caufeild undergoes in the few days that the story takes place.

Probably is it looks pretty hard to remove.I would buy the tool again if it didnt have the flip screw driver.

Very impressed with the quality of the tool. Nice construction and comfort with the handle, and the pop out screwdriver is very handy in a pinch.

I have been doing minor renovation work at home, and I can say I use this tool many times every day. It is great as a paint scraper, paint can opener and paint can closer, among other things. I haven't thought to use the screwdriver since it so neatly tucks into the handle of the device (and contrary to another review, the screwdriver on mine has never popped out unless I wanted it to -- you have to push a button to get it to fold out).What can I say -- it's cheap, great quality, and it does a ton of different things.

It completely ruined the visual enjoyment, greens, blues, reds, oranges, purples, etc. were too intense. I live in the southwest and love the subtly of the natural earthan colors. Besides the poor photography the narrator seemed to be frantically searching through a thesarus for desciptive words.

I would estimate that the vacuum picks up about 70% of the clippings, so I'm not sure it is worth the noise (and it is noisy). I found this to be true regardless of how big the trim job. Also, when this trimmer goes dead, it goes dead fast. My old trimmer would slow down when the batteries needed charging, leaving me with some wiggle room to finish up my trim.

I wish I would of went back and bought another Norelco with the precision cutting system because it worked better than the Remington. The Remington MB-70 needs to be recharged when the battery goes down. You can't use the cord when shaving. That can be a big problem when the battery runs down and you have half a face to shave.

If my face was a perfectly vertical plane and all my whiskers were at 90-degree angles then this arrangement might almost work. As it is, it doesn't.

Survived--not in the sense of simply enduring, but forging stronger family bonds out of these apparently unendurable trials. Kusz's writing is almost painfully sensuous but never overblown.

The only real action happens at the beginning and end.The \\"relationship\\" between the two leads, Derik and Sara, is not even developed.

The sex and romance were very rushed, I suppose it had to be in order to fit everything into so few pages!I read all the reviews and was surprised no one mentioned the second story. Maybe my library had a different version and I was just unlucky enough to get the bonus. I would have been mad if I paid for this, only to find the last third of the book is a separate novella -- a horrid rape \\"romance\\" that reads like something written by a cave man.

I finished the book and had that sinking \\"that's it?\\" feeling. I felt cheated. It was a good idea, but it never managed to engage me the way I expected. The only reason I kept reading was that I expected it to get better, to live up to my expectations. I should have given up and not wasted my time.

Everything about this book fell flat for me. The sexual tension was weak. The plot non-existent. The character interactions were boring. Occasionally there were moments of something witty.

And it did start out that way, with Derik's provocation of Michael setting off a fight, possibly to the death. However, so much of this book was unbelievable that it was like chewing cheap gum that won't hold together. For example, the deadly attackers who fail to assassinate the heroine--they fall over, etc.--make no impression not only on her, but apparently also on the rest of the hospital staff. No one seems even upset. In fact, no one in the hospital seems even to notice the deadly attempt. No one calls the police. It's as if a group of rowdy boys have misbehaved. The characterization was very uneven and \\"jerky,\\" not smooth. Yes, the dialogue is funny--Davidson is rightfully famous for that. I laughed often.

This reel handled 50 plus fish smoothly with no issues. Drag worked like a champ. This reel is a workhorse.Update 8-23-12I have used this reel on 5 trips now, casting Size 22 BWO to Size 2 Buggers, Hoppers and Stoneflies. I have used it to catch Trout, Bass, Crappie and Bluegill and it has handled fish up to 4 lbs. This reel has landed over 2 hundred fish and handled thousands of casts. It performs just as well if not better than reels 3 times the price.Reel is loaded with Scientific Angler Mastery Series Trout WF4. It has been paired with the following rods - Orvis Trident TL 3wt, Winston 5wt and Basspro Whitewater Classic 4wt rods.It is a certianty that I will own a few more of these reels in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"10/11 not up to big fish","review":"Not that at this price you expect it would be. The drag is sticky and the reel handle far too feeble and the base is extra feeble. Tuna and dorado were caught on this reel so it is functional for a trip or two or as an emergency back up reel - it has tons of capacity. But if you buy one, go over all the screws for the base and handle and hit them with lock-tight or glue. This thing falls apart under pressure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scratched/Marred right out of box!!! Coulda been a contender!","review":"Not sure who to blame... too big an amazon box that let the okuma reel box bounce around too much or if the reel was dropped on the factory floor before they stuck it in the box. soooooo bummed. my other beef is that the reel came configured where to wind in the line, one would reel counterclockwise. surprised that that's the default orientation. they included decent instruction on how to reverse that but it involved a tiny phillips screwdriver/screws and a little pushing/handling on brand new, oiled up bearings.Other than that, the bearings and drag systems seem pretty smooth.Is there a way to attach a pic to this review?? I was able to on the packaging review...."},{"rating":"1","title":"specs","review":"I would consider buying Okuma even after beingcompletely dissed by a woman at Okuma customersupport.

It is light, fluid, and versatile. The drag adjustment was a little odd and could use a bit more refining. The instructions for changing the reel to left-handed were simple and only took a few minutes. Some people prefer just to flip the reel around; I'm not one of them. If you're left-handed and want and great reel, search no further."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice reel","review":"Nice reel. I put it on my Redington CT 5wt. Haven't really used the drag yet. Basically just holds my line, but reel feels solid. I would buy it again for my other rods. I have recommended it to my friends. The price is hard to beat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Test fit it first!","review":"Maybe it's unfair to rate this reel until I've fished it, but spooled it up today and went to put it on my 8wt. Front foot is too thick to fit in the reel seat. I've NEVER had a reel that did not fit the appropriate weight reel seat. Since it was already loaded, I decided not to return it, and carefully tapered the front foot so that it would fit. I expect an inexpensive reel to have less than perfect drag and some cosmetic problems, but this is ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Bickham's forte","review":"Jack Bickham writes a varied type of Novel. I've read all of the Brad Smith Tennis series . His Westerns are usually 4 star efforts. His family oriented books, such as \\"Baker's Hawk\\", are great. But, when he writes about Bank Robberies (\\"The Silver Bullet Gang\\"), or in this confused tale about the stealing of a virus, Jack Bickham's efforts leave a lot to be desired. As in \\"Silver Bullet Gang\\" the main character (Davey, here) is not very likeable. I , early on, got a little tired of his negative attitude. Also, to me, the plot makes very little sense. If you wnt to try a likeable Jack Bickham book there are LOTS of better options."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Rossetti, but...","review":"This edition is horrible. It has no line breaks.

When have you seen Reynolds cry? -- after committing murder. He is sardonic, evil and sympathetic. The ensemble work is superb with Keith Carradine solid, and Pat Hingle wonderfully venal. Newcomer, Hayley DuMond, carries her weight and often the weight of the movie itself. She is the center of the emotional storm, complex and driven. Weinman's choice of authentic folk music is worth the visit alone. I had a good time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly Good Cast","review":"It would have been better without Carradine (What is with that stupid smirk on his face?). Haley Du Mond is beautiful and talented. It must have been a chalenge for her to act as though she loved Carradine's character. Reynolds was good but the flowing long hair in the 1920's?

I was quite shocked when my order arrived and I eagerly sprayed the perfume for a sample, to only be truly disappointed by the scent. It's a very heavy scent -- it almost makes me think of a little old lady.According to the previous reviews, this was also a perfume that Michael Jackson wore for years. Wow! I can't imagine that he would want to smell like a little old lady! This is not a manly scent by any means."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bal A Versailles by Jean Desprez for Women","review":"I purchased this cologne because I learned that it was one of several that was used by Michael Jackson and I was curious. This may sound odd but I was always curious as to how he smelled. I'd read that some people referred to his scent as soft or light and pleasant. I was surprised to find that this is not soft, in my opinion, but it is a fragrance that I enjoy. It is similar in quality to a lighter version Tabu which I wore for many years and loved. I would recommend this to anyone male or female. I love that I am able to wear something that he really enjoyed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfume","review":"Great perfume. Quick delivery.

I loved the idea that it held so many pairs of shoes, but the materials are VERY cheep and the pockets for the shoes are WAY too short. I have small feet (size 6) and the shoes still stick halfway out and fall out with any movement of the door. Has the potential to be a great product, but too bad the company decided to cut the corners and create a product that is a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother.","review":"Horrible, horrible, horrible. My mom had one of these a few years ago, so I bought this one. Come to find out the rope she had holding it up in the center was NOT because she'd broken something on it, but simply because of its bad design. Any shoes with heels stack up on top of whatever's below it, and once you get it full it sags like nobody's business. Her solution was to attach a rope to the top center and forcibly make it hold at more of a 90-degree angle. That worked pretty well, but I didn't want to mess with all that. I bought a floor-to-ceiling, spinning shoe rack instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Already used and cheep","review":"I just received my package. It was already dirty (used) and had a dead beetle in it. The legs got stuck in some cracks so I am going to have beetle legs in my shoe rack forever. gross. also the slots do not hold my whole shoe, meaning the heels are sticking out in most of them. It looks pretty cheep, but I guess that is what you get for 11 dollars. I just started using it, so I hope it doesn't break like everyone is saying it will."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the trouble","review":"I have returned this product twice now. The first time it arrived without the metal door hangers. The second time, everything was in the box, but once I got it up and put shoes in it, it sunk under the weight of the shoes. It looked horrible, and it was so hard to get the shoes in and out of the pouches. Find something with a hard/metal/plastic frame, it's worth the extra money."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly made","review":"I had a product just like this one 8 years ago, but had to give it up because my cat kept climbing it and shredding the plastic. I recently ordered 2 of them and was very disappointed. Pockets are too small to hold a pair of sneakers, so I had to put one in each slot. The supports for the pockets also broke. After about 3 days it came crashing to the floor when the small plastic rings that it hangs by broke. I managed to get it back on the door by using metal rings. The 2nd one lasted about a week, but the material ripped and the plastic rings also broke on this one.Would not recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh, ok for small doors","review":"We got this b/c we live in an apartment and it has smaller doors than would fit a more sturdy shoe rack.

Maybe for a kids closet this would work well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripped Immediately","review":"I didn't even have half of the slots filled and it came crashing down within 5 minutes of hanging it up. The material ripped right where it hangs onto the medal door hanger. Also, one of the plastic pieces that hold the outer top/bottom of each slot snapped in half pretty easily as I put a pair of shoes in.

My hubby's shoes don't fit in it at all, the spaces are too short to hold them. It isn't substantial enough to even hold my shoes and our kids' shoes without the spaces kind of \\"folding\\". The kid's shoes aren't even that big, a toddler and a 10 year old!I don't wear heels or anything that would tear the plastic but 3 of the spaces tore so bad I can't even use them.

The product arrived late but assembly was easy enough and all my shoes seemed to fit. I actually had about eight free spaces so I was psyched that there was a possibility of further shoe shopping in my future. Thirty minutes later I heard this crash to only find that the plastic holder used to support the weight of the system over the door had broken and created this huge tear rendering the product worthless. Most of my shoes are slip on or tennis shoes so relatively light so I was a bit shocked this had happened, especially so quickly. I thought I was getting a deal on this as I've seen other systems like this for forty dollars or more but in actuality I just managed to waste more money.

Thisproduct is only big enough (in each spaceprovided) for a small pair of high heels to be stored!!I recommend this only for children or verysmall ladies. I have size 11 shoes and itSOOOO does not hold my shoes. I have to scrunchthem up to get them in or only put one of the shoes, not both,in one or every other one of the slots.

This one is a little complicated and involved,and that's why it's so good. I haven't finsished yet but so far it's one of her best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good read from Ann Rule","review":"Ann Rule provides enough background information to make the people she has written about come to life. Ms. Rule has the ability to make a book of non-fiction read like a work of fiction. As usual, the well-chosen photographs add to the book without being excessively graphic. Van Houte/Blackthorn is an abominable waste of a \\"human\\". It is astounding how many lives this creep ruined--including those of his own children. It is mind-numbing that such narcissists can thrive in our world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caren","review":"This is absolutely the worst written book that I have ever read. Perhaps it doesn't matter, because the story IS riveting. Having read other Ann Rule books, I have to wonder if she had less experienced staff members write it for her. It is written in a choppy manner, with various grammatical issues, as well (I'm no expert on grammar -- but these issues are obvious). I can believe that much effort was put into researching this book, but I wish more effort had been put into the writing of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"D U L L","review":"Why, why, why did we have to learn about the grandparents of Sheila and Alan? What did that have to do with the story? While I felt very bad that Sheila was brutally murdered, I think Ann Rule tried to make Sheila this poor helpless creature when infact, Sheila had lots of avenues to take if she really wanted to get away from Alan. I love Ann Rule's true crime however, this time she definately missed the mark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Ann Rules best, but among the best of true crime","review":"I've read so much of Ann Rule, probably all of her books, and I think they're all four stars or better. This one I gave four stars, because it's not quite her best work, but it is certainly better than most true crime writers. Her thoroughness is one of her hallmarks, but the main thing that sets her apart is the way she can get into the head of the criminal and the motivations. Ann explains how she wrote this book at the request of a victim, and that must be a first. It's the story of the murder and abuse of Sheila Bellush, made truly horrific because the children were in their home when she was murdered. As always Ann brings compassion to her narrative that has never been matched by any other true crime author. A solid four stars, only by comparison to her other books, which are almost entirely five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Detailed account of relentless revenge","review":"Ann Rule reconstructs Allen's twisted childhood and its effects on his multiple abusive marriages and convoluted business deals. It shows the resulting horrific murder-for-hire of his former wife, Sheila, after she fled the state with her quadruplet toddlers.The clues tying the bumbling murderer and accomplices are painstakingly detailed, showing that they all led back to the ex-husband.The trials seem a bit tedious as the reader follows the same clues once again through each proceeding, but in general, the book is Rule's usual gripping account."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad, not great","review":"For the most part, this book is well-written and presents the researched facts in an orderly fashion. However, it goes on FOREVER! I love Ann Rule's writings, but does she always have to use titles and lines from once popular songs for her book titles? You Belong To Me, Every Breath You Take, etc., etc.Blackthorne is a wicked man, if man he be. As for Sheila, I felt sorry for her, but didn't understand why she didn't get out sooner. While she definitely was no angel, either, she didn't deserve to be abused. I was happy that she found a good man the second go-round. However, she allowed him to abuse her children. When their father abused them, she made it a court case. When their step-father did it, she joined in. My Dad was a Marine D.I. and he wasn't an abusive parent. So,in my opinion, Jamie Bellush has no excuse for abusing children, his or not. Why the girls let him adopt them is beyond me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly boring...","review":"I'm a huge true crime fan, a very big Ann Rule fan, yet this one didn't do it for me. To me, Small Sacrifices was a masterpiece. This one was loaded w/unnecessary detail, yet she sometimes left out stuff that the reader would consider important ... for instance - Stevie's sexual abuse allegations against her father seemed to scare Alan, so they must've had merit .... yet it was really never delved into in the story. Another thing - while this crime was about as bad as it gets, and I hope those 4 losers rot in jail for what they did - Sheila was a bit unsympathetic at times. Ann Rule could have at least acknowledged that, rather than chalking it up to being in love, or being afraid. And Jamie was a jerk! I had a hard time understanding why she allowed him to discipline the girls that harshly (11-12 yrs old, being slapped in the face?)."},{"rating":"1","title":"YAWN","review":"For the most part, I have been a big fan of Ann Rule. But lately, she's been just throwing them out and they just aren't that good. I couldn't bear reading this book for more then fifteen minutes at a time. It was so repetitious and monotonous that I would fall asleep. Why did we have to read about Sheila and Alan's grandparents and what did it have to do with her murder? The victim herself, while she certainly did not deserve her fate, was not really that likable. She seemed alittle self absorbed and turned her face to alot of bad things that Alan did. The book just went on and on with needless information. It didn't leave you wanting more, this was the first book I actually couldn't wait to finish. If you want to read a truly good true crime book, I recommend \\"Salt of the Earth\\" by Jack Olsen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completly One sided.","review":"This book is completly one sided. Never once did Rule interview the Bellush Family. I believe that she betrayes James as the bad guy, even though she never interviewed any of us. This was a terrible tradgey that hit our family. Don't waste your time reading Rules one sided story. Watch the A&E show instead.!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another fascinating book from Ann Rule","review":"Once again Ann Rule has shown herself to be the best author of true-crime. I just finished \\"Every Breath You Take\\" and am still astounded at how much research Ms. Rule has done to make this story so thorough and compelling.What I have always appreciated in Ann Rule's books is the objectivity with which she tells the story. I find that many true-crime authors interject their opinions into the story. Ann Rule presents the facts objectively, and lets the reader come to hiw own conclusions.I read \\"Every Breath You Take\\" in a single sitting, and it was fabulous. But, to tell the truth, I didn't expect anything else.Thanks for another great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"True crime at its best!!","review":"Ann Rule is, in my opinion, the best true crime writer today. I love true crime and have read alot of different authors, but nobody is better! This is a scary story! Having been married to an abuser a long time ago, I shuddered each time I read about the abuse that Sheila suffered at the hands of her husband Allen. But the scarier part was that there were so many people that knew or suspected that Allen was plotting to kill his ex-wife and said nothing! I am looking forward to Ann Rule's next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring -- Wait for the City Confidential Version","review":"This is a \\"true-crime\\" novel about an abused wife/mother who leaves her wealthy, charming husband after years of marriage. The husband wants revenge and stalks her and eventually brutally murders her. This is where the story begins.The story itself is interesting enough. And Rule does a good job of keeping your attention for a while. But after the murder, the ensuing court case just goes on and on. It's as though Rule has made a deal to mention everyone in the book that she interviewed, so she has to give the most intricate details of the court case in order to fit everyone in.Bottom line: The TV show City Confidential could do a great job with this story (if it hasn't already), but as a book it's just plain boring. One of the few books I was not able to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long and drawn out","review":"This book is filled with extraneous stuff that could have well been left out. I've loved all the other Rule books I've read, but this one was a real let down for me. It would have been good being half as long.I think it would have been better not written at all, and possibly the request by the victim to have Anne write it clouded her better judgement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I agree totally with the review below entitled \\"B O R I N G\\". Ann Rule is one of my favorite authors, but this book is a major disappointment. The story is not compelling, and it could be told in less than an 100 pages instead of over 400 pages. It was hard to finish the book. I don't mean to minimize the horrific murder that occurred, but I didn't find this story to be on par with what I can usually expect from Ann Rule."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tired cliche","review":"What was it about the stories of Sheila Bellush and Allen Van Houte that made Ann Rule feel compelled to write a book about them? A Dateline special I can understand. Neither of these individuals are very interesting let alone sympathetic. Sheila's second husband, Jamie, was not likable at all. Everyone was a two-dimensional cardboard cutout. Allen was the controlling, overbearing, conniving, abusive ex-husband. Sheila was the dedicated, loving wife, and hapless victim to be. I got the sense from the book that there was more to Sheila's character than that, but Rule never chooses to protray her with any depth.The narrative was not fun to read. I thought that Rule jumped around unnecessarily from time period to time period, and this is especially true when she jumped around when telling the story of the weeks leading to Bellush's death.True crime stories always draw me in, simply for the human drama. Unfortunately, I felt no drama in this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing!","review":"I originally just got this book for a crime and law paper I had to write. But it turned out to be so involving and so capturing, you really begin to feel like you know this family and you begin to feel what they went through. It is an amazingly detailed depiction of a serious sociopath and his demonic and manipulative ways at getting anything he wants and eliminating anything \\"unnecessary\\" to his lifestyle.I highly recommend this to the reader who really wants to be -involved- with a story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of her best","review":"This was not one of Ann Rule's best books. \\"Bitter Harvest\\" and \\"Stranger Beside Me\\" are much better reads.In a nutshell: \\"Every Breath You Take\\" is too long and it's difficult to sympathize with the individual(s) as they were portrayed in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"fast reading","review":"I gave this book four stars. Intro was very long. All of the characters introduced at the beginning of the book and there were many, I found this very confusing. As you read the book you realized who everyone was but I did not like this lay out of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down","review":"Wow this is narcissism at its best. I read this book in a couple of days and made several attempts to put it down but just had to keep reading. One of the best true crime stories I have read. Truth really is stranger then fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear Storytelling","review":"Ann Rule's gift has always been the integration of facts in a format that allows readers to discover the gruesome crimes in a more or less chronological order. She relies a bit too much on foreshadowing - a frustration in many true crime books - but in this book she keeps the pace fast and the revelations breathtaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breath taking suspence","review":"Ann Rule is an exceptional writer and has outdone herself in her true account of Sheila's life and those who touched Sheila. Throughout the story I felt myself in tune with Sheila's thoughts and feelings. It makes one realize how easily some people can draw others into their life and cast a spell to become so possessive of another human life, even to the extent of extinguishing that life by what ever means possible. This book is a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply put: the worst book ever.","review":"I'm not a fan of true crime, and now I remember why. Thisbook was boring, repetitive, non-creative, and a churn of newspaper article facts. My last time for Ann Rule, whomI was shocked to discover how many books she sold. Simplyput, this is one of the worst books I have ever read. Did someone say it was once on the best seller list?"},{"rating":"1","title":"600 pages should have been 300!","review":"The story is interesting but way, way too long. Ann Rule's books keep getting worse. Her first books were great but have gone down hill lately. Some are nothing more than old newspaper articles put into book form. This one is half filler material about houses, cities, wedding dress descriptions.........yawn. I'm done spending good money on bad Ann Rule books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great! - for Non-Readers!","review":"I have always hated reading - but Ann Rule has opened up a wonderful world to me. Her subject (murder) is sad, but she does an excellent job of enthralling us into the victim's lives. Even though I knew the outcome, I couldn't wait to read it for myself. I only wish I could find out more about what has happened since the ending of the book. Thank you Ann Rule."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of Ann's best book (in my opinion)","review":"I have read every book that Ann Rule has written, and usually can't wait to read her next book. This was no exception. I purchased, but for the first time, found it difficult to follow, with too many details. It took me awhile to finally finish the book, when I usually read it in two days. I have given every other book by her 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't get passed the 30th page.","review":"I would not tell anyone to read this book. [No offense to the family it's about] but I wanted a book I could get so into I wouldn't put the book down, this book -- I couldn't keep reading. It's way too boring in the first 30 pages, I just gave up with it. A waste of my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"B O R I N G","review":"That's the best way to describe this book. There were times I couldn't keep my eyes open. Sheila Bellush was by all accounts, smart...so why did she stay with the bird faced Allen?(which Ann Rule continuously calls \\"handsome\\")... If that's not enough, she deals with him bringing home prostitutes both male and female(not to mention a few lovers in between). She finally has enough and leaves the man she fears, only to move on the same block with him? Then we are bored with the family tree....we have to go back to the childhoods of Allen and Sheila's parents. While the only interest lies with Allen's family, because his life with them, would mold him into the person he would become. Maybe it's because the victim herself wanted Ann Rule to write her story, but I feel Ms. Rule just threw in too much needless information. The real interest lies in the killer himself. That would have been an interesting story..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping and Bizarre -- Typical Ann Rule","review":"I have read all of Ann Rule's books, and this is as good as all of the others. Rule's books continually strike me as so bizarre, you can't even believe they are real. At the same time, you like them BECAUSE the reality is so much more bizarre that you would expect. I also like Ann Rule's books (and this one is no exception) because she does not try to make heroes out of the victims -- she portrays everyone realistically and humanly, with all of the normal human faults we all have. This book gets off to a bit of a slow start (Ann Rule does love to go into the family history of the main characters a bit too much), but picks up quickly and is well worth the effort. Allen Van Houte/Blackthorne is pure evil."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"Ann Rule is one of my favorite writers. I have read & enjoyed every book she has written. Unfortunately, this book fell way short of her other books. Her books are usually very hard to put down & has you sitting on the edge of your seat.Unfortunately, this one was quite disappointing. The story was very dry, quite slow, uninteresting & just plain boring.Not one of her best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every Breath You Take","review":"I have read every book Ann Rule has written and each time I am amazed that each new book is\\" the best I have ever read\\"until her next book comes out and as always the new book is \\"the best\\".In writing this book Ann Rule has managed as always to make her readers privy into the very life of the victim and the person responsible for her death- this book delves into obsession and the truly devious and horrific way the final act of this obsession was carried out -a detailed and factual well written gripping book ,as only Ann Rule can write."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never ABRIDGE","review":"I had trouble following the characters in this audio, yet Rule has a fluid writing style that makes a true story read like fiction. But in this abridged audio version, this talent makes itself apparent only in spurts. I think this is due to the abridgement process.I feel the same way about abridgment as I feel about watching a movie reformatted to fit the television screen; if I am going to invest the time in viewing the movie, I want ALL of the movie. So even if I were reduced to a 12 inch screen, I would want to see the movie in letterbox, if possible.So too, if I am going to listen to a book, I want the WHOLE book. Granted, there are things such as charts and graphs that are tedious in audio, these things are best described in brief, but I do not think this is the sort of pruning and clipping that took place in this abridgement; otherwise, I would have found the characters easier to follow because they would have been much more developed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even close to her other books","review":"This was also a huge disappointment to me, an avid fan who has read all of Rule's books and can hardly wait for the next to come out. The book has way too much detail and the characters are not very interesting. BORING BORING BORING!!! This story would have been much better served as one of Rule's short stories. My advice is to get ...And Never Let her Go - much better and more interesting read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Comedy Gold","review":"Anton Szandor LaVey is a comedic genius with a witty understanding of truth and virtue. Even though comedy isn't the exact point of his writing, humor still comes through in an undeniable way. That makes sense as he elaborates on the importance of a sense of humor in destroying the sanctimonious in more than one part of the book. His views are always insightful, even if you don't agree with everything he says, and he has a paradoxical way of showing truth. \\"The Devil's Notebook\\" is a short work and makes for a very approachable read. You should read it, and after you read it, read it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of LaVey's Most Interesting Work","review":"Of all of LaVey's work, though the Satanic Bible is most well known, and arguably the best, this was the one I enjoyed the most. I think that the essays contained in The Devil's Notebook reveal a lot more about LaVey and about Satanism than you can find in any of his other works. This is one of the few books I have found recently that made a noticeable impact in my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's interesting","review":"This is an interesting book. It rings alot of truth if you read it with an open mind. Personally I think Mr.Lavey would have been alot of fun to hang out with. You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gods Among Men","review":"Everything negative can be said about this book, even by those that read it. LaVey speaks only to very few who have a keen sense of humor, a sharp intellect, and a hearty taste for freedom. Most people need not apply for the position, and in fact, it's prefereable to everyone already inside. Purchase with care."},{"rating":"1","title":"LaVey's Poorest Effort","review":"\\"Hatha Toilet Seat Meditation\\" is the most impressive thing here. A more personal approach than his other books, it's also far too narcissistic and whiny to make much impression on most except for self-righteous Christians or know-it-all LaVey worshippers, although amusing in places. LaVey seems to think that by whining about how much he hates everyone he is indulging himself; I agree, but it is the self-indulgence of a spoilt brat throwing a temper tantrum. A volume on his work in lion-taming or psychic investigation would have been much more impressive. The Satanic Bible is better in every way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wiccan Separatists, Come On!","review":"This is a great book, and if you have an open mind yet don't care to really read about Satanism in its pure form, this book is for you.A fellow Wiccan said:>There should be a separate section for those...don't put us all together, our beliefs are not the same!!!I think that's an interesting point; however, understand that if anyone is casually browsing in the metaphysical/magic/religion section, don't you think that perhaps a person should have a *choice*?I don't think most Satanists would disagree: what is the matter with grouping Satan and Wicca in the same section at a major bookstore? Regarding Satanism, people are allowed to make their own choices, and those who know the way will follow their own path...Have you even read this book?This book is not necessarily about Satanism--buy it if you wish to be entertained, and at times, informed upon some lighter topics from LaVey."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Devil\`s Notebook","review":"If you are into Satanism ore wan\`t to read about it.

Trying to pave the way, he denied any illegal activity by members. That is not what most people think of when they think of satanism, and for mabny it was no longer scary.

So the size (length at least) was something that was missing from the product information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad book about sandwiches","review":"This is the third in the Sin series. It is the only one I read. It was so bad I didn't want to read the others. The first two might be good. The first one was made into a fairly good movie.The series is about Detective Delaney who hunts down serial killers. In this book, you meet the killer right off. She is a semi-sympathetic character who is killing bad men, such as cheating husbands. But, the author makes sure she should be caught and punished by having her kill one victim who turns out to be good and has second thoughts about cheating on his wife.Most of the book deals with how the killer does in her victims or how the detective makes a sandwich. Instead getting details on how the crime is solved, we get details about sloppy, gross sandwiches that are eaten over a sink. In the end the crime really isn't solved and the killer is discovered mostly by accident."},{"rating":"2","title":"Want to know about the evangelical movement in Colombia?","review":"This book provides a treasure of insights for anyone wanting to understand the evangelical movement in Colombia. Writing from a feminist perspective, Brusco must admit that evangelicalism radically changes the dynamics of family life for the better...I highly recommend this book for anyone wanting to understand the religious climate in Colombia, especially in Bogotá. I found the book easy to read, except for a few pages dealing with sociological studies on machismo.

A quick question to a stranger avery few blocks was more helpful. However this map was great at giving the driver the overall idea of how his area is in relations to what's around him and how far he is from the water or from a particular neighborhood.

Most of the clever, funny, endearing, and amusing scenes from the book have either been excised in the film or just haven't translated to film all that well. It's kind of a pity, because the excellent television adaptation of Hogfather showed that the Discworld can be adapted to screen successfully.Recommendation: pass, go directly to Hogfather."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I hoped to see.","review":"I read the book \\"The Color of Magic\\" and found it extremely amusing. The DVD? Well, it didn't seem like anything Terry Pratchett ever wrote. I can't see Rincewind being that old either. Perhaps he was, but to me he seemed younger. In the book, the story flowed, but in the film, it seemed to jump around from one thing to another...in other words...to me, it was a dissapointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I was very pleased with this movie, it was faithful to the spirit of the book and adapted beautifully to the screen. I understand why they would have taken a little flavor out of the world in order to streamline the inevitable need to spend minutes explaining, such as magicians never saying the number between 7 and 9, and that Rincewind was more of a bumbling fool and rather than a bit of a swindler for instance. All in all, a fun film."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as the book","review":"If you are a Pratchett fan and read his books, you will love this morsel like the best chocolate in the world.

It seemed rather that they didn't know how to tie the two story threads together and so simply ended it by rolling the credits. I found this highly dissatisfying and weird for a movie that was so light-hearted in character: it was almost like it was a betrayal of what went before, rather than a completion or a resolution.And the tourist? Please! Why couldn't it have just been about a rogue wizard on the run? That was a serviceable enough premise!

Instead of the sharp satire of the novels, it's just fantasy rehashed with some CGI and terrible, terrible acting. Sean Astin pretty much ruined this all on his own; there wasn't a single scene he was in that didn't leave me cringing. Worse, Jeremy Irons butchtered the clever and icy Patrician, giving him a lisp, of all things. I was embarrassed just watching this. Some of the storytelling was cute, but you'd be better off with the actual books. Hogfather was a thousand times better, and I didn't even like the original book all that much. Really, if you much be introduced to Pratchett through television, go with Hogfather, which was much truer to the book and to Terry's intelligent style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movies That Suck","review":"I bought this movie used for $3.00.

My wife and I sat through this very long movie last night, ...waiting the whole time for it to get started, with some sort of plot or theme, something! This movie starts nowhere, stays nowhere and ends nowhere. I would much prefer a cheap budget, low quality sci-fi channel movie that is badly done over this monstrously long movie that goes nowhere. It's a shame really. It could have been great. The actors aren't bad, the filming isn't bad. It's all the content, ...or lack of it, that's bad.

I was very surprsed with the results and the ease of use. It only takes about a minute to apply to your whole body and it really does dry instantly. I will warn you though that it will take 2 to 3 towelettes to cover your body. I have fair skin and it took 3 applications to get the color that I was looking for. I originally bought a box of 10 towelettes and used 8 of them to get a nice looking tan. But after that, it just takes 2 towelettes every 5 to 7 days to keep the tan.

Additionally, Borushek is a nutrionist and includes meaningful and very useful information on fats, carbs, diabetes, high blood pressure, and more in appendix-like sections of the book.

The book prompted me to write my first Amazon review.I couldn't believe that there were positive Amazon reviews until I noticed that many of them hail from the author's friends. This manuever is wholly in line with the thinly-veiled thesis of the book.

This is huge, I love that someone wrote a book that takes a fresh look at all human emotions and actions.

She will never let you forget that she is responsible for many small \\"miracles\\", that she is doing smart and specatacular social issue theater, that she changes the lives of young women everywhere... blah, blah, blah. Come on. It's just too much. I'd believe your work was important more easily if you weren't constantly telling me it is. Also, she paraphrases the enormous amounts of praise and worship her fans bestow upon her and somehow it all just reads as having come from Jessica's own mouth- again and again and again.

Yes, the book does go on about various clichés that show up in a goodly portion of fantasy literature; the only problem with this is it was like having someone point to the screen during a showing of an Indiana Jones movie and tell you about the various pulp clichés - you either already know about them and thus just want the person to shut up so you can watch the movie, or you don't care in which case you just want the person to shut up so you can watch the movie.There were a couple of caustic bits that did have me giggle; three of them, now that I think about it.Funny books really need to be funnier than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Look at Cliches","review":"This book looks at the cliches from the fantasy genre.

There's no entry for 'love', and that's usually part of any fantasy novel. So, my main complaint is a lack of important entries. Also, the entries that do exist often just point out a cliche and move on. Yes, we all know that the 'slender youth' is usually a girl in disguise.

It has been very useful. Having recently got the C++ version I may have had unrealistically high expectations. It is a good book, but I don't judge that it is that much better from the C version. All modern C++ compilers accept C programs so you can still get the formidable benefits of NR without moving to this version. I particularly disliked the size of the header file in the C++ version. It has to be included in all code (or else write your own individual header files) and since it runs to many thousands of characters, surely it was obvious that no one would spend time entering it?

The cross section is made of some type of \\"cushiony\\" material that doesn't take bending or other types of manipulation well. The item becomes cracked, the paint chips and the words become a little faded. The good news is that this model is one of the few if only ones poorly made; I also bought the volcano model and because the girth of the item is greater it does not bend and crack.

The kids were a bit young to really understand what they saw when looking at a real flower through a microscope, so this one definitely fit the bill.

This one, though over time the price has increased, is by far the best one for the money. Quality isn't the greatest as far as lasting. My first one lasted the longest. But the job it does is SUPER! Any make-up artist will tell you never to curl lashes with mascara on them. It can break off and pull out the lashes. Also, to preserve your lashes, always, always remove eye make-up before sleeping. Your lashes can break off overnight, and using a cheaper grade (some of the expensive ones aren't higher grade) mascara can cause lashes to become brittle and break.

The great strength of Ms. Braun's books is her hero Jim Quilleran and the amusing cast of characters who inhabit his world.

This book brings the history out of the African-American struggle and makes it more personal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap materials + poor foot design","review":"Not too pleased with this product: the opening for the face was too small so I had to partially rip the seam, the material is kind of 'burlap-y' and I don't even know what I was supposed to do with the feet. There is no opening on the bottom, so I guess you could just wear shoes inside the costume (although it seems like it would get very dirty and rip like that) but there is not enough room to fit a sneaker in. I had to cut holes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Introduction to \\"longer\\" stories for little ones.","review":"Most of the stories in this book are about 100 pages long. For each page of text there is a beautiful, Disney-worthy illustration. The stories are the classic triumphs of good over evil that the Disney generations grew up with.The stories are split into chapters, which is a nice introduction to longer stories for little ones. I thought that my three year old might be too young for this type of book, and that I would save it until she is older. I was wrong.I am currently working my way through the book with my 3.5 year old. She knows that she will hear one and sometimes two chapters per night, and then have to wait for more. She is very interested in the stories and loves looking at the illustrations.I can't think of a better way to introduce discussion about \\"what will happen next\\" than stories that are divided into chapters.

Certainly not worth full price. My wife and I were certainly disappointed by what we did NOT find in the book - few comparisons of manufacturers or models of cribs, strollers, etc. We are used to the CR magazines and other guides that are loaded with current and detailed information.

I don't think that I could give this copy that I bought away! I bought it to buy baby products, starting with a simple crib and carseat. I was more concerned about how the brands ranked...unfortunately the writers of this book were not. The good thing that they did offer were tips on how to select a good crib/stroller/carseat/etc. So if you want the how tos on buying this is a good reference. If you want the \\"what to buy\\" stay away.I went out and bought the book \\"Baby Bargains.\\" I found it extremely useful in telling you the history of brands and rating them all clearly on a A to D scale.

Track 6 is the only one that caught my ear while going through the cd (for those of you who like beats more than lyrics), but thats one thing I cand give tim props on is his lyrics has step up a bit on this one and for magoo well....anyway.For those who want somthing to bump in their car this cd is definitely not for u. Just about every hook on there is pretty much wack (track 5 is ok). I know people have their own taste or whatever but a 5 out of 5 is just damn rediculous.

Amazing is all I have to say. I haven't heard anyone else produce beats for the true audiophile. Don't Make Me Take It there is an amazing beat. N 2 The Music and a few other's. I can hand pick the good ones and I guess everyone expects too much. If you listen close you'll see why no one else can do what Tim does.

This stuff works for me and my daughter. It indeed helps a sore throat to go away much sooner and prevents it from developing into something worse. The gargle comes in individually sealed small disposable plastic pouches that is easy to carry around. I definitely recommend it and would buy and use it again in the future.Still, the product could benefit from a taste improviement, if possible: it has a very concentrated salty-and-bitter taste. Also, the twist-off tip requires some effort and several spins to remove."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neat idea, but","review":"The idea to sell prepackaged gargles is a great idea, especially if you are pressured to go to work despite being sick. Moreover, brine solutions like this are prone to bacterial contamination once opened, so it makes sense to package them in individual use containers. When this product arrived I happened to have a sore throat so I tried the product a few times. The individual solutions are the perfect volume for gargling, however, the packages are extremely difficult to open. They seem more designed for shipping and inexpensiveness than for ease of use. The gargles taste pretty good, but they seemed pretty weak from a saltiness perspective. Unfortunately, it did not help my sore throat at all. I followed this experiment with a gargle of my own preparation: the standard saturated warm water/table salt that moms always recommend. The latter did the trick immediately. In conclusion, I say stay home from work and make your own salt solutions, you'll be happier that you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convenient","review":"Sure I can make my own saltwater gargle, but this is one very convenient product. I keep some in my desk at work and in my travel case so when I am out and about, I can still gargle when needed.

A super convenient product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Money to Burn","review":"I used to mix table salt with tap water, but why do that? It's almost free!

There is simply not enough to get a good gargle going and it doesn't taste good. If you ever come out with the old form again, I would certainly buy it.-Mrs. Jacks"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"Gargling with salt water is good for a sore throat. But this stuff, a sort of slimy brine in a packet, is no more convenient, no more effective, and definitely more unpleasant than just dumping some salt in a glass of warm water and stirring it with your finger. You need to remember to carry it with you (you can always carry some salt packets from the deli). You still need some place to spit it out. You will definitely want to rinse your mouth out to get rid of the taste. Bad idea. Bad execution."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is my favorite simple cureall","review":"I use Simply Gargle even when I am not sick, it seems to clear up any itchy or hoarse throat situations.

You will feel immediately better, especially if you are sick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple salt water will be a better choice","review":"In general, I strongly advocate warm salt water for oral hygene. So, I sampled this product. I am not pleased with the additional (unnecessary) ingredients added to simple salt water, as they created an unwanted flavor and taste. I really do not know if they have any value add in terms of health and hygene. The sachet is not easy to open. I feel sad that so much of plastic waste is generated for such a simple purpose. I wish the company used bio-degradable packaging. I am not ready to pay a lot of money for such a simple solution and little convenience. I would personally use simple, warm salt water."},{"rating":"2","title":"worthwhile, useful, and also great before church","review":"Yes, the little packets are a bit hard to open (but better that they don't leak). But I find them most convenient; I also find them effective for making the throat feel much better when a cold's coming on. The mixture tastes herbally medicinal but is not offensive. I found that I had to learn how to gargle properly, but that comes with a few times' practice.I find that my singing voice in church on Sunday morning is much stronger if I gargle one of these beforehand. Overall, I recommend these and intend to get more for myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soothing and convenient","review":"Some have complained about the strange taste of these porta-packets of throat ease gargle. Personally, I found the flavor to be tolerable - a definite salt water base but with scattered, pleasant notes of herbal essences lingering throughout.This past weekend I awoke to a hoarse and irritated throat after shouting most of the previous night at a football game and actually looked forward to putting this product to the test. Lo and behold I found that this gargle rinse did help to soothe my throat. Later that night I used it again before retiring to bed. I am pleased to report that I awoke the next morning with a throat back to normal.The best thing about these packets is the sheer convenience. The compact, efficient design makes for easy storage in your glove-compartment, backpack, purse, etc. I definitely will carry a few with me during the cold season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Portable, sanitary and easy to use","review":"Salt water gargle for sore throats was the first home remedy my mother taught me. The thing was, I never quite got it right. I either got too much salt and felt like I'd just sandpapered the back of my throat or too little and had to gargle again. The pre-mixed vials make Simply Saline gargle easy to use and carry without mixing. It's a great idea particularly during cold and sore throat season.ADDENDUM: My husband has the cold from h-e-double toothpicks and he's trying the gargle for the first time. He likes it, but what irritates him is that the packaging is hard to get into. He'd deduct a star from this rating for that reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it for the convenience","review":"Pay money for salt water? Makes starbucks look like a good deal? Actually, these are a good deal. Salt water is a wonderful remedy for many thoat conditions. You don't hear about it because the drug companies can't make big money from it, and they want to sell you patent stuff for sore thoats. But ask a nurse or a good doctor. At home you can have a glass of salt and water, but these packs let me take this mixture everywhere. Good design and construction. All the added ingredients can't hurt, and *may* do some good.

It might fit, but there is a smaller one for homes, which usually have a 3\\" line. For what it does, at this price point, it is the best. There is another kind rubber hose drain cleaner, but my experience is that they often break, and then you have a large piece of rubber in your drain line in addition to the clog. If you have a good hose and decent water pressure, it will cure 90% of your sewer clogs.

Counterstrike is, without a doubt, Sierra's best work! Whether you are a serious hardcore first person gamer, or just like to mess around shooting chickens in Italy, this is a great game. You get the choice of being a terrorist or a counter-terrorist, both sides have their ups and downs. All in all, I strongly recommend counterstrike for any person with Half-Life and a computer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"I have been playing Counter-Strike for over a year now and have loved every minute of it. The latest release adds some weapons and changes some of the uniforms of the characters. But as with everything out there, there are some drawbacks. First, Boost your video card and memory. Do not run this on the internet without at least 128MB of memory and a good Video card with 16MB. Second, the faster your internet connection the better. I run over a cable modem and when I'm in an area with 10 or 12 other people, the video gets real jumpy. On the other side though, the support for this game is out of this world. There are sites all over the internet supporting the game and answering questions. If you are looking for a great game, look no further."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Awesome Game","review":"this game is the coolest game ever.you need to buy this game.if you want a game that has alot of action this game is the one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Half-Life Mod","review":"Well, like I said, it is the best Half-Life Mod. But don't buy it, download it. The only reason I would buy this game is if I had a slow connection like a 56k modem. Even then, gameplay is going to be a little bit choppy and you are going to be at a slight disadvantage to the rest of us with cable and DSL service. But back to the game, It has a very innovative idea being once you die, you are dead (for that round). Rounds usually last around 5 minutes or until everyone from one team dies. Speaking of teams, there are two of them, terrorists and special forces teams (like Rainbow Six). Unfortunately there is only one type of gameplay though, cops rescue hostages. That is it. I like the game as a whole but if you haven't been playing it for the last year then you are going to get tore up by those of us who have been playing. Good luck to those who try this game and happy fragging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old game, yet popular today.","review":"Ok look, although this is a old game, it is one of the most popular Fps(First person shooter) games out there. Ive played this for atleast 5 years now, and my friends that I know still play cs today, like myself. From planting bombs to rescuing hostages, you'll find this game enjoyable. There are lots of custom made maps out there that can bring boardness from official maps, to playing this game 24/7.

Half-Life Counter-Strike is the game to buy. With an already 1,000,000 players playing it every day from online visitors, the popularity of it is sure to expand when it goes retail. But one thing that everyone has to remember is: COUNTER-STRIKE WAS NOT BOUGHT BY VALVE, VALVE HAS LITTLE OR NO CONTROL OVER COUNTER-STRIKE AND WILL NOT GAIN CONTROL OVER IT. They are publishing the game, but did not develop it and have no control over what goes in the game. As the actual developer calls them... \\"They are simply tech support..\\" So all you guys stop saying it has been bought by valve or sierra because it's not. But anyway, it's a really great game and anyone is sure to like it. No matter if your a fps, rpg, or whatever, you'll be playing it for weeks.

You probably wouldn't understand it unless you've played the game, but simply put it combines awesome maps, and a great weapons selection. It also includes an element of teamwork that works to win most of the time, although it is also very possible to do a lot of damage to the other team all by yourself.

The game used to be fun, but eventually, do to cheaters, the game deteriorated. Many people play this game in ways that many would consider cheating, or unfair play. Due to the frustration caused by this, the game has lost its value. Also, many people don't play as a team, but instead go solo or \\"rambo style\\" as I like to call it. Considering this is a teamplay game, when people don't play as a team, it really is no longer fun. Another thing about this game is that it has optional voice chat. I don't know about you, but I don't want to hear some little kid barking orders to me, let alone do I want to hear some people talking about anything while I'm playing this game. In conclusion, this game is not worth it anymore.

I'm only talking about the product, Counter-Strike is actually not a bad mod, since about 90% of the Half-Life gaming community plays it, there is no room for other mods. This is bad for the people that are tired of Counterstrike and are looking for something new.Buying Half-Life by itself is cheaper, you can download Counterstrike for free anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"HaHaHaHa I'm surprised they call this a game","review":"Well lets just get a few things clear on why this game [stinks]. First of all when you get it you will find out you have to download about 6 hours of updates! Well after I did that I went to play a multiplayer game and quickly found out the graphics well arn't \\"up to code\\" we'll say. This game would be great if you barley want any realism at all, as in you can spray out bullets on full auto and have no accuracy problems. To top it all off once you wait 30 minutes to get in a game, you can hardly hold a connection for 5 minutes before you have got a message Surver has been lost or something like that.

So i tried training again and it froze before i got in so i uninstalled and reinstalled tried again with the same result. i tried to load a saved spot in training but it takes me to the last 3 seconds in the game and then a c4 blows me up. i know it sounds funny at first but try doing that over 20 times!

The replability value is extremely high -- however, there is no plot and story line for those who crave it -- just endless point click and shoot.Bang.Keep in mind that this is a multiplayer online game and a FREE modification of the single player game halflife.

Buggier than a picnic and, forget about trying to play it on a dial-up connection.On the other hand, if you're looking for the best first person military style shooter out there, I highly recommend Delta Force Land Warrior.

But Hurley proves that writer's block can be conquered, sometimes, by giving yourself a deadline. And he does a lovely job of capturing some essence, some droll humor, some cosmic message in each of these vignettes. I'd say he was able to force himself into a state of flow and let the words come without having the time to think about them too much. He seems to have a way of connecting with people quickly and he certainly has the ability of turning that connection into something quirky, fun, and surprisingly enjoyable to read.

Reading about the seeds of the future Israeli Navy, a Zionist Maritime Squadron, training in Mussolini's Italy in 1936 is reminiscient of a Mel Brooks movie plot, but the truth is far more shameful and truly not funny.

Even if they are too easy, they are still fun. I think my daughter will be asking to play this again in a few months. I hate to say it, but I enjoy helping her beat these games.Oh yeah, these games are old, so make sure you buy the Windows XP version if it is available. But if not, Vista will let you install using an older version of Windows. Control Panel > Programs > Programs and Features > Use an older program with this version of Windows.

It might work in the older versions but it will not work in the new Intel based machines. That should be noted in the description of the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks great but not functional","review":"I purchased this case after getting tired of waiting for Creatives leather case to become available. As far as appearance, it is well crafted. When it comes to functinality, it stinks. Here are the problems I have with it: 1) there is no hole for the microphone, 2) the hole for the headphone jack is not lined up properly, 3) the charger and sync adapter brick can't fully engage the player because of the leather straps, so it is easily disengaged by the slightest movement. This is ok at home, but try using this in the car (if you want to charge while you listen); it falls out with every turn you make. This case was not designed with much thought about the functions of the zen player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good case...","review":"This is a good case made with nice materials. it offers a nice fit and buttons are easily usable. it comes with a clear screen protector and has a belt clip so you can carry it more comfortably. it is just a little bulky, but nothing to worry about if you plan to carry it in your belt, hand bag or hands. it could only fit big pockets, though. my only serious gripe is about the inner seams, they are very rough and could scratch the surface of your player. yes, Zen Vision:M's have very soft coating and this could leave marks. anyways, you really should consider getting a skin for your zen (Best Skins Ever) in any case. This is a very good case overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leather Case Very Disappointing","review":"WARNING!!! Can not use button features to operate Zen player because leather case is way too tight! You can hardly get the player into the case so no amount of time or breaking in period is going to fix the problem. Sadly, it's like having a pair of shoes that are so tight you have to remove them so you can walk.

It doesn't allow me to click the buttons, the bottom two since it squeezes it already and it's down so I can't access them. Overall, it's ok for just keeping your player in there. I really recommend an invisible shield, it works better than this case for sure. This case is a bit bulky, but it's alright if you don't mind taking the player out to press the buttons to change songs and put it back in. Sometimes when you put it back in, it will accidentally press one of the buttons which can be annoying and pretty much is. Basically, if you want a case to keep it in this isn't too bad, but another product is better for sure. Either my case was jinxed or they are all like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Poor Product","review":"I bought my daught a Aiwa CD player and like the other commentsmade the CD changer quit after a year.

I bought an AIWA system for my college age son. We both felt it was a great value for the money until one month past the warranty expiration when the CD changer quit working. A couple of months later, the tape deck went out. Everyone my son knows with an AIWA product has run into the same problem. My college age daughter reports the same. I tried contacting AIWA, but their web site does not even provide a way to send an e-mail. After an extended wait on their 800 number, I was told there was nothing they could do once a product was 3 months past warranty other than charge what I considered an exorbitant fee for repair. Bottomline: if well-cared for AIWA systems barely last more than a year, how great is the value?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks ain't everything: Junk is Junk.","review":"AIWA technically looks good, but it's poor quality ~ that comes with an unbendable, three month, sad warrenty. I purchased an AIWA system last year, and to date, it's junk. The radio is the only thing that is working (with poor reception). The tape player never did work properly and by the second month, the CDs began skipping and by the third month, it was a corpse. Call it lazyness, but by the time I got around to boxing it up, paying 15 bucks in postage, and returning it for a full-refund, the warrently had expired (by three weeks) and they returned it to me parcel post with a mass-produced letter of explaination regarding the warrenty (or lack of warrenty)Even if I were to have paid them to fix the system, the repair work would have only carried with it a 3 month warrenty. My advice? Save your money for a Sony."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sound - good value","review":"I purchased this system to compliment my 4 year old RCA projection tv and my new JVC DVD player. The main factor driving me towards this purchase was quality of this system for the price I was paying. Now 2 months later I am still very pleased with this purchase. The instructions provided were very easy to follow - considering I had about 4 devices all hooked together now. They even provide an 800 number to call in case something is not working right or you have a question about the instructions. The sound quality is also very good and the dolby sounds awesome. There are several EQ presets available to choose from as well as a karaoke feature (which to be honest I have yet to use). I have not had any trouble with reception issues at all.

Like one poster wrote, Mr. Griffin did a thorough job chronicling events that were (before this book was published) often rumored of and never elaborated on. The Black Mafia/Black Brothers/Black Muslim syndicate had long tentacles extending beyond Philadelphia, but eventually crumbled because of its own ultra-violent behavior.In so many ways, Philadelphia was the epicenter of Black America during the 1970s, and the book does a great job of exposing a number of historical events. I grew up hearing about the Hanafi massacre, the mysterious beheadings, the life and death of Major Coxson, the prison murder of Bo Price, and the rumors surrounding the Nation of Islam. If anyone is interested, this book is beyond worthy, and deserves a space in your library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Majority true but........","review":"The book made me clearly understand a lot of the going ons during that time because I was young.Growing up in the sections of the city of Philly and ,especially the South Philly side of the action, most of the storied account is true.The book made me relive the 70's all over again. Most people didn't know of the Black Mafia because it was to be a secret amonst us South Phillyains.Most of the guys that mentioned in the book were nice and respectable guys though they did their thing.(unlike these so call gangsters of today,when they reached their target they didn't miss and hit innocent people)).What book failed to mention is the dealing and payoffs within the police departments.Overall a good incite to what was going on back then !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book!","review":"Although I was a young child when the black mafia was in full force in Philly, I remember a lot of the names from my family and neighbors.

Apparently academics use the term \\"Ear Training\\" for the entire set of skills associated with sight reading music. The specific skills amateurs might associate with the term, hearing and recognizing intervals etc. are only a part of that and represent less that a quarter of the text of this book.

However, if you're on a budget, this stretcher would be hard to beat. It's lightweight and compact so it can travel with you if needs be. It's sturdy, made of metal with foam hand grip and foam leg pegs; it's comfortable on your legs because of the foam. But most pertinent of all, it WILL stretch your legs in a safe and effective manner! In fact, the only fault I could find after multiple uses is that I wish that wing nuts had been provided with which to assemble the unit; the supplied nuts are more than serviceable, but wings nuts would have been just a tad more convenient if you wanted to disassemble the unit for travel, although disassembling the unit isn't necessary. I highly recommend this stretching aid, especially for someone with knee limitations.

The extra scenes diluted the story: They took attention away from the story. This is a story about a 'peppy' band, and the original story was 'peppy' too. This version makes the movie lose it's rhythm. The story gets lost in the extra footage. These scenes make the movie too long, and a little tedious. I was considering giving it one star.

The Director's Cut version of That Thing You Do is one of the worst movies you will EVER see. Save yourself the trouble and the money, because it may very well destroy one of the best movies for you if you watch it. I know it seems completely implausible, but it's entirely true. The editing job they did on That Thing You Do, I am convinced, is the best that has ever been done on a film. They took a train wreck and turned it into a masterpiece. I know you won't believe me, no one ever does until it's too late, but heed my warning! Proceed at your own risk! or you will lose more than you ever thought possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feel Good","review":"Under-rated, this is a charming movie with a charming cast and a charming little story with some bite.

The anamorphic widescreen is a treat as are the trailer clips. However, knowing that a ton of edited scenes wound up on the floor, I was expecting a few of those to be included. While it's true most deleted scenes in most films should be deleted and left to rest, not having the opportunity to check out left-overs was a big disappointment. Still, it's one of the best motion pictures (next to \\"The Idolmaker\\") about rock 'n' roll before its midlife crisis. Maybe they'll come out with an Ultimate Deluxe version in the near future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie...Great Music!","review":"Not only is the movie upbeat and fun, but the music is awesome.

The film follows the story of the One-ders (Wonders after a smart re-christening) who started as a small Erie, PA garage band and experienced a meteoric rise to fame in the innocence of early 60's pop music. The film, while corny in some parts, tells a very poignant story with a refreshing mixture of humour and drama. The band's reaction to the swirling events around them make for a great storyline and an effective lessons-learned presentation of the real world of pop music; everything from marketing and promotion to relationships among band members.Fame can be a wonderful yet damaging experience and this film effectively demonstrated that. Not to mention very funny and lively. A great film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film, but the director's cut not nearly as good as theatrical release!","review":"First, I'll say that I absolutely love the theatrical release. It's one of a very, very few movies I return to watch. Brilliant. Given that, I thought the director's cut would be better - some holes filled in, more of our favorite characters, etc. I was surprised to discover that, for me, the additional scenes didn't add to the story. In fact, the opposite. This shouldn't be too much of a shock - Have you noticed that most of the \\"Deleted Scenes\\" aren't that great? In other words, the final editing is usually pretty darn good, IMHO. On the positive side, I bought this to replace an aging VHS tape, so I'm happy anyway.

He seems to relish his role here (since he wrote it)... taking a break from the more serious dramatic roles that have shaped his more recent career. The film concerns a group of teenagers who form a band and become wildly popular and start to tour. It also concerns the trappings of fame, losing your first love and losing the starry-eyed innocence of being young. But never quite giving up hope. Tom Everett Scott is good here as the drummer, Guy, and you will feel genuine happiness for him and the character played by Liv Tyler when they finally get together at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"WRONG REGION!","review":"The movie is excellent!

It's also just fun to watch a group go from a group of small-town friends - led by a talented songwriter - to superstars and all the joys and relationship problems that come with fame. This movie isn't really just about music. It's about finding out who your true friends or true love really is, which happens when much is at stake. Tom Hanks wrote such a cool movie in his first try. I recommend it for Beatlemaniacs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You WILL be singing these songs!","review":"This is a wonderful movie for viewers of all ages.

That Thing You Do! is a great interprtaion of a 'Beatlesque' band from the small town of Erie;PA who make thier big break after thier drummer breaks his arm and they hire another named Guy to play at the 'Mercy-Hearst Talent Show' where he picks up the tempo of thier slow song and makes it a dance pop hit!

It's a sixties flick which is witty and funny. The first time I saw this movie I didn't really like it but after I saw it a few times I loved it. It's about a 60's band from a small town that make it big and what happens to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Feel Good Movie.","review":"This movie just taps into your adrenaline and makes you want to jump up and down while listening to the exhilirating song that puts this band at the top of the charts. The soundtrack is what charges this movie and makes you smile everytime you watch it. This is definate, indisputable proof that you don't need sex, violence, or language to make a movie really good and popular. You just need good acting, music, and unoffending humor to put a movie at the top of the charts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rick Elias and Guy's love for jazz","review":"Normally a solo artist and member of Rich Mullins' Ragamuffin Band, Rick Elias and his wife Linda wrote the majority of the performed songs in this movie. He even has a cameo role, playing guitar for the Vegas-suited band that tours with and introduces The Wonders. This is a very good, but not entirely great, movie. My only deep regret is Tom Hanks cutting short the absolutely mesmerizing duet at the end of the show with Guy and Del Paxton. I've rewound and played that scene about a hundred times. Guy's respect for \\"good\\" Jazz as a recurring theme throughout the movie is its driving force. If for no other reason, see the movie for that reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extended cut disappointing","review":"I've loved 'That Thing You Do' for years on VHS. When I saw the DVD at a local bookstore, I started dropping hints to my wife for my birthday. Lovely to hear the sounds in surround and the music is well mixed.

I first saw this after it came out on video back in the 90's; bits of it on tv every so often since then. I did download the movie from iTunes, but deleted it to save on memory. The movie and soundtrack is so addicting, I have the soundtrack for a while, that I had to buy this version, as I was curious on how the characters meshed together and answer some questions that I had. It's just exciting seeing in how the band went from being a garage band to being on the National stage in just a few short months, having fun and their reactions to the sudden fame on a single catchy song.

I can't help BUT to think of this movie as \\"The White Five Heartbeats.\\" This movie was SO similar to that spectacular movie that I wonder what Hanks was smoking when he wrote the script. I only caught this one on TV, and...it was okay...but much like \\"Why Do Fools Fall In Love,\\" and that movie about Little Richard this isn't new material. This is just a ripoff of \\"The Five Heartbeats,\\" only it doesn't have sexy black men and good, soulful singing. This movie was full of dorks which reminded me of \\"The Five Horsemen\\" from that wonderful movie, \\"The Five Heartbeats.\\" I guess this is another movie that falls under this category: \\"whites (who wrote most of the reviews if not all of them, and who make up most of the internet community) loved it and blacks, who would rather watch \\"The Five Heartbeats\\" for the eighth time than watch this, didn't think much of it.

The only reason it made the theaters was because it had Tom Hanks' name tagged to it. Its true home is where it is played now - on USA up all night. The funniest part of the movie is the build-up to getting to see Tom Hanks. We don't see him for the first 20 minutes of the film, until the climactic moment when the camera slowly crawls up from behind him in a slow dolly. When the star is finally revealed in all his glory, Mr Hollywood is cooler in his Ray-Ban shades. The funniest thing about this is Tom Hanks is the narcissist behind the camera. The only thing more obnoxious than this is the horrible soundtrack. The film digs its own grave by playing the awful one hit wonder that the band supposedly rides to glory over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hideous! 1 star only because there is no lower choice available","review":"This film is so god-awful it makes me sweat with embarassment for my limited participation in enabling its existence by having seen it. TTYD might be an OK film to someone born after the era which Tom Hanks attempts to convey here through cliché and outright quasi-Beatloid parody, but there are films aplenty from the 1960's that pretty much tell the same stale \\"unknowns-make-it-big\\" saga with far more authenticity and sincerity, simply by having been made during that time. Not even as believable as a film with Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello, nor as musically sophisticated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little known classic for the ages","review":"I saw this movie when it came out. Instantly loved and have seen it I'd say 15 times since! Now that my son is older, I wanted to share the great songs (brilliant soundtrack, songs that you don't hear in the movie) with him. He's 8. It's now his absolute favorite soundtrack. Songs are very Beatle-like mixed with surf sound. Catchy. Get the soundtrack. Get the movie. Highly recommend this for any lover of a great story or loved that era of music. See early version of Charlize Theron. Hanks and his story of one hit Wonder's is a great tale. What can I say - its a great movie :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"unusual extended cut","review":"I lived on Orange, California during the making of this movie and during the time the movie represents. I bought it hoping for a commentary track that would mention that many of the street scenes were filmed in Orange, including Watson's Drug Store and the Army-Navy Store being real places there. Unfortunately, there are no commentary tracks and none of the additional features mention that fact.But the extended cut version of the movie, which gives you a lot more character development, particularly of Guy Patterson, makes this purchase well worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plug and play, digital sound quality","review":"Best adapter ever, for sure the lowest price.

I was ready to send his mower back to Amazon.com, but noted the return policy that stated that anything containing oil or flammables cannot be returned. I was able to repair the axel myself to the point where the wheel can now turn. I've learned my lesson never to buy something like this online again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shipping Poor","review":"The box was total open when the mower arrived.

I read Sue Grafton, I read Lawrence Sanders (the real author) and now have a fantastic new author to read. Thank you"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done thriller.","review":"This is the first book I have read by Lehane, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I found it to be a tight novel with real characters and written intelligently. The twists are (for the most part) not forced and force the reader to re-examine details several times before understanding their importance. I am a big fan of Michael Connelly's books and this book has many of the same kind of appealling characteristics. In fact, stylistically it reminded me of Connelly's Trunk Music. After reading (listening to) this one, I plan to get the other books in the series. Great work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Positively Fourth Street.....","review":".....was indeed a Bob Dylan song and an excellent clue for Jay to give Angie and Patrick!! Just part of the little details and nuances that Lehane brings to the Kenzie/Gennaro series--and why I keep coming back for more!! I am attempting to stretch this series out until I hear that Lehane has a new one coming but the only thing saving me right now is the fact that I don't have Gone, Baby, Gone in my house.Lehane's writing is addictive. The interplay between Kenzie and Gennaro feels authentic. And the mysteries (in my gullible-reader view anyway) are sound.Sacred is a bit \\"lighter\\" than previous Lehane novels I've read, but I find that the mystery and plot don't suffer and that \\"light\\"ness lends itself toward making me care more for Patrick Kenzie and Angie Gennaro.This is, indeed, a good thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, not great","review":"The first Dennis LeHane book I ever read was \\"Shutter Island\\" which I absolutely LOVED. What an jolt that story was. I followed it up by reading \\"Mystic River\\" which was also very good. I was expecting that same type of story/writing with this one and it just wasn't the same.I picked this up off a clearance rack for $1 not realizing it was the third in a series. Mr. LeHane does a good job of bringing you up to speed on the characters and I was able to enjoy the book even with skipping the first two. I enjoyed the settings of Boston and the Sarasota/Bradenton area so that added to the book in my opinion.This book, while good, did not have the writing quality or the story \\"punch\\" that the other two books I read had. It was more along the lines of a James Patterson, quick read that was enjoyable but not outstanding. I still find myself several years later thinking about \\"Shutter Island\\" and I am sure this book will be forgotten within days. A really good beach read, but not much else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sacred","review":"This book was great. Not the best in the series. Darkness Take My Hand is the best, with this following. Lehane is a great writer. Makes you not want to put the book down. He really knows how to keep your attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"A star dropped off for each book, \\"scattered\\" not \\"sacred\\"","review":"Not much story to describe, just alot of poorly stuck pieces. A carpet woven with silly string. I was happy to see I'm not alone in my disappointment with this fantasy rendition. However, I see some who liked it, but thank goodness for Spencer and Hawk Boston will remain. Bubba Rogowski, indeed. I felt Lehanes beginning statement that he saw no story here was an extremely accurate one, the friends who said otherwise were not. No, Elvis Cole here, only a foulmouthed crybaby, with a bimbo for a partner and an imprisoned scuzzball lowlife as a friend. \\"Baby I'm gone\\", too many great writers await and time is too short.I suggest Lehane use his creative writing degree and apply it toward fantasy science fiction, or comic books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak plot plus smart-aleck sleuth equals a dull book","review":"I read Lehane's first two books and enjoyed them immensely. But Sacred was so bad that I am very angry that I wasted several hours reading it. The plot seemed to be an afterthought to the smart-aleck, wisecracking dialog of Kenzie. I was also turned off by the condescending put-downs of Florida. Lehane's provincial adoration of Boston detracts from his stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sacred - Great read, but full of typos in Kindle edition","review":"This story was typical of Dennis Lehane's writing. The characters are believable, the locations equally so. I recommend Sacred wholeheartedly. It is a 5 star read. But.. I felt I had to downgrade it to 4 stars because of the dreadful spelling/typo errors in the Kindle eddition. It looks like somebody ran a spellcheck and just accepted the default spelling suggestions en-bloc without actually checking. This is just not good enough. The publisher is treating us as 2nd class readers. They would never allow a printed novel to go to print with so many blatant errors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sacred is a nice read for the subway commute home.","review":"While I enjoyed the red herrings thrown here and there and the dialogue between the heros, I was disappointed with the ending. Kenzie and Angie are characters the reader can identify with, but the monster that is Desiree is never quite justified or explained fully for my tastes. If she had shown more avarice throughout, or if the origins of her promiscuity were defined, she might have been more believable. Maybe some insight about her childhood would have helped. The one insight we do get is around her relationship with her mother; unfortunately, it wasn't enough to pull it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"THERE'S NOTHING SACRED","review":"The characters were immature and boring, and like the plot, too much formula. I was disappointed reading \\"Sacred\\", especially because it was the Mystery Editor's choice! The reference to Dylan's album was incorrect, but no big factor in the book. Sometimes facts are misstated; however, the content made me \\"yawn\\" and I could barely get through Lehane's latest effort. I doubt if I will ever read another of his books. Since the Mystery Editor chose this title at Amazon Books, I doubt if you will print this. Where was his head? Really bad stuff, but at least I got it off my chest. I hated this boring book..."},{"rating":"2","title":"And the beat goes on.","review":"If you look at the 5 Lehane novels, \\"Darkness Take My Hand,\\" \\"A Drink Before The War,\\" \\"Mystic River,\\" and \\"Shutter Island,\\" \\"Sacred\\" is probably the weakest.Based loosly on Raymond Chandler's \\"The Big Sleep,\\" it sends Angie and Patrick off to Florida to track down the missing heiress of Billionaire Trevor Stone. She is not all that she appears to be and neither is the plot with numerous twists and turns common in Lehane mysteries.Lehane maybe writing the best novels today and Sacred\\" is for now, the last of the Patrick Kenzie/Angie Gennaro duos. Perhaps there will be more. I myself was happy to see them go. Like others before them they seemed to have the same personal problems that surface repeatedly and I imagine that Lehane is too good of an author to have to rely on a formula. Read \\"Mystic River\\" and \\"Shutter Island \\" and you'll know what I mean.But it's unfair to denigrate \\"Sacred\\" because of its company. It still remains a good novel"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Score For Lehane","review":"I can't stress how good this guys books are. And while I didn't think it was as great as his previous two in the series, it still has moments that take your breath away. Patrick Kenzie and Angie Gennaro are first introduced in his book, \\"A Drink Before the War.\\" It's so important to start there and read them in sequence. \\"Sacred\\" begins in an alomst comical manner for the two detectives but in true Lehane style soon turns gritty and violent. They're asked, rather forcefully to track down a billionaire's daughter who has disappeared along with the original detective who was hired to find her. It just so happens the original detective was Patrick's mentor. These books are fast paced and you'll find yourself staying up late to finish them. What a great set of characters Lehane's created."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, strong book, true to Lehane's style","review":"The #3 installment of Genarro/Kenzie stays true to its roots of authentic characters, continuing their evolution, and a great story with all the right twists. The previous book (Darkness, Take my Hand), was so dark and grim that both, the dynamic duo of Patrick/Angie and the readers, needed a lighter case that was a bit easier on the psyche. And Sacred was just that case. It's not Lehane's chef d'oeuvre, but it's an important book for continuity in the series. I thoroughly enjoyed it and read it in about two workdays."},{"rating":"2","title":"NO REASON TO TELL GOODBYE!","review":"I just love this work!

While some of the ideas (different forms of love, individuality, and stretching the limits of socially accepted behavior, life and death) were interesting, the way they were conveyed in this book was not effective for me. None of the characteristics were likable, nor was I able to feel for any of them. The book starts out with a woman having sex with a dolphin, and ends with unexpected deaths. While some smaller sections were enjoyable to read, I generally found myself wishing this experience was over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book ever written","review":"please, do not waste your time.

I have a 120 max PSI Husky air compressor, which actually made it hard to find spray guns of any quality that would be compatible with my compressor (used mainly for airbrushing). The Campbell spray gun did the job nicely. While I'm pretty familiar with spray guns and compressors, the gun was easy to set up and use, and I would assume it would be just as easy for someone with no experience with spray guns.The gun comes with extra tips and clear instructions, as well as cleaning oil and necessary tightening tools. Easy to use, easy to clean. I have no complaints and am glad I purchased this. I probably would not try to use this to paint very large projects, say, the interior of a house or siding, but would be fine for baseboards, doors, trim, playhouses, fences, and other similarly sized projects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh.....","review":"Seems like a decent paint sprayer... but... in the instruction manual, at one point, it says to move the \\"set screw\\" from the top to bottom hole. Mine didn't come with a set screw, although the screw holes are there. Also, unless you have an accessory kit/set of adapters with your compressor, get one. The paint sprayer is not set up for a quick connect and you'll either need to change the fittings or find a coupler that works.

These include such things as planetary coordinates, rising and setting times, and many others. Each calculation is carefully explained with numerous examples. The included 3.5 disk contains a series of small dos basic programs which can perform all the calculations in the book. These programs should run in any pc with dos or windows.

Hong Kong at this time was still British and \\"business\\" ruled the daily lives of the British and European company executives as well as the Chinese businessman and worker. One of my favorite movies, it tells the story of the \\"Noble House\\" and Ian Dunross. The Noble House is loosely based on the real trading company of Jardine Mathewson, one of the early trading companies that helped found Hong Kong. (who has since moved to Singapore when Hong Kong reverted back to the Chinese). Plot twists and fortunes made and lost plus romance and danger make this well worth watching.

Exciting to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptionally enjoyable","review":"This film is from the family of stories written by James Clavell that includes \\"Shogun\\" (starring Richard Chamberlain) and \\"Tai-Pan\\" (starring Bryan Brown). Produced for television mini-series, this particular film runs a close second behind \\"Shogun\\" in its exceptional production quality and its characterization of the original novel. At approximately six hours running time, it's a little long for one night's entertainment but once started, it is very hard to turn it off! A great value!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD had a \\"skip\\" in it.","review":"Certainly not the fault of Amazon, the second of four included DVD's had a flaw it it that wouldn't let the player go forward - I had to do a scene selection to the next scene, then back up to just AFTER where the flaw occurred.

Instead it comprises only three of the four parts. Buyer beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great story, lousy technical quality","review":"This applies to a new tape. The story is great but the technical quality is awful. The tape, made in 1988, has squeezed 355 minutes of playing time into a 240 minute cassette by reducing the thickness of the tape. The result is extremely faded colors and occasional static. If this caused by the tape's age or thickness I am not in a position to say. If the reduced thickness is the cause then two cassettes is the obvious solution. I assume that when a DVD is issued the technical quality will have been rectified. I have placed a preorder for a DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent mini-series about Hong Kong pre-1997","review":"An excellent mini-series about Hong Kong pre-1997.

It's been very well done though so if you've never seen it before or you don't remember it on TV you'd never notice! The transfer is pretty good but still a little grainy. The absolute worst thing is the sound, it is HORRIBLE!!! I had to crank up the volume to hear the dialogue then scramble for the remote when the music came blaring out...ugh!

Amazon.com, however, was the answer to my Rock prayers. Every song in this CD package contains solid representation of a Classic Rock genius. Although several gemplates were omitted (1984, The Man Who Sold The World, All The Young Dudes, etc.), no Bowie fan would expect or even appreciate his timeless works compressed onto 2CD's. In any event, if you want the best Bowie anthology there is to date, this without question is the one to get. You hopefully shoudn't be disappointed as you find yourself similar to me becoming the latest in a dedicated line of Ziggy Star(dust, man)'s Heroes!.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I expected","review":"Arrived in a timely fashion. Packaging was great. And the size of the stickers were great! I was a little worried that they would be too small and look stupid on a giant wall in the baby's room, but they are nice and big and the clear backing on them makes them blend right into the wall.

You can find these stickers at other places though, I found. If you order them through [...] you'll get free shipping and handling for new customers which is nice.

I am really not artistic, and yet I had such a fun time placing them creatively on my son's walls. When you get tired of them, you just peel them off with no residue at all. If you want to change the order or move them around, you can do so easily. They really make his room look homey and sweet. They are far less expensive than wallpaper or custom painting, and they really make for a lovely baby's room.

Unlike the TV show, this game can be played by up to 4 players. Its a lot of fun playing against another person, but the 1 player game is good too. The 1 player game is more like the show in that if you get one question wrong, then you are eliminated. In the multiple player games, you play until there is only one player let.

Furthermore, the teapot was missing its lid. When I contacted Amazon they said that they could not send me a new lid. I had to return the teapot and they would send me a new one. Their next email said that the teapot was out of stock so I could take a $5 refund and keep the teapot (with no lid) or simply return it. Now I have no teapot. All in all, had it been packed properly (with the lid and in the box that is advertised) it would have been a very cute teapot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"Not my kind of heroine.

I could not predict what would come next, but was always satisfied with the build up and solution. I was able to suspend disbelief throughout and honestly enjoy and escape into the story -- which is saying something when you have an immortal man/tiger who has been captured in an antique. Would recommend this to anyone who enjoys fantasy or paranormal romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tiger Eye","review":"Great drama, romantic, wonderful action, suspense....keeps me glued to the book, I can't put it down.

I'd recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This author gets better with experience.","review":"I actually read this author's most recent book, The Fire King, before coming back to read the first in this series, Tiger Eye. The concept is good but the story and dialog are a bit predictable, the characters are a rather one dimensional, and the romance lacks sexual tension. Even though I say this, it is still worth a read, if for no other reason than to see how this author grows with experience.I read The Fire King first and loved that book. It had everything that this book lacked and it was interesting to see how Liu evolved as an author with time. I'm anxious to read the second book in the series and see the subtle improvements in this author's writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess I am not ...","review":"into the whole idea of time travel. The idea that this gorgeous warrior guy has been around for 2000 years and has never met a kind person is just dumb. The premise of this book reminds me a bit of Sherrilyn Kenyon's Fantasy Lover. Yet in Kenyon's book the hero comes out of a book and not a box. I could not get too far in either book. Too ridiculous for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying to give it another chance","review":"I was told, \\"If you like Sherilyn Kenyon, then you'll love Liu.\\" How wrong was that salesperson! Unfortunately, I had already purchased 4 books. I was surprised to see that those titles were not the first to the series. So I downloaded it on my Kindle and thought there was something wrong with download because of how short the book appeared. nevertheless, I read this book and found it to be hum drum. I never did care for authors that repeat themselves and she does a lot of it. I do not need constant reinforcement or a reminder of how the character feels.Would I recommend this book, absolutely NOT. I do however have to find the other books to just get it out of my systemI totally recommend Sherilyn Kenyon. I have brought in many naysayers with Acheron, a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, very well written","review":"I was told she was a new author and this was the first book she ever wrote - are they sure? The characters are so well drawn and complex, even the secondary characters. You can tell she is setting up a series but unlike Keynon's books the secondary characters don't overwhelm the plot. It does take a while to get to the action, because she is creating an entire legend and background. The only part of the book that I disliked was the cover. (They should have gone with a tiger motif). The ending was a bit abrupt, but it was still satisfying. Buy this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I found this book a total slog, and I was able to finish it only by skimming long sections. By looking at the reviews, the book clearly appeals to some, but not me. Plot: predictable. Characters: one-dimensional. Settings: sketchy, even Beijing, which surely could be made interesting. Though come to think of it, the main Beijing sequences take place in a modern hotel and an attached mall, a waste of an exotic locale. May as well be in Topeka. The dialog tried hard, but didn't work for me, perhaps because I was already annoyed at wasting a dollar and an hour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Argh. Emotional overload.","review":"OK, so I got to about 3/4 of the way through the book, and then I just couldn't take it anymore. The plot and setting of the story is pretty interesting, don't get me wrong, but the execution is quite terrible. I found it all very melodramatic and \\"oh-woe-is-me\\" through and through. The two main characters, in fact, were very unappealing and wrought with emotional stress that seemed too dramatic to be taken realistically. I don't know. I read Ms. Liu's other book, The Iron Hunt, and liked it quite a bit, and had expected more from this previous series. But, argh, the melodrama just bared on my nerves, until I had to put it down in fear of ripping out my hair or flinging the book out the window at some innocent passersby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertainment to the max!","review":"That's why I read novels, to be entertained, and what a fantastic read Tiger Eye was! A tough, resilient, capable heroine and one severely HOT hero. (I want a Hari of my own.) I loved coming along on the wild ride that was Marjorie Liu's debut book. And having been in Beijing many times, I can vouch for the accuracy of the author's descriptions of the city, except, darn it, no one's ever tried to sell me a puzzle box! If you love the paranormal, characters you can root for, and an involving storyline, then this book's for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Keeps your attention. Hard to put down..

If you like the idea of opening a little box and a big sexy warrior pops out, you should read The Pleasure Slave by Gena Showalter. Also, the macho men who protect Dela reminded me of the band of brothers in Dark Lover by J.R. Ward. Great reading, great fun. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh no, the action stopped and they're having ANOTHER long-winded conversation.","review":"I absolutely love Marjorie Liu's Hunter Kiss books. Dark, beautiful prose. That said, this book is so different it's as though it was written by a different author. There are small spurts of interesting action that pull the plot along... only to be mired down a page later with too much repetitive dialogue. I really wanted to like the main character Dela Reese and her love interest Hari, but after the umpteenth overwrought conversation about her protection, safety, and emotional well-being... ugh. This book became a tiresome mess. Also, I bought this as a Kindle edition and it's jam-packed full of typos. Annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I expected","review":"Reading the reviews from Amazon, I expected this book to be mediocre and akin to the free romance books available on Kindle. I read one of her books that was part of a compilation (Dark Dreamers) and enjoyed the attention she gives to mixed ethnicity and people who are \\"different\\" (which is why I decided to take a chance on this book). I have to say that I thought Tiger Eye was good. I read some people complain that she her books are all the same - I haven't read enough to agree or disagree but Tiger Eye was entertaining enough for me to purchase the next in the series :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality shoe.","review":"I had a similar version of this shoe from about 3 years ago that lasted, surprise, 3 years.

So ya never know if it's going to be a quality mix, but this one definetly is, but is sadly overlooked. Both disc have great flow to them, and some excellent new remixes of classic songs.

I'm sure Mr. Ellison has some talent, but this collection of songs is mind-numbing because it's so monotonous!

It also comes with a duplicate solid wand to be used as the \\"reappearing\\" wand after the first one vanishes. The solid wand is very nice and solid (although mine had a chip in it which I had to repair). Not only can the wand disappear, but it can also be made to transform to silks after being wrapped in paper and torn up. The quality is very good and the price is reasonable.

When you open it to play, you have to lean it on something because the top is so heavy it falls backwards. My dd still loves it a bunch so I didn't have the heart to return it...I wanted to real bad. She also got the Cotton Candy Cafe and the Salon and so far they've been ok. But I think that's because they are small and open up to only 2 sides and nothing fancy.All and all, I would not recommend this toy and would return it in a heartbeat if dd wouldn't be crushed. Too bad, because it's real cute."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much to this toy....","review":"I bought this toy for both my 3 year old daughter and my 5 year old niece for Christmas. As another reviewer noted on here, the handle fell off immediately, although it does snap back on. The sides that open up on either side have fallen off several times as well. I would say this toy is not particularly durable or well made. I was under the impression that this toy did more than it does. There are only three functions: one of the three center circles turns around and plays music, and there's two doodads on either side that pop open when you hold the pony's paw upto it. My daughter does seem to like it, but I am disappointed with it. I can see this going into the back of the closet within a month!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls Apart","review":"I will never buy another My Little Pony Castle or other play set. Last year my daughter received the Castle for Christmas and this year she received the Dance studio. In both cases these toys were not durable in the least. They have been a source of frustration for my daughter and especially me, as I am the one who fixes and repairs these every five minutes. We love the ponies but will never waste money on cheap plastic play sets that fall apart the moment you look at them ever again. Save your money and buy something more durable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, it falls apart, but it's a lot of fun.","review":"We also have had problems with the dance studio falling apart. Our solution was to keep it apart, though. Our nearly 4-year old daughter loves to play with it but doesn't much care about anything but the twirling circles. She'll play for an hour, switching ponies back and forth and playing the music. For that alone and the joy it brings her, it's worth buying. The \\"wings\\" that fall off and the latch that broke off numerous times all sit in her \\"pony box\\" waiting for another day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but falls apart too easily","review":"This item was purchased for a 3 year old, and within minutes of play, the sides popped off, and we were never able to securely attach them again. The heart clasp at the top also came off, and we were never able to get that to stay on either. A toy that keeps falling apart is very disappointing for a 3 year old. This item is in pieces, sitting in the bottom of a toybox."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken more-or-less instantly after opening it.","review":"Within 10 minutes of unwrapping this Christmas gift, my little girl broke off one of the hinged sides of the case and popped down the \\"pop up cake\\" so that it never popped up again. Within 30 minutes the heart clasp fell off.This is a piece of junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, but occaisionally frustrating","review":"My daughter also received it for her 4th b-day and LOVES playing with it. It does fall apart easily and the back wall of it (the part that is vertical when it is open for play) falls backwards with just the slightest bump which she finds frustrating becasue it messes up \\"her decorations\\" - how she set up the ball. The other thing she finds very frustrating is that only one of the three dance platforms spins - all three turn around the floor, but only one also spins. If you have a child who spends much of her imaginative play time setting up and arranging all the pieces perfectly, do not get this toy - it will frustrate her.She does not play with it nearly as much as she plays with the castle. Although I am happy enough with it, it is not a must-have toy, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this instead of the castle","review":"Based on the castle reviews, I am really glad my little girl got this instead of the class. It can fall appart pretty easy, but the parts are easy to put back on. It folds up neatly and you can squueze about 5 more ponies in once it's closed. A few cute, but very small parts (glasses, cake). It's loud, the dance floor spins, and lights up, so my 3 year old loves it. It's cheaply made, but she loves it. And, it's a great travel toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly made","review":"My daughter received this yesterday as a xmas present and the moment she opened up the heart that is supposed to lock and keep it closed the heart fell off and she got upset that she broke it. She also received an extra pony to go with it and like the previous person said it doesnt spin like the one it comes with. So she played with it for 5 minutes and now she is done. I would not suggest this toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pretty scarf","review":"I am an amateur --just a cardio class with belly dancing. This scarf is very pretty and has a nice jingle!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Collection","review":"If you are a fan of really good detective historic mysteries and enjoy superb acting, this collection of the 13, of a total of 20, of the Brother Cadfael (a Benedictine monk in medieval England) books that were made into movies, is for you. (The books, by Ellis Peters, are also an excellent read.) Derek Jacobi is a terrific actor and is supported by great casts. The series is historically accurate and shows what life was really like in the twelveth century. Each story has been condensed into a movie of less that 1 1/2 hours but are throughly enjoyable and little of the books has been omitted so that there is no difficulty in enjoying the full story - unlike many books that are \\"condensed\\" to be made into movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Huge Cadfael fan!","review":"It is a low budget, but well made series. I enjoyed it! And with the exception of one episode, it is true to Ellis Peters' Bro. Cadfael books."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Series","review":"An excellent mystery series with the very capable brother Cadfael (portrayed perfectly by Derek Jacobi). All 13 episodes are worth watching. The supporting actors are also uniformly good - especially Julian Firth in his recurring role as Brother Jerome. Well worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enjoyed Greatly and Very Frustrated!!","review":"We had been slowly working through the first season of Cadfael and soon after we watched episode 9 the rest of the videos became unavailable through Prime. I have tried to find another avenue to express my frustration with this but decided this would be the easiest way. The videos are very well done, a little dated, but very enjoyable. If I was just rating the videos I would rate them four stars. I am very sad that the remainders are unavailable and would like to encourage Amazon to restore them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"European Disc Format","review":"The DVD's were in European format, which means I cannot play on my Blue Ray and have to use my computer which is inconvenient. It would have been nice to know that ahead of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Series on Prime? NOT!","review":"I was so excited to see that the complete series was on Amazon Prime. Until I found out that it was only the first 4 episodes of the complete series. Amazon needs to get all the episodes into prime or break them up by episode. I loved this when it was on PBS Mystery, and would love to watch the rest of them again. I'd give it 5 stars if this is fixed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cadfael: Complete Collection","review":"I first viewed \\"Cadfael\\" when I lived in England back in the 1980's. I purchased the music CD (Angel - 7243 8 37086 2 8) in March of 1998 and now have the complete set. If you enjoy any of the \\"CSI\\" series from \\"Quincy\\" to \\"Monk\\" then you should feel at home with \\"Cadfael\\". Both DVD and CD are excellent entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cadfael","review":"I took a chance when ordering this collection because I'd never seen the series on PBS, but well...Derek Jacobi rocks! He was great in the production, \\"I, Claudius\\" and this series is even more awesome. The setting is during the early 1100's and well written and researched, paying attention to historical details that make the stories come to life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Amazon Purchases","review":"I'd be lost without Amazon on line ordering. I am an avid reader and always looking for books (old and new) and videos (old and new). I have lots of 1/2 Price Book outlets here in DFW but many times I still cannot find the books I am looking for. And the purchases always get here in a timely manner. I have never been disappointed. Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Cadfael!","review":"I loved the Cadfael stories so much when I saw them on PBS that I recently purchased the set. The stories are just as good today as when I saw them a number of years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practically Perfect in Every Way!","review":"I love Cadfael.Love the stories, love the actors, love the scenery. Love Derek Jacobi. I love that I found this box set at a fraction of the cost of the fancier, prettier version."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"These are wonderful mysteries, most faithfully produced. Derek Jacobi is a very fine actor and his portrayal of Brother Cadfael is wonderfully nuanced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Europe's mentality through its medieval history","review":"Another masterful BBC production, with the great Derek Jacobi as Cadfael.I first saw this years ago, rented from a public library.Attention to detail, great acting, historical correctness, all this make this series almost an educational tool, for those who want to learn and understand Europe's mentality, through its past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rose","review":"I have enjoyed Ellis Peter's books and watch this series on TV. I wanted to be able to share this with my family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yay!","review":"I've been waiting for the Gidget movies to come out on DVD for a long time, as I no longer have a VHS player.

They were shot in 2.35:1 ratio....so almost HALF THE PICTURE IS MISSING!!!This is the second time Columbia Tristar has deeply disappointed me on films I wanted in DVD. The first was their butchering of \\"Where Angels Go Trouble Follows\\" and \\"The Trouble With Angels\\".Alas, they will remain missing from my film library until they are released in their proper ratio!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WIDE SCREEN GIDGET","review":"I agree with the other reviews. This definately should have been released in it's original aspect ratio. 2.35 and the other two 1.85. If they all were only 1.66 it would not have been so bad. I am certainly waiting till it comes out in wide screen, and hope it does, but will hang on to my video's in the meantime.It would have been a wonderful set to have, VERY DISAPPOINTING."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE - Gidget DVDs are pan & scan","review":"I was all set to pre-order this DVD set of the first three Gidget films when I learned that they are pan & scan, not widescreen. All three films were made in widescreen, and the original \\"Gidget\\" was filmed in Panavision--meaning that the pan & scan version will cut off 1/2 of the picture. (I'm not sure if the other two Gidget films were Panavision (2.35) or 1.85 widescreen.)If you're thinking about buying this as a permanent part of your DVD library, you may want to wait until Columbia does a proper job on the DVD. Even if you don't have a widescreen televison now, you will before too much longer..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agree with everyone else here...","review":"\\"Gidget\\" (the original, the one I ordered the set for) should be in WideScreen, not FullScreen. It's a sad, sad day in a movie lover's world when my AMC taped copy is better than the DVD I shelled out $25+ for.I was so excited when it came in, only to be disappointed after the opening credits rolled. Thanks God my Sandra Dee/Bobby Darin collection came in the mail the same time as \\"Gidget\\".What a disappointment! Execs at Universal should be forced to write letters of apology (personal, not form letters) to us who rushed out and bought the collection. And then replace our DVDs with the WideScreen. Made an already bad Saturday that much worse...jenn m.Oxford, Mississippi, USA"},{"rating":"1","title":"No widescreen, no sale!","review":"How dare they, in this day and age forsake widescreen TV owners and others that wish to have movies in thier original aspect ratio.I wanted the first Gidget movie, I have it taped on VHS in Pan and Scan and wanted a modern 16:9 trasnfer of this Cinemascope film.Shame on Columbia/Tristar for not doing this the right way. Shame on them!This will never be bought by me unless they release a widesceen version like they should've in the first place.You would think that the studios would learn thier lesson from the fullscreen only Willy Wonka fiasco.If you must put Pan and Scan on DVD, make sure the widescreen version is also available (preferably on a seperate release).This potential sale has been cancelled."},{"rating":"1","title":"GIDGET COLLECTION","review":"This could have been the perfect mid-summer diversion. However, someone at Columbia/Tri-Star decided this collection should bereleased in full screen. (The first Gidget feature is in CinemaScope). Such a let-down. I guess I shall just have to keep the Cinemascope tape copy I made off Turner Classic Movies Channel. I hope I can get my money back. Note to those in charge of such things. Full-frame is for VHS. Wide-screen is for DVD. Pass it on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gidget","review":"All three movies were very cute and enjoyable, it was disappointing that the movies weren't in wide screen though.

My daughters who are just entering their twenties enjoy them with me. James Darren was my teen idol, and Sandra Dee was so sweet it was a joy to watch. Now Gidget goes Hawaiian still gave me James Darren, but I also got to enjoy the dance and music of a variety of other stars, it takes me back to a softer time. I can't say I enjoyed Gidget goes to Rome as much, but the scenery was worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surfs up","review":"After reading all the reviews before buying this I was a little concerned about the quality of what was to come. I have no issues with zoning or the screening ratio.I was looking for this everywhere and now I have found it. Thanks"},{"rating":"1","title":"umm hello","review":"Okay so I know my wife has been waiting for these movies to come out on DVD since dvd was around and what does the studio do, they release it in full screen mode only. Umm Hello , anybody else see major problems with this,to the Studios who produce it, GO BACK AND FIX ITnot worth the money, also since it appears to be only on one disc, even using double sided, it would still most likely be using a very high ( translated to bad picture ) compression schemeits a shame too because they are truely excellent movies"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a letdown!","review":"I've been waiting for these films to be released on DVD so I could see the ENTIRE frame, not a cropped pan-and-scan portion of the frame. Why did you decide to limit the image, Columbia? It is so easy to just encode the entire original widescreen film and let the DVD viewer choose whether they want to crop it to fit their TV. Send the originals to me and I'll encode them! The more people that reject this release, the quicker we will see a proper widescreen release on the market. Unfortunately Sandra Dee, I will be waiting longer to see thee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I also was set to purchase these DVDs in order to view the other Gidget movies in widescreen (probably 1.85:1) as I have on tape the original Gidget movie from TCM in widescreen. However, I will NOT purchase cheesy, full-frame editions. Columbia-Tristar has really stumbled lately with their DVD releases (Ship of Fools, Divorce American Style, Trouble with Angels, etc.). When will they get with it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"BOYCOTT THIS RELEASE","review":"Who wants a cropped pan-and-scan edition? Who wants to see LESS of the original film frame?!!! Shame on you CTS for this poor, long-awaited release. The people who want to buy this film DO NOT CARE if there are black bars on the top and bottom. We like films released on DVD in their original aspect ratio!! Why the VHS mentality?I will happily buy this set when they are released in widescreen, as they were intended to be seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less Than Stellar Set","review":"Not only did they put a Cinemascope film in a \\"Full Frame\\" dvd, but again, they put 3 movies together that should be sold separately (for those who disliked the second and third movies like me) or in a collector's box set. Sandra Dee was the best, and in my opinion, the only Gidget. The second and third movies were just horrible! Yes they have James Darren back as Moondoggie, but why not bring back Sandra Dee if they were going to make sequels? Save your money, this set is not worth buying.If you want to see Gidget in all its original beauty and not hacked to pieces like on this dvd set, tune into TCM they play it occasionally."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Complete Gidget Collection","review":"Great for a trip down memory lane.

I must have got a lemon as I appear to be the only unfortunate one here. The link is there, but there is no way to \\"play\\" it. I will be returning mine.Otherwise, regardless of the formats, I always enjoy all the Gidget films--particularly the ones with Sandra Dee."},{"rating":"2","title":"For all us Gidget fans.....","review":"Did you grow up watching the Gidget movies on the weekends? Do you love the beach? Ever wish you were a surfer girl? Then this is the DVD for you!!! Get all three Gidget movies in one set. Their wholesome and fun. New for some, nostalgic for others. Nothing better than watching a beach movie in the dead of winter!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Who did you expect? Kim Novak?","review":"Yes it is a true shame the these movies were released in such butchered condition, however if I am to choose between a butchered Gidget, or no Gidget at all....
