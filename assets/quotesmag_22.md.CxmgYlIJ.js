I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't recommend this one","review":"I have a couple other Oxo Good Grips items that I love and I needed a new spatula, so I picked up one of these at a local grocery store. I like the design, and it's nice and thin and easy to get under food, or at least it was the first couple times I used it. That being said, it's probably okay for moving cookies off a baking sheet, but it is definitely not designed for the heat of a frying pan. I used it for flipping eggs and pancakes and the edge started to melt. I had to use a sharp knife to scrape of the rough pieces. I'll have to try the silicone version, which has a higher heat tolerance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good replacement for the previous OXO","review":"I purchased this OXO spatula to replace my previous OXO that had the solid metal blade (now sold again here on Amazon; 1071536) as the tip had started to come open after several years of hard use, thinking, that based on my experience with OXO products, if it is made by OXO, it must be well made. From the get go I was unhappy. Specifically, the plastic part of the spatula required hard scrubbing to clean it, and I found it to be hyperflexible to the point of picking up things and then dumping them, like burgers. I finally threw it out after finding, for the umpteenth time,that it still contained food material after washing it. With my old OXO, a simple rinse with a sponge with soap under hot water cleaned it thoroughly. I am happy that Amazon now has my previous style in stock again, and I will order it forthwith!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great turner.","review":"I have had these before and tried the OXO silicon one and did not like it.

I thought it would be more flexible, like the metal ones are, but that's its only flaw in my eyes. That's why I give it 4 stars instead of 5. Other than that, it is perfect. I like the thin blade and tip, which makes turning delicate items a breeze without tearing or crumpling them up like the thick plastic spatulas do. Mine did not melt, blister, or curl. I know this for a fact, because I accidently left the blade in my fry pan on high when I went to answer the phone. When I came back, the food was ruined but the spatulas was perfect. I'm here to buy a second one. :o)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sticky spatula","review":"It's great that this material won't scratch your upscale, non-stick pans, however many different types of food like to stick to this spatula!

Incredibly, the first time this was used to make pancakes the edge of the spatula blistered and melted. We tried it on hash brown potatoes with the same result. A call to OXO customer service elicited their willingness to refund the purchase price only if we returned it--which simply isn't worth the time and trouble. Maybe it's only the blue ones this happens to? We're rethinking our opinion of OXO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What You Would Expect","review":"Everything this thing touches sticks to it like glue; and it has an incurable backward bend to it that makes it difficult to maneuver in any pan you try to use it in.

I have bought so many crap turners in the past and I was hoping this one was going to be a change of pace for me. Others have had flimsy handles that couldn't bare the weight of an omelette, some couldn't stand the heat, others scratched my cookware. This one couldn't get under a soft cookie on the pan because the edges of the turner are too soft. This one couldn't flip a 2 egg cheese omelette because the turner is too flimsy. This one couldn't flip a sunny side up egg because it warped in the hot pan oil. I can't find a use for this turner. It's garbage. I'm disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nylon Flexible Turner","review":"I purchased the nylon flexible turner after owning an identical turner the past two years.

It bends very easily, especially when it's a little heated. So forget about using it to turn something heavier than a silver dollar pancake. I can't even fold omelet with it. The edge also melts, not from being left in a pan but from being used to flip crepes, etc.. I regret this purchase. The only reason I give it 2 stars instead of 1 is that it has a relatively thin edge which makes it easy to slide this thing under a pancake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible - Food Sticks and Tip Melted","review":"I normally love Oxo products and will continue to buy them, but this product was terrible. It was no better than a super cheap turner. (In fact, I think those would be better!) The tip melted and is flaking off. After only a couple of uses, we can't even use it any more for fear of getting little pieces of plastic in our food. In addition, food sticks to it like crazy. We had to use an SOS pad to get the tip cleaned off. Save your money. I'd suggest trying the Amco or Silvermark Silicone turners.

They truly are the best computer speakers I have heard priced at less than $$$. They have a very neutral sound, i.e. non-boomy bass, smooth mids, and crisp but not overly bright treble. The frequency response is also impressively flat overall, aside from a small dip in the lower midrange, which I have noticed with every computer speaker system. The gain limiting is very good, as the speakers can be at full volume with little to no distortion. They sound at least a million times better than a Bose Acoustimass system. I have noticed that they get grainy when the equalization isn't flat and the surround setting is turned up, so just keep those set to the middle, keep the EQ on your computer off and prepare to be blown away.

Now I am not saying these are bad speakers, but I wouldn't value them at anything higher than $50, on the high high end.The thing people don't understand well, is that speakers are speakers. These one's look ok, but they fall over sometimes, and the volume control and placement of the two satellites can be annoying. (I am being particular for a reason, not trying to dissapoint those who already have them). I enjoy the pair that I have, they do the job, they make some noise.

I got these with the dell, and they have nice sound, but the volume is really bad. The volume control is in a bad spot (ON TOP OF THE RIGHT SATTELITE) really annoying. Also, you can get much better sound out of the JBL creature speakers, JBL invaders, and the JBL soundsticks. All of the JBLs sound better and look much better with an apple.

SMALL apartments are often rentals, and not many landlords I know of would put up with my rewiring, repainting, and wall-mounting a heavy flatscreen TV.

This said, painters not primarily interested in oil, might be able to find a book better suited to them elsewhere, but, for oil painters, this book is an asset.A final note, the person who claimed this book to be too dry and without illustrations should be disregarded, this is not a picture book for the entertainment of children but a comprehensive handbook for serious painters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indispensable!","review":"I want to urge any aspiring artist to purchase this book! It answers questions which my instructor was not even able to shed light on. The topics run from very fundamental to very detailed and technical; and it is written and illustrated in a very easy to follow style. Perhaps the best part of this is that the author (an accomplished artist) has a website from which the reader can directly engage him for advice and questions:[...]If you have a palette and easel, this book has to be as close at hand as your brushes! It is indispensable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"so far, so good","review":"Yes, yes, yes, I know a wet cleaner is better than a dry head cleaner like this TDK product. That said, there is not an alternative so I went ahead & tried this product out on my 4 year old Sony Digital 8 camcorder (the TRV-460 I think). The camcorder had perhaps 60 hrs of recording time on it (plus 60 hours playback) & it had become totally inoperable. A couple of 10 second applications w/ the head cleaner & all was well. Once or twice since then I needed to re-clean but overall I'm very satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!","review":"My HI8mm machine was working just fine but I wanted to be sure the heads were clean to do a special project. After using this cleaning casette it rendered my machine useless. It will now not record or play any tapes.Unforturnatley for me I did research on dry cleaning casettes after the fact. Many experts warn about these casettes ruining otherwise good machines. They instead recommend running a brand new tape for about 20 minutes as this will clean the heads safely.I would like to sue the company the makes these things."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great stocking stuffer","review":"A friend gave me this book and as soon as I opened it, I knew I had bought Christmas stocking stuffers for all of my family, friends and former teachers.

Im a true Tori fan and have been working on a full collection for years, us uk and imports so i felt the need to add it to the collection. Dont make the same mistake it is not one of her best remixes and am sure that all it will do is sit on my bookstand. Save your money and buy some other Tori.

No offence to the many popular Christian reading fads of late, but Way of the Master supersedes them in importance, hands down."},{"rating":"2","title":"What We Need To Hear","review":"Ray Comfort has it right. Our churches are filled with the \\"saved\\" who are merely numbers on a roll.We haven't taken the time to invest in those searching for Christ to tell them WHY they need Him. The Law is the only tool to lead someone to God's love. Check up on the newly saved and see how many are active members of a church after a year. You'll see we aren't doing it right.Ray actively speaks out against our unbiblical habit of going after numbers, and not souls. Just look on TV at the largest \\"Christian\\" church in the U.S. and see what I'm talking about. A Christian church without a Cross in it? Totally ridiculous.Buy this book, and have your eyes opened. The commentary by Kirk Cameron is great also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine Representation of mid-late 80s rap","review":"This series is to rap what the \\"Didn't I Blow Your Mind\\" series on Rhino is to Classic Soul. An excellent representation of what was popular at the time (in this case, roughly 1985 to 88). Rp was still fun at this point, as evidenced by the Fat Boys' \\"Jailhouse Rap\\", Rob Base's eternal party starter \\"It Takes Two\\" (based on Lynn Collins' \\"Think.\\"), UTFO's \\"Roxanne Roxanne (which spawned some unfortunate imitators in 1985). etc. The Biz keeps the comedy going with the laugh fest \\"Just a Friend\\" and the seriocomic \\"The Vapors.\\" Kris Parker signals things to come with \\"Criminal Minded\\" (which does not endorse gangsterism as the title may indicate) as does Public Enemy's policial rap \\"Rebel Without a Pause.\\" Fortunately, Kurtis Blow stops things just before rap got ruined with the gangster garbage, so enjoy and learn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emergency Cars are Great","review":"The 3 different types of cars are great to work on vocabulary & colors.

Yusa may have great lyrics, but her voice and the music don't match.

I recommend that those interested listen to the clips and decide whether this is the sort of music they enjoy; if that's the case...more power to them...I, instead, elected to use the CD as a drink coaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the most complete book on thrift ever written.","review":"Reading the four books and the newsletter Amy has written has change my life.

Indeed it's funny how much of it my wife and I already implement. However, the scrimping is overdone. For example, my wife and I catered our own wedding and saved a bundle. However, we would never have dreamed of having a pot luck wedding!I prefer Andrew Tobias' approach, which is more balanced. He both scrimps and invests. With six kids you could argue that Amy is not doing the Earth any favors. No doubt it's hard to have six kids and any money left to save no matter how frugal you are.A healthy balance is sadly lacking here."},{"rating":"1","title":"TIGHTWAD ABSURDITY","review":"You can save money, but most of these suggestions are worthless...like something you dream up to fill up a book.

This is taking cheapness to a ridiculous level that is not normal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated, irrelevant, and time consuming","review":"Living frugally while raising a family and sending my husband to college full time while living on one income in Los Angeles is no easy task. This book was a waste of my time. It includes ways to make your typewriter tape last longer and how to save on encyclopedia sets.

If you are searching for the book used here on Amazon.com, then you are already ahead of the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attitude spoils the content","review":"I am a schoolteacher -- and most of us are not known to be millionaires. I found a lot of good ideas in the TIGHTWAD GAZETTE, but I don't like guilt trips (shame, shame shame if you use disposable diapers) (shame shame shame if you want two incomes in the family). There are other books on the market that promote thrift and frugal living and they are a joy to read and make the reader feel good as opposed to foolish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best frugal book ever read","review":"I read and subscribed to Amy Dacyczyn newsletter in the early 90's, To this day I still use her ideas and recipes from her books and newsletters, in 20 yrs I have not found any frugal book that measures up. Amy covers everything in her book from remodeling to coupons to dating, there are so many good things in her book that this is the only book you will need on frugal living, although I like to read other frugal books Amy's is the best!! The homemade Christmas gifts for kids I still use today, I wish Amy would come out with another book for this decade, we need her creative ideas."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT","review":"GET TO THE HEART OF THE MATTER, FORGET WHAT SOCIETY SAYS-BE YOUR OWN PERSON/FAMILY, AND CONSERVE MONEY AND RESOURCES!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be required reading for all newlyweds!","review":"I wish I had this book ten years ago! Then, I might have something to show for the last decade! All the ideas in this book are practical and most are pretty easy. I like the way Amy just puts the ideas out there, and then lets the reader decide whether or not it is for them. (The first thing she says in the chapter on \\"Dumpster Diving\\" for example, is that it may be crossing a line for even die-hard tightwads. But she still lists the pros and cons so you can decide if it will work for you.) I also like the ideas for kids' parties, and the \\"Pantry Principle\\". This is a great book which I will be referring to often."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Complete Tighwad Gazette","review":"I highly recommend this book.

Her creative, and sometimes outrageous, suggestions show that there is always another way to do something besides throwing money at the problem!Those who find her specific suggestions too extreme can still glean many words of wisdom from the WAY she came about her tips! Adjust the situations and apply them to yours, no matter how \\"froo froo\\" you are (pinkies up!) If you really want to learn how to save - you will!! She presents not only suggestions but strategies as well.BUY IT!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"As much as I'd like to not have to work, I'd rather work then spend my day cooking from scratch (I hate cooking!), rewashing baggies or shopping at thrift stores for deals. I only got a quarter way through this book, but I didn't find it helpful to me. The only thing I agreed about was the price diary, which I knew about before. I also didn't like that she seemed to put down people who wouldn't do these things, like we're a bunch of fools for buying new baggies or pre-packaged convience food.I'm sure her ideas work if you're willing to put in the time and effort, but they just aren't for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth The Money or Time","review":"This book is 927 pages long. Of those 927 pages I found two new ideas for saving money. This book was a huge disappointment to me. Not only are most the ideas lame some are even illegal, like filling an old mail with a smaller mailbox, then pouring concrete into the larger one.....this is suppose to stop kids from using a baseball bat on your mailbox.......illegal! Try that and if the kid gets hurt by swinging the bat at your concrete filled mailbox you are going to get sued for the damages. It was a real bad book in my opinion. The ideas are not fresh and some are simply stupid, while others are a waste of time. I really did not like this book and I highly suggest you check it out at your library rather than wasting money on the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"She's got a farmhouse with abarn you know.","review":"I really did not like this book.I got sick of reading about the farmhouse and barn (you only have to mention it once).I don't know why she had six children if she can't feed them,maybe she had them to fill up her barn.I agree with another reviewer who said she is giving her kids the idea that they are not worth it.It's ok for kids to have second hand clothes and toys but it's also nice for them to have new stuff to (she could buy things in the sales).She has no balance.There are better books out there to save money I say buy one of them instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way to extreme","review":"I thought this book would help save me money but it just made me glad that i'm not as cheap has mizz Dacyczyn.She comes across as a know it all and has very strange ideas on bringing up children who have to work for a twenty five cent snack.Also some information is repeated.Buy if you want a laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book","review":"I started reading these books years ago. A friend and I became tightwad buddies. We would make meals, freeze, dry, and harvest together.

The things mentioned don't bring up more of the new things used to save money. Many of the newer simpler things aren't covered or other ways to reuse things. Some of the suggested reusables aren't made any more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Practical Information","review":"This is probably the best book on cash conservation that I have read.

Well I was wrong! This book has so many great ideas, I don't know how I ever lived without it. It has changed my way of going about things, and I don't mind saying, actually taught me we did have money we could save, we just had to change a few things. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is struggling to make ends meet. Expecially if you either want or have a family. It shows you that you can raise kids and still have fun without spending so much money to do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible organization","review":"I had a very hard time with the way this book is organized. It's NOT! It's organized by season??!! On one page there is what to do with your juice lids, the next page is budget weddings? Huh?! Would have made more sense if it was organized by actual categories-kitchen, toys, clothes, utility bills, car repairs. I thought it was more of a reference book but unless you know exactly what your're looking for and can look it up in the index it's useless. I wish I hadn't wasted the money. It's all over the place. No rhyme or reason to it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never received the product","review":"I really wanted to help this student ... I assumed it was a student from the website listed.

Here we were two car payments, mortgage and only one income and I couldn't imagine putting my child in day-care. We were facing some tough choices. Amy was the answer to my prayers. Needless to say Amy's books have always been there when I needed some incouragement or motivation. I've borrowed these books to many friends and everyone has bought their own version. Go to the library first and if you can't bear to take it back, BUY IT! I have all three and they are all tattered and well worn, trophies of simple living."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting","review":"This book is certainly not for everyone and maybe a lot of people wouldn't want to do it for a long time, but I do think that the author has a point. If for a while you do live as frugally as you can, then you save your money and you will have quite a nice financial cushion.I really can't imagine dumpster diving, it sounds very disgusting. I won't go that far, and I really can't imagine being frugal forever. Some of the things the author does are a little too extreme. Life is too short and why shouldn't people buy nice things and enjoy their life? I do think that it is a good thing to be frugal especially when the expense of living is going up. It really depends on the person and how they want to be frugal, some of the advice here works for me and some of it doesn't. Overall it's a great book with great advice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone should own this book","review":"The only problem I have with this book is that the pages after the first section do not line up well with the index, making it difficult to use. That is an editor's mistake that I hope they correct in any future reprintings.I bought this book back in 2000 and still read it from time to time for motivation. Even though some of the ideas presented may be extreme for many, one can still find inspiration to do things at a lower cost and save time. Although I still used disposable diapers on my children, getting diapers as presents and early potty-training did save me money later on.This book not only gives great ideas, it is also thought-provoking. She reminds us that the little things do matter overall and shows us through her own personal struggle without being annoying. When she states this is a serious lifestyle, believe it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent Dacyczyn","review":"Dacyczyn does not encourage us to follow her methods literally; she only suggests looking at our spending habits and realigning them.

While some of the ideas are a bit extreem, others are true gems that you will wish you thought of sooner."},{"rating":"2","title":"A step beyond","review":"This book is helpful to anyone that is looking for ways to save money. The author goes beyond just normal saving strategies and has great ideas. No, not all the ideas are for everyone. But I found useful information that will assist me in saving money the rest of my life. She also offers insight about how much we actually waste and ways to help the enviroment. I will save in three months the cost of the book and that is just by using two of her ideas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book but needs to be updated - should expand their small online section","review":"This is a book full of wonderful ideas but falls short on how to save big bucks by using the Internet. Websites like Amazon and Tightwadsales offer fantastic savings on everyday items normal people purchase, especially electronics and books. Other than not having a section on saving on the Internet it's a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Changed My Life","review":"This book is one of a kind. It changes your thinking and is highly informational.Why only four stars?-The binding. It is burdensome to hold, and the covers fall off the book pretty quickly.-It is dated. Though it's only ten years old, much of this book is in dire need of updating. For example, the articles on computers and phone service can be disregarded, and in the internet age, there are a lot of new money-saving sites out there. (Can I give a shout out to Zenni Optical and eTrade!)Seriously, though, that's all I have as far as criticism is concerned. This is a fantastic book."},{"rating":"2","title":"something for everybody, especially if you are new to frugality","review":"Not everyone will agree with everything in this book (I sure didn't).

I am a young professional and I found this book very useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tightwaddery is about fun and creativity!","review":"A must have for anyone who is trying to save money.

After that, she started expressing an interest in wanting to keep a journal/diary of her own. She loves horses so I thought this would have been perfect.When it arrived, I was not too impressed with how it looked. The picture is printed on there and looks really cheap. The colors are off and just has a really cheap look to it.The locking mechanisim is plastic so I dont see how it will hold up very long. They certainly dont make them like they used to.Also, when she opened it for the first time, the binding separated from the spine of the book. The pages held together and stayed stuck to the glue binding, thankfully, but I am worried they too will start to fall out.I am a little disappointed in how this is made. My daughter seems to like it but I have to say I was a little let down by it and am already looking for a replacement for her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Xmas gift","review":"Really nice, not some lightweight cheap paper or cardboard, even the lock was good.my granddaughter loved it and shes 13."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought as a gift, child loved it","review":"Great for the price!

They are the only truly talented and unique music artists that have come out in years. They sound like nothing that I've ever heard before and they sound GOOD. Wild West Show and Saved are both great songs that showcase the rockin' country that Big and Rich are. For the price, this is a great single to have, but you need Horse of a Different Color and the Fan Pak to truly appreciate the talent of the duo that is Big and Rich."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wild West Show is different, but fun!","review":"I am a huge tradition country music fan (George Strait mostly) but I have to say this was great. Not everyone is going to like this, because it is just so out of the normal country guidelines. At least it is not a borderline pop song like some female \\"country\\" singers. Instead it is more rock influenced band which really makes up a unique sound. For those people who aren't afraid of a little variety in their usual country routine, this is a refreshing treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet J.","review":"The CD was absolutley beautiful. I love every cut on it. I listen to the CD all the time especially when I am down, it helps relieve some of the every day pressures in my life.

As is typical of Fodor's, it covers the major cities and a fair number of the less visited areas, cities, and islands. Provided is a representative selection of hotels and restaurants, and a fair number of attractions. It has many more maps than Lonely Planet, a definite plus.Major problems: it is less useful for the traveller seeing Australia by road, since many country towns where motels are found are not covered (travelling from Adelaide to Sydney by a leisurely route, I looked for Port Augusta, Lithgow and Forbes in vain). Good metropolitan maps of the major cities would be appreciated, as well, showing each airport and city center.Still, a very good guidebook which will be a great help for the visitor to Oz."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best","review":"This CD will take you you on a ride like you would not believe.

Using it to play Street Fighter now, my inputs are coming out fine, etc.No major issues, and I never expected it to be very clean at the price, so it's totally fine.

The author's self concerns are so vast there is very little room for Ireland, almost none. A few tidbits survived, that is actual tidbits about Ireland, but for the most part the book is not about Ireland, it is about Roy. I suppose he is an interesting fellow, but I did not buy a book about him, at least I had not thought so; but a book about the author's various tortured landscapes is what I got, and again, very little Ireland.Perhaps I am too harsh.

The last loader I used actually made a lot of noise when it's gears moved the balls around this let me know the loader was on and working properly. This loader is much more quiet which I found more difficult to discern whether the loader was functioning, turned on, malfunctioning etc. When my batteries died the loader pushed balls intermittently, would turn off and I couldn't see the red light in the sun so I thought I was out of air or was having a marker problem. When I left the field I went back to the car and noticed the red light and replaced the batteries.

The Everlast Bar comes with nuts that don't fit the screws. The nuts are laced with a hard inner plastic lining that requires you to use powertools to force the screw to chisel through. I returned it for a new one, thinking that surely this was a mistake, but the replacement had the same pieces. Horrible!However, I was determined to make my purchase work, so I put it together with force. Once I had everything assembled, I found that the bar does not keep together by design; even with the screws pretty secured, the outer loops on the bar (they are supposed to serve as multi-purpose handles) can unhinge and detach from the bar, because their connection to the bar on one side is not secured by screws. That's absolutely ridiculous when this is clearly supposed to be keep you safely suspended in mid-air.Thoroughly dissatisfied.

Although the width of my doorframe was fine, the width of my walls were actually thin... So, what happens is that all that's holding you up is a 1/8 of an inch of wood, and if you that slips, down you go... Also, it creates considerable stress on the wall, and the paint started to crack after 6 pullups.. For me, in many ways, this product is an accident waiting to happen...If your walls are 8 to 9 inches thick, your door frame very strong and you are average height (no taller than 5'10\\"), then this could possibly work for you...

Reviews from 2005 state that it comes with incorrect hardware. November 2007 they still sell this with the incorrect hardware. The bolts are way too big for this system. I had to use my own nuts to get it tight enough to use. Also it does not fit on my doorway correctly. It fits good on one side of my door frame but the other side is almost off the frame.

Like so many other reviewers, I opened the box to find the wrong hardware included and very poorly worded instructions. At least one reviewer claimed that you can put the rig together correctly by somehow divining that a socket wrench is needed; this is wrong. The hardware is INCORRECT for the device, and you would have to supply your own bolts and nuts or try to force the supplied materials to work.

I have carpeted floor, which is not firm enough for the bar to leverage against during situp. I haven't try it on a hard floor to see if it work there or not, but I doubt it will. The bar is strong and sturdy once all screw is in place and tighten. The bar does need to have a doorframe header to work properly, I would not just depend on the leverage wood bar and its sandpaper to hold by itself. The bar size is not adjustable, so it will only fit certain size doorway only. The soft grip is nice and comfort as well.

It holds my weight (210lbs), but at times, I feel like it's bending. The grips aren't placed at an anatomically correct angle, so your wrists will get worked harder than they should.

I'll be looking for a new one."},{"rating":"2","title":"chin up bar","review":"Easy to install. Assembly could be easier, but only took about 5 minutes. Elbows sometimes hit doorway frame when doing certain chinups, but what do you expect? Mine is leaving a slight embedment above the frame where most of the weight is trasnferred, but I keep it on the closet frame so no one sees it.

Only problem I had was that when I got the item, there were a couple of factory defects.

I didn't feel like paying addtional fees for shipping so, I drilled a hole into it myself and it works fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"works OK","review":"I weigh approx. 150 lbs and when I grab onto the bar and lift my body, the metal joints flex a little bit. When I do push up with it the same thing. It feels a bit edgy but it has worked OK. And considering its not so heavy weight it is not surprising. Another thing, the overall width may be a bit shorter for some wider doors, so make sure you measure your door before purchase. Each end should be at least 3-inch wider than each side of the door in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jenky build.","review":"Extremely shoddy and cheap constuction. It fit my dorm's door frame well. However, curved bars keep falling out of the holes they fit into, as they're not held in place by anything.

I've owned it now for two weeks with no disappointments. It came with all the necessary bolts, nuts, and washers. The directions are very simple if you have any experience with reading/looking at pictures. Be sure to tighten bolts with tools (not your hands as others seem to have tried). The only caveat is that the bar doesn't fit all door frames. I tried 3 different doors in my apt. before I found one that fit, but as long as you have several door options you should be just fine. Also you should put some type of clothe between the bar and frame to avoid potential scratching/denting.

One odd thing was the bolts were metric while the nut was 7/16 imperial; not the threading - just what I had to use to tighten them.Even with the padding, it will most likely leave an indention in your door frame. Looking at the cantilever design of the other manufacturers, I suspect they all would. I have had it for a few weeks now, and it hasn't slipped off which is something I read on reviews of other manufacturers. It's probably better than average in terms of value for price. The online store I bought this from sent me the wrong product for a soldier at GTMO, then would not even express ship the correct product. Not a huge deal, but not good customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not multi-purpose","review":"This product is sturdy enough to do dips or pushups, but forget about chin ups or pull ups, which I mainly bought it for. It is portable enough that you can slide on and off the door frame, but the edge of the wooden plank that is supposed to sit on top of your door frame is only in contact with your door frame for 1-2 cm, much too short to be sturdy enough to do any proper pullups. I had great reservations trying to do a pull up because I had the sense that it would slip/slide off the frame once I reached the top of my pull up.For $30 that I bought it for, and the pain it took to assemble this, it is not a very good product"},{"rating":"1","title":"Received wrong assembly item with product","review":"I didnt buy this product through amazon, I did through another retailer.

I did not trust this for serious workouts and will not even attempt to do so. I like others am sad to see the Everlast name on this product. I will be purchasing a regular screw in pull up bar.

See which fills up first.","review":"I try to be optimistic but this thing isn't helping. I can't believe they put the Everlast name on this piece of junk. I read the other reviews and figured I'd try my luck. Naturally, I also received the wrong assembly hardware. The bolts are too small (or the holes are too large) in diameter to provide anything but sloppy construction. The parts list and assembly instructions show six of only one type of nut. There are two types included: four lock nuts, two standard nuts. The parts list and assembly instructions also show six PVC caps for the nuts. There are only four. The metal tubing seems rather thin walled for the price.

To be honest, I half expected it to fail, \\"you get what you pay for\\" and all.Admittedly, assembly was somewhat tricky since the bolt heads were smooth, and no tools came with the kit. However, with a clever use of some pliers, the problem was resolved, and the bar put together in a matter of 1.5 hours, hence the 4/5 rating.Other than that, the bar works just as advertised.

When I showed it to a friend who has something similar she was shocked by the terrible materials used for this thing.

Wonderful stuff.The only disappointing track is track 14 (David Byrne-Maria Lando). This reminds me of Ry Cooder and Charlie Musslewhite perfoming with heavy-weight Cuban artists. \\"Chalk and cheese\\" I would say. Never-the-less, only one track out of 15 is a very minor pertubation.Buy this CD and it will definitely become one of your favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Review...","review":"Overall, I thought the soundtrack was good.

I had looped that nonstop, 8 hours on my IPOD while I am at work, and I never get tired of the song. It is very poppy, catchy, and overall a classic masterpiece. I will rate the disc 1 star - that star is for the first jam. The rest of the music isn't good at all. Even the other Lohan jams, their kinda strange. Stevie Wonder is rolling in his grave.

If you want to make up a dance routine, or just dance, this is the cd you have been searching for.

Stop analysing and just report like you did with the first two books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good cure for insomnia","review":"I looked forward to this book and was disappointed. As someone stated in another review, it's the same fantasies over and over again. Many of them are written using the same slang and terminology to reference certain parts of the anatomy. Considering the English language has a dozen words or different ways to describe the female anatomy it seemed more than a bit odd that most of the women who submitted fantasies would all choose to use the same 2 or 3 words. About 1/4 of the way into the book it started to seem like the author wrote a lot of the fantasies herself since she also uses the same slang lingo in her chapter intros and the fantasies are all so similar. The book also lacks variety but if you're interested in reading the mostly tame fantasies of totally inexperienced or totally repressed women, this might be a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"First Impressions needs a proofreader and editor.","review":"I got the impression that Rankin wrote this book in a short period of time without the assistance of a proofreader or editor. It was superficial, with such helpful hints as \\"People come in all sizes and shapes,\\" and \\"People with a warm smile are perceived as being more friendly.\\" I didn't need to read her book to figure those out. Her logic is also flawed. She states that, \\"Doctors touch patients, not vice versa because doctors are more privileged and powerful than patients.\\" Did she consider that doctors need to touch their patients in order to examine them - not because of any power status? Using the book to promote her feminist beliefs, numerous typographical errors, and trite comments also distracted from what little substance the book had to offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine came quite dull","review":"Sorry to ruin the party, but I was unimpressed.

I bought this on 9-11-2002 for \\"America The Beautiful,\\" as I consider this the best rendition of that song, but I was pleased with what else is on here.\\"Sail Away\\" (wriiten by Randy Newman) is actually a wickedly ironic tune connecting the Black American expereince with slave ships (you have to listen closely to the lyrics to get the irony). \\"Hey Mister\\" deals with the problem of hunger in America while the remakes of \\"Abraham Martin and John,\\" \\"Imagine,\\" \\"Let it Be,\\" \\"That Lucky Old Sun,\\" etc. are so hauntingly soulful with Ray's aching voice and the Raylette's gospel-like phrasings that you wouldn't wanna listen to this with the lights off late at night.Overall, this wonderful album (much of it culled from 1972's \\"Message for the People\\") will really make you appreciate Ray Charles for the genius that he is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't keep everything as organized as it could","review":"This was not a very expensive cabinet so but it could have been made much better.The main issue is that there are open spaces in the back where the things from the drawers can fall out.

The songs are simple and emotionally relatable, but the music behind them is interesting and textured, with threads of 80s post-punk and Omaha indie rock. A necessary record for indie fans in the know; its production is fantastic and the band is fast gaining recognition.

The author's product line is not cheap either, and many of the projects (especially the hobo bags) look like a lot of the cheap imports available today--why put all that money into something when you could buy a nearly identical item cheaper?The clothing is nothing remarkable either, and definitely warm weather only.

I would give it a 5 because this story is sort of adventure and a little history in it. This kid named Dave went a school full of rich kids. One day he came home something happened to his father. His step-mother sent him to an orphanage it is called the HHB. One night Dave sneaks out of the orphanage and went out to see places near the orphanage. Then he met his grandfather and they did some fun things. One night he goes out but doesn't come back and at the end his grandfather tells them he is going with them. The warden that was there was very mad, but he showed only a smile but he was furious.He said that he can go but he was very wired that the kid would protest to how they treated the children there. I gave this book a 5 because it was a good book to read, and I hope you will like it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"An original & riveting novel for young readers ages 8 to 12","review":"When his father dies, Dave finds himself placed in an orphanage (the cold and strict Hebrew Home for Boys in Harlem) far from the life he knew on the lower East Side of New York City. Outside the gates of the orphanage, Harlem is a world of jazz musicians and swindlers, exclusive parties and mystifying strangers. Inside the orphanage, Dave finds rare friendships and bitter enemies. Somewhere Dave must find a place that he can call home. Gail Levine is a talented author and Dave At Night is an original and riveting novel for young readers ages 8 to 12 and a highly recommended addition to school and community libraries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story","review":"When Dave's father dies, Dave is separated from his brother and sent to an orphanage. Dave finds a way to sneak over the wall of the orphanage and wanders the streets at night, where he meets many interesting characters (both high society and from his own social class). In his adventures at the orphanage and the streets, Dave learns a little bit about himself and what he needs in life, he grows to accept his problems and embrace his gifts. This is a sweet little book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book EVER!","review":"I read this book a long time ago when I was in 4th grade, it was wonderful. I still remember it today. The characters from the Hebrew Home for Boys were wonderful from alfie the kid with allergies to the big bully! The stary line is also great making you want to cry at sometimes and laugh at others. This book will have you or your child turning the ppages faster and faster each time. Even though this book has the classic plot of orphanege it provides much much more than that! So if you are going to pick a great book for your kids to read pick this one! THEY WILL LOVE IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Review for \\"Dave at Night\\"","review":"Dave the daredevil and his brother Gideon are seperated when their father dies in an accident and Gideon goes with his uncle while Dave was dumped at an orphanage. Dave gets to all sorts of trouble and at night, he runs out of his prison and out in the world where he meets a friend. I like the book because of the different personality of the boys at HHB, and also that HHB is named Hell Hole for Brats etc. If I lived at a place like that, I'd probably be cowardly but Dave is different-he finds a way to escape and I really like that. Although this book is different from other books Gail Carson Levine wrote, it is a very good sort of different because usually she writes fairy tales but this book is very adventurous and very exciting."},{"rating":"2","title":"READ THIS!!!","review":"Do you know anyone who lives in an orphanage? I do. His name is Dave Caros in the book. After his father died, life was tough for Dave. Ida his step-mother, didn't have enough money to take care of him. She took the troublesome boy to an evil orphanage in New York City. Mr. Bloom, the orphanages superintendent, took Dave's only memento from his father. Dave is determined to get it back. He also wants to run away from the horrible place to live with his good friend, Solly. The conflict in this book is Mr. Bloom vs. Dave. This is because Dave wants his carving back while Mr. Bloom won't return it to him. I think the theme was think before you act. You never know what kind of trouble you'll get into. I definitely give this book 4 stars. Everything was well done, except the book could've used more description. I recommend this book to anyone who likes suspense and adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dave at Night Review","review":"If you like adventures this is the book for you. A boy who's father dies and no one else wants him goes to live in an orpahanage. This could be one of Gail Levines best book yet. Dave At Night is great and I highly recommend it to kids age 12 to 14. Gail Levine makes this book come alive. He's an orphin by day magician by night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read For Anyone Studing The Harlem Renaissance","review":"Not Gail Carson Levine's typical book, but definatly her best.Eleven-year-old Dave Caros does not have the best life. His mother died in childbirth, his father just died, his brother deserted him, and his stepmother put him in a ophanage because she cannot support him and herself. In the HHB (Hebrew Home for Boys) Dave discovers a new world- of friendships and betrayal, of stealing and giving. Outside of the HHB, in Harlem, where Dave escapes at night, he finds another world too- of parties and jazz, of famous blacks and new friends. Maybe, somewhere between day and night, Dave can find a place he calls home."},{"rating":"1","title":"a book review \\" Dave at Night\\"","review":"WOW, This was a book that I had to put down.It wasn't the worst but I've read better.I am really suprised I finished this. But don't listen to me see what you think.This story takes place in Harlem, New York. This story is about a boy named Dave. Dave is very young and his mother died when he was little, and his father just passed away.Dave is stuck in an orphanage till one of his family members can take him. His sister Ida is too young and doesn't have enough money.The rest of his family is too poor, have too many kids or are to old. Dave meets lots of new friends and learns new things. This was an okay book I guess. I didn't really like this book because it took too long to get to the action."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dickens Re Worked","review":"Gail Carson Levine has written, as the Booklist reviewer notes, a Dickensian orphan story. The only problem with this is that she sets it in a real orphanage, ostensibly telling her father's story, and, in an afterward, listing Hyman Bogen's \\"The Luckiest Orphans\\" as part of her research.But if she read Bogen's book, she knows the orphanage was well endowed, the children well cared for, not locked in, not beaten, and not subject to prison type mealtimes. They were called \\"The Luckiest\\" because they were treated to excursions few children at that time could enjoy.The sad part, which might have made a worthwhile children's novel, was that they were without their families. I find it interesting that Levine waited for her father's death before writing the book. I don't think he would have approved. It is a cheap use of a traditional tear jerking theme."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I bought this brake pad for my car and start squeaking noise immediately after installed.

I would recommend this as I thought it was a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fast Pace, Weak Writing","review":"This book had a great deal of potential. It seems to have been either over-edited or the author had not researched his subject matter very well.It is very fast paced, extremely so, with shallow character development and only cursory details about where the action takes place. There is a subplot about a sadistic assasin that one wonders why is in the book. The premise tends to insult the reader's intelligence. It is also sexist and marginally racist.It is also evident the author was not trying to authentically depict the intelligence establishment or the use of cryptography. There seems to be a 1970's sense of mistrust of the government written into the novel as well as a sense of governmental incompetence.The characters are cliche but friendly and this book will keep you reading it, however, it will not take very long, the pace is maddening and the details few.For a brief, if not unsatisfying, distraction, Simply Simon, fills the bill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast paced and engaging","review":"An interesting plot with an autistic teenager breaking a supposedly unbreakable code.

This is my 2nd Art Jefferson thriller I have read on my Kinde (Cloudburst (An Art Jefferson Thriller)was the first) and I have enjoyed reading both. Ryne ranks up there with David Morrell as far as I am concerned (The Naked Edge,Creepers, and of coure his most famous:First Blood) and I have been reading David's books for years.

I didn't realize it when I bought it, but it was made into a movie called Mercury Rising some years ago. The book is action packed and, in my opinion, well researched.

I'd recommend this book to anyone who likes a good thriller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast paced, edge of your seat thriller","review":"I found the fast pace and constantly nerve wracking twists to keep me reading this book to completion after the first time I picked this up,exciting.

It really made the reader feel sad for the boy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basis for 'Mercury Rising'","review":"When I started reading this it seemed familiar and then I realized that this is the book that 'Mercury Rising' was based upon. There are quite a few differences between the two, so viewing/reading one will not preclude enjoying the other.The basic premise is that an autistic teenager, Simon, has broken a code that was the key for a new data encryption system that the US government was going to use for all their most sensitive communications. In order to protect the code some government agents have decided to eliminate the threat, that is Simon and his family. Fortunately for Simon an honorable FBI agent, Art Jefferson, becomes involved in the case and acts as Simon's protector.This is a fairly predictable thriller sort of a story, predictable even if you haven't seen the movie. There is little literary merit to the story but it is still an exciting read. It is well plotted by the standards of the genre and will keep the reader happily turning pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun read","review":"This was a good read for a vacation trip.

Interesting characters, and the plot had some nice surprises. An autistic boy is the core of the story -- an \\"idiot savant\\" who can decode an otherwise unbreakable code becomes the target that several groups want or want to kill. The book does fall into some typical tropes: a psychotic killer, a couple of hidden secret government agencies that nobody has ever heard of, the rogue head of one of those agencies, and a hacker who can do technological magic and break into any computer system. The story relies too heavily on these plot tropes. But there are several likable characters and the story moves along pretty well.

I can honestly say that the way he portrays himself and his company bears literally no resemblance to how either exists in reality. I found Sidney to be a megalomaniac and quite divorced from the day-to-day goings on in Harman International. The company culture is abusive, and back-stabbing is not only the norm but is rewarded. I found senior management there to be \\"ethically malleable,\\" to say the least, and financial results were reported that were less than honest. You'd never get this from reading this book. So.... if you're looking for good fiction this might be your ticket. If you want an accurate representation of how HI exists, this ain't it. I noticed that it is for sale in the \\"Used\\" section for under a dollar ... it's still overpriced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Disappointing","review":"This book is full of bravado and it reads like a one written by a megalomaniac. In the book, it sounds as if Sidney is attempting to address his own regrets in life. I don't mean to discount Sidney's success in business, but he does not share much of that insight in his book. He emphasizes a lot on ethics and integrity, but he doesn't seem to fully embrace that at work or demonstrate that in his family and personal life. He also emphasizes hard work, but who doesn't already know that. To put this book at the level of a classic is highly unfortunate, and to categorize it in the same league as \\"My Years With General Motors,\\" as Tom Peters has done, is to do Alfred P.

The Jorge Ben video was also on fairly regular rotation on Black Entertainment Television in the late 80's and early 90's. What ever happened to their world music shows......But I digress.

The author seems to have a gift for cutting right to the heart of every relationship issue, especially in the context of each individual's spiritual growth. This book, more than any other, has informed my current perspective on relationships, and has proven quite helpful in creating the context to discuss masculine/feminine issues between myself and my partner. We have been using Deida's suggestions with great success for some years now, and our relationship has blossomed in ways we never thought possible, due to our increasing faith in honesty and full expression of each of our gifts. I recommend the book highly to anyone who's at a place of questioning how one can reconcile one's sexuality with one's spiritual path."},{"rating":"2","title":"Understanding the sensual aspects of \\"relationship.\\"","review":"I liked this book because as a sometimes \\"clueless\\" male, I appreciate all the insight and help I can receive about the female energy and the intricacies of male/female relationships.

Kind of an indie-pop, alternative rock sound without reaching the nadir of either.

This 2006 version, along with having much more professional-looking DVD menus, may have better picture quality during the film, though -- at least it's easier to read the end credits on this version (and if they re-rendered the movie at higher quality and it took more space, that could explain why many special features were cut)."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont believe the hype...","review":"I should've took video of this so you could see but I bought six of these and in less than a week the rubber started peeling off the cone. 1000watts sike!!!

Yet, neither of us could find a use for this silly twisted piece of junk :( Maybe we're just not smart enough to use it correctly? But unlike the 5-star poster who keeps one everywhere, our clip sits in the junk drawer. It was difficult to insert into a book, it was NOT easy to turn a page, and my daughter and I both agreed that if we just wanted a book opened to a single page (the Bible? a Cookbook w/ one good recipe?) for an extended period of time then maybe this will work. But for active reading in comfort... nope. It's junk in our opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Item arrived used, not new","review":"This item does help with keeping small and large paperback books open and stable, and it is particularly useful for paperback cookbooks. Because the product does what it says, I gave it two stars. I ordered this product 'new'. Unfortunately, when the item arrived to my house, the packaging had already been opened, and the clip was clearly used multiple times. The protective coating was absent from the two bottom prongs as well as from the top arch which touches the edges of the pages. The entire reason I went with this more expensive clip was because reviews suggest that the protective coating is necessary to prevent page tearing. I recommend the product, but not buying it from this particular seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORTHLESS, NOT a Stand, must balance book to stand up on spine, It's an OVER-GLORIFIED PAPERCLIP","review":"DO NOT ORDER! WHAT A WASTE! THE WORD \\"STAND\\" SHOULD NOT BE USED IN THIS DESCRIPTION!!!!!This clip \\"and stand\\" is merely an over-glorified paper clip and works only to assist in balancing the book to stand directly up on its own spine (perpendicular to your surface, with no reading angle) and it is impossibly annoying to turn the pages. The book will pretty much be standing straight up (making the bottom half of the page difficult to read), and every time you turn the pages you have to take it off and put it back on and THEN rebalance the book to stand on the desk. You are better off using a black binder clip to simply hold the page in place, because this is ALL this piece of junk does!WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book clip holder I've tried","review":"I love these things - they're the only book holders I've found that reliably hold open both paperbacks and large books, and they don't take up a ton of space. I've tried similar products by other companies, but they tend to be flimsier. I agree with the other reviewers that the coated ones are better than the uncoated metal ones (which leave smears on the page). It does take a bit of trial and error to determine how many pages to trap in the clip - if you have too many, it's hard to move it up and down to release the next page. Once you get that figured out, it's easy to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"As others have said, this thing is pure junk.

Amazon responded by forwarding my email to the service company and them sending me an email stating that the service contract would on its way within days. I had to send many emails to the service company before it was finally sent. Luckily the MP3 play did not brake during that time. At one point I tried to cancel my service contact as I had not received it yet, but found that canceling it was so complicated that I was never successful at getting it canceled. Of course there is no phone number to talk to a person; all I ever got was an automated response system that kept my running in circles.

For example, my HDMI connection stopped working with my Samsung and the repairman said this doesn't happen unless you broke it (very rude).

I have known Frank since highschool and he sounded just as good then as he does now. The first time the school heard him sing it was for the Cristmas program. He sang \\"This Christmas\\" by Danny Hathaway. Danny was reincarnated that day! The auditorium was stunned to silence, then broke into applause. This was a preview of what was to come.Most music today sounds manufactured. This is not the case with this cd. I was totally impressed but not suprised at the pure and refreshing R&B; sound of his cd. He actually talks about love. This is what r& b truly is about.His rendition of \\" His Eye is on the Sparrow\\" was second to none.

But it's better than that -- he is the Donnie Hathaway of today's generation -- and we should treasure this work.It is definitely NOT one to sleep on -- the entire album is true to it's title, \\"Love Stories.\\" Each piece works love magic -- but my favorite (other than the \\"Wedding Song\\") is #10 -- with a chorus this powerful \\"someone who'll take time from their day and spend it with you -- one who will go to the extreme to give you love.\\"Please buy this and lift the talents of this magnificent artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved Love Stores","review":"I highly recommend this CD!

This solo project is WONDERFUL! It takes me back to my childhood where I listened to love ballads that were TENDER, INVITING and SINCERE. Nothing forced or crass which unfortunately happens to be the theme for many of today's R&B.Although there will be many comparisions to Hathaway & Stevie, with contemporary guest artists such as Brandford, Ray Fuller and others Frank still has his own style-very spiritual and jazzy. McComb's music expresses love naturally--pretty much as it happens. As he says \\"Friendship is the main ingredient for Love Natural\\". I expect to be friends with Frank McComb's music for a long time. And yes ladies....he definitely ain't hard to look at.Thanks Brandford for producing Brother McComb's album and allowing us to share his music. This music reminds me of why I married my wonderful husband. He's a breath of fresh air....."},{"rating":"2","title":"McSmooth","review":"Frank McComb has brought the best of both worlds together on this album - he successfully mixes jazz and R&B together to create a wonderful blend of tracks. I'm not a big jazz fan myself, but I love R&B/Soul. Frank's vocals and lyrics are thrilling, I just can't enough. Obviously, the guy grew up listening to Stevie Wonder and Donnie Hathaway. When you listen to him, you almost wonder if Donnie's back or something. He's incredibly smooth and has a tasty luscious tone throughout the album.I have had this album since it came out - and I'm ready for another one from him. There's no one out there really like him, except maybe Buckshot LeFonque - who doesn't have nearly as many good tracks as Frank.Great purchase for jazz fans, good purchase for R&B fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just saw 'em live","review":"I didn't get a chance to buy this album when I saw them but, let me tell you, live they put on a great show.

The limitation is that it's written using the English language, and I have found that phrases that are categorized as the same in this book are more often than not the same in the original language.

Personally, I would have been even happier if the ancient Slavic beliefs were elaborated a bit more.At times, the movie may seem a wee bit too graphic to sensitive viewers. Being born and raised in Poland, I grew up on Polish cinematography, so I'm somewhat used to the bloody battle scenes in historical films. However, I have a hunch that most viewers won't mind the other specialty of Polish film makers, the nudie scenes ;))Its historical value aside, it's a primordial \\"boy meets girl\\" story, and it has a happy ending as all proper fairytales should ;)) What can I say, I love my epic sagas...

I have a deep, longstanding devotion to St. Clare of Assisi, and the author of this book, a Franciscan priest, had a deep famliarity with all the original sources about her life. He presents a thoughtful and clear description of every important aspect of her life of devotion to Jesus Christ, as lived among the Sisters of her community at San Damiano. What emerges is a picture of a marvelous, well-balanced, and deeply charitable life -- a beautiful illustration of what authentic religious life can be. I haven't read a great many books about St. Clare, but this one is so very satisfying that I don't need another. This edition is a translation from the second French edition of the original book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Performance Fine, recording poor","review":"The music is good. The recording is listenable, but it is not as much fun to listen to because the sound is kind of distant. Often time, the noise of what is going on in the room is almost as loud as the music. It does not have much dimensionality. It is mono without much of a sense of presence. I have lots of live Monk that was professionally recorded. These recordings may very a bit in the quality of the recording, but they all sound better than this set.This set is not bad (despite the paragraph above), but is is more for completests. One thing that is interesting is that you hear the voice of \\"The Jazz Baroness\\" on the live recording introducing Thelonious Monk. It is kind of interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Time Toys Moon Board","review":"Great idea, but cheaply made. This broke about 3 weeks into using it, and there isn't a way to fix it.

So I purchased a 10 pack of CDRWs from Recording Store on 09/26/09, received them and they are fine"},{"rating":"2","title":"Genre-blending perfection!","review":"Sadly, what's going to make this book \\"not for everyone\\" is the fact that it boldly breaks away from the tired, architypical pattern followed by current drivel labeled \\"popular fiction\\". First off, the writing is beautiful--literature caliber. Tired of thin, cardboard characters and colorless narratives? Ms. Brooks deliveres a character driven story so vivid and so descriptive, the reader can't help but feel sandwiched between these two lovers as they embark on thier murderous crusade for perfect love. Never have I felt so intimately connected to a character in a novel, or so emotionally invested in a cause. And when the couple commits their unspeakably violent acts, I couldn't help but feel as if I stood beside them. Brooks' writing is that effective. This is the type of novel you pick up and don't put down until you've finished the very last page."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW...that's really all I can say...","review":"I really, really liked this movie. On the websites I've been to, everyone keeps comparing to Shark Tale. Well, all I can say is that...This rocks Shark Tale's SOCKS off!!The story could use a little touching up. The characters were at best, stereotypical, at worst horribly annoying/disgusting.But the visuals are really what make this movie worth watching. This was an amazing achievment; a work of 3D art. The animation is astounding--these characters, no doubt about it, have the illusion of life. Their faces are expressive, their clothing is astoundingly well-done, and as for the ears and hair--let's just say AMAZING and leave it at that, because I really don't have words to describe it.I think that if you like animation, you should watch this movie. If you like movies, period, you should watch this movie, but just rent it; DON'T buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light, but fun","review":"Ok, there's no big deep meaning here. It's a safe, standard cartoon for tween-agers, or maybe kids just below that age. The stereotypes are all there: and over-protected and rebellious princess (or something like), muscular and handsome hero with supergeek sidekick, and a basically good boy who just fell in with the wrong crowd. Their quest is to recover a magical gem from the mad scientist (with lab coat) who stole it.The animation is as good as any around. A few nice turns of story line save it from being boring as well as trite, but I'll let you find them for yourself. It's good entertainment for kids, but an adult should have a good book to read while this is on.//wiredweird"},{"rating":"1","title":"snurks stink","review":"I thought this would be a clever shrek-ish movie, but the kids were bored after about 10 minutes.

The script has more holes than a tank top I own. The relationships of the characters (if they may be called that) are non-existant.

It does have one really cool song on its soundtrack, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"not often pleasantly surprised","review":"It seems like the 7 1/2 minute walk to Blockbuster is rarely worth the trouble. But this movie charmed and lifted where so many others bore and disappoint. It touches the perfect amount of emotion without leaving you feeling exhausted or wired, but with a warm glow. There are some terrifically memorable scenes, including a great one involving the brothers playing the guitar together, and a classic fight scene. The model-turned-actress that plays Penny shows her limited talents, but it doesn't detract from the overall superb craftmanship of this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Edward Hopper's green","review":"\\"Twin Falls Idaho\\" is bizarre, shadowy, enticingly eerie, and more moving than it would have been if its makers had merely intended to settle for a freak show. Instead, it's something more poetic, more tantalizingly original. In its dream-like way, it says more than any film this year about identity and isolation. So pared-down yet so vivid is its flavor that you look to paintings -Edward Hopper's, say - rather than to other films for ways to describe the way \\"Twin Falls Idaho\\" speaks its language of loneliness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent First Film","review":"In comparing \\"Twin Falls Idaho\\" to the other films in its very narrow genre (indie or foreign films dealing with conjoined male twins) it shines through as being far more sympathetic to its characters. It is also pleasing the way it glides gracefully between dark humor and drama. Unlike Peter Greenaway's brilliant if lurid \\"A Zed and Two Naughts\\" (1985), this quiet little film is light and refreshing in places. It explores its characters very thoroughly, giving the audience more than just heavy-handed symbolism to consider. \\"Twin Falls Idaho\\" lacks the budget or scope of drama that made David Cronenburg's \\"Dead Ringers\\" such a treat. You must keep in mind this is a first film for the Polish Brothers and I think it shows great promise. With the success of such brother filmmaking teams as the Cohens and the Wachowskis, I think these guys have a bright future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shamelessly cool","review":"While in some ways an interesting look at a subject that has not been explored much (at all?) in film, this is one of the worst movies I have seen in a while.The script, direction, acting and cinematography are self-conscious to the point of being over-the-top. There are numerous scenes where you could say \\"ah I see that's supposed to symbolise THAT\\" - there is nothing subtle about Twin Falls Idaho, regardless of its slow pace. Everything is delivered to us with a film-school handbook about metaphors and mood lighting.People have compared the Polish brothers to David Lynch and other directors of his style. Unlike David Lynch's films, this one leaves NOTHING to the imagination. It just looks like it does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bizarre love triangle","review":"This is the first feature from the Polish brothers, but it surely won't be their last. It's a sombre, introspective, low-key film about conjoined twin brothers and their relationship with Penny, a small-town hooker with, alas, the proverbial heart of gold. In accordance with a movie convention dating back at least to Pretty Woman, model-turned-actress Michelle Hicks plays a prostitute who somehow barely earns enough money to rent a one-room apartment.The film adheres to convention in several other ways, but succeeds nonetheless, and manages eloquently to convey universal themes through characters born into the most unique circumstances. The scene of the brothers singing a duet for Penny, with cooperative guitar accompaniment, is almost magical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Once Upon a Time","review":"A lovely piece of work. This film isn't for everyone,it's too special. There will be a day when you discover the meaning, you may be young and understand this story or old and can relate to its symbolism. Your time will come. Like all good art, the Polish brothers will be dead when this movie is most appreciated."},{"rating":"2","title":"unrestricted.... is the word.","review":"This is the best compilation of Millie's work so far.

The packaging is great, too: the booklet includes an essay, complete track information, and a discography.

The best song is \\"After the Fire\\" (penned by Townshend) of course, but I really love the beauty of \\"Giving it All Away.\\" It's good to know that Daltrey is willing to try different vocal ranges and styles.

By breaking it down into parts, Mr. Dubosque is able to explain what is otherwise quite complicated subject, especially for a beginner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this drawing book!","review":"This book is part of a great series of drawing books. It has detailed drawings and easy to follow instructions. Perfect for my young artist (10 year old). Product arrived quickly and was exactly as expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful reference","review":"I used much of this book as a basis for teaching drawing to senior citizens. The clarity and simplicity did much to help them \\"see\\" what a drawing is."},{"rating":"2","title":"How to change your life","review":"Reading this practical and inspiring book was a revelation. I have suffered hopelessly alone for a long time but now I do not have to any longer. This is a road map for changing my life for the better. Now all kinds of wonderful possibilities are opening up for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fosters courage to do the hard things","review":"This book helped me develop the courage to come out of the SP closet. I wanted out despite the fact I was deathly afraid of the consequences of someone finding out I have SP. I \\"knew\\" they would find me defective and count me out. But at the same time I didn't want to keep this gut-wrenching secret from everyone because I felt dishonest. I needed to break free and tell someone . This book discussed the pros and cons and told me if I decided to come out, how I should do it. I came out to a friend I trusted and this person didn't disappoint me. Their acceptance of my SP really took some of the pressure off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye-opening book!","review":"When I was a kid, I was petrified of being judged. That fear continued to the present. Reading Diagonally-Parked, I discovered that part of the problem was that my father always criticized me and my mother was overprotective, making the world seem a scary, risky place. But more important, I discovered that I don't have to live by yesterday's messages today. I can rewrite the script for my life. I guess this is what they mean by knowledge is power. That makes this book powerful too."},{"rating":"2","title":"The answers are here","review":"For years I have sought the one cause of my social anxiety disorder. I thought if only I could discover it, my social fears would disappear. Diagonally-Parked showed me that my frantic search was dooming me to frustration and failure. Even if there were \\"one\\" cause (which there isn't), I found out that knowing it wouldn't do anything to help me function in my present life. While insight about the past is useful, it is not essential to feeling better in the present. What I need to do is work on my thoughts and behaviors as they exist now and this is what I'm doing with the help of this super book. What a big relief."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommend!","review":"Going to work has been torture for me. When a co-worker said hello I turned bright red, began to tremble and became awkward. I tried to avoid them. Everything my supervisor said to me seemed like a challenge to my ideas and my competence. I deferred to the judgment of others even when I knew they were wrong. I always felt angry, frustrated and inadequate. But now I am changing that. A whole new world is opening up for me and this book is making it possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solution-oriented","review":"I like everything about this book from its educational content and supportive approach to its humor. But what I especially like is how it focuses on coping with the vast array of SP problems. It doesn't just give us a series of principles and general guidelines then set us free to try to apply them. Instead, after it supplies the principles and guidelines, it targets the specific, fundamental problems SPs face every day and guides us as we work through each of them. This way we discover and develop solutions that really work for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Personal and Professional - Recommend","review":"I got this book because an online counselor recommended it. What sets this book apart from other books on SAD is its focus on living with SAD. It has lots of informative and interesting history and origins material, more than most other books. It has lots of good exercises, tips, lists, suggestions etc. in lots of areas. It has lots of good case histories and stories too. But it is the author's personal understanding of SAD from 22 years of living with it that she shares that makes this book invaluable for me. It makes everything else make even more sense. I know the author knows first hand exactly what I do and feel from experience. She is speaking directly to me alone. This means everything to me and helps me work on getting better."},{"rating":"1","title":"reader","review":"Way to much time spent talking about theories. The advice seem to miss the mark for me.I recommend \\"Dying of Embarrasment\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for work stress","review":"A recent survey says 61% of people believe work stress is the main cause of mental illness. I don't know about other mental illnesses, but I sure know that work stress sends my social anxiety off the charts. You're being judged all the time and your job is on the line so you're always keyed up even before you add in your problem with social anxiety. This is one reason I'm happy I found this book. It talks about what people with social anxiety need to know about work and jobs and shows us how to cope better with the stress and get what we want while we work on our social fears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of recommendations on the net","review":"I found this book recommended on a bunch of social phobia web sites. I am glad I got it because after the attack on the World Trade Center I am even more afraid to be around other people. I like how personal and helpful the book is, like showing you you're not alone in how you feel and where you can get all kinds of help, like social security disability. It tells you lots of stuff you need to know, like what you can do if you are pee shy or blush or sweat too much. I like its humor too. The author tells some funny stories about her own battle with social phobia.It is a big book and will take a while to read because it tells you everything you should know about social phobia and how to recover it from it. Some of it is technical but mostly it is easy to read and understand. It is good for information, exercises and finding help."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book Review- Author: Dr. Signe Dayhoff","review":"\\"Diagonally-Parked in a Parallel Universe\\" is the socially anxious person's bible for thoroughly understanding the disorder, and working toward recovery.It is also an imperative information tool for the support people in their lives.I find that few writers have brought to light so many of the specific personal life challenges faced by social phobia/anxiety sufferers. Dr. Dayhoff, a recovered social phobic, delivers empathetic and expert counsel for overcoming these challenges.The book delivers a message of hope: There IS a way out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good guide to making friends","review":"Reading this book is like reading my journal. I really relate to Barry's struggle of going to a singles bar then agonizing over everything. Trying to meet people and date is a big struggle for me too. I like how this book talks about what social phobics go through and need to know to get better. It details the steps in meeting people, carrying on conversations, and dating. I'm taking these small steps and seeing that maybe having friends and dating isn't impossible for me after all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful and encouraging","review":"Even though I love the title and cover because it's exactly how I feel, I bought the book because of the table of contents. I can't believe how comprehensive it is. It covers just about everything I can think of I want to know about. It talks about these things in detail not just a paragraph or two. I also like the personal but professional way the author writes. It makes me feel I know her and can trust her. I'm glad I have this book. I feel very encouraged by it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emphasizes social phobics strengths too","review":"SPs have difficulty seeing their strengths. What I like about this book is the author shows SPs the positive qualities they have from living with SP. Since SPs endure so much unpleasantness and pain with their condition, they have the ability to endure almost anything. They are stronger than they know. They are survivors. Since they mostly listen instead of talk, they are the ones who make conversations possible and make talkers feel good. Listening is a valuable and necessary skill. Since they live with loneliness almost all the time, they can handle it better than most when they have to. Throughout the book the author emphasizes SPs \\"reframing\\" negative perceptions of themselves in positive ways so they can see that they really have alot to offer. I think it is important that SPs know they are okay people and have value and positive qualities even if they have SP. I want to thank Dr. Dayhoff for making this very important point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Increases self-confidence","review":"In addition to my fear the biggest problem I have in social situations is my lack of confidence. I always seem to do things wrong and feel like a fool. Well, that was how I felt BEFORE I started to read this book. No matter what topic the book is talking about it shows you how to gain confidence in yourself. You may be learning the ins and outs of effective job hunting but at the same time you're building confidence in yourself to do it. A little bit at a time piling up your small successes you begin to feel you really can accomplish things. It spurs you on and makes the next step easier. This book is definitely a winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this book!","review":"Do not buy this book at all! I bought this book looking at the stars rating listed on the site. But it actually causes the anxiety to increase. Because the ways of overcoming given here are not realistic and cannot be used directly. For example the book just says that you need to dress well, listen to what other person is saying, do not worry, do not get scared etc. Even I know I don't wanna get scared and worry but I just can't help it! It comes naturally. Trust me, the only thing that works is The 20 tape CBT series by Dr. Richards. Its the best money you'd ever spend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhelpful","review":"I think this book misses the mark by equating social phobia(SP)with social skills and advising sufferers of SP of techniques to use in social situations. Social phobia has nothing to do with social skills; i suffer at times from social phobia and people generally describe me as being relaxed and natural in social situations. In fact, when I tell them of my problem they don't believe me. Inside however, I am a wreck and dread many situations, imagining I am going to act hysterically and go out of control. Books like this, in my opinion, misrepresent the condition for people who don't have SP but would like to understand it. For those with SP, it is not helpful either - I recommmend seeing a doctor or a psychotherapist who is well versed in cognitive techniques, not a book about what to say at a party. If you are simply nervous at parties and don't know how to act, that is NOT social phobia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Info - Different Package","review":"All the books in the world can't change a chemical imbalance in your brain. I have a bookshelf full of thistype of material and tried for 10 years to \\"cure\\" myself.The answer was far simpler....SSRI drugs.I resisted for years. Drugs?! No way, they're for nuts.Now I can see that as one of the multitude of bad thoughts I had when I was perpetually anxious.Talk to your doctor, not your bookseller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Need for this book is worldwide","review":"Since social anxiety is international, I hope this excellent book is translated into every language so everyone who needs it can benefit from it. It would be a shame and a great loss for them not to be able to access its expert knowledge and sage wisdom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Divinely inspired","review":"For this book to be so helpful to so many in desperation and pain from the debilitating disorder of social anxiety the author must have been Divinely inspired. This book is a gift from the Almighty. Thank you, Dr. Dayhoff, and God bless you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great self-help","review":"I have used this book since last August and see improvement in lots of areas, like talking to sales clerks and people at work and meeting new people. I was always too scared to meet new people or go to the mall or parties. I did not know what to say and knew I would come across sounding stupid. That is not as big of a problem now because this book shows me how to control my panic and gives me things to say. I really like how it shows me what my strengths are and how to build on them and reminds me to praise myself when I do something right. I never believed I did anything right before. I think this is an excellent book which can be used by itself or with therapy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good if you're really serious about recovery","review":"If you want a small simple book on SA/SP this isn't it. This isn't a book you read in an afternoon. It isn't a few pages on SA/SP and a handful of exercises. It's 408 pages! This book says it wants you to know everything you need to know to be successful in recovering, like preparing for recovery. At first I thought who needs this. Get on with the exercises. But it became clear to me as I read why more understanding of SA/SP and preparing gives you a better chance at getting better. Now I think this is a very smart book because of how it makes you think and works with ALL the big problems us SA/SPs suffer from."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything you need in logical steps","review":"Good book. Technical but easy to read. Funny and touching. Author really has her fingers on the pulse of what people with social anxiety go through and what they need. I like the step by step method and life-strategy approach which helps me with so many issues other books don't. It's not just an exercise book. I am relaxing and controlling my arousal, seeing positive changes in how I look at things and act on them. The change feels good. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Focus on social effectiveness is on target","review":"I like how this book focuses on the need for social effectiveness training for people with SP. I don't know whether I don't have these skills or they are rusty from lack of use, but I know for sure this kind of help is essential for us SPs to get better. Everything we do requires us to be socially effective. Therapy or drugs alone is not enough. This is an informative and highly useful book I hope all SPs read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good job!","review":"I can't believe how much useful material this book covers. I wanted to go on antidepressants for my SAD but found them too expensive. This book remedied that. It told me where to find free medication programs. It also told me how to apply for Social Security Disability Insurance and what to look for in my insurance coverage for therapy. I like how all the practical things I need to know to get on with my life are here. This book has everything and more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big achievement","review":"It means everything to me to learn that I'm not the only one who feels like this. Millions of others do too and this feeling has a name - social phobia. While professionals are learning how to treat SP, I am learning as well with the help of this important and exceptionally useful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ab Fab!","review":"Don't read this book because it has everything you need and want to deal successfully with social phobia. Read it because it's smart and funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok to be basic but not that way","review":"isnt a good book, cause even the basic is out of this book, ahrd to get it, the exemples are no clear and you get tired of it in few minutes, what the science use to call; lazy brain. but if you want try it dont blame me later , cause i told you so"},{"rating":"2","title":"an infamous musical genre taken seriously","review":"Oi! A Sweeping epic not only of punk music but of the British political and social culture from which it arose and the culture it left in its wake. Savage uses the Sex Pistols' very brief but very bright existence to chronicle the story of the punk genre. told in painstaking detail, England's Dreaming covers everything from the life of Malcolm McClaren to the inner workings of the band (including the tragic Sid and Nancy story) and its impact on popular culture and music. England's Dreaming elevates punk from its notoriety into a serious (if hated and controversial) art form and critique of modern culture. Savage manages to keep the personalities front and center, and walks the reader through the punk movement in all its fame and infamy. A must-read for any serious student of music. Book contains many photos and documents, and an appendix and discography which are very helpful for further research."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an overview of Britpunk.","review":"Horribly padded. No narrative flow. Not an overview of Britpunk. Just 540 tedious pages devoted to the short career of the Sex Pistols with an occasional paragraph on other bands. Check out \\"Riot of our Own\\" and \\"Rotten\\" first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its Long winded and boring.","review":"Its long winded and boring (it does pick up after the first 150 pages...) If you really really really love the sex pistols, and are obessed with tiny little facts about their manager, and their lifes, then this book is for you. If want to know more about the punk movement, anarchy and beyond don't read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An epic, definitive documentation of the era","review":"Awesome overview of mid-70s punk. The best thing is how it imparts a sense of the hysteria of London 1976-77: The chapter on the chaotic June '77 Sex Pistols boat ride, taken from the author's diary, is downright gripping (he was on the boat!), painting this period as the pinnacle of all the madness (and the book).Credit is deserved for tracing the lineage of punk, plus all the criminally overlooked concurrent scenes (No Wave, Cleveland punk) as well as the psychological underpinnings of it - though an Electric Eels lyric quoted sums it up better than any sociologist could.What's unfortunately lacking is the musical aspect of it, and the US proto-punk bands (Stooges, MC5, etc.). Take this as a vivid, complete picture of a vital moment in England. I've read this several times, and it still gives me the thrill of history being made with each passing day of the Pistols' existance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this series unless you have a special interest in the Sixties","review":"Save the Last Dance for Me by Ed Gorman features Sam McCain a 24 year old attorney/private investigator who comes up way short as a hero. The story is set in a small Midwestern town and involves a religious cult, some snakes, two murders, and a lot of unbelievable events. It is all a muddle and not worth reading especially since there are really good mystery series and authors such as Elmore Leonard, Lawrence Block and several others. The year is 1959 and the sub-plot features an upcoming visit by Vice-President Nixon who of course is running for president against John Kennedy. At the end, after a highly improbable solution to the murders, Nixon comes and plays volley ball in a suit and wing tipped shoes. If you must, get it from the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"A History of Kingman County 1871-1969","review":"I found no fault with this order. It was delivered by the time they said it would and was in good condition. It would have been helpful to me if it told a little more what the book was about. I was interested in Biographical material and there was not much of that. I was glad to be able to find the book for our library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Primary Sources of 20th Century American History","review":"This book does a nice job of giving primary sources that present opposing perspectives of the same event. For example, the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany is told by a young Nazi soldier, a young Polish boy, and an American girl (who saw the Poland exhibit at the New York City World Fair close). However, there is no argument in favor of Nazism here; the young Nazi soldier looks back in horror on the war.For WWII, this book also does a nice job of hopping back and forth between events in Europe and events in America before Pearl Harbor, showing American isolationism in action.The photos make it worth buying the hardback book over the paperback series. I own both. The paperbacks' formatting is hard to follow where the primary sources begin and end, whereas the hardback edition is well done visually."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be titled: A Dark Review of The Century","review":"This book has interesting photos but the overall message is extremely negative. Why would anyone want children to read a book that focuses only on the worst events of the times? My wife bought this for our kids and being a history buff I quickly snatched it up for review. Thank goodness! It portrays the worst of humanity and is not appropriate for kids.

The TV was delivered by Eagle Freight in great condition with no signs of shipping abuse and it was clear that it had come directly from Sony through an Amazon shipping hub in Nevada. The price was as good as I have found and I am very happy with the purchase through Amazon. I have not had any of the clouding issues that some people have reported and the one at the local Best Buy and Circuit City don't seem to have it either.

I have not tried the setup for the color yet, but the delivered basic has a slight red shift, but nothing terrible. What really stud out for me hen I evaluated this TV along side others is the crispness of the blacks and the detail in low light scenes. Of course, the colors are remarkable.

It's a manageable size and weight for a 46\\" set. It has 2 HDMI inputs and it would be nice at times to have 3.The color balance right out the box was good, it only required a little fine tuning. Everything looks good on it, regular cable, standard DVD's and BluRay 1080p discs. I have it hooked up to a TIVO 3 HDDVR and a BluRay player.

I had professional installation on the wall using a universal wall mount from Mustang.The 2 HDMI and component inputs were enought to connect all my peripheral equipment.The clouds are very apparent, but I dont see them to be a hindrance from a practical standpoint.

There is no excuse for this when you are spending this kind of money on a TV. Eagle (shipping company) is picking up the TV and I am getting a refund. I went ahead and ordered the Samsung 46 S4695d.

I was very pleased with version 2.0 although it had it's short comings.The Ugly is the time it takes this program to launch and to switch from organizer to editor. Every time you launch the program it tries to log onto the internet. Even when offline!The Bad is the Help system. There is very little information provided and you have to go online to get help! Does Adobe think all computing is done while we are connected to the internet.The Good is certainly worth waiting for. Improved cropping tool, healing tool and my favorite a one click red eye correction that really works. Despite the Bad and the Ugly I think this is a tool you need if you are working with digital images.

Laughably bad. Try reading the dialogue aloud...Overall, I found \\"Chasers\\" to be frustrating to read, found myself grinding my teeth in parts.

The tape stays on for 8 days and then is removed to let the ears exercise for a couple of days before putting them back up. Removing the tape before trying this product was a long slow process and not at all enjoyable for the dog. Another Doberman owner told us about the Hollister product and we gave it a try. We are super pleased with the results and can't believe how easy it is now to remove the adhesive tape. It just peels right off after letting the remover soak for about 10 seconds on the tape. If you let the product soak for too much longer it will just evaporate and is not as effective.Overall I would give this 5 stars and the only reason I am giving it 4 stars is that it is expensive for the small amount of product that you get in a can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland","review":"Orleans.

However, approaching Lyn Hejinian's My Life, I was hoping in fact for something more along the lines of a classical narrative, something that was decidedly missing in as I turned the pages. I was able to understand that she had a couple of kids, but seemingly never had sex.Quite honestly, I have no idea what Hejinian's life was like, and this novel/poem/chap book obscures any understanding that I might want to know, as the assertions in My Life are vague, repetitious, and quite frankly uninteresting."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor product","review":"I didn't expect this to be a long-lasting product, but I did expect to be able to use it more than 3 times before it broke.

I was NOT disappointed. This Book is TERRIFIC!! Neil Gaiman's short story \\"A Study in Emerald,\\" alone is worth my money. Gaiman was able to capture Sherlock Holmes in a different light and still stay true to the character (that story had a lovely twist at the end).Most of the other stories are also wonderful with maybe one or two that lose the Holmes feeling to them. I like how Holmes was able to accept the possibility of other worldly creatures through the use of logic and deduction and that he knew of cults because cults are the cause of many a small murdering sprees and one has to keep up with that kind of information.I read the entire book in a span of three days and just devoured everything in it. This book made me want to go and read other Holmes pastiches!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing collection","review":"Maybe my hopes were just too high for this one. It sounds like a great idea, but I have to agree with Cyberalchemist. Holmes in no instance ever confronts the weaknesses in his deductive system, which is where the real drama should lie. Instead, he displays a ridiculous erudition concerning all things Lovecraftian, which makes for a series of predictable, boring denouements. Some of the stories are decent reads, but reading them one after another gets tiresome. No points for guessing how many times Holmes' cocaine is mentioned either. I think every single author had to throw that one in there, whether it was pertinent to the story or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantasic!","review":"I am often leary of collections that combine two of my favorite \\"universes\\" in literature, but this worked better than I could have hoped.Facing the ultimate empiricist with the ultimate unknowable has produced a series of tales that kept me reading long after I should have been abed. A few did not satisfy (one involving Irene Adler instead of Holmes, another more about Vlad Tepes than HPL, for example), but overall, this collection was fantastic in all senses of the word.Anyone who is a fan of both Doyle and LOvecraft will be very well served with this collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"great fun","review":"I enjoyed most of the stories, although admittedly they weren't all so great, but even if they had almost all been terrible I would still recommend this book, for the sake of Neil Gaiman's \\"A Study in Emerald\\", which I have reread more times than I can or care to count. it has a brilliant twist ending that leaves one totally in awe of the author. it is by far the best in the collection. However, even the worst ones can be endured, and if nothing else, laughed at.

Though I'm still wondering where the bathrooms were on the Jupiter-2. Season 3 has some over the top campy episodes. Like a couple other reviewers mentioned, the Robinsons finally spent some time quality in space rather than stranded on some rock. The episode where Dr Smith becomes a grooovy hippie is a hoot. One of the best things about season 3 is the hip new theme music during the opening credits...far out man!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this is a fun season","review":"Yes the show was still campy but the Robinsons finally get to do a little space traveling.

My QUESTION: I boguht this set a year ago---does anyone know if they reissued better quality prints of Season 3 LIS? I would buy an updated copy if they improved the quality. Also--a few people noted that \\"edge enhancement\\" was overused. That is TRUE--but thta is not the main reason the prints are bland, flat, and not crisp. the real reason was stated by another reviewer who had the knowledge that FOX did not strike PRINTS in the 80's, rather they made some sort of \\"internegative\\" that needed visual enhancements to look good--in any case--it meant the visuals are flat and look out of focus. As others stated. Season 3, volume one hasd some of the BEST episodes of the whole series--it's not fair to have them released so poorly!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING WARNING!

The recipes are unusual, yet the ingredients are readily available.

Make sure you try the dried cranberry/walnut variation - it can become quite addictive!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst 50!","review":"I am a great lover of biscotti, especially since I have to watch my sugar intake. Because biscotti can be expensive, I decided to make this simple cookie and have quite successfully. However, this book is not the book to buy if one wants biscotti of good texture and taste. I remade one recipe (Almond Biscotti) and tried two others (Coconut Biscotti and Milk Chocolate & Honey) to see if I made a mistake or preferred another flavor, but none of them were worth the effort. They were dry and too hard. The recipes I found on-line and in magazines were much better. I'll try another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Best 50 Biscotti Recipes","review":"Both my Mom and I bought a copy of this book, because I love biscotti's. I've made them before and have always had great luck. But I made two recipes from this book. Both were so bad tasting that I threw the biscotti's and the book out.

In her poem \\"Jury Selection,\\" she describes herself standing in front of a judge and being asked if she's \\"ever had reason/ to doubt the integrity/ of a police officer.\\" She proceeds into a simple and sparse narrative, describing a tense encounter between her sister and a sheriff on the side of an empty stretch of highway. In the space of a stanza, Clough creates a picture of absolute fear and helplessness before authority- all the stronger for the fact that the reader never finds out exactly what happened. You just learn that Clough is \\"excused with cause.\\" This would be the metaphor that best fits this talented writer. She speaks her truth plainly, unflinchingly, and emerges victorious."},{"rating":"1","title":"The \\"personality,\\" not the musician","review":"As an example of celebrity biography, this book is passible; it, at least, held my interest enough to allow me to finish it. Unfortunately, I had picked the volume up with the hopes of gaining some insight into Steve Earle as a musician and songwriter, not a mass of gossip about a person who happens to be a musician and songwriter.St. John amply demonstrates the shortcomings of a journalist's approach to biographies: the facts are--these, as noted in other reviews here, not being well checked--presented sans interpretation or insight and there is nothing to be gained from this book that could not be gained by reading sundry articles by other journalists.The author, again as noted in other reviews here, clearly is a fan and just as clearly does not seem to know much either about music per se or the specific traditions Steve Earle fits into and is in the process of transforming.Don't throw the book away if someone gives it to you, but don't bother buying it, either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Near death is right","review":"There is stuff in this book I doubt Earle remembers, but it's to his credit that he has survived to become the vital artist he is.

I did not expect to see anything exceptional when I turned it on since it was only hooked up to an inexpensive amplified indoor antenna. The analog channels were unwatchable but then I ran the auto program to find digital channels. The TV was able to find 20 or so HD and digital broadcast signals in the area which are as clear and clean as any you will see in the big store showrooms. We only use the kitchen TV to watch the local network affiliates and with the exceptional reception this TV produces, I am in no hurry to arrange a cable hookup."},{"rating":"1","title":"That's a Pickup Truck?","review":"I have been looking for a black pickup, similar to the one we own, for our 3 year old grandson. I was amazed that the orange box I thought it was displayed in, was actually part of the toy. I admit it looks sturdy but the appearance is VERY unrealistic. I've shared my misconception with several people and they all agree, it looks like it's sitting in its packaging. Oh well, it has been good for a laugh and I hope Henry won't care. What was Tonka thinking?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Money well spent","review":"I absolutely loved this book. It was a required book for a personal finance course I took at when I was a freshman in college. It along with another required book The Millionaire Next Door by Thomas J. Stanley, William D. Danko, really helped me put saving and investing money in a new perspective. It is true that the book could have been a little more in depth and I don't agree with their take on debit cards, but all in all it is a good starting point for anyone who would like to better manage their money, or anyone who needs a little help getting their finances in order. It offers practical advice that you can put into use immediately to help you get back on the right track."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time on this","review":"I found this book to be disjointed and not helpful at all. There are much better books out there on money management. My favorite so far is \\"The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need\\" by Andrew Tobias."},{"rating":"2","title":"College book, messages for everyone","review":"I was required to read this book for one of my graduate classes and enjoyed the format and topics. The variety of authors and perspectives is interesting, and even though it talks down to the read in some of the section introductions, the overrall message becomes clear: the systems in place that support racism and bigotry are large and well supported, but you can still do something starting with your most important asset- you."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG disappointment","review":"I just wanted to do a review of this cd to hopefully warn other potential buyers who may have been hoping for more of the same from what Shark Island previously delivered with Law of the Order. I'm not going to go into a lot of detail but there is only one song which I beleive holds up against that exceptional cd which is the song Go West. I got Law of the Order due to reading so many good reviews written about it and I wasn't disappointed. Most of the songs were good and I really liked Richard Blacks vocals. The songs here don't have the same catchy hooks, the production has no guts whatsoever, and Blacks vocals sound like he's either shot his voice out over the years in between or like he's not trying. Perhaps the songs aren't as good because they didn't have the help that they had with most of them on Law of the Order. I don't know, but this was a huge disappointment and I certainly gave it plenty of plays to see if it would grow on me. It didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice follow up to Law of The Order","review":"Zeppelin never put out a great follow up to II,Savatage had a hard time trying to match Hall of the Mountain King,my point being that some bands just put out a debut that will never be matched.This second outing from Shark Island is solid from first track to last.It at times sounds like Law of The Order but with a slightly more blues feel.It rocks hard also and I think the first reviewer should give it another spin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"In brief, this cd's nowhere near the quality/coolness of the original album. I realize as people grow/mature, styles change. However, the band should've stuck with the formula that brought them some success the first time around.I tried to like this cd, but couldn't bear to listen to it more than 3 times before it got filed away with the rest of my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"ANOTHER GREAT EXPERIENCE","review":"AS ALWAYS, THINGS WENT SMOOTH,FAST DELIVERY, SUPER NICE ITEM AT A GREAT PRICE,GREAT SELLERS, THAT'S WHY I SHOP USING AMAZON WEB SITE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Book with a lot of Big Ideas","review":"This book is wonderful at explaining the ideas presented in the Tanach.

I found it more textbook like than other histories, and was at times somewhat disjointed, and the author tended to make sweeping generalizations about the quality of artistry on various albums; however I found the book to have much useful information in it, and as I have been an avid listener to Jazz, Progressive Rock, and Jazz-rock for many years, I was happy to see that someone had undertaken the task of writing a book with this much detail. At times I found the book to be difficult to read but it was worth the effort. The sad thing about books about music is that the book form is very limited in its ability to make a point. This book would make a good companion textbook in a college course,with accompanying audio and video files, or would possibly be a decent outline for a documentary series on Jazz-Rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, perfectly pitched","review":"I bought this book for an overall understanding of BI without wanting a deep dive into the technicality of the technology.

This DVD is like an SNL spoof! I could not believe that they were actually trying to be serious. Then, to top it off, the next guest he brings on is a woman who calls herself an \\"urban mermaid,\\" who sings some hippie song at the end. They are all about promoting their personal websites and just being as strange as they can be. I actually lent this DVD to others just because they couldn't believe it could really be THAT weird...but we are all in agreement that IT IS!

It is well worth buying the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bit Slanted Toward Popular/PC History","review":"My only complaint is what's in the title of my review. The history here is not groundbreaking but it is more than just the standard basics. Someone with a background lacking in historical knowledge can benefit from this book, and anyone who enjoys reading about history will be at home here. Nice brush-up for those who feel they'd like to update what they know in this subject.

Not having a scholarly type of interest in history, I found this book to be educational and fun to read. History is a very dry subject for most people and the author's humor was very entertaining. If you are looking for material for a dissertation, go to the library. Pick any history book because they all contain the same information.

He also talks about people and events that are not (at least in my opinion) very important in the big picture of U.S.history.

On many occasion you have to laugh out loud at the way some of it is presented. My 8 year old kid started reading the book after seeing me have such a good time. The book is also intriguing. The author points out that native Ameicans probably crossed over into the Americas from Asia into the US across what today would be Alska. It also seems intuitive when you look at a map of the Western united states and the Pacific. He then goes on to point out that the Majority of native Americans today have a completely different blood-type from most Asians today which strongly indicates the presence of other groups in the Americas during the same period."},{"rating":"2","title":"U.S. History for Dummies","review":"Good Book. I is very detailed with the necessary fact about US history that I require.Thanks"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Biased","review":"Potential readers should know that this book presents US History from a far-left viewpoint. For example, the author suggests that the British held the moral high ground during the Revolutionary War and that the colonists were lucky to win, and that the colonists were primarily a group of incompetent zealots who wanted new territory in which to practice their bigotry and intolerance. He even fringes on being revisionist when he subscribes to the very obscure notion that Davy Crockett didn't really die in defense of the Alamo. The author states early on his view that American history as we know it has been too heavily influenced by writers of European ancestry, and that his is an effort to \\"set the record straight\\".I feel that it's inappropriate to title and market this book as an objective and unbiased book on US History.

The Visual Quickstart model is well-applied, but only to simple things such as opening files, setting tabs, formatting chart elements, etc. I believe the shallowness is due to its attempt to cover Word, Excel, Powerpoint, and Entourage in a 398-page volume. A VQG for each module would probably have the space adequately to cover the capabilities of the software. Questions I had from using Powerpoint for several months were not answered.I can only recommend this Guide to those who have never touched a Microsoft Office component before.

As others have done, I will have to cut the opening to make it work. It would be really handy if both Amazon and the manufacturer provided the dimensions including the opening size so we know in advance. Simply saying this model suits your car is total rubbish. It's really not worth my time to ship this back to the U.S from Australia. I will stick to Ebay for parts in the future, much easier to get information from the seller.

Unlike its sister shows (X-Files, Millenium), The Lone Gunmen was a refreshing contrast, offering a more buoyant take on the conspiracy genre.The only really disappointment about this show is that it was cut short, ending in a cliffhanger (that was thankfully resolved in the last episodes of X-Files). It's really a treat to see what the Gunmen are up to when they're not giving Mulder or Scully the assist and this series helps to explain why they do what they do.All in all, while this is required viewing for those wanting to experience the complete X-Files story its also a good, fun way to get introduced to it as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, great show!","review":"The transaction was quick and easy, arriving on time and in perfect condition.

Once you get them loaded-up, the various plastic cradles and straps do a nice job of holding everything in place.

The instrumental at the end entitled Here On Earth Score Suite is interesting, but kind of sounds out of place.

We measured just to be sure. It's one thing to be short on one board but two!? Yes, the top board that went across the top was also too short. We double checked the instructions to make sure we were matching all the correct parts and we were. I was unable to assemble the headboard correctly due to errors made by the manufacturer.

You will end up with TOO many holes! It doesn't show you where the screws should go or what side, and It is easy to make a mistake or 2. If it was more clear I would have been more satisfied.

First, the good: There are a couple of wonderful selections here, including Gene Autry's Rudolph and the absolutely beautiful Arbolito. I'm Gettin' Nuttin' for Christmas is also good. (That's why I gave it the two stars.)However, many of the selections seems very un-Christmas-like, PARTICULARLY The Takeover Before Christmas, which appears in the middle of the cd. This is a totally inappropriate and out-of-place selection that ruins the flow of the entire cd, in my opinion.

This is not a male-bashing book, it's not about what men have done to women or society. Instead it's about what has happened to men, how culture and society have affected men in ways they may not recognize and/or control. This idea alone must offend some. As I've seen other reviewers accurately mention, several angry people are reviewing a book they've not read, and speaking with a big chip on their shoulders. It's an interesting study, thought-provoking. Relax."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say \\"Dull\\"?","review":"This book belabors every lame point it tries to make.

I can't believe that this author has won a Pulitzer."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Was Horrible!","review":"This book was terrible. Faludi puts up a sympathetic front, but only to cover her man hating feminist roots. She ends up blaming everything that she portrays as man's problems on men. The same thing feminists have been doing for women's problems for years. This book is a propoganda campaign at best. A reaction to the growing men's rights movement. Things have gotten so bad for boys in this country that no one is buying the feminist's girls are the shortchanged gender in schools studies. Stiffed is a desperate attempt by women like Faludi to keep the blame spotlight off themselves. Faludi makes generalizations about Vietnam Vets that she should really be ashamed of. Is it any wonder that the men portrayed in this book have been writing to their local papers complaining about how Faludi protrayed them in their book? Faludi has not left her man hating days behind her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Are the times finally changing?","review":"I read a review of this book on the opinion page of today's Seattle P-I.I haven't read the book yet, and I tend to be wary of highly touted books written by vocal feminists. But it's refreshing to see a glimmer of hope that perhaps someone is finally listening to us.Like the wild salmon of the Columbia, we quiet, hard-working WASP males may well turn out not to be the limitless, resilient, infinitely-tappable resource we seem on the surface.Vilifying us doesn't really help you, and it certainly doesn't help us. Perhaps it's time for us all to go back and read our Eric Fromm more carefully now. (With the lullabies of Steve MacDonald, Enya and Loreena McKennitt playing nearby..)

It makes all the difference in the world.-dubhghall"},{"rating":"2","title":"The other side of the page","review":"An unfortunate aspect of feminist criticism is the belief that no man can possibly have any meaningful insights into what it means to be a woman. It's reassuring, in an odd way, to find that many masculinists (a word that our society seems to need more and more) have the same knee-jerk reaction to a woman's book about men.Rather than drawing generalized conclusions about the state of masculinity today, Faludi focuses on individual stories. She examines the belief held by many men that they're somehow being victimized by the monolithic forces of Feminism, then puts forward the argument that maybe, just maybe, the real problem is that being male is no longer a automatic guarantee of privilege.Perhaps, rather than trying to pin the blame on women, American men might better put their efforts into moving ahead in the society they've done so much to create."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately, only a nice try.","review":"Ms. Faludi creates a work that is in dire need of editing. In the more than six-hundred pages of generalizations and patronizing prose Ms. Faludi leaves no question answered. She poses roundabout theories with serious flaws in their premises and moves on to more convoluted thesis.Recently I attended a lecture by Ms. Faludi. In the hour and a half that she lectured and answered questions, she did not tighten her loose grasp of what she tries to discuss and ultimately prove. Unimpressed with her performance I had anticipated a clearer explaination of her analysis and conclusions in her book. Utterly disappointed.Authors who recieve $1 million by their publisher before printing make me suspicious as to the truth of the hype and media attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly researched","review":"The topic of this book could have made for a great work if the author had done comprehensive and objective research. Faludi interviewed a very narrow section of the male population to apparently confirm many of her own preconceived notions about men and what makes them unhappy.For those interested in the topic, the book Real Boys is infinitely more insightful and meaningful to those who want to understand men and boys."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Research\\" goes \\"Tabloid\\"... Truth gets Stiffed","review":"How sad. Authors now have a few conversations with a few human subjects, jump to conclusions that appear to mesh with ther prior preconceptions, and then peddle the whole mishmash as some sort of social science \\"research.\\" For each of the troubled men Faludi describes in this book, I can easily think of a dozen or more who have faced similar circumstances in very different ways, and have very different views on the matter. I guess these men just don't count, since Faludi has not graced them with her supposed journalistic saavy. I am a social scientist by profession, and this is definitely not social science.

As bad as the vaporous Robert Bly and his many imitators are, however, they are paragons of clear-mindedness compared to Susan Faludi. Faludi has stitched together a couple of dozen dreary overlong magazine profiles of an assortment of oddball losers and is now trying to pass the results off as an assessment of men today. This is lazy, but even worse are her Marxoid yearnings for the days when men earned their living in overalls, their faces smeared with coal dust, swinging a sledgehammer. Collecting hardluck stories from gay porn stars isn't reporting. Emptying a reporter's notebook onto a page isn't writing. Fantasizing about the return of John Henry isn't social criticism. At bottom, Susan Faludi's problem is that she mistakes sloganeering for thinking and that she's too wrapped up in her obsolete ideology to notice the difference between the two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shows an odd attitude toward her subject.","review":"What if a male journalist were to write a 600-page book that focused on interviewing Leona Helmsley, Lorraine Bobbitt and others like them, then concluded that their complaints were the chief issues that most women face? Would women reviewers find such a book to be \\"a must read for all American adults\\"? I think not. Yet that is the essence of what Susan Faludi has done in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elegant writing, bad research.","review":"If you're going to generalize about a group of people, you need to have a sample of that group of people. Instead of a sample, Faludi selected a small number of very atypical men then used them to espouse her own views. Her previous book was truly great because it focussed on something Faludi understands: how women are misrepresented. This new book itself misrepresents.

Not only does this fail to pass some of the very basic research method rules, it manages to stumble on each of one of them.Even quanitative works like the sexuality reports by Shere Hite are beleaugered by the danger of having respondents that have strong feelings about the given subject. Based on this premise alone, the researcher might be working with a minority and should never try to generalize from such a sample. To see that Faludi has the gall to do that from the kind of face-to-face interviews she conducted is almost hilarious.A much better job is done by Christina Hoff Summers in the \\"War Against Boys\\" where she at least follows sociological threads to support her conclusions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extravangant Nonsense!","review":"Don't bother reading this well-written trash. I sold my hardcover copy to the used bookstore after reading it since I don't want it in my bookshelf. Like her previous work in the best-selling venomous feminist diatribe \\"Backlash\\", this is a mean-spirited attack on males of the species that sounds very convincing as she is describing it but never cuts the mustard as far as any kind of reasonable effort to explain what it all means. As far as I can determine, Faludi thinks all men are infantile, immature, defective, and sort of insubstantial. This is thinly veiled feminist rhetoric at best, and at worst it is soaring prose screed. Ugghh! I hated this book, and its anti-male thesis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Iron Jane?","review":"Another reviewer suggested reading Warren Farrell instead. I suggest reading Robert Bly's \\"Iron John\\" instead -- to get a line on what men think without going through a middle(wo)man. Bly said everything Faludi said, said it better, and said it ten years ago. Where has she been? Oh, right: attending men's meetings and ridiculing them."},{"rating":"1","title":"'Stiffed' refers to the purchaser of this book","review":"Faludi probably deserves credit for doggedness in gathering reams of anectdotal stories. The principal conclusions are essentially that life is unfair (now there's a surprise) and that all our fathers were imperfect men if not brutally insensitive SOBs.The book is physically a heavyweight and intellectually lightweight. As the phrase goes, this book should not be set aside lightly--it should be hurled with great force."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most important books I have ever read","review":"Susan Faludi has really gone over the top!

Instead, this book focuses on the stories of men whose stories are anything but typical, and whose complaints can easily be shoved aside by the reader.

The studio versions are overflowing with emotion and passion. But not this live dvd.And every few songs the concert is edited out and a bit of other footage is edited in for a couple of minutes. Then back to the concert. Totally took the momentum of the concert out. I hope the next one is better. It wouldn't take much to be better than this one. Will I still purchase MM cd's? You bet.

It is very dated and bizarre. My two-year old is actually showing an interest in the potty on his own and loves potty books, etc. However, he could have cared less about this video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Potty Traning Magic","review":"This video is amazing - like Potty Training Voodoo for toddlers. My kids' daycare person recommended it and had been using it for 10 years. I've known three stubborn 3 year olds who would NOT use the potty but voluntarily did after seeing this video a few times. As others have mentioned, it integrates using the potty into typical kid situations (such as the birthday party). So it is not soley focused on potty training. But I think that is why it works. Your little toddler sees the bigger kids (e.g. 4 ish) having fun at the birthday party then taking a potty break and wants to emulate them. Also the goofy songs really appeal to the 2 and 3 year old set. Highly recommended"},{"rating":"1","title":"Focused more on Party than Potty","review":"The theme of the video is Bobby's birthday. I felt like the potty topic was secondary to the party! A lot of time was wasted. I think this video would be most appropriate for kids who have almost mastered potty training, because it showed kids taking breaks from having fun in order to use the bathroom. I almost bought this video. I am so glad I just rented it from the library and didn't waste my money!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it!","review":"This is the worst! This movie is about bobby's birthday party, not going potty! Every so often they mention going potty, but really the focus is the party. Half the songs don't even relate to going potty. They sing ABC's etc....they sing about Bobby being a big boy now that he is 4 and how he does all these things, not one of the things mentioned is about going potty!We also bought Potty power....it is great! The whole dialoge is related to going potty. Much better! This movie just made me angry that I spent $20 on it. Total waste!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My son hated and I hated it!","review":"It's really boring (the images, the music, everything!!!)

It is so boring! I couldn't even get him to sit half-way through it the first time I turned it on. It's slow going and really not very interesting... not for a toddler, and especially painful to watch as an adult. I'm sorry I wasted my money on it, and I hope you don't either!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Old video, more about a birthday party","review":"I got this DVD thinking it would be good but my husband and I were very disspointed. The video tells more about a birthday party than the actual potty training process. It even has a song about a clown that has NOTHING to do with potty training!It is an old production and therefore not appealing to a younger generation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it's cracked up to be!","review":"I was disappointed in this DVD - the best thing in it shows kids lining up to use the bathroom. Much better stuff out there for potty training - like Elmo's DVD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!","review":"I have a 2 year old who always enjoys a new DVD. We were so excited about a new \\"potty time\\" video but, this really SUCKS! It's all about a 4 Year old who has a birthday party. Does not focus on Potty Time at all. A REAL WASTE OF MONEY! I would recommend \\"Potty Time with Bear\\" it really focuses on potty training and really caught my daughters attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much \\"poop\\" talk.....","review":"This video made our family very uncomfortable w/the language. If you want \\"poop\\" or \\"pee\\", this would be a terrific video"},{"rating":"2","title":"favorite","review":"Have watched this video through 4 children and still remains a family favorite. Hysterical songs you also can sing in the potty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"NOT a very good potty training video. Couldn't even hold my little one's attention for more than about 2 minutes. The dvd's theme is about Bobby's birthday, and it felt like the potty topic was secondary to the party. Waste of time and money. I think this video would be most appropriate (if you can get them to watch it long enough) for children who have almost mastered potty training since it shows kids taking breaks from having fun in order to use the bathroom. Would strongly recommend either \\"Potty Power\\" or \\"Potty Time with Bear\\" (Bear in the Big Blue House) over this one. My son loved both of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivated My Son","review":"I had a lot of trouble getting my son to Potty train. He just didn't want to. There is a song for just about every task of using the potty, both to instruct and reward. Its theme is a birthday party, what kid doesn't love that? He loved this video and learned all the songs quickly. They are all popular nursery rhyme tunes, short and easy to remember, and although I often felt silly singing in public bathrooms, it really worked. 4 years later and I've repurchased it for my 2 year old. She seems to love it too. Adults complain, and yes its rather insipid entertainment, but really its geared to 2-3 years olds, so parents, get over yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"I bought this and \\"Potty Power\\" for my daughter when we were trying to potty train. She absolutly loved Potty Power, but when we put this in, she went as far as to shut the TV off. I could not get her to watch it at all. I wish I had bought a different show."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Money","review":"We purchased two videos for our 3-year-old--this one and Potty Power. Get Potty Power instead. It does a much better job of engaging a toddler and worked wonders for him. This one, on the other hand, couldn't hold his attention for more than 2 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass it by","review":"The story had the potential to be much more inspiring,amusing and promotional of chess. It disappoints on these fronts.She is clearly a great actress as is Kline but the somewhat sombre style of the film results in a missed opportunity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch T.V. instead","review":"Not horrible, but, there are many better things to watch. I couldn't get into this movie and couldn't make myself like the main character. Who gives up their entire life (risks their job, forgets to pick their kids up at school) to play chess?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Battles","review":"An inspiring chess movie because the democratic essence of the game prevails even when overcoming such obstacles as gender and class bias. But too, the story is as much about battles of all kinds as it is about chess.We find in this film that a cleaning women's life changes because she says, \\"I exist, too. I have an interest. I will work at it because it matters to me.\\" She learns, as we all do, that if you take a risk you may lose, but if you do not take risks you will lose.Beautiful and subtle, yet appropriate, soundtrack and cinematography. Dialogue simple yet profound. Acting - spot on.Again, foreign studios seem to be outclassing LA and NY - not even close. Well, OK, we have bigger CGI effects' computers and budgets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"This is simply the best chess related film I have seen to date. Its better than Searching for Bobby Fisher in my opinion. Very well acted with a good story that can be appreciated by those who don't know a thing about chess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming, sweet-natured...and a fine movie, too","review":"When a reclusive, middle-aged American living on Corsica agrees reluctantly to hire a middle-aged, attractive woman to be his occasional housekeeper, who could guess that the result would be, not love, but chess? Helene (Sandrine Bonnaire) by chance watches a couple play chess. It intrigues her. She buys a cheap set for her husband, who has no interest. Finally, she asks Dr. Kroger (Kevin Kline) to teach her.A curious, cautious, nonsexual sort of intimacy grows as, to the doctor's surprise, she shows an aptitude for the game. Her husband thinks she's doing something beyond her class. The doctor rather thinks so, too. But all ends well, including Helene's great victory in a stuffy, male, class-conscious tournament in mainland France. Queen to Play is a most pleasant way to spend 97 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic film","review":"Excellent French film with amazing commentary about Kevin Kline and French moving making. Strongly recommend for the connosseur of French films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Great. Probably off the chart for people who actually know how to play chess. It is even better if you speak French as I do.as the French is clearer than in most French movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smile Sandrine and I shall resign.","review":"It's a French film so it can be slow at times. Bonnaire's character's chess evolution is a bit accelerated. But the chess is realistic, the story and acting is superb and... it's Sandrine Bonnaire ! If I were sitting across the board from her and she smiled once, I would resign and melt into my chair like silly putty. The extra \\"The Making of...\\" is very well done, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Foreign Film","review":"I really enjoyed this movie. It was a little dry in spots, but I like Kevin Kline and thecostar was good too. I like foreign films for a change of pace and this one was easyto follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"outstanding movie even if you know just a little bit about chess","review":"Excellent motion picture with great acting. Superbly produced with a great cast. The plot/storyline is easy to follow such that even the English subtitles were not a problem (the movie has a French audio track). The film is more about relationships and the role chess might be perceived to play in that than it is about the game itself.It is a refreshing and imaginative film with no profanity, violence or sexually suggestive scenes. What a novel concept. The film was produced on the untainted island of Corsica in the Mediterranean Sea and provides a perfect setting for this charming film. If you don't play chess you might be drawn to try it just as our heroine did in the film.Queen To Play was an unexpected treat. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry I read it","review":"I'm a mystery lover, and there are a few things we expect from mysteries. Not to be a spoiler, but this book does not satisfy. Too much is irrelevant, and the bad guys completely triumph. If you love art and creativity, get the book for that and enjoy it, but if you are a mystery lover, pass it by. It left a bad taste in my mouth and I truly wish I had not read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Journal: The Short Life and Mysterious Death of Amy Zoe Mason is no Griffin and Sabine, the Atkinson sisters are no Nick Bantock, and Simon & Schuster should stick to books that don't require a lot of design and leave the intricate, visually interesting books to experts like Chronicle Books. Not only does the rendering of the books \\"collages\\" in two-dimensions destroy what little interest they may have held, the so-called \\"clues\\" are obvious and heavy-handed. There is no mystery here, just a book that is disappointing on all levels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Journal: Short Live and Mysterious Death","review":"This is an attractive book which combines scrapbooking and mystery.The reader gleans information about the characters and plot of the story by piecing together the information in the scrapbooked pages.There is a certain satisfaction in the ending where the reader is required to use a bit of deductive reasoning based on the clues given to solve the mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, horrible execution","review":"I had such high hopes for this book because I thought the concept of a mystery playing out in a visual journal was so unique. However, there is nothing mysterious about this book. I am baffled by the reviewers who say they went back to find \\"clues\\" that they had missed. I don't understand how you could miss anything--it was all so obvious. As soon as the murderess appears you know exactly what is going to happen.And, I'm not even going to comment on those who are wondering if it is really fiction except to say that anyone can start a myspace page under any name they wish. How gullible are you?If you must read this book, get it at your local library or read it in the bookstore (it doesn't take long at all). Whatever you do, don't shell out any of your hard earned cash for this one. What a disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Looking for a Good Read? Don't Buy Journal!!","review":"My reaction to this scrapbook, which I purchased due to an extremely clever Web site promoted on Publishers' Weekly? It is scandalous that a well-known agent succeeded in marketing a series of images which is little more than an art project and that a major publisher agreed to invest on production costs. The \\"story\\" is a 20-minute read at best. I imagine someone will soon be turning it into a successful tele-film. If you like literature, don't waste your time on this so-called journal, a total rip-off which left me wanting my money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Journal: The Short Life and Mysterious Death of Amy Zoe Mason","review":"I thought this book was most interesting. The format is intriquing as it is journaled on another book. I gave it to 3 friends who loved it and in turn gave it as gifts to other friends. One of the best reviews a book can get is the readers willingness to pass it on to someone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting concept that just didn't satisfy","review":"This was an intriguing premise, finding a scrapbook/journal and then discovering what unfolds in this woman's life. The only problem is that the premise doesn't allow for a very satisfying ending. I think you're left with too many questions at the end and it just leaves you feeling unsatisfied. It only took about 30-40 minutes to read, so I suppose the time invested isn't so bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and Clever","review":"I picked this book up at the book store, and put it down. Repeatedly. I wasn't sure what it was. So I bought it! I loved it. I loved the cleverness of the whole process, the beauty of the book itself, and the mysterious storyline. I wish someone would point out all of the secret extras as I am afraid I missed some! I am giving it to a special friend of more than 45 years. She and I used to have code rings and play detective. I am sure she will love it as much as I do. Don't pick it apart! Buy it and read it just for the pure joy of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty to look at, waste of time to read","review":"I have to say, I was quite disappointed in this book. It is a beautiful book -- a quick flip through the pages promises a fun mystery with tons of places to hide a variety of clues. Unfortunately, the pages don't actually deliver on these promises and once I finished, I couldn't help wishing I could ask for my time back. On the plus side, it only took a short while to go through and, as I mentioned before, the pages are quite lovely. I feel like the Atkinson sisters had a great idea with this book but were unable to follow through to tie-in the story and the technique.I glanced at the user rating for this book here on Amazon and was quite surprised to see that it has been given 4 out of 5 stars with 38 reviews. I'm going to have to go flip through the reviews now to see if perhaps I've missed something monumental...(alas, no)."},{"rating":"2","title":"HIghly Recommended","review":"The premise of reading someone's diary was excellent and it got me hooked right away. Of course, I knew it was a book, but somehow I still experienced that note of tension as if I was reading a private diary, and that tension and the mounting feel of unease is what I want in a mystery. I loved the artwork in this book, in fact, that's what made it interesting and added a complexity to what could have been an ordinary tale. Through this art the character's emotions were laid bare on the pages and that gave the book a strong psychological angle, a visual view into a woman's innermost thoughts and insecurities. Were these fears justified? This book has the feel of graphic literature which would make it interesting to my friends who want and expect to go beyond the written word."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Dream Come True","review":"As a huge Smokie fan, this is the CD I have been waiting for during the last 25 years. There are many live CDs from the 'new Smokie' (without Chris Norman) but this collection captures the original band on the high point of their career. They were supporting their superb 'Montreux Album' but their set list is spanning their entire back catalogue at that time as well. They rock through songs like 'Needles and Pins', 'Going Tomorrow' or the great 'The Girl can't help it', and they also include great up-beat songs like 'It's your life', 'Wild Wild Angels' in addition to their more laid-back hits like 'If you think you know, how to love me' or 'Living Next Door to Alice'. The sound quality is really good and the recording sounds fresh with a good 'band/audience' balance. No matter if you are a Smokie fan or if you just like great songs performed in front of a live audience, you should definitely go and get this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super songs and lyrics","review":"I listend to it in my good friend Doru's car during our trip from the Carpathian mountains to Bucharest (July 2000). He said the group played long time ago in Bucharest and he liked it. I bought the CD and the more I listen to it the more I like it. The \\"Living next door to Alice\\" and the \\"Oh Carol\\" are the absolute best. Never heard of Smokie before but now I am after all their recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good film","review":"This is a film that originally aired on PBS as part of a series on Women, War and Peace. It is a very good reconstruction of a story that was shamefully ignored by the news media that covered the bloodier aspects of the long civil war in Liberia. Both the producer and the film maker deserve awards for bringing this story to the public.After I viewed it for the second time, I immediately started circulating it to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing story of the power of dedicated women","review":"How is it that we know so little of someone who won one of the most prestigious prizes in the world? This documentary about Nobel Peace Prize winner Leymah Gbowee from Liberia, Africa, tells the story of one woman and the movement that she inspired to bring peace to a country that had undergone years of tribal warfare, and killed uncounted husbands, sons, brothers. She refused to argue the politics, but organized women--muslim, christian, rich, poor, urban, rural--into a movement that held sit-ins, blocked access to buildings, even refused sex to their husbands until those in power began to pay attention to their demands for peace. The film is not movie-theater quality, but it tells a real story, with real people. It is often difficult to understand the dialog, so the subtitles are a necessary evil, but that's a small price to pay to learn of this amazing story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pray the Devil Back to Hell","review":"With little or no help from the international community, Liberian women had to take steps to stop the madness after a 14 year civil war. Still much need to be done but it is heading to the right direction very slowly. Recommended to those who have an interest in Liberia and Africa in general.Hans Frankfort"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pray the Devil...is a DVD worth owning","review":"This is a DVD about women and about the power of peaceful protest.

So over to Petco I went to buy the flea drops that have worked for the past 8 years.Cedarcide is simply NOT worth it considering the way it upset my dogs, not worth the money I paid, and didn't work!!!

After watching it, I looked up the soundtrack on amazon to see if it was available.Just take a look at the lineup of songs gathered for this film. That is enough by itself to buy it. Then add the creative genius of Mark Mothersbaugh. Mothersbaugh is the guy who used to be in the musical group Devo but who also did a likewise excellent soundtrack for Wes Anderson's film, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou. Seeing his name in the list of musical artists just confirmed in my mind that buying it was the thing to do. I've had the CD for about a month now and it is currently my most listened-to selection.It is easy-listening with flavorful pizazz, like a well-cooked meal. The cook knows just what spices to add and how much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darkly Comedic Sound","review":"Befitting the tight little dark comedy The Last Supper is its wonderful soundtrack. Mothersbaugh gives a sometimes eerie, sometimes amusing score that perfectly suits the tone of the film in its simplicity.The non-orignal music was also chosen well. Tracks by KC & the Sunshine Band and Shonen Knife are an ironic contrast to the dark undertones of the film and give a needed rest from the drama."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Universe Behind the Masks","review":"University of Massachusetts Professor of Physics and Astronomy, Edward R Harrison, takes the lay reader on a thought-provoking and learned journey through the epochs of humanity, and our attempt to unravel the workings and the meaning of the many universes which we have created in our image. Writing in beautiful prose, Professor Harrison reawakens us to the lives,the words and the views of the thinkers, sages and mystics of all-times. The everchanging character of the Universe as it is pictured in time, bounded by the confines of our religious and scientific prejudices, is rendered here like fine brushstrokes upon a canvas. In the finely crafted \\"Masks of the Universe,\\" Science meets History and Religion. In the Professor's words: \\"All who claim freedom of will and deny the determinism of the universe in which they live are guilty of the Pelagian heresy. I am myself a Pelagian heretic.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Shivers!","review":"Granted, this disc is not his best work, but still better than lots of recording artists, and you'll want this CD in your collection for the technical beauty of the playing and as a record of the artist's early career. Yes, you can expect a whole lot more from Jacobs-Strain down the road. Watch for his live concert collection, Longest Road I Know. I just saw him at a festival and can testify, he was brilliant solo and shined alongside more seasoned players. His covers are fresh, masterful and authoritative. And his original tunes are knockouts, combining the emotional truth of his playing with that uncanny, knowing voice and with subject matter deep beyond expectation. Want blues that send shivers along your spine? Let's hope this man expands and records his original repertoire, and, yes, buy yourself this disc as a taste of good things to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"What can I say but.....","review":"One of the most ingenious books I have ever had the pleasure of reading. \\"Seymour\\" is the perfect example of a story giving back exactly what you put into it. I believe the greatest testament to this book is that there are 2 things that I not only will never forget, but which I use almost daily. First, I believe one of my all-time favorite characters is the little grinning man in the car. To this day I see him sitting politely and grinning ear to ear. Whenever I need a laugh, I think of him. The second, and most important element is from \\"Seymour\\" and his explanation to his brother about shooting marbles. If you get excited at hitting the mark, then somewhere inside, you didn't expect to hit it. When you KNOW you can hit it, you just do it, then go on with your life. Truer words have never been spoken. Thanks for the inspiration JD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Half of it's a tough undertaking...","review":"...which doesn't make the experience any less rewarding. Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters is a complete joy...and like the other Glass stories, a fun part of the family puzzle. Seymour: An Introduction feels less fulfilling. While it provides much information that helps the Glass-family-follower, much of it seems unformed, rambling and rawly philosophical. Nothing wrong with that unless you'll feel more rewarded by an actual story in the second half of this collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total junk","review":"Totally insane! Don't expect Holden Caulfield, he's nowhere to be found. This book is just whacked out beyond belief. It's really nuts. Salinger has gone crazy and there's no plot no humor no reality.

There was nothing about him I could relate to. I'm not even sure what this book is about - It was just that awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gross indulgance","review":"This is a horrible book. This is a rant, an exercise on the way to finding character before actually writing a thoughtful novel. This is someone with a literary license to do anything he pleases. Catcher in the Rye and Nine Stories justifiably categorize Salinger as a great writer, but this is a long, dull sketch with no tangible emotion. If I wrote this, it would get published nowhere. Anyone that likes this knows nothing about writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Half of a great book","review":"Do NOT miss \\"Carpenters\\". It is one of the greatest novellas from the 1950's and Salinger is in great form for this one. It is funny, touching, beautiful. \\"Seymour\\" is a failure, though. Supposedly an introduction to a novel which never saw the light of day, it is long, boring, plotless, rambling, self-conscious and self-absorbed to the point of being a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you hang in there, it's worth the effort.","review":"I'm a longtime lover of Salinger's writing, but I've never been able to get through Seymour. I liked Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters, but I would always get bogged down in the first 20-30 pages of Seymour and stop reading it. In the beginning of the story he jumps around a lot, and his paragraphs can go 2 or 3 pages long. I always felt like I was listening to a clever and witty narrator who didn't care at all about connecting with his audience. But after getting through these first pages, I started to really like the writing. There is a great letter from Seymour to Buddy that you're bound to like if you like the emotional, family exchanges in Zooey. There are also some great sections where Buddy speaks directly about what writing means to him. They're fascinating, and you won't find a more moving discussion of writing anywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Time Machine","review":"Scents act on me like a time machine; I'm not alone, as I discovered years ago when the National Geographic, of all entities, did a survey/study on the whole phenomenon. One whiff of something and I'm practically molecularly transported to the time I unconsciously associate with that scent. WHAT does this have to do with \\"Raise High the Roof Beam Carpenters\\"? This books does the same thing to me. I've never experienced such extraordinarily atmospheric writing. Of course \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" gets all the glory, and it is certainly a strange magic carpet ride in its own right. (Happy Fiftieth Birthday, by the way, Catcher in the Rye!) Still, I wish more people knew of the incredible \\"Raise High the Roof Beam Carpenters\\". Buy this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SHOULD BE READ FOR COMPARISON","review":"While, I will grant you, this is not this author's best work, it nevertheless needs to be read, if for not other reason than comparative purposes. Lets face it, this is one of America's greatest authors, but like a baseball star, you just know you cannot hit a home run each time up to bat. That being said, I, myself, enjoyed this work. There is some very good writing here and it does need to be noted. I really do not recommend that all of Salinger's work be judged by this one particular book, but it is certainly worth the read when you put it into context with the rest of his work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Question","review":"Would someone please help me out in understanding something?

Disappointed with Nine Stories, and totally let down by Franny & Zooey, I continued on to this book. I found the first story - Raise High The Roof Beam, Carpenters - an enjoyable read. There was hope yet, and Seymour seemed to be the most (only?) interesting character from the Glass family stories; so Seymour: An Introduction would probably be the best story of them all. It turned out to be a kind of pretentious ranting by the author and all the philosophy books that he had apparently read. I was really hoping to find some of the magic that was in Catcher. The first of the two stories in this book came close to offering that, but the second one was impossibly frustrating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seymour: An Introduction? Yes. Yes.","review":"Self indulgent? Yes. Fabulous? Yes. Nobody who is railing against this installment of the Glass series can possible be a writer themselves. Look at the themes, metaphysical and otherwise, and then look at the delivery. Beautiful. And wordy. But beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"a transforming resource for parents","review":"I highly recommend this book to parents of behaviorally challenged children and to the people in parenting classes I have taught. Its approach empowered us to reach and teach our oldest son whose disabiities include autism. We received it years ago when he was in a psychiatric hospital program modeled on the book's principles. In simple, clear language, using a programmed format any parent could understand, the book teaches what really reinforces behavior, how to avoid power struggles, and how to develop habits that promote cooperation and good behavior. What worked for our son worked even better for the five children who followed him. It probably made having them possible. This is the most helpful parenting book I have ever used."},{"rating":"2","title":"ANNOINTED","review":"THIS TAPE IS SO ANNOINTED. IT'S ALL MUSIC AND HEAVILY ANNOINTED AND PEACEFUL.

No Thanks.","review":"I just finished reading this, and I'm actually a little bit mad at these guys. I didn't even mind so much that the book is a thinly veiled sales tool for their seminars and \\"mentoring\\" program. It didn't fool me for a minute, so I could take it as that...and still be open to learning something new. But I did mind that the \\"win-win\\" sales technique they are teaching people is a thinly veiled \\"here's how to manipulate people into believing you are consultatively selling.\\" (For those reading this who are not professional sales people: consultative selling is an approach that should truly end up with a win-win, where you are truly offering a product or service of genuine value to the customer.) It's also kind of crazy, since they seem to believe that this manipulative approach will result in building wealth that can then be used to make the world a better place. I agree with the later, but not the former."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your time - Infomercial for their mentorship program","review":"I found this book insulting at times.

I did learn a few things from this book, and found it to be motivating, but as a Dave and Pete fan, I was very disappointed. The book is just a huge advertisement for their mentorship program. The book is from the perspective of a few new mentorship students and their experience at the first intensive training session.If you have read any of Dave and Pete's other books, don't bother with this one. If you haven't read any ofDave and Pete's books, I would definately recommend them.

In her 324-page book, Cheney gave an extensive review of each Montana community that ever had a post office, including brief town histories, how the towns were named, and who was the first postmaster or mistress. Cheney's work also had a 6-page bibliography and cost $12.00. However, \\"A Checklist of North Dakota Post Offices 1850-1982\\" is just that, a 15-page pamphlet listing no more than the post offices in alphabetical order, the date opened and the date closed, if applicable, and an abbreviation of the county in which the post office was/is located. While of elementary use to a collector of North Dakota postmarks, as a historical reference it's useless and doesn't even have a single line of bibliography. To say that \\"A Checklist\\" is disappointing would be a gross understatement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to ride","review":"Very hard for a 2 year old to ride, even had my neighbors try to ride it and didn't go too well.

Once I recieved the new bike, there were a few rust spots on it, and stickers were smudged, they had a lot of air pockets and wrinkles in it. I do not reccomend the bike for the price it is selling at. My son loves his bike, dont get me wrong, but for all the defects in both bikes that we have delt with, this bike should not sell for anymore than $40-$50 bucks!

So I returned the bike to Amazon for a new one. This time the box came as is and not in a bag.

Though Irwin is getting better in their attempts, they've missed the mark by a mile with this one. Any fan of the Akira Toriyama creation would find this figure as being a waste of money. Gohan, at this stage, was one of the strongest fighters in the series. Why would he need a Jet to fly when he could do it under his own power and so much faster? Irwin made a similar mistake in their earlier releases when they gave the characters weapons. First off, why would you need a gun if you could destroy the world with one finger? In addition, the sight of a seven year old Trunks figure with a bazooka was a little too much. If you're looking for a good Gohan figure, look for the stand alone 7\\" figures series 14 or later.

Although I took out a new loan, this book goes into assumptions, seller financing, and other financing choices that I didn't know much about. I think a lot of people looking to buy might find these alternatives worthwhile. Overall, a profitable read.P.S. This book is not an \\"infomercial\\" or \\"get rich quick\\" hype.

I actually tossed it across the room when I was done, angry with myself for not setting it aside when I was bored at page 50."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been good","review":"I really couldn't read this long enough to see if the plot was good because the language in it was so common that it was disgusting. I wish authors would not mess up their stories with common street talk and just use good proper English."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Romance Writer Adds a Bit of Mystery","review":"As a voracious mystery-reader I did not find this book very enjoyable. There was an awful lot of cutsy romance novel banter between the main female and male characters which served to make me lower my opinion of their intelligence. I like \\"cozies\\" but this was way too wordy. Readers who prefer romances may like this book but mystery readers will have to wade through a lot of unnecessary dialogue to get to the plot. I consider it a mediocre padded genre romance with a fairly original mystery added."},{"rating":"1","title":"Story ok, but writng style is labored","review":"I quite enjoyed it on a wet Sunday afternoon, but the writing style is just too padded out.It isn't really any different from a thousand other books - okay to pass the time, but not a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Breathe of Fresh Air","review":"Suzann Ledbetter's East of Peculiar inspired me to order the entire series to see how the characters progressed. The elderly characters in the series were presented as vital and witty which is rare today. The heroine herself is over 30 and doing just great which is another oddity in these times. The mystery kept me guessing and the romance was detailed enough to keep me interested but not overpowering like some romances that read like a \\"How To\\" manual. I truly enjoyed this cozy book and will continue to follow this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Ledbetter","review":"EAST OF PECULIAR is Suzann Ledbetter's first mystery (she is author of a dozen other books including a biography, 10 novels and 2 humor books) and its a funny and involving story set in the Missouri Ozarks, a place the author knows intimately. Readers are going to love Hannah Garvey, the former ad exec in Chicago who throws over that life to manage a retirement home deep in the Ozarkian hills. There is a murder there and Hannah and the local sheriff become involved in the solution to the crime and inevitably become involved with each other. Ledbetter is a terrific character-creator and has a lot of fun, as readers will, with her cast of retirement home characters, all turning amateur sleuths to \\"help\\" solve the crime at Valhalla Springs."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Disappointing","review":"\\"Casablanca\\" is my favorite movie of all time. I felt extremely happy when I heard that an original soundtrack of Max Steiner's great score was to be released. However, my illusions became shattered when I bought this CD because almost all the dialogue from the movie was included on this Rhino release. I felt so disappointed at that. It would be better to buy the movie instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"simply fantastic","review":"as a rabid fan of Casablanca I almost died of joy when I received the soundtrack as a Christmas gift...and then this experience was repeated the first time I played it. The soundtrack, like the film, is absolutely perfect. fans of both music and Casablanca, and indeed good film in general, will adore this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Enough Stars For This One","review":"There's been a trend over the last few years to include dialogue in movie soundtrack CDs (I think \\"Apollo 13\\" was the first). Well, \\"Casablanca\\" is the standard by which all these CDs should be judged. This CD hits all the highlights, and uses them wisely: it knows when to talk, and when to shut up and let Max Steiner carry the show. This CD is so well-constructed you don't even need to have seen the movie to understand the story (of course, if you haven't seen the movie, why would you get this CD?)Kudos kudos kudos to everyone involved. Vive la liberte!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Who's unhappy?","review":"CASABLANCA, one of the twentieth century's great films, is memorialized here not so much by stirring film music as by the fact that you get the exquisite screenplay banter that still evokes grins at its genius on, say, the forty-second hearing.I assume that technology did now allow the separation of Max Steiner's score from the spoken witticisms that begin at the beginning and don't end until the end of this fantastic movie. As a result, this 'soundtrack' is actually a trip through some of Casablanca's finest moments, spoken and played.It is produced and presented here with an entertaining and informative 'thick liner' that frames both the movie and its soundrack.Who's unhappy?, as Sam memorably asked in song. Not the owners of this motion picture soundtrack, that's for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mouse Deer","review":"Ingenious! I am thrilled with the storyline. I plan to use this book in teaching character education or the rainforest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful.","review":"Nice review. However, the competition in the realm of defense/defence economics books is scarce. So don't look around that's it. It provides a balanced and objective description of the economics of defense.

It offers some international comparison, but for that it's better to read some more recent working paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Duffle Coat","review":"The Jos. A.

The examples are listed in such a way that you can't read them on the Kindle. The regular expression matches are listed by showing the matches with a light gray behind the match.

Lacks examples of the use regex in any major programming language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Houston, we have a problem...","review":"I don't know if every copy of the book is like this, but mine was printed so faintly that the highlighting of the examples was too faint to see. What this means is that the examples in the book (and there are a lot of them... that is the primary method of teaching in the book) are useless without the accompanying text. The accompanying text is quite good and thorough, but I wouldn't recommend this book at all unless you're sure they've fixed the problem at the printer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"In the book introduction the author correctly states that most regexp texts and tutorial tend to concentrate just on the \\"easy\\" part: regexp syntax illustrated with a few examples, and do not give the reader even a little mastery in the art of using them. He then proceeds to writing another short and sweet useless syntax illustration. This \\"book\\" has no more useful material than you can find in a free web tutorial, so I suggest you save your money and stick with those, or go for a book that's worth some money: \\"Mastering Regular Expressions\\" by O' Reilly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle Version is Defective and Unusable","review":"While the printed version may be a good reference, the Kindle version is formatted improperly to the point that it is renderred useless.

Rosco Gordon was the most likable person in the film, and I was curious to sample some of his music. Simply put, this album rocks.

It's worth every penny."},{"rating":"1","title":"It tells the time ...but thats all!","review":"This is a cute clock. (I bought it even after reading the mixed reviews because I thought it was SO CUTE and knowing that my son is gentle with things.) HOWEVER, we had it only a week before the button that toggles between music (radio) on/off/alarm music/buzz broke! So now it is only a clock...no music or alarm. I read several other reviews that said the arms fell off but so far that hasn’t happened to us but they do seem to be a bit too \\"delicate\\" for a kids' clock. My 5 yr old is happy to have a clock in his room but if I had it to do over again I would have purchased a different clock."},{"rating":"2","title":"puzzle time!","review":"As long as you enjoy putting things together, this is great!.

This book clearly helps the reader define what any form of abuse is, how and why it happens, and how to protect oneself from abusive people, creating personal and emotional safety. For anyone who suspects they may have been (or possibly are being) abused, this is the book for them. As a Therapist, I recommend this book to adults abused as children, adult children of alcoholics, even people who are in ambivalent relationships and can't figure out why they are still there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful enough for tough nails","review":"I purchased this from another source. Just tried for the first time and loved it! The noise is not too intimidating compared to other nail grinding tools, and although it's not cordless, it comes with a LONG power cord to let you chase your dog! It has many variable speed to adjust according to the type of nails, however, the knob seems too loose and change its speed by just touching it by accident. One thing is that there is no customer service nor company information on this product. So if you need a help, you are stuck unless there is someone who can help you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for my pitbull","review":"We are very happy with the grinder, our dog didn't like when we clipped his nails so I was looking for alternative, this did it."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant","review":"I never knew Hugo Largo but I heard \\"Thrilled to Be Here\\" one morning on NPR (Morning Becomes Eclectic) and I literally pulled over to the side of the road to write down the artist.

Definitely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mimi is THE queen of ethereal cool!!","review":"If you don't think \\"Fire and Roses\\" and \\"Clues of You\\" are two of the coolest songs you've ever heard, listen to them again (and again and again). Comparisons to people like Kate Bush may give you a clue, but they don't tell the whole story. Since Mimi started her \\"big label\\" work with Michael Stipe (of REM) and then Moby, her work has grown in depth and quality. I can't wait until her next album comes out!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, I wish I loved this album","review":"Like most of the reviewers so far, I thought Hugo Largo was an AMAZING band. Mimi Goese's unique voice and lyrics are back, but are very overproduced. Hector Zazou, especially, has a way of turning things cold. \\"Fire and Roses\\" is haunting, playful, and mysterious - but the rest of the album was a great disappointment for a very hopeful fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like nothing else. I dare you to buy it!","review":"Mimi Goese was part of an obscure 80's art band named Hugo Largo. Not a \\"trained\\" singer, per se, but she does things with her voice that are quite unexpected in the realm of pop music. When she's not a screaming angel, she's a spooky whispering child.Rounding out this effort is the ever-capable hand of producer/musician Hahn Rowe. Violinist for Hugo Largo and N.Y. scenester extraordinaire with a Midas touch.In short, just when you thought you'd heard it all, along comes Mimi.

They are really good. I tend to like the scent, & the initial price, plus there's hardly any animal fat used in the manufacturing of them. Also, as much as I'm fast becoming a bit of an environmentalist the strictly paper packaging only isn't too bad either as opposed to thick wax paper & plastic. When I get a fireplace or woodstove, the wrapper makes great kindling too.I just think that the shipping & handling is a bit much. I worked in a mailroom before. It does not take nearly 5 dollars to ship out 2 bars of soap at the standard rate. Sounds like a certain seller is pocketing a little bit more if you ask me. Other than that the product is fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me?","review":"This is in no way anywhere close to be called a Jasmine soap.

I will have to look elsewhere if this is all Amazon has to offer. Too many \\"didn't receive copy\\" statements to trust this company. If they can't send a copy of the warrantee, what does that say about their service if you have a problem?

For two weeks calling the seller asking \\"where is my stuff!\\". Their response was to call an 800 number that directed me back to amazon.

I contacted the Extended Service Plan and they said a local repair company would call to schedule a appointment. The repair guy called and he said Plasma's and LCDs do not have in-home service and they would come and pick up my Plasma. He said that there are other Plasmas that were in line before mine and could take up to 4 days to diagnosis and another 2 days to find out how long the fix will take. He said that it could take 2 weeks to 3 months depending on the part. If you purchase a Plasma or LCD I would never recommend this service plan. 3 months with-out a TV is unacceptable. If I could give this plan a negative rating I would.

Don't bother with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A trip down memory lane for Aphex fans of yore.","review":"Classics is an Aphex Twin compilation with a sound that most Aphex fans are unfamiliar with. The songs are less flighty than his more recent endeavors such as the Richard D. James Album and Come To Daddy. The Classics album is heavy on the beats, and James' focus here is on finding a groove and riding it. Owners of his Polygon Window LP should recognize the style somewhat, in the similarity of the pounding of the bass and drums, less skittish and more forceful. This is an album for losing oneself, forgetting your surroundings, and just spacing out for an hour or so. Classics is not the most accessible of Aphex albums, however, and one would do well to pick up some of his other work before venturing into his older, harder sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get into it","review":"I can see by looking at this album and his newer stuff that Aphex Twin has evolved with his musical style since this album. Classics is a minimum effort album as far as I can see, just wierd sounds replacing normal drums and breakbeats. Very noisy and detatched. Though its not completly horrible, it comes pretty close."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't normally buy extended warranties, but...","review":"I normally don't buy extended warranties but with my new Macbook Pro and monitor I will be transporting it around to various photography workshops and any time you travel you increase wear and potential for damage. I bought from Amazon as they sold the AppleCare slightly cheaper than Apple did directly. Plus having worked int he consumer electronics industry I understand thathigh end electronics can be sensitive. Alot of people who review things on Amazon believe technology should be perfect (no bugs, no defects, etc) and that is just not realistic. To keep prices affordable durability tradeoffs are made by companies, even Apple. It's a statistical tradeoff which I understand. I have used my AppleCare once on my wife's Macbook pro and it paid for itself on that one repair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, great taste","review":"I found this book after seeing Priscilla on TV.

How anyone could not smile/laugh at \\"The Working Song\\" would be beyond me. Anyone who even remotely \\"likes\\" Disney will LOVE this film. The music, the acting, the comedy, the beautiful photography, the animation, the clever dialogue, the art & set decorations!

It was a classic Disney movie in the sense that it had the cute animals, singing, prince and princess, etc., but the twist was having them come from that \\"ideallyc\\" world into ours, let alone New York, was great. Her being so \\"pure\\" and singing wherever she went or making dresses overnight from curtains, her prince coming and singing, the chipmunk, it was not only cute, but clever and funny.

AN ENDEARING HOMAGE TO THE FAIRY TALE!","review":"If you love Disney's animated features, then this is a must see movie. I happen to own all of Disney's animated films. I also love and respect all the work that went into these timeless classics. What makes this film so good is that it takes some very stale, over done cliche's and add a refreshing twist to the concept. You can see what's coming and you can't wait for it to get there. I am not a big fan of musicals with a few exceptions and this film works in some musical numbers that I found funny and entertaining. This has got to be one of Disney's best live action comedies in decades! The cast is great the effects are well done and the film flies through it's hour and a half-ish running time in a snap!

The DVD has plenty of extras and fun stuff for the kids as well.It is well worth the price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Downhill Disney","review":"Disney films have pretty much gone downhill since the \\"Hunchback of Notre Dame\\" animated movie. In that film, the heroine kicks men in the groin to make her escape and the comedy relief is provided by a stone gargoyle that relieves itself by passing gas.In this film, we have a live dog urinating on the leg of a prince and a chipmunk that defecates when frightened.Is this what passes for family entertainment these days?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The children watched - and enjoyed most of the show that they could understand, the singing, dancing and really cool dragon and chipmunk (the star of the show).As parents watching the show, we thought the cast were excellent, but the story was weak.I, a native New Yorker living in the West am getting pretty tired of explaining to my children (who have been to NYC twice) and neighbors, that New York and New Yorkers are NOT the way they are stereotypically portrayed on the screen. As with our Italian heritage, thank you Sopranos, not all Italians are \\"Family\\", not all Irish are drinking thugs. I have a sense of humor and can laugh easily, but these sterotypes are generally taken as real!Why is it so popular to stereotype one group of people but not another?Hmmmmmmmmmmm?It's a movie we rented, but probably won't buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"The original is better","review":"This is a parody of \\"The Sleeping Beauty\\", a classic that is now coming to Blu-ray. But unlike that wonderful, carefully planed classic which took the Disney studio almost a decade to develop, Enchanted lacks sincerity.It pretends to put the fairy tale world upside down and teach a couple of things about \\"true love\\", but instead ends up reaffirming the fairy tale concepts, but without the class and elegance of the original. In fact, bad taste is all over the place: Almost-nudity, a joke involving faeces, talk about boys wanting \\"only one thing\\", easy jokes copied from Shrek and \\"Splash\\", a nauseating musical number in Central Park...If you're still itching to know what Enchanted is all about, rent it before buying. And buy The Sleeping Beauty Blu-ray."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible torchering movie!!!!!!!!!","review":"i hated this movie!!! i liked the first time i saw it it, but when your mom is obsessed with it and you have to watch it every other day,it becomes the most annoying movie ever!!!!!! watch it ONCE!!! i guess if you want to watch it a second time its okay then, but then it gets annoying!!!! anchanted is not one of those movies that you can see over and over again and never get tired of it. watch it one time!!!!! it gets boaring atfer tHAT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stuck watching Disney","review":"Having three little girls that believe they are all princesses I have to endure many Disney movies. Enchanted is different from many other Disney movies in that it kind of makes fun of the basic FairyTale formula Disney has relied upon for years. As an adult male with the children I found the movie funny and I laughed in places my kids did not get. For having to sit through this on a long drive it was pretty good. Despite not having any car chases or fiery explosions I still liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfectly named film","review":"This film is so much fun I didnt want it to end. Amy Adams is transcendent in her role as the Princess to be Giselle. She shouldve gotten an Oscar for this performance.

Amy Adams is perfection. Without an ounce of camp or a wink at the audience, she embodies a fairy tale princess, innocent and sweet, and every moment she is on screen is a delight. The songs are great-- especially the Central Park and apartment cleaning numbers. The only misstep is the over-long dragon finale. But by the happy-ever-after ending, that's forgotten and the silly grin returns, sometimes accompanied by a little tear. A joy for kids and grown-ups."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly funny","review":"My girlfriend loves this movie and I though it was going to be boring movie, but I ended up laughing my butt off!

My only complaint is that there wasn't much background for Andalasia. Was Gisselle truly a Princess or not? What happened to the Prince's father? And the like.The real-life part was rather amusing. Gisselle was just adorable, and seeing the fairy-tale gestures done by a real-life actress instead of a cartoon counterpart was rather amusing, especially when she starts singing, and the creatures in the city - like the pigeons and even the COCKROACHES! - come in to help her with such and such. Everyone did great jobs in their roles, especially the Andalasian characters because of their exaggerated gestures and breaking out in song at seemingly random intervals. If you're looking for a fun and entertaining fairytale to watch, this is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"fairy tale","review":"It's a disney style fairy tale.

I, however, love fantasy and am a diehard romantic. If you enjoy movies which are a little bit fairy tale and a little bit romance, where good triumps over evil and leaves you feeling happy and uplifted, this is for you! If you prefer, as my best friend does, blood, guts & horror and can't stand the thought of impromptu song and dance scenes that just magically happen in the middle of your movie, not so much I'm afraid. I personally think big kids and little ones alike can enjoy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely a great movie!","review":"I had reserved judgment about this movie prior to purchasing it. I thought it would be too hokey, but my daughter really wanted to see it.I won't repeat the other reviews, but this is a great movie. As an adult, I found it to be entertaining and just plain sweet. My little girl danced and sang for hours imitating Princess Giselle. We thoroughly enjoyed it.The transitions back and forth from cartoons to the real world were interesting. I also liked the tie-ins with other Disney movies such as the animals helping around the house like in Snow White, as well as the kiss from Prince Charming and the poisoned apple. There is a Cinderella slipper scene. I thought the dragon scene toward the end was a lot like Maleficent in Sleeping Beauty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best movie around for little girls","review":"We have watched this movie twice in the cinema and now just bought it. It is really a very good movie for little girls. Girls need to know that Prince Charming may not be the right guy for them...could be for someone else though. They also need to think independently which this movie encourages. Its a very nice movie otherwise too and is good to watch with the family. I wish there were more family movies we could watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This is one of the best Disney cartoon/movie I have ever seen.

It tells how Seymour Cray and his small team built not only the most powerful computers in the world, but commercialised them at the same time.The book takes us from Cray's early days through the science and business of supercomputing, and it focusses more on the personalities than the technology, which to me at least is far more interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE this Numbers Puzzle","review":"My kids love this puzzle and has made learning numbers fun.

After this book, I have to agree. This book includes 2 occasions where the heroine is sexually assaulted by the hero in her sleep (once while she's drugged...hot, huh?), and another where he has sex with her after she asks him to stop. uhhh, i think that's called rape, and that is not romantic. And then when they never deal with those assaults and proceed to fall in love... It just did not ring true at all.The thing is.. there was a pretty interesting premise here, and the author has the capacity to write decent dialogue and make up good characters. So why does it just turn into this rape fantasy? On top of that, the mystery part wasn't that well developed or explained, and it ended incredibly abruptly.

Instead of showing us who they are, we are told \\"She is frigid\\", \\"He is bored\\", etc. It left me cold and un-invloved. At the same time the story line is so preposterous, most of the times the heroes themselves don't know why they are doing what they are doing... so how can we identify with them??!I didn't grow to like them, I didn't believe in the love story, I just wanted it to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Insomniacs Only","review":"I ordinarily like Anne Stuart books, but this one didn't hold my interest enough for me to finish it.

The actual time passage scenairo was very vague and loosely written, and I don't know about you, but when I am fantacizing about a gorgeous hunk of a man, I wan't him AVAILABLE, not in essence, cheating on his pregnant wife.(No matter what the customs of Beltane dictate.)

I'd like to find one all encompassing product that will define the curl, enhance the curl and control the frizz."},{"rating":"2","title":"massage cream for stretch marks","review":"I don't have the Whole set but I am going to buy it I have the Massage Cream the one in the tube and it is wonderful I started to use as soon as I found out I was expecting however I didn't use it everyday one a week if I remembered so I ended up getting a few stretch marks but since then I have been using it everyday and the stretch marks that I have have actuly started to fade already and I have not gotten any more I still have 11 weeks to go but hopefully the cream will continue to do its job"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Gift","review":"This Dragonfly Turquoise Gemstone ring is so pretty.

Ury makes the read quick and easy....like his thought process and this book will lead you to pursue more of his work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Flow of Positivity","review":"From his experience with working with children, married couples, business disputes, international conflict and more, William Ury demonstrates that an alternative to anger and violence is not only possible but much more productive and rewarding for all parties involved.Although Ury specifies indentification and processes involved in all its various forms, you will not find much extrapilation here. Reading this provides a person that may be interested in dealing with conflict (whether at home, or at work, or even politically) a solid starting point and an enlightened positivity towards a more detail study on the subject.Just a little more than 200 pages. The cover is treated to be fairly resistant to the elements so feel free to pass this along to friends or keep it on the coffee table for a quick reference to its diagrams.If you have to develop a power point slide show on mediation, this is a big helper.

And it only took a couple of hundred pages to tell the same story over and over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so Provocative...","review":"The \\"third-side\\" idea of Ury's book was a neat one. I think that his idea of recognizing a third-side, may it be another person/people or a motivating force, and allowing it to assist in nonviolent conflict resolution is neat in that it helps us individually recognize the will to 'resolve'. I just don't know if that whole idea is actually that stimulating.There is an over-simplification in his methodologies which proved to be a significant downfall of this book. Much of his examples were underdeveloped and it seems as if he molds the examples to fit his opinion, instead of his opinion fitting into the examples. The major dissappointment for me in the book was that he writes of other people and other cultures through the employment of racist techniques and makes it seem as though every conflict is simple enough that it can eventually just be \\"talked out\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not show you how","review":"This book just say that you should settle your disputes with methods such as mediation and negitiation but teach not tell you how you can do it.A disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this CD!","review":"What a waste.

Jarrett's volcalizations never intrude on the wonderful music, making this album accesible for anyone. The trio's ability to communicate only gets better with age, and this is one of their peaks. While the moodful melodies and ballads are truly stunning on this album, the spotlight is stolen by Jarrett simply digging into some up-tempo bop standards. Highlights? The entirety of Billie's Bounce and I'll Remember April are ecstatic (the latter featuring a marvelous drum-solo intro punctuated by rhythmic chords on behalf of Jarrett), however, the true gem is the brief, almost frantic and assuredly intense John's Abbey. One can almost see the sparks flying from these three masteful musicians!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for a tough job","review":"This is an economy blade and it lasted as such.

The band is talented, and the songwriting is great. I honestly don't understand why you haven't heard these guys on the radio more. The songs are very radio friendly... Mars Electric should be multi-platinum. The music is really very no-nonsense rock and roll.Someday, Another Day, Far Away and Feels Like June are the best songs on the record.

Sad to say this is one of those bands with little talent but nothing that seperates them from many dozens of other groups that sound just the same. They aren't ones I want to add to my collection.During these days of auditioning, I have noticed one thing. 98% of bands have been ranked somewhere between a 4.5 and 5. This is monotonous. I can't understand why every band rates so high with so little talent and nothing different. It makes reviews garbage basically. People please get off the 5 star buttons and reserve it for your favorites only! I can't even get a clue by reading reveiws so I have to write my own.

OK the eye candy is a bit \\"tastier\\" but did it enhance gameplay. I would say no. It seems that you paid for hardware upgrades to basically bring your system up to \\"state-of-the-art\\" and the graphics in the game aren't \\"breakthrough\\" enough, but it just might be that I over-expected.Now the game mechanics or interface, that's a whole other story. Horrid simply horrid. While the radial interface of the original game was a little cumbersome, there was at least some intuitive-ness to it. From the click on the map to go there traveling, to hard to get rid of quests, this new game is just wrong. As you progress in gameplay, the interface gets easier, but it's never a smooth organic feel."},{"rating":"1","title":"I loved the first- and this was horrible!!!","review":"Please do not waste your money, like I did. The game is VERY buggy, and has tons of broken elements. It was clearly done on a low budget, and is just leveraging the great success of the first version.The graphics look like they are from the mid-90's, and the gameplay is just... a joke.

I bought this last January as my first dslr camera. I chose it because it was 10mp unlike other starters which were fewer. It also had good ratings despite not being as popular as other brands. What sealed the deal was that it was lighter than a lot of other dslr cameras. I have not been disappointed. The pictures I have taken have turned out great using a variety of lenses. Its menus and features are easy to use and you can switch lenses quickly. Being small and lightweight, I can take it almost anywhere without it being a strain on my neck and shoulders. I recommend this camera for anyone moving into the dslr field."},{"rating":"2","title":"best value around for a 10MP DSLR","review":"I am really happy with this camera. I did a lot of research comparing it with other comparable 10MP DSLR's like the Nikon D40X and the Canon Digital Rebel XTi, and although these others have their own subtle advantages over the E410, the price, functionality, quality, and portability (due to its light weight) can't be beat. It has taken me a little bit to get used to the functions of this camera (this is my first digital SLR) but it hasn't taken me long to appreciate all its capabilities. I do look forward to getting a longer focal length zoom lens and a flash, at some point. But definitely it's lots of fun and easy to play around with for indoor and outdoor photos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camera!","review":"Buy this camera! I have read reviews that said that this camera was too small. I am 6'2\\" with big hands and I think the size is perfect. I think some people are stuck in the 35mm film days and don't realize that a digital slr does not have to be like a film slr. This camera is fast, small, and light. It takes great pictures. My other digital slr is a monster compared to this. I will keep it for some things (sigma sd14) but for most of my photography the e-410 is a perfect fit. Plus it has a dust removal system which sadly the sigma does not have. For the price there is nothing else that even comes close. Unless you are a professional photographer I can't see why you would need more. Buy this camera! I got mine from Cameta for $339.00 with the 14-42 lens. The ad said refurb but mine was an untouched demo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great compact DSLR","review":"I'm in love with my Oly.

It takes great photos, battery life is great, and I like that it takes multiple storage cards simultaneously. It's a fantastic product for REALLY short money. I would recommend to anyone who wants to upgrade from a point and shoot. This camera WILL open you world wide. The only thing that's lacking is image stab, but the 510 or 520 are easy upgrades for the future if you decide you want it.

More importantly she offers resources and hope for women who are currently living silent/secret lives of shame and uncertainty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased Bull","review":"This movie makes white people from the south look terrible. They are portrayed as owning nothing. There is that black woman who owns a restaurant and a black man who owns a store but all the whites are poor white trash except possibly a white older woman who may or may not own a beauty parlor and who chases the black store owner because everyone else in town (white) are trash with their teeth turning brown from tobacco (her words). This movie plot was good but the uneven way the director trashes whites is wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine for a previous decade","review":"The material was dated, in terms of technical aspects. Explanations of the process of film making did nothing to fulfill the title - How to Read a Film. With that title I expected the focus to be on the creation, development and presentation of film content, film theory and the phenomenon of communication through the medium of cinema. Perhaps when it was first released it was more relevant to the reading audience. If you already have a basic understanding of the cinema arts or film history, you may find the book does not add a lot of new insights or information."},{"rating":"1","title":"needed advice","review":"they were very cute but in making them the arms kept breaking on the monkeys when we tried to take them from the molds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to work with.","review":"I needed a monkey candy mold for a cake I was doing.

There are a number of original songs and a fantastic version of Pacabel's Canon in D. Trace is a virtuoso with all the tricks, finger picking and lots of percussive stuff.

The system is now out of the one year warranty, and none of the function keys operate on any of the handsets. I can't turn off the ringers, access caller ID, or access the phone book.

It was given to us by a friend and now with 2 kids, I still use it. My 3 year old can sit on top of the front wheel when traveling to the beach or short distances. I can fold it by myself without taking the wheels out. The basket is great and it maneuvers beautifully in bad sidewalks and pothholes. The wheels are larger than many joggers' so its a more comfortable and sturdy ride for kids and for mommy to maneuver as well. Fits through any door but not very easy to get into a car so better for city living. Also, the canopy is great because it has a zippered side for keys and things you surely wouldn't want to fall to the ground. Don't get the $99 one, get the LX. There's a big difference. I also own a double Tike Tech jogger but believe Expedition Double Jogger to be better than the Tike Tech."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've seen better","review":"Great stroller, roomy, it's like a Cadillac for baby. One thing that turns me off and is very annoying is that that front wheel does not swivel!!! Don't even think of going anywhere where you have to turn. Why don't companies think of these things? Unless your an avid runner or walker going in a straight line,it's great but don't even think of going in and out of stores with this thing, it takes up half of my trunk and I own a truck and weighs a ton."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dachshund for Dummies","review":"I just recently had a medical emergency with my Dachshund.

Within 8 hours she could not stand on either leg and I had to rush her to a big Vet Hospital, they did surgery on her that same night. Back problems in dachshunds are common and if I had not read a lot of books on the subject I would not have know.

We are not leppers or psycho's....we are trained and weathered to believe that this life is 'normal'. When one finally realized how ABnormal this is, your whole life looses it's shape, matter, form, and perspective. We are trained form babies to be this way for some reason. I do not feel alone anymore. Maggie is brilliant! and I think Zoe must be my sister!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An author coming into her own as a writer","review":"Maggie Estep, who I have been a fan of for years since her MTV days, has written a funny and quirky coming-of-age novel that I must highly recommend. What is most striking about this novel is not its plot or character development, but Estep's voice, one of the most distinctive today. The over-the-top situations and wildly funny antics of the heroine, written in Estep's trademark deadpan language, are the strength of the \\"Diary.\\" The novel is written like one of her CD tirades, and we can imagine her loudmouth voice reading the lines to us. The novel is also semi-autobiographical, so it's easy to imagine Estep's distinct personality throughout the book. Often hilarious, Estep's first novel signals the coming of age of not only Zoe, but also of Estep, who seems poised to be a fine novelist. Looking forward to \\"Soft Maniacs.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of flabbergasted at all the praise...","review":"This is just a really awful book. I know a lot of people assume that anyone who doesn't like Maggie Estep doesn't get punk rock or transgressive/alternative fiction or like hanging out on the lower east side...Au contraire, though I rarely wear my Gen-X hipster chevrons on my sleeve, this should be right up my alley. But it's awful.Like you would expect from Estep, it has some verve and is definitely different, but it's a rambling mess. I suppose the confessional aspect is supposed to be endearing, but I was just generally offput by the decisions Estep's narrator makes. It's hard to muster sympathy for Zoe.Judgment, on the other hand, comes quite naturally. The narrator is supposed to be an \\"emotional\\" idiot -- but I'd just do away with the qualifier. And I'd skip this book while we're at it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spectacular Photos but find a guide elsewhere","review":"There are gorgeous railroad photographs here that will inspire you to do the same.

Why cant matel make dolls in these series and other similar series that have a more modern look to them. LIke can you ever see anyone where this dress in public and if a movie star wore it they would be put on a worst dress list.

A shape sorter should be educational and fun for very young children. The rainmaker seems like a nice feature until you get it home. It's tricky for even an adult to put the shapes into the sorter as they only just about fit into the holes. Once in, they make the most annoying noise whilst sliding down the tubes. The pleasant and soft sound of the rainmaker is completely destroyed by the banging of the plastic colored shapes on the sides.I'm sad to say that my eight months old played with this for five minutes and now shows no interest in it. If you're looking for a shape sorter, please buy a traditional one and not this disappointing product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment Too","review":"1) The system caused the rear speakers to emit an annoying hum as soon as they were turned on - this matches the report from the other reviewer, so maybe that's just how they're made. I had the SH-FX60 connected to a Panasonic SC-HT40. The rear speakers are just fine with no hum or static when connected directly.2) Within the first 5 minutes of operation, there was a small \\"pop!\\" and the rear speakers ceased to emit any sound except the hum described above. The green circle that is supposed to light up showing the receiver sees a signal also went out. Installation had been done according to the instructions. I power-cycled both the surround system and the receiver, tried taking the transmitter out and putting it back in when the surround system was off, and the rear speakers never came back on; neither did the green circle.I ended up returning the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't recommend if you have other wireless gadgets","review":"I tried to use the SH-FX60 kit with my Panasonic SC-HT740 system, but it only worked within 5 feet of the transmitter! Past that range, the wireless connection could not be made and no sound at all came through to the rear surround speakers -- possibly due to interference from other wireless gadgets. If you have other wireless devices that you aren't ready to part with, or if you're in a building where others may have wireless gadgets in close range, do not waste your money on this item. Otherwise, cross your fingers and maybe it'll just work."},{"rating":"1","title":"FX60 - Disappointment","review":"There is an annoying buzz in the sound system while using the FX60.

The signal does not work when the microwve is on, even though the microwave is about 30 feet away. The 2 units don't commuicate very well. I have to constantly be adjusting the location of the receiver because it looses signal. The receiver is only 18 feet away and it has a hard time working. Sometimes, during a movie, the signal will go out for 4 seconds which is pretty annoying during an action scene. The unit has stopped working completely 3 times in which I have to plug and unplug the unit to fix the problem. The 3rd time the problem did not get fixed so I am returning the unit. I purchased warranty for it so hopefully they will give me my money back instead of trying to fix it. I should of never purchased it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did I buy this...","review":"I've been thoroughly disappointed with this system since the day I purchased it. First off, I can hardly hear anything from the speakers (no individual volume control for the wireless speakers). I have to put my ears up against the speakers to actually hear them (I think this may not be due to the wireless speakers so much as the Panasonic system driving them).That's not the most annoying feature though. Ever since I installed the wireless kit, I've had problems with my wireless home network. Apparently, this Kit interferes with my wireless g network. At one point I could not get my network to work at all. Sometimes, I cannot even use my network while I've got my TV/surround on. So I have to turn it off just to work on my computer. Ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"CRAP!","review":"The sound continually cuts out despite the unit only being four feet away from the receiver.

The authors explain medical terminology very well and give you devices for remembering what you've absorbed.

You can also go directly to any chapter that interests you the most and it will be clear even without reading the preceding chapters first."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible artwork","review":"very disappointed in this book.

Seriously, this is not a good table top poker table at all. I keep reading how sturdy some table tops are.....what?? it's styrofoam.....how sturdy can styrofoam be? The box was barely taped closed when I got it. No packing. Come on Amazon..make sure your distributors are sending the same item to everyone. What good is a review if the items are not even similar.

It's definitely not a \\"professional\\" table by any means, but it was good enough for our purposes. I would also like to add in response to a previous review that the cup holders are actually quite nice.

This he does concisely and to the point but with a sense of humor which I greatly enjoy.The only thing which might be expanded on in a second edition, would be how different RSS reader applications react to feed content.

I'm glad I took them out of the box first and tried them out. There's no sound in one ear, and they haven't even been used yet! Not a good sign. After looking at others reviews, it's obvious that they are poorly made and if they hadn't been broken already, they would be soon.

The second and third pairs (which I purchased at the same time with the idea of having one for the computer and one to carry around) didn't last as long (perhaps a few months each). In both of them, the insulation around one of the wires had (or developed? I'm not sure how this happened) a cut in it, and the insulation eventually separated from itself, exposing the wire. The wire then eventually frayed away, again leaving the headphones with sound in only one earpiece. Also on the third one, one of the pieces attaching the earpiece to the headband broke (before the wire frayed), but I was able to swap it out with the same piece from the second pair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding !!","review":"After purchasing Dominic Miller's Second Nature, I knew that I could not be without First Touch.

Although all tracks on this CD are fabulous, I must comment on the 2nd track, \\"Do You Want Me.\\" This is a moving, sexy arrangement which holds me captive every single time I listen.

Historical and fictional characters are mixed as the story of the Russian offensive of Winter 1942 is told.All the subplots are linked by the Shaposhnikov family; Viktor a Moscow nuclear scientist being the main character. The various sub-plots include a Russian labour camp, Viktors fight against the authorities and his conscence and the harrowing story of a train load of Jews an the way to the gas chambers of Auswitz.Along with Solzhenitsyn's The First Circle, Vasily Grossman has wrote a truly classic book about the injustice of Stalin's Russia, which you don't have to be an expert on Russian history to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Russian novels - EVER WRITTEN","review":"I am surprised why this book is not as widely known as the classics of the 19th century. This book should definetely be among the classics of the 20th century litterature. It is among my personal top 10 favourites in any language. PLEASE read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Banned in Berdichev","review":"Vasily Grossman's epic book about the Soviet Union during World War II, especially as it pertains to the characters involved in the horrific Stalingrad battle, is a must read for anyone who has any desire to understand the Soviet people, their attitudes, their fears, their culture, their government, their loves, and their power, and all that tempered their post-war behavior. Grossman was from Berdichev, a heavily Jewish Ukrainian city, and saw, first hand, the effects of the Nazi slaughter, aided and abetted by some of the Ukrainians. This book is ponderous, but nonethless fascinating;undoubtedly reading it in the original Russian would make a difference. It was banned in the Soviet Union for many years;mostly because Stalin and his successors did not want the Soviet people to feel that the Jews were especially singled out for horror and that some of their fellow Soviets in Ukraine, the Baltic states, and elsewhere, were complicit in the Nazi design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life and Fate","review":"This is a tremendous novel centred upon the battle of Stalingrad in 1942-43. It covers much of Soviet life. And it poses a question that must have caused Grossman, a committed comunist, great pain: What is the difference between Fascism and Socialisim? The pain is in his answer - There is none.There is some wonderful writing in this. A chapter in which a Jewish mother, doomed behind Nazi lines, writes her farewell to her son has been turned into a stage play.The book, not the author, was exiled; an indicator of Grossman's standing in the Soviet hierarchy of the 1960s. The manuscript and the typewriter tapes were taken into exile, and Grossman was told that his book would not be read for many years. So even the commisars knew that they could not kill this book, they could merely delay it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The War and Peace of the Twentieth Century.","review":"Life and Fate is overwhelming. Grossman brings out the horror of the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, the awful treatment of Soviet citizens by their own government, the presence of anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union, and much, much more.

When you also consider that it is a translation, that's really saying something. The book is an easy read, the language is very straightforward, yet I was blown away every time I sat down to read it. The book entertains while being profoundly moral, like a Kurosawa film. Along with Lowry's Under The Volcano, with its fantastically beautiful prose (and serious shortage of plot), this sits at the very top of my stack. So don't let its length bother you - instead, be grateful that such a such a killer read isn't over too soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting","review":"Although I was initially intimidated by the size of this epic novel, I was soon swept up by the fascinating lives of its wide range of stars, all linked by a single family.

The characters are fighting for survival against the Germans while laboring under a state apparatus that could at any time ruin their and their families' lives. Some of the author's musings on man may seem dated, but, in my experience, such stereotypes are still held by countless people, especially in asia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great textbook","review":"Ms. Robbe did a great job of explaining the basics of planning for expositions and tradeshows.

Not terrible... but not terribly interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"For beginners","review":"You will not be wasting your time by reading Developing The Leader Within You. If you are new to the field of leadership, this is a nice introduction. If you are an experienced leader, the book will remind you of some basic principles that you might be neglecting. It does not delve deeply into any one area, and it does not really break new ground. The quotes are selectively footnoted and many of the anecdotes are apocryphal. Maxwell is given to cute turns of phrase that he hopes will be interpreted as words of wisdom (e.g., \\"People do not care how much you know until they know how much you care.\\"). All in all, this is a fine basic introduction, but I was hoping for more. This should not be the only leadership book you read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Resource","review":"Developing the Leader within you is a fabulous resource for anyone who is serious about becoming the best they can be.

If you want a few practical tips on how to be a domineering leader, this book is for you. If not, pick up a book on the topic of servant leadership. Don't look for a quick fix that will make leadership easier than being in the trenches loving one another. My disagreement with this book is more out of my feelings of what a leader should be, not with the way Maxwell wrote.

That wheel assembly lasted three months and then the ball bearings fell out. This time Razor had me send it to them postage paid though I had to pay the packaging which was about as much as the scooter cost new. Within days of the new wheel we were back to the whomping.

The first couple of times you ride it, it's great, but then the back tire gets bumpy from braking. Even if you squeeze on the hand break a little bit. The front tire is fine because it's filled with air, but the back tire is like a plastic, so when you ride it more and more the back tire wears down, which makes for load sounds, and a terrible bumpy ride. Pieces and screws fall off, and it goes really slow. Like 4 miles per hour slow. Don't trust the ads. If you're looking for an Electric Razor Scooter, then get an E-200 or E-300, both tires on those are filled with air, so it gives you a great, smooth ride. Overall: Do NOT get an E-100!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the headaches","review":"I got this scooter e-100 for christmas and have problems all the time.The back wheel wore down to the inner tube in the first 2 weeks.Now it makes alot of strange noisy.Now we can't get the scooter to charge up.My mom gets no response from razor and the replacement parts would add up to cost more they we paid for the scooter.It is not worth it trust me.I am 9 years old."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is a great toy","review":"This is a great toy to have!I would ride it every chance I had.I think it is well priced.

One month after we bought it the belt broke. I had to spend hours on the phone and finally razor sent me another one. After all of this I went back Toys r Us and bought a buyer protection plan. One month later I was glad I did, the belt broke again. I called Razor and the belt is on back order 4-6 weeks. This toy was too expensive to be a disposable toy, and since we have had it, it has been broken done more than my son has been able to ride it. We are going today to Toys R Us and exchange it for a better one. I wish now I would have spent the extra money in the beginning. I do however recommend the buyer protection program. It really is a great feature at Toys R Us. I hope this helps someone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amy offers the BEST Cardio Workouts!","review":"I need my cardio, it keeps me sane. Yes, I understand the benefits of intervals & using weights. There are very few options (as far as fitness dvds go) that can compare to the intensity Amy brings! I end up sweating buckets. After the workout, I feel amazing! It's an endorphine rush, and I am a total addict =) Highly recommend this for those looking for an intense cardio workout!!There is a bosu (dome) workout out on the dvd. For those that don't have a bosu - there is a modifier and she uses a step. It may not be as long, but it is intense. Your legs/glutes will feel the burn, and good luck walking after ;)The only drawback is the choreography. The first couple of times you do the workout, some moves may frustrate you. You will get the hang of it, be patient, it's worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crazy woman!!","review":"You may get a cardio workout but it will be frustrating. Amy Bento is not a good instructor.

The film has great acting, a perfect setting in post-war Tokyo, and can truly claim to have an all-star cast (with Robert Ryan in one of his best roles). Also a major plus is the commentary track, which provides valuable insights into the screenplay and making of the movie. House of Bamboo is also one of the rare film noir releases to be made in color during the classic years of the genre (1941-1958). Even after several viewings, there are small nuances that one notices for the first fime. A Samuel Fuller masterpiece not to be missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"okay melodrama....fuller style","review":"Army sergeant, Robert Stack, working undercover, breaks up a syndicate led by expatriate Robert Ryan, in this hard-boiled melodrama set against the urban sprawl of post-war Japan. Expert commentary by Fuller scholars James Ursini & Alain Silver makes it all seem rather more interesting than it is - yet, effective characterizations abound, notably Stack's taciturn investigator, later honed to perfection as The Untouchables' Elliot Ness, a radiant Shirley Yamaguchi as the love interest, and Robert Ryan as an unusually sympathetic villain (more avuncular than sexually ambivalent, as suggested by some commentators).The letterboxed image is fine, though the drab color transfer blunts the immediacy of Joe McDonald's on-location photography."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Sam Fuller's best work","review":"Because this was an early widescreen CinemaScope film, Sam Fuller included a lot of wide shots to show off his location, Japan, and also take advantage of the new format. But he should have used more close shots. You'll find that it's tougher to engage with a film shot like this, and it has far less emotional impact. Another problem is Robert Stack -- he can't really act and is not enjoyable to watch. Robert Ryan is excellent, however, as he usually is and well worth watching. But, overall, the film is less than satisfying. It probably intrigued audiences when first released, but it doesn't hold up today. Buy it only if you're a big Robert Ryan fan. It's not by a long shot Sam Fuller's best work."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think Robert Stack wandered in from another movie","review":"This is not a \\"typical\\" Fuller effort. He goes for the Cinemascope view of post War Japan, pictures of blossoms and Mt Fuji and is lumbered with that sorry excuse for a performer, Robert Stack with his mannered wanderings - whether in a hurry or standing still he seems to be strolling along - and his full range of expressions from A to B. The drama gets to be placed secondary to the scenery and the suspense likewise droops much as I imagined Ms Yamaguchi's desire drooped at the thought of giving Mr Stack a massage. Boy what a let down. Mr Ryan does his professional best but hey, he's always a trooper worth watching. Mr Godard allegedly thought this was Fuller's best film - if so he must have been high on some illegal substance at the time. No no Nannette? No no noir!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Turkey","review":"I love Robert Ryan but even he could not save this boring script.What could have been an amazing piece of pop action history ends up a boring love story. BUMMER"},{"rating":"1","title":"Noir Misfire","review":"Robert Ryan never delivered a bad performance. His memorable portrayal of a Tokyo crime boss is the best thing in \\"House of Bamboo\\" (1955) - director Samuel Fuller's flat attempt at Japanese film noir. Ryan easily towers over Robert Stack's routine characterization, which looks like a dry run for \\"The Untouchables.\\" Apart from Ryan and Joseph MacDonald's on-location CinemaScope photography, this reworking of the superior \\"Street With No Name\\" collapses at the starting gate."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE ROCKY HORROR Collection Really Rocks!","review":"THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW Collection contains the ROCKY HORROR movie soundtrack, the soundtrack to the original play, an audience participation CD, a kareokae CD, and a booklet.

The bronzer has a light scent and does not irritate my skin. At first, I started with 3-4 squirts, and am now down to 1-2. The coverage is perfect.It looks as though I've been tanning. My only caution with this product is to be careful when wearing light colored clothes. The bronzer will stain the garment, but will wash out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"There seemed to be no attempt to digitally remaster this film to DVD. The story treatment of Poland's first christian King (Miesko) was very poor despite the fine cast. I hope that someone like Jerzy Hoffman (who directed the 'Fire with Sword' and 'The Deluge') does a remake. Miesko and his son Boguslaw the Brave both forged Poland into a powerful European state, which subsequently became a powerful empire stretching from the Baltic to the Black sea during the golden age of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.For people of Polish extraction like me or for those very few others in, the English speaking world, interested in Polish History this film is disjointed and not pleasant to watch. It also requires a prior knowledge of Miesko and his deeds to follow what is going on.Ron Ostrowski, Canberra Australia"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bible","review":"This book is a Bible, a remarkably exhaustive and balanced survey of the history and the present of the Basque language and Basque linguistics. All those interested in the possible external connections of Basque (a popular though unrewarding subject among non-specialists) should read and remember the basic chapters on Phonology (3) and the Lexicon (5) as well as the sobering one on Connections with Other Languages (6). The style of presentation makes it very easy to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!!","review":"HSAS's only album. They broke up as Sammy Hagar joined Van Halen and Neil Schon regrouped Journey for the Raised on Radio album. The album is live with a lot of overdubbing in the studio. The result is absolute pure unadultrated rock n' roll. Sammy's vocals are some of the most powerful he ever recorded and Schon cuts loose on the guitar more than he ever did on a Journey album. I waited for this album to come out on cd for many years. Well it's out and is well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buried Treasure","review":"This disc is worth the price just to hear the beautiful and stirring cover of \\"Whiter Shade of Pale\\" and the epic \\"Animation/Valley of the Kings/Giza\\". Though given seperate billing on the song list I consider the latter to be a single piece of music,and it may be the coolest piece of music ever that wasn't done by a band named Queensryche,Sanctuary,or Nevermore. The only word I can think of that describes the sound is regal. Sammy's vocals soar beyond anything I've personally heard him do and Neal cuts loose with some wicked guitar work. In addition to this you get a couple of straight-ahead,balls-out rockers \\"Top of the Rock\\" and \\"My Hometown\\",a couple of mid-tempo emotional somgs in \\"Missing You\\" and \\"He Will Understand\\",and \\"Hot and Dirty\\" which is,well hot and dirty. I don't know how many copies this record has sold but it should be a lot more. If you're a fan of hard rock/metal you SHOULD have this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great supergroup","review":"I saw an MTV concert when this album came out and loved the music.I bought the cassette tape with my after-school job money.Sammy Hagar has one of the most powerful voices in rock,and who knew Neil Schon could play like that?The only problem is the 3 song suite(if you will),\\"Animation/Valley Of The Kings/Giza\\",on the CD there is space between the songs,instead of it being one continuous song.I had to get the CD to put it on my MP3 player.Other than that its still a great overlooked album."},{"rating":"2","title":"HSAS from 1984","review":"I have this album in vinyl from 1984. It is some live music by an allstar band featuring Sammy Hagar and Neal Schon. Their version of \\"Whiter Shyade of Pale\\" is terrific.

It will certainly give you that Christmas spirit and crack you up at the same time. Ru's remake of Dolly Partons Hard Candy Christmas is a gem, and I'm sure Dolly would be proud and feel this version does justice.

It is extremely easy to set up, taking about 30 seconds from getting it out of the bag until it is ready to use. The side bags make it easy to add a bit of sand to weigh it down so the wind doesn't blow it away. The storage bag is just the right size and therefore takes 2 people to put the tent away (the only downside of the product). Overall we are very pleased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I bought this for my 10 month old for the beach this summer, and after the second use, one of the posts snapped in half! We were not rough putting it up or taking it down, it is just cheaply made, and I think over priced. It was also very warm inside, even with the flap rolled up. It also would blow away with a strong wind unless you weighted it down. I was disappointed, especially after spending so much money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Life-saver for second baby!","review":"We have a 3-year old and 2-month old, and this tent has been a lifesaver for our active family! We take it to the park, pool, outdoor concerts, etc. We purchased the Eddie Bauer Infant Travel Bed to put in it, and our baby takes her wonderful long naps while we enjoy life with her along side us. This has been one of the best investments we've made to make life with a second baby \\"livable\\". We love our CABANA, and recommend it to all of our friends!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"works well","review":"It works for us. It is super easy to set up and take down. I've only had it a couple weeks so we will see the wear and tear factor later but for now it is great. I take it outside when my baby is playing and the big girls are in the pool so I can keep an eye on both and the baby is protected by the sun. You do have to weight it down though because any breeze will move it. One review mentioned putting ziplocs in the carrier so when you are at the beach you can make sandbags for weights- I thought this was a great idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kwik Cabana II---easy up","review":"I tried out the Kwik Cabana I as well as this one. They are both a cinch to put up. The number II has a better amount of room. I would not get the number I for the reason that you would outgrow it too fast. II seems to be spacious enough for two or three years at least. The only slightly annoying thing is the bag could be a bit bigger, as it is hard to stuff it in. (folding down, however, is very easy.) The breeze comes through nice and low for baby lying down. And very private for nursing, changing, etc. The \\"lip\\" might keep some amount of sand out."},{"rating":"1","title":"worth about a quarter","review":"I ordered this book knowing I wasnt going to get anything spectacular because it was cheap, but I figured it would actually have activities in it, because of the title.

We usually fought over our single tv (in the 80s) and rarely could agree on anything. But Galaxy High was enjoyed by both of us. It's quirky silliness and aliens-can-do-anything storylines were great.

The songs themselves on this CD are all super-catchy, so even if you aren't well-versed in Portugese it shouldn't matter. The result of his experimentation and everything else is both incredibly original and irresistable.

It only adds to melodicity, if that's a word, i don't think it is. it opens up new horizons for Joe, instead of just his guitar, some pieces of wood, some electronics, and some strings. i like his new view of music NOW, but i also like his view of music THEN i.e. back in the 80's and early 90's. it's a good CD and i recommend it to any Satch fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reinvents Himself Again","review":"One of the things I like about Joe is that he isn't content to do the same thing over and over again. This time, he reinvents himself using techno. Some people don't like it because they say his guitar playing isn't emphasized enough, but the main reason I like Satriani is that he makes interesting, great songs, not just because he is a great guitarist. I think the album is really good, and I do find myself speeding when I listen to it! There is only one song that has real drums and bass, and I think it's out of place and not all that interesting.

Engines of Creation follows two very organic albums taken straight from the rock and roll handbook. You won't find inspired rockers like \\"Train of Angels\\" or \\"Luminous Flesh Giants\\" here. Engines is all about electronic drums and synths.... and guitar. Joe pulls of a radical (maybe not so radical, \\"Not of this Earth\\" had its techno-moments) shift and comes out shining like gold.

Every track is obviously Satriani playing electric guitar; only the bass/percussion are synth, which I humbly believe he uses exceptionally well to empower and drive the music.If you love his '95 album, \\"Joe Satriani\\", and think that's what he should do with his talent, you probably won't like this. If you don't like music full of energy and passion, you probably won't like this. Frankly, that's your loss; this album truly has some of his most powerful and moving compositions.

This album is nothing like his others that show great talent, feeling, style and inspiration in mesmerizing music. What little of that Joe that does come through on a few tracks is still clouded and cluttered with techno background. If you are looking for an instrumental lead guitarist album,,, look elsewhere. But,, if you are looking for pre-programmed \`80s techno, you found it in all it's five star rating glory.. It would, however, make a great sound track for a si-fi."},{"rating":"1","title":"The least impressive Joe CD","review":"I have all of Joe's CD's, and this is the only weak one in the lot. I hope Joe doesn't forget why people buy his records. It's to hear guitar, backed by amazing musicianship.... Not computers. There's no live drums on this disc at all, and that is what hurt this record the most. I hope this doen't mean that Joe has run out of things to try on the guitar. One more record like this, and it could spell disaster for his career, much like when Pat Benatar released that blues record. I know artists don't want to be put in a box, but Joe's box is guitar, not keyboards. Like it or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehhhh What The?","review":"This album pretty much sucks, it's all techno and i think this album is whack! he jumped on the techno bus with both feet here folks. I love satriani i have every one of his albums and videos i am a little obsessed but this album isnt joe satriani at all! i'm a giant vai fan and giant fan of classical music so maybe i had higher expectations out of such a great guitarist but i guess you can't always put out a great album, must be a dud somewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Joe's 'Experiment' Fails Miserably","review":"Engines of Creation contains some fine guitar playing, but it's doubtful many of Joe's loyal listeners (or any other rock guitar music fan) will be able to stomach the array of computer effects and dance beats that sandwich the guitar work. Unfortunately, with one album a year - many of Joe's fans will be angry at his departure from his Rock style. With the necessity of his loyal following (being non-mainstream), this will undoubtedly cost him more fans than it will gain him. A bad move from one of Rock's premiere instrumental guitarists..."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT'S A TECHNO ALBUM WITH SOME GUITAR RIFFS!","review":"It's OK but it's also not a true Satriani album. He's jumped on the techno bandwagon but didn't do the greatest job at it. He's guitar work is complettly drowned out by bass and robotic beat sounds. Couple songs are good...if your into techno. I hate doing it but I was dissapointed in this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Engines Of....","review":"Some may like this, some may hate it. But I say when one puts out a stunning cd as his last effort 'Crystal Planet' why should the fans even be put in a position to be in a love/hate relationship with the next one? Some artists evolve w/ the times out of necessesity (KISS), others evolve to show they can, and that is what 'Engines' feels like. A try at something that isn't him. Sure there are good tracks like the opener and of coarse Borg Sex, but the majority of the cd flounders with an incredible boredom. If you like Satch and buy his stuff before you hear it, get ready to change that train of thought after hearing Engines Of [Creation]."},{"rating":"1","title":"what..go jump off a bridge pete","review":"you call KRS ONE bad rap?

I'm a devote Satriani fan but this album sounds like a empty soundtrack for a bad video game. Satriani's trademark is that ALL his music is marked with distinct melody and/or the powerful songwriting. The lack of any \\"real\\" drums and bass also contributes to the \\"emptiness\\" you get when you listen to this album. Listen to friend's copy before you lay down the cash.

The only place this album falls short is in the electronica itself. The backing tracks most times sound like demos that come with the sequencers. I think a much better overall product could have come from more concentration on backing sequences. I recently saw Joe live and the backing tracks translate much better to real instruments and make the songs much more powerful. I won't even attempt to compare this with previous albums; it's apples to oranges. Overall I would definitely recommend this album but beware that it will most likely take an open mind and several spins to appreciate it fully."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't be afraid","review":"It's easy to blow off this album if all you hear are the techno beats which are dominant on only four tracks. The direction this album takes really isn't that far from tracks on previous albums it's just know techno has a name. It is still Joe's classic style of music with some new sounds added. The same \\"radical departure\\" tags were hung on the self titled Joe Satriani as well as Crystal Planet.

A recent interview in Newsday Newspaper implies that this will be Joe Satriani's new direction.

More upsetting is that this is 'the new Joe' - and rock guitar fans will need to find a new super-hero..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, just not the Joe we know.","review":"Though EOC broke some barriers, all in all it is very lacking.

In fact, this album doesn't compare to his others even remotely.

'Crystal Planet' was a great disc. I also like techno.Combining techno with guitar chops isn't new or original. The best example of this, however, is Jeff Beck's 'Who Else!' CD. Joe's style simply doesn't fit into this genre as well as Jeff's does. This Satriani CD just appears to me as a reaction to the direction Jeff Beck is taking his music. The missing piece is the MUSICALITY. Joe is famous for the 'hook', that little guitar-sung chorus you can't get out of your head.You won't find any here. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brutal","review":"Not as bad as Steve Vai's latest... but close.

Interesting food for musical thought from the Bay Area's finest plank spanker in this new outing. A mix of styles and ideas mesh together to create a sonic soundscape of unique quality. Satch has once again reinvented himself by embracing elements of techno, hip-hop and dance. Die-hard widdlers may object to this new move but many will embrace it as Satch has. The big question though is how can he do it live? Will he tour alone with samples or a live band? The surfer surfs on into new territory. Open your mind!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Joe made a mistake","review":"yes, it's true. Joe made a mistake with this album. The songs are poorly written and the drum machine sounds downright awful.

With that being said though, this CD is chock full of BLISTERING LEAD WORK. If you are looking for the crunchy metal hooks ala \\"Surfing With the Alien\\" or \\"Crystal Planet\\", you WILL NOT find them here. The old, worn out metal themes have been replaced with dense textured synths, electronic drums, and synth guitars. This is absolutely the most original guitar recording to come out in a LONG time. The lead work is phenomenal (as usual), but this time it takes on an exotic, improvised jazzy feel. Standout tunes include \\"Devil Slide\\" with it's machine gun synth guitar rhythms and dueling solos, the atmospheric Rush styled \\"Flavor Crystals\\", and \\"Borg Sex\\" which digitally builds to an AWESOME solo climax. Joe certainly had his creative engines running full throttle and if you will listen with an OPEN mind, you will see that he has trailblazed a new path for instrumental guitar."},{"rating":"2","title":"the sound for the next century","review":"Well, maybe is not the clasic Satch sound, however I think is a masterpiece, like a combination of two music ways, first the renew guitar sound of a terrific artist and second the future sound of the electronic music, don\`t miss the 8th song, one of the best ever.

The girl I spoke with even asked her manager and he said there is no difference. Warranties are a tricky item to review, because it all looks good until you actually need it. So, on this one, I suppose only time will tell.

Think of Dune, for example. Sad to say, if Lucas had taken Brooks' novel as the basis for the Phantom Menace, instead of the other way around, next to nothing would have been lost. Aside from a couple of short scenes involving Anakin, the book was nearly identical to the movie. If that's what you're looking for, then you'll love the book.

There are a few places where useful technical information is imparted. If the book works at all it works as a reference.

Maul came off so completely un-menacing in this novel, the descriptions were non-existent, and the action was completely boring. I had no emotions while reading this book at all.

I was hesitant to start reading Star Wars books. Up until this book I hadn't gotten into the science-fiction genre. This book converted me. I could not put this book down. Unlike so many others, I really like the Star Wars prequels (I'll probably gets some dislikes for this admission). This book follows the movie verbatim but reveals so many extra tidbits of information that answer many heretofore unanswered questions. Terry Brooks is a stelar writer, and his vocabulary keeps things interesting; I actually had to look up quite a few words in this book. After reading this book I had to start reading other books in the Star Wars oeuvre, and I so much the happier for having done so. This is definitely a book I would recommend to friends and Star Wars enthusiasts alike. Worth the $7 I paid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I saw the movie, wanted to read the book.

There are serious creative limitations in translating screenplay to prose which Terry Brooks mostly copes with pretty well, though the characterization is a little superficial in places.

I think the problem is that George Lucas didn't write the book. Terry Brooks is a great writer, but couldn't go into much detail because of the movie. There are somethings he couldn't expand on because he didn't know what Lucas was thinking. If Lucas actually sat down and wrote the book himself or Terry the book would have surely got a 5 star rating.

This book is based on Lucas' screenplay, thus is very true to the story you saw on screen, down to the dialogue. In that way, this book is mostly dull and uninteresting. However, it does include many details about the relationship between characters such as Anakin and Padme, Obi-Wan and Qui-Gonn Jinn which you do not see in the film. There are a small handful of\\"~ 'scenes' that were not present in the film, but so few and far between that it is not worth reading the whole boring book just for those parts. This is one of those rare times where the book is NOT better than the movie. right now, I suggest letting the film speak for itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost as good as the movie","review":"If you've seen THE PHANTOM MENACE(and who hasn't!) and you read this book before you see the movie than you may be dissapointed when you see it.

Even though this is a great book I would definately recommend seeing the movie first just so you could visualize while you read. In conclusion, if you want to know a larger story on THE PHANTOM MENACE read this book but if you don't care about anything STAR WARS unless it's in the movies than don't bother with this or any other of the great STAR WARS novels , but you will regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT A SURPRISE!","review":"I purchased this book to find out more about Carolingiam modulation. What a pleasant surprise! With its unique, almost experimental methodology, this book demonstrates truly interdisciplinary approach in discussing different aspects of the Carolingians.The author's fluid writing style takes us into seemingly an overwhelming world of architectural historic styles, literature and poetry, philosophy and mathematics. And yet, we are never lost for a moment, but carefully reminded to maintain our focus to modulation.In addition, numerous line drawings of architectural plans and visual poems are effectively incorporated as supporting materials to analytical discussions of selected monuments.I strongly recommend this book as a rare example of never forced but genuine interdisciplinary study of the early medieval culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Romance story","review":"Barbara Cartland enhances the romance with this story.

Many of the moves are done in front of the step, facing the step, so your back is to the TV, so you can't see what she is doing... I watched this video twice before attempting the first 3 segments, and still was only able to do 50% of the routine-with constant rewinding.

All of which means this album is pretty cool. I'd like to tell you it sounds to much like an AIC knockoff, but I can't.

It is perfect corollary of the first statement. It looks like the author has already came up with a 'thesis' and then pick and choosed those recipes which suited her viewpoint.

Someone should hit him in the face with a shovel. Or, as Gaslin would write it, in the face with an xBox(tm) or a can of Mountain Dew(tm) or something else with a \\"tm\\" at the end of it. This isn't really violence, since Beemer isn't really a person -- just a one-dimensional idea. He's the kind of person a shallow person thinks he is. Beemer thinks he's special because his desperation is loud and narcissistic. Would that he were right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Assembly is horrible!","review":"Got the product and took it out of the box! OMGosh, so many pieces. And the hardware for the assembly is scattered in many many different bags. You would think they would have packaged the pieces that match eachother together in seperate bags. Not put the same pieces in many different bags. The hardware for the drawers is PLASTIC!!! what the heck is the deal with that....plastic!? Seriously!? It also chips and scuffs easily, the instructions for assembly was horrible as well, I have put together alot of furniture and this one was by far the worst!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Hold Up","review":"I have had this product for a couple years now. I bought it originally for the sleek design for a relatively low price. Needless to say, it hasn't been worth it. The drawers cannot hold much weight (filled with ordinary summer clothes) and the finish comes off fairly easily. The side panel is currently separating from the unit because of the weight of my TV. Overall, it is very attractive but not functional at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"They pass the savings and assembly hell on to you","review":"So I have been a member of amazon for 8 years and have never been driven to write a review until now... Yes the price is right but when your instruction manual references part number 278,,, yes 278... You know you're in for trouble. Plus the manual reads like an aircraft repair guide... Argh! But anyway, I agree with the other reviews about construction quality... Fair at best,,, particle board covered with a coat of lacquer... Not strong and not durable,,, but it looks nice and for the price what do you expect. I just didn't expect to have to assemble every piece of drawer hardware, 2.5 hours for me and then have to put in all the sliders and then finally the actual unit,,, 4 hours easy... If south shore would just send it partially assembled then assembly would have been much easier... Good luck,,,Just have a six pack handy and a free afternoon... you'll need all of it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Experience...","review":"...and I am not even talking about the actual product!

It took me 3 weekends to put it together (even though I am pretty good at putting stuff together) and once I was finished the drawers didn't even line up! one drawer is so tight it hardly even pulls out! There was a step where I had to screw through plastic, and had to call the help line to see if I was doing it right. Nothing about this product is quality.

The first thing I pulled out of the box had a broken corner and it just got worse after that. A drawer front had a big chip right on the front and the piece for the base was broken in half.

I'm slightly happy with my purchase because the price is inexpensive. However, all of the drawers are slanted. I followed the assembly instructions exactly, and it looks sloppy. Also, there were many chips and bent corners, as though the board had been dropped. If I had known it would look like this, I would have spent a little more for a better dresser. I also bought two matching bed stands and the drawers slant in the same direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Experience","review":"This is the WORST dresser ever sold.

The drawers don't line up and it wasn't due the assembly because both rows of drawers are off equally. They also left out he back of the dresser so we have to wait for a replacement.

However, if you follow the directions explicitly and carefully (and read ahead to ensure you're using the correct screws/nails/etc.) all of the pieces fit together, and seamlessly. There were 2 places on each drawer where you had to screw through an existing hole in one piece of wood into another piece without a hole. Yes, this was a bit more difficult than screwing into a pre-drilled hole, but nothing a 130-lb woman like me couldn't do.When everything was assembled, the dresser was sturdy, the drawers fit in nicely, and was big enough to hold my husband's clothes.This is an EXCELLENT product, if you have the patience to assemble it.

I regret buying this item but you get what you pay for now not only did I spend the money to buy this dresser now due to it falling apart and the drawers are coming apart now I have to spend money to get a new one.

It took me over two days to put this thing together because nothing fit and everything kept falling apart. I put it together two weeks ago and because the drawers would not stay together I had to get my own nails and nail some of them into the boards. But just today, I opened a drawer just to have the piece of crap fall apart on me!!! The directions were a little backwards too. Some of them said to put a few pieces in before putting screws in but then the screws wouldn't go in after the other pieces were in. What the heck?! The holes that were already made into the boards were too big for the screws and other pieces to even stay in there. They just kept falling out.

I've always done cardio on an empty stomach everyday (no days off from cardio) Strength training 6 days a week. I decide I could try some of the things Mike mention for 4 weeks. If there is 52 weeks in a year what's four weeks. I began strength training 1st thing in the morning two lower body exercise, 2 exercises for chest and back, and 1 exercise for smaller muscles. No cardio for four weeks. I lost 3 lbs in 3 weeks (I also started my menstrual cycle during this time. I usually put on 3 to 5 lbs of water weight) I'm so excited!

HOWEVER... the SDK documentation is lacking and some basic information on using the 3DS MAX plugins, etc. is completely missing. With a lot of experimentation I managed to export levels, but such basics as how to create doors, platforms, etc. are not in either the book, the tutorial, or the Web site. Bottom line: if you want tech info on game programming with OpenGL, this is an OK book. If you want to play around with the SDK, you're better off downloading CrystalSpace from SourceForge - it's better documented!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly worth my time","review":"The book is ok if all you want to learn is theory. If you really want something that shows you the ins-and-outs of realtime 3d processing, this book isn't for you. I felt like there were too many topics covered and the important ones were skimmed over. There is a total lack of practical example code as well - don't bother looking at the FlySDK either - it's a waste of time.The final straw was when I had to learn BSP techniques. This book had maybe 10 pages on the topic, no real code, only a sample formula that made no sense. I did some research on the Internet and found supporting information and better formulas (for free, mind you) that helped me to understand and formulate my own BSP algorithm. I went back and looked at the section in the text again and found how much was really left out of the BSP section and it was shameful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bugs, Errors, Typos, broken code... doh!","review":"Although the book itself is very promising and states the basic concepts of a 3D grphics library, I still don't recommend this book at all. Why? Because if you buy a book that is built onto a SDK, you also want to USE the SDK (otherwise you buy another book that just tells you about the concepts). If now the authors provide you with tutorials and utilities to convert - let's say - 3D Studio MAX - files into their own level-filetypes things seem to be ok. But if you finally realize that the provided utilities are not working, the MAX-export-plugins have to be (a) installed in a different way they tell you and (b) still cause MAX to crash when you do not work with a simple box (how interesting!), you get really mad. After trying around for several hours I gave up and had a nice christmas-campfire.In the past months a lot of VERY good books were released on this topic, you are better off with one of these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why you should not buy this book!","review":"This book has many spelling errors for one. Second, after reading this book you would have learned nothing about building your own 3D game engine. This book teaches you how to use the fly3D engine and does a bad job of that. If you want to learn how to make your own 3D games then you are going to want to get OpenGL game programming and both Game Programming Gems books. This is truly a waste of money, don't say I didn't warn you. I don't see how anyone could use this as a reference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Source Bad book","review":"The source for this book is for an entry level 3D engine, which is just what I wanted. But a lot of the theory (coll det etc) in the source is not explained in the book. Rather than explaining fundamental aspects they seem to throw in loads of detail about the topics that they dont seem to have covered and taken for lots of articles that you can find on the web (gamasutra for one).Saying that the source is nice and taught me a lot, bsp trees + a bit about collisions. Im glad I have the source but the book seems thrown together and shabby. I just think they could have done a better job making it readable starting 3D engine book rather than a shabby reference book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This ones nothing to brag about...","review":"... I agree with some of the previous negative reviews. I find the flow of the text unpleasant and the book lacked an introduction - where's the pedagogy? It seems as if someone with competence in the field but without alot of forethought just sat down and wrote it, and Addison Wesley didn't bother to have an editor help out in any way. Anyway, this book is in line with the rest of Addison-Wesley's books. Half of the courses that I take require textbooks from Addison Wesley. The courses are always difficult thanks to these second rate books. I recommend Wiley above all publishers but stay away from Addison Wesley if you can. They just dont seem to give a smack about the quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"...to those who write reviews and those who read them","review":"I've read reviews on this book by others.

I like the fact that 99.9% of the time there is a happy ending where the main characters live happily ever after. However, I like the space between the first page and the happily ever after to have some conflict, character development, and plot. This book contains none of these. As far as I can tell, the \\"story\\" is a excuse for the Author, whom I've read and enjoyed many times before, to illustrate how many different sexual acts she can describe in flowery detail. If you buy historical romances for the sex scenes buy this book. If not, don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"It had it's moments","review":"I must say that I that out of the seven books that I've read in the Cynster series this is one of the best. Actually I've only liked three. I find that Mrs. Laurens spends intirely too much time focusing on the sexual aspect of the each relationship. Seven sex scenes that are at least five pages long is out of control. It's like that's the only way anyone knows how to express there love, not so much actions and deeds. It's crazy. All that said, this book along with Devil's Bride and Scandal's Bride were the most straight forward. Simon and Portia communicated better as a couple better than any of her other characters in her previous novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"A \\"Perfect Bore\\"","review":"I found this latest installment of the Cynster series to be dreadfully lacking. Where is the sexual tension and buildup? There is none. The subplot (murder) was equally lacking in tension. Indeed, I could not bring myself to really connect or care about any of the charactors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and Formulaic","review":"This story is not up to the standards of previous books in the Cynster series. I found it repetitive and ultimately boring. I might not have been so disappointed if it had been issued as a paperback, but I feel that the publisher lured me into buying an inferior product at more than twice the cost of previous books. I just hope that she returns to previous form in her new series, The Bastion Club."},{"rating":"1","title":"Finally, an end to the Cynsters!","review":"I had one MAJOR problem with this book -- Simon and Portia have pages of discussion with themselves about what they are feeling and should they/will they connect with each other -- who cares!There's these 3 page long monologes with each one thinking about if it's gonna work, should they, could they, blah-blah-blah. I would get into the story and then, BAM, another long monolog ...frankly, they just needed to shut up.I was also recommended ALL FOR LOVE...Lucifier's story. I just never got into it.

Ho hum.I did not think the sex scenes steamy in any way.Anyway, just my 2 cents."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Lover","review":"I actually thought this book was really interesting, and the background story going on was fun too. I thought with every encounter with Simon and Lauren just made the sexual tension between them steamier and steamier. Yes, there were parts that I skipped, but I feel like Laurens does that in most of her books = putting way too much detail, or going off topic into something else, or describing someone's thoughts a million times. It certainly wasn't the best book by her I read, but it was NOT the worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Plot.....","review":"Seemed like the plot was just an excuse to string together a series of sex scenes. Not Ms. Laurens best effort. Wait until it comes out in paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad house party","review":"I love Ms. laurens novels especially those involving the Cynsters. This was just not in the same class as her other books. There were no visits from any of the other Cynsters even though one of their own was in danger, which is totally unbelievable. There was a murder and I really didn't care who did it. There was sex with no romance or even dialogue between the main characters. If Simon commented one more time how glad he was she did not engage in useless chatter I was going to scream. Honestly I don't know why I finished it except maybe I thought I would get a Cynster update in the end, even for diehard fans this book is not worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I have read a lot of books by Stephanie Laurens, where the character are well thought out and appealing. This book lacked feeling. I felt nothing for the characters, no compassion, no sparks. Just ink on a page. The characters seemed to just be at a party, and they both decided that it was time to look for a marriage partner, and since they knew each other, (even though they didn't like each other) then why not I. The B story was lacking also, the characters had no depth and you did not care what happen to them. Don't waist your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!!!!!","review":"I was impressed with the first books in this series, but this one is very disappointing.

This book however is really lacking her usually style and humour. You know in the first 10 pages how it's going to turn out --- there's a semi-interesting mystery (ala Amanda Quick) thrown in the middle, but that's the only interesting piece in the book at all. I almost stopped reading it 1/4 of the way through because it was just boring and completely predictable (in an overdone, not comfort food) kind of way. Here's hoping her next book is better..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely \\"A Perfect Lover\\"","review":"I've read the whole Cynster series.

It's about sex, and sex and more sex! If you enjoy steamy sex, ok... then go ahead and spend your hard earn money on this book. I find the story utterly ridiculous and unrealistic. If Portia is intelligent, independent and is strong willed, then I find it highly unlikely for such a lady to allow a man (worse, a man which she has very low opinion on)to teach her sexual intimacy and the pleasures of it. I have wasted my money on this book but I console myself that at least her sexy scenes are not too bad. So, my advise?? Stay away from this book. I am sure there are other books which provide good plot with some romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Inasmuch as I dearly loved all the other Cynster books, I found this one lacking. I truly had to force myself to finish this book. There was no spark at all to keep me entranced. I missed the family interaction that was in the other books. Simon may be a Cynster in name only because he sure doesn't act like one. Was he adopted??? Portia is an intelligent woman whose priorities are skewed. I think this series is done...time to move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Perfect Bore","review":"I have all of the Bar Cynster books. I was excited when I saw this on the newsstand, but very disappointed in the book itself. I would compare this book to a pornographic movie that has no plot just mindless, boring sex. There was no romance here, just graphic repeated sex. Not even real love demonstrated. The plot was good but it was constantly upstaged by the sex that seems a little farfetched to believe that Portia's reputation was not ruined by her behavior. I lost all respect for both Portia and Simon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rumba New York:The way it's always been.","review":"Growing up in New york many years ago I had first hand experience of playing this kind of percussion.

Not only a detailed catalog of what's available, the book also does a great job of suggesting how best to use each type of record to reach your goals.If you are a US resident researching your Irish ancestors, there is a decent section pointing out which US records may be of assistance. The book seems written in general, though, for those who live in Ireland or are otherwise able to get there to do research.

My sister has one as well hers went out right at the one year mark and they again want to charge $175.00. Sounds like they have a lack of customer satisfaction skills.

Both my kids are very different yet this book touched on each of their challenges with practical and thoughtful advice as to how to address the different phases that each child went through. Many times, I followed their guidance, sometimes not sure if it would work, and was always pleased when it did! I give this gift to all my friends who are at this stage and always get an enthusiastic response after they have read it. It was truly my guidebook for these years and is dogeared from use! I highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good advice for that first year","review":"I highly recommend this book to anyone sending their kid off to college.

It DOES project nicely onto the walls and celing. The images are colorful and not scary. It plays music as it turns. It's wind up which is nice for not having batteries, but I'd prefer a plug in so that it wouldn't wind down and be done in minutes.All in all I have no regrets about this purchase. My daughter likes it, and it's durable and works how it said it would... it's great until I find that perfect one that is like this but goes all night long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great...Try a different brand!","review":"This isn't that great... The room has to very dark for it to work very well, and at best the images are pretty indistinct and boring--just colored shapes trying to be pictures.

C'mon. It's a wind up unit which lasts barely a few minutes, no where near enough time to be enjoyable, and the brightness level is deplorable. You need to place it as high to the ceiling as you can get it reasonably for it to project a decent 'light show', and my boys room gets pretty darn dark. This is product number 2 from Discovery that is just some overpriced chinese junk. I'm OUT! Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has potential","review":"This does not plug in. It is battery operated. It only stays on for a few minutes and then you have to wind it again. You cannot have just the light. You have to have the light and sound together.

Bose can sell its product for whatever it wants to retailers but they in turn should be allowed to sell it to their customers for whatever price they wish. This policy is decidedly unfriendly to consumers as they are paying higher prices than what would be offered normally in a competitive marketplace.

The user simply places the iPod in the dock and plugs the unit into the wall. The sound is amazing and comparable with other Bose speakers I've heard. My friend remarked that he needed an empty field to fully test its limits. The slim remote contains the minimal iPod controls and functions well. The iPod also charges while in the dock.This unit can be easily moved around the house and, with care, occasionally transported away from home. When my Sound Dock arrived, I moved my old stereo and speakers to the basement and cleared lots of room in my apartment. Those heavily into music hardware may dislike this system due to its simplicity and lack of expandability, but this is ideal for my circumstances and worth the considerable cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"well worth the money","review":"If you are thinking about turning your iPod into a sleek home stereo, this is the gadget to choose. Well designed and sounding terrifc we have come to expect no less of the Bose engineers. The design is absolutely simplistic, an aspect that puts it above the comeptitors on the market already - the system itself has only volume control buttons, everything else is done through the iPod unit you plug in, or through a remote, which should look familiar if you own a Bose waveradio. These feautures make it really, eally easy to use. What will ultimately convince you to buy this system is the superior sound it puts out - listen and compare, it has no equal.I gave it 4 out of 5, because it only supports iPods from Gen. II on and it is only available in white, not in black. Absolutely no other complaints about this great product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy the sounddock","review":"The Sounddock sounds very good--when it works. LOL!!!!!! Works intermitently only.

Some of the reviews I had read made me concerned about sound quality, but my wife was really excited when she found out that she was getting a Bose. They're supposed to be the best, right? We turned it on, and we were both very disappointed with the sound quality. It sounded like more like speakers in an alarm clock-radio than a $300 unit. We took the Bose back to the store and bought an Altec Lansing inMotion IM7 speaker system for $50 less. The sound was rich and full, and the remote allows you to adjust bass and treble. Very much improved from the Bose. About all that I can say positive about the Bose is that it is a better looking unit than the IM7.

After professional installation the unit was easy to pair with my Motorola MPx 220 SmartPhone, but then I realized that you have to pair it everytime you start the car. kind of defeats the purpose of this unit as I was expecting to be able to lerave the phone in my bag in the back seat/trunk.Beyond that it has minor functional problems. When you pick up a call it says, \\"Call Ended,\\" but the caller is picked up and talking. It takes a few seconds for the microphone to pick up your voice so you get to play the; \\"Hello? Hello? Are you there? Can you hear me? game for a minute before actually being able to converse.All in all, I wish Motorola had done the install so they could help me troubleshoot it onsite.A bad-buy. Perhaps the Nokia kit would have been a better purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so much","review":"I bought this based on other folks reviews, and had it professionally installed into my older Cadillac. The sound quality coming out of the speakers was great, lame that it didn't support A2DP but shame on me for not catching that- the bad part was the microphone pickup. We moved that thing all over the car to try to get something that didn't make me sound like I was calling them from a tin can in Australia, and no dice.

The sound quality on both ends is phenomenal. When my husband calls me, despite the fact we have a pretty loud Mini with a manual transmission, I can hear him as if he's holding the phone to his ear in a library! I would highly recommend this product, especially for those people who find themselves juggling more than one task in the car at once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product.

It confuses the names of your contacts if you use short voice tags, I fixed this using name and last name for my voice tags (contacts) so instead of using just \\"john\\" I started using \\"john smith\\" and it started working just fine. The sound is clear, the system is easy to use and definetely beats talking with the phone in your ear. Sometimes people in the other side of the line start complaining about the quality of the sound but normally works just fine. I have it installed in a F-250 Diesel so probably part of the problem is my truck is just too noisy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't hear my singing over music","review":"I was soo happy to get this, but we had to return it, because you have to turn the volume up so loud that you can't hear my voice, even with the MIC turned all the way up.

It made me sad to have to take it back and I hope we can find another one like it. I thought mine was defective and tried to exchange it but they ran out of new ones. Now I see a lot of people must have the same problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this!","review":"Got this from Santa at Costco. Quality not bad overall but camera quality poor. The audio level on the karaoke cd over powers the mic level. (even with A.V.C.) You can not adjust the mic level alone. It is built into the master volume. The mic that comes with the unit needs to be yelled into just to hear your voice over the music. We are returning it tomorrow!Gonna try a different model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Karaoke you can't hear","review":"Agree completely with the prior review. Even at maximum microphone volume you can not hear the karaoke vocals. Pretty much defeats the purpose of a karaoke machine.

However one of the microphones broke after 3 months, the color started going in and out after 4 months and now is completely out. It's not worth the extra money to have the tv/dvd component since it is only black and white. Also you have to have the sound up pretty high to hear your voice through the speaks. For a 9 year old it is fine and she loves it, but it doesn t' work the way it should. There are so many other options I do not recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"only ok, and only when it's working","review":"This was a present for me since I love to sing. It works ok for karoke--but only when it works. It often has a cd error, or says there's no cd when there is. It's a huge waste for anything else, since the screen is so small. It's heavy and hard to move. The mics it comes w/ are terrible. I am able to adjust the volume and use a separately purchased wireless memorex microphone that sounds good w/o having to be right up against your mouth. When it works, it's fine for an at-home w/ the family or a few friends karoke night, but we're shopping for a new system that will play all the discs ALL the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Primarily lists low-fat and \\"lite\\" foods.","review":"Of all the fat/calorie/cholesterol count books I've seen, this has been the least helpful. The inclusion of brand names for the listed food items is nice, however the vast majority of foods are those already reduced, or naturally low, in fat and calorie content.

I've been happy with other Twinlab products for years.Sadly, I've learned about a serious problem with this B vitamin product. It contains the wrong form of B12--cyanocobalamin. According to the information I've received, this form cannot be digested without stealing methyl needed for other purposes. The form of B12 that is usable and best digested by the body is methylcobalamin. For most people taking B12 orally is not as effective as sublingually, or better yet, in a patch. I'm sorry I've been taking this, as it seems that taking cyanocobalamin could be worse for my usable B12 levels than taking no supplement at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rock Excursion for Celtic Singer","review":"John has done a number of really good albums, focussing on accoustic Celtic and Celtic style music. I always look forward to finding more CDs he has put out. However, this CD appears to have been a change in direction for him--much more rock-influenced and electric. I have pretty wide tastes and I like a lot of rock music, but unfortunately, this genre doesn't seem to be his strength. He doesn't perform rock well and the music is pretty boring, if loud and electric. If you like his other stuff, you will probably be disappointed by this. If you are looking for a rock album, or a celtic-influenced rock album, there are many better places to look."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent resource for quick and easy lookup","review":"Compiled by Nancy M.

I'd describe it as a 'driving cd'. That is, A. I love driving and listening to it. and B. The music is hard charging, towering and powerful. It drives me. And the lyrics are cool too. I had never heard of A Static Lullaby until I bought this CD because Amazon recommended it and I listened to samples here before purchase. But now, I love them. And, the songs on the album stand individually as great songs, but I don't think I have EVER skipped a song on this CD, or stopped it before listening to each and every song. Even now, after owning it for several years, I still sometimes listen to it twice in a row, all the way through, when driving. Hell, now I have to got put it in and listen.

Kids, much like us adults, have their own preference anyway. So, I let my toddler watch it. He loves it! The shows do not have very dull moments which is great because kids, especially toddlers, have very short attention span. The show teaches good values and lessons. It teaches words in a variety of languages which adds to the fun. I don't quite expect TV shows to teach foreign language thoroughly anyhow.

The characters are kinda weird looking, the stories are not realistic (the episodes occur in Toyland), and they teach kids words in different languages, but never the words or the same language. I remember one word being Russian, and they also said a word in Swahili. I guess that makes it educational but I'm just not sure there is much use in my son knowing how to say a bunch of random words in all different languages."},{"rating":"2","title":"My First Linda Hall book, but not my last!","review":"This is the first of Ms Hall's books I have read - don't know how I missed them for so long as I am an avid mystery reader!

A friend lent me this book, and frankly, I couldn't put it down. I stayed up until the early hours of the morning reading it. The story is believable and engaging, the characters have depth and are complicated like people in real life, and the religious aspects of the story are very natural--not simply tacked on. The implied criticism of the judgementalism of some Christians is also well done. I'm ordering the next book in the series and hope Linda Hall will write more soon! Thanks for a good read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The First In A Great New Series by Linda Hall!","review":"Like all of Linda Hall's mysteries, Steal Away is a wonderful story penned along uncharted territories of new and unknown paths that are trodden with intrigue and suspense-a weaving of twists and turns that nearly make you dizzy...nearly. Steal Away is peopled with believable personalities which communicate the complexities of life: love, guilt, shame, pain and sorrow, regrets, greed, betrayal, compassion and joy. Clues are dropped thoughtfully throughout the story.

Linda Hall's best book yet. This novel is complex, compelling, and the story is intricately woven into the lives of the exceptional characters Ms. Hall has created. The mystery will grab you and keep you guessing until the very satisfactory ending. Personalities spring to life throughout this book, each of them with their own set of problems and secrets, which build the escalating mystery to a fine pitch. This is the best book I've read in years. I can't wait for Ms. Hall's next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD NEW AUTHOR","review":"This is the first time I have read this author. The plot is good and kept me guessing until about halfway through. THe author gives hints through out the story.

She absolutely loves it and is willing to watch it over and over. I generally don't want her watching TV because it numbs the brain. This however is an exception because it is very educational.I also like the fact that it is not overly polished like so many TV shows are.I noticed that some reviewers complain that it is boring to them.

By her second birthday, she could sing the alphabet all the way through [and delighted family and strangers alike doing it!].

It is entertaining enough to keep their attention, and when they walk away from it, they've been educated!I gave this to a friend of mine whose 4 year old still didn't know her alphabet.

His unauthorized biography of Jimmy Connors, based on much painstaking research and numerous personal interviews with Connors, paints a picture of a great athlete, but one who is both inspiring and disturbing at the same time. Drucker intertwines his own personal story with the career of Connors, and both make for fascinating reading. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in sports and life in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a kick","review":"This book is a kick to read, especially if you are of the age to remember most of the matches and the circumstances surrounding them; and if your not you'll find out what tennis used to be all about. I like the way Drucker wound his story throughout without getting in the way of, or better yet, co-opting the Connors story. The two seemed to intertwine seemlessly. Like others have said, it brought back a time when tennis had a meaning beyond the game and players, specifically Connors, that transcended sports. Lest we forget, Drucker has reminded us of those times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly nauseating","review":"I coudn't agree more with the Amazon review here by Milacik Najdrahsi - I, too, was very much looking forward to reading this, having idolised Connors as a teenager myself, but this book is one of the worst I have ever read, a horrid, self-regarding author's ego trip, replete with the worst kind of American psycho-babble and pitiful philosophising about personal family difficulties, self improvement and the pursuit of 'success'. There is a prolonged, ghastly, obsequious chronicle of a highly ambiguous and suspect 'friendship' with Connors together with endless, embarrassing accounts of Mr. Drucker's own laughable tennis exploits (or 'career', as he likes to call it), with some atrocious writing to boot. It was extremely painful to cringe my way through to the end. I like to think that if Connors himself has read this he would have found it as loathsome as I did.

The prologue was the best part of the book. It started out with an explosion of character involvement and then the fire went out. She failed to give the reader a true insight into the main characters. I was hard pressed to understand why the two main characters were attracted to each other. I could only assume it was because they were trying to save a small company. There was no \\"electricity\\" between them. She had numerous secondary characters that never stood on their own. I read the entire book in one weekend, only because if I put the book down, I could not remember who was who. I hope the real JAK comes back to us soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Took this one back to Borders....","review":"Hmmm.. not up to her usual, didn't like the hero at all.. seemed like a Jerk..

I love her novels as Quick and Castle also, but I must agree with previous reviews. JAK has found a formula that worked for her in the beginning: Deep Waters and Absolutely Postively. But now the books seem to be all the same. The two main characters give off the same persona that are the same in each book. But the quality of her books has not gotten any better, especially her last couple of books. I would wait for this one to come out in paperback...unless you simply can not live without your JAK fix"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH THE MONEY - EVEN IN PAPERBACK","review":"This book is a far cry from the author's novels written in the 1980's. This reads more like a beginner's endeavour than a seasoned artist. To call the characters two dimensional is giving them too much credit. Shallow characterization and a weak, weak story line. Her last three books have all the same story line and each has been worse than the last. I will not buy another new book. I may not even bother to check it out of the library. A total, total disappointment! Unfortunately, Amazon requires at least one star in the \\"rate\\" field or I would have given it ZERO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Krentz hits all time low with Soft Focus","review":"Jayne Ann Krentz does not write page-turners. Her books are light entertainment. As Krentz has moved her emphasis away from the romantic, towards suspense, her breezy style has turned against her, but never more so than in her most recent offering, Soft Focus. The relationship between the hero and heroine can't save you from a mystery that is as fatuous as it is boring and predictable. This book is not mysterious, suspenseful, or romantic. What's left? Recommendation: send a message to the publisher with your credit card; do not buy this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a keeper","review":"This latest book of Jayne Ann Krentz is a far cry from her usual style of writing. I've read every one of her books and was disappointed by this recent release. Her books have always been enthralling, entertaining and a true joy to read. Soft Focus was very different from her other books. While the use of crude language itself did not bother me, it was out of context with the story. The action between the main characters was disjointed. There was no strong feeling of romance between the characters nor was there much development of the characters love for each other. The story did not flow nor did it make any sense. Being a fan of Krentz, I would still purchase any book she writes, but this one is not one to save to read again. The style is so different from her other work that it is as if someone else wrote it. Wait for it to come to your local library rather than purchasing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mechanical repeat of JAK's usual plot","review":"I've been reading JAK since I first found her as Jayne Castle and have spent many enjoyable hours hunting down her work under all her pen names. She has been one of a very select number of authors I buy in hardback, but no longer.I agree with a previous reviewer, you always know the issues and basic characters in a JAK book, but they used to have more life and spontaneity. For me, her last 3, 4 or even 5 novels have been stilted, blurred copies of her earlier body of work.Although I will continue to buy her books, hoping for her old style, I won't buy them in hardback. I recommend first time readers try some of her earlier books, in paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not up to JAK's standard","review":"I, too, have read most of JAK's books and especially appreciate her Amanda Quick historical genre. But, Soft Focus was a disappointment partly because I paid full hardback price for a \\"too pat\\" story that would be acceptable only if I had found it in the used paperback or reduced price tables. I am tired of the lack of commitment before sex---stupid, dangerous examples for us validate by buying Krentz novels. Also, the dialogue was \\"not fun\\" or witty. I kept falling asleep but usually I read romances all through the day and night. My advice is to wait for a paperback, as I will on the next Krentz. Where oh where has one of my favorite writers gone? ( Guess I'll revert back to Garwood, Devereaux, and McNaught for the new hardbacks! )"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"As a long time fan of Krentz, I was extremely disappointed in Soft Focus. I usually cannot put her books down once I begin to read. This, unfortunately, was not the case with this book. It has no continuity. The writing is very choppy. And sex,(real and imagined) seems to be put in places just to fill up space. Jayne, if you read this, please get back on track. I love the Quick books, as well as the flower series (Amaryllis et al)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleepytime","review":"It took effort to finish this boring, drawn out story. When the end came I had forgotten the purpose of the beginning. Jack is a macho businessman, Elizabeth is a power business women. The main subject is a crystal, named Soft Focus that is stolen, and throws them together in a search they don't seem to take very serious. Noir film festival comes into play, not exciting or mysterious. This book almost made my Waste of Time rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Un-baked cake...","review":"I used to really enjoy JAK, but her recent books have been less than wonderful. This book almost pushed me to give up on her. It's as if she doesn't care about character development or emotional intensity. I got the impression she was writing a Harlequinn novel (no offense to Harlequin fans) or that she had a deadline to get a book out.

Try Linda Howard, if you want to remember what JAK used to be like..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Next Book Please","review":"Soft Focus was not JAK's best effort to date. I have read nearly all her works, relentlessly backtracking out of print editions. I Love her ablity to weave a mystery that all the clues are there, but leaves you guessing until the end. This did not happen in Soft Focus. The ending was a suprise only because it was unsupported. The charatures decissions to have a romantic relationship was very sloppy. And what about commitment? Sex without commitment is both supid and boring in a plot line. I await her next book with higher expectations!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Soft Focus","review":"I have been a fan of JAK for years and i got to say i'm a little disapointed at her latest. it lacks her earlier intensity. i feel that the character are underdeveloped and that overall it did not keep me from putting the book down. i usually have to keep reading to find out what happens next, but this book was too predictable and dry. i hope her next shows what she can do as a writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"plot not well flushed out","review":"Rather boring - I had a force myself to finish it (now I wish I hadn't). I just thought it would get better. Save your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I finally gave up on this book around page 200 and moved on. Can Krentz develop another plot other than the Seatle business man, saving a family business? She did it best with Wildest Hearts and she has failed to live up to that success here. Even the love scenes were boring, well, actually nonexistant and the characters were flat. Skip this book and save yourself the boredom."},{"rating":"2","title":"jak does it again - better than ever","review":"I could not put this book down. The book was fast paced, fun, and the charcter development was like only JAK could do. The plot, a white color crime that the police could not be brought into takes the main charcters, Jack and Elizabeth, on an chase that kept me guessing what and who would happen next. I loved all the charcters introduced in this book - they felt real. The worst part of this book was that it ended - I wanted the story and charcters to go on forever- Jayne did it again - a keeper for all JAK fans!"},{"rating":"1","title":"God(dess) in the machine?","review":"Too formulaic and a great disappointment.

Other of Burke's books are much, much better. This book is really about one stubborn family, the Sonniers. It doesn't really have a purpose to it. It is slow paced and boring. I was looking for more pages when it ended because I couldn't believe that was it. It was a big let down after finishing A Morning for Flamingos which is fantastic. Skip A Stained White Radiance and read something else by Burke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Show me the story !!!","review":"This was my first Burke. Great character depictions, but little story.

Burke has quickly become one of my favorites authors; too bad it took me so long to start reading his work. Dave Robicheaux is simply a good, tough guy. He's fair, flawed yet balanced, determined, strong and justice-minded. This book has several interweaving stories within one overall deep plot. Robicheaux faces off against organized crime, white supremacists, and a family with ties to both and several family secrets. All the while he is a great dad and husband, and true friend to Clete and Batiste. I'm stunned more of the Robicheaux novels haven't made their way to television movies or the big screen - the main character and the story-telling are that good and that engrossing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good publicity, not that good music","review":"Naulo's music is not really naulo.

A complete gem from 1985, this album was a huge smash in all the clubs during the period. The track 'Crazy For You' became somewhat of a gay anthem after being tagged 'an 80's Y.M.C.A' by Reamon Van Anal. That didn't stop the masses buying this and slammin on their leather jackets in the 80's, wether you were gay or not. Crazy For You is and undoubted classic, so if you're a fan of 80's hair metal this track is gonna rock your world!Also reccommended, 'Looking For Freedom' - The soundtrack to the falling of the Berlin Wall, and perhaps the only contender to this"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Be Put off by the Italian Text!","review":"Be AWARE that this guide is \\"written\\" in Italian -- but do NOT be intimidated by that fact.

I have no language skills and found it easy to use and quite indispensable. While it's difficult to have a truly bad meal in Italy, with this book it's amazingly simple to have a positively great one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Utterly breathtaking","review":"Although this is a concert performance rather than a fully staged one, there is no lack of drama. Everyone sings as though he or she WERE the actual character. Sets, costumes and movement are completely unnecessary when every emotion is displayed in the singers' faces and voices. Although the title role is typically taken by a tenor, Thomas Hampson is so invested in his performance and sings with such gorgeous tone that you can forget you ever heard a tenor in this part. Susan Graham is for me the DEFINITIVE Charlotte. She has just the right weight and tone in her voice (although others who have recorded the part on CD have been wonderful -- most notably, Tatiana Troyanos and Frederica von Stade -- their voices have been either too dark or too light). In addition, her performance, in particular, in Act III will break your heart. While all the other parts are well-taken, Sandrine Piau deserves special mention as the perfect Sophie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very funny","review":"I wasn't sure about this book, but this is a funny book.

The background instrumentals were decent, but several of the songs were chopped a bit, leaving out instrumental dance breaks or even entire verses of music. The biggest downfall, however, was the caliber of the background vocals on the karaoke disc. I myself would never use any of the tracks with vocal backgrounds on this disc professionally because they were actually under the pitch. No way will I sing with off-pitch vocals in the background. This disc might be good if you just want it for fun, since some people might not be bothered by that.

So, I figured it was a version of what I wanted.Unfortunately this dimmer is single-pole (per the packaging and I confirmed it does not have the third non-ground connectino necessary to work with the companion dimmers) so it is not what I wanted.I like Amazon (this if the first time in over 10 years of buying stuff through Amazon I'll be returning an item) and the Lutron dimmers (keep buying more)...but this is an unnecessary hassle I figured I'd warn others about."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Lutron Dimmers Save Energy","review":"I love this dimmer.

Then i noticed they changed the design - smaller light holes, heavier clicking action, seemed to be more reliable, and the smaller lights on the dimmer probably generates less heat than the previous design which is definitely a good thing. So as the old ones I had died off, I replaced them all with the new models. And guess what? They're starting to break too. Less frequently than the previous ones but breaking nonetheless. As they're dying i'm replacing them with regular on/off switches, I have yet to have one of those fail. YMMV of course, but just thought I'd share my experience - for the prices of these dimmers, they should last alot longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great - but unreliable","review":"I have 15 of these switches installed in my home. They were installed about 8 years ago. Most of them get very light use. They work great at first, but eventually the hardware in the switch breaks and the main button for turning the light on and off no longer works. For a $25 light switch, I expect the reliability to be much better. None of my $1 light switches have ever broken and they get much more use than the Lutrons in my house.Lutron customer service is helpful and is supposed to send me parts to fix the switches. But still, I should never need customer service for a light switch...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fancy Dimmer","review":"These dimmer switches are deluxe. Works fine for my 6 inch recessed ceiling lights, 6 total, two per dimmer. Although incandescent dimmers may go the way of the dodo bird, as florescents are the wave of the future, I am able to throttle down the lights enough that the three hundred watt draw goes to about 100 watts and the lifetime of the bulb is increased. The dimmers slowly dim when turning them down or off, but seems a little fast on the dimming to get you out of the area before it goes total dark.

As a business graduate of University of Pittsburgh Dental School, to say he lack the credentials to assess the theory of evolution is an understatement. While his argumentation is entirely pathetic, one must remember one thing, that like evolution, gravity is just a theory.

So, the bottom line is that this book presents the arguments for young-earth creation directed to Christians who are undecided on this issue or believe that evolution can be worked into scripture. The author presents good arguments why the Bible and evolution are not compatible. This is written with the average person in mind and not at a scientific level. It is definitely worth reading as a good intro to the topic.

Thankfully we've come a long way since then, and will go further still; science doesn't claim to have all the answers, but more are constantly being found.Martin is a dentist (though he did get his bachelor's in biology), not an paleontologist, geologist, or evolutionary biologist - and it shows. Buy this book if you want a young earth creationist worldview, but don't expect anything that will debunk the FACT of evolution.Remember the law of gravity?

With that said this book isn't really worth the money unless your scenario fits mine, not enough time and don't know what else to look at. I had to make above a 35/70 for an A and I barely did that. The book is a general overview of the concepts on the test but the test itself is very complex. There was many things on the test I hadn't ever seen before (reactions and reagents).

Her early hits were aggressive three-chord ditties like Can The Can, 48 Crash, Daytona Demon and Devil Gate Drive, all done in her shouting vocal style. Later she actually started singing and had hits with beautiful ballads like If You Can't Give Me Love and She's In Love With You. Her duet with Chris Norman of Smokie, Stumblin' In, is included here, as are interesting covers of classics such as Fever, All Shook Up and Steve Harley's Make Me Smile (Come Up And See Me). In retrospect, Quattro was quite original for her time and very successfully mined a pop-rock vein. Her contribution to the UK music scene in the 1970s was considereable and this album reveals her as a sensitive interpreter of intelligent compositions, in addition to the disposable pop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suzi was born to run...","review":"...and rock-n-roll! This is the only CD I know of featuring Quatro's version of Springsteen's \\"Born to Run\\", and it's worth a few bucks for this song alone. Most of the other selections, good ones mind you, can be found on the proper albums, but at least if you find this cheap you've got one solid rarity. \\"Make Me Smile\\" is a super-smooth come-on, \\"Mama's Boy\\" shows off Suzi's sassy side, \\"Daytona Demon\\" sounds like a cross between Joan Jett and T.Rex, and \\"Stumblin' In\\" is her buttery duet with Chris Norman(and her only big US single).

Buy this book - this senior statesman is at the top of his form."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps 7 years bad luck","review":"Although the idea of this work is interesting, it falls short in terms of providing an enjoyable and interesting read. Many of the events and characters seem to be too setup and unbelievable. The writer is trying to get into the mind of a master spy, a genius, but seems more like an average kindergarten student attempting to explain the mind of Shakespeare. As a result the characters, dialogue, plot, and pacing aren't capable of conveying the mind of Hanssan. The characters were quite flat and the reader is not able to make an emotional connection with any of them through the whimsical and juvenile writing. There certainly seems to be something missing in this work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sins of the flesh?","review":"Schiller's conceit here is misguided. The mirror references are tired, and Hansen's overbearing father is a cliche rather than a character.

Describing itself as non-fiction presented in the form of a novel, it fails miserably on both counts. Instead it's quite transparently a quickie translation of a television script into a junk book. And junk is no exaggeration as I found this so-called book remaindered for five bucks at an overstock store.Check out the helpful Amazon stats on this work and you'll find the writing is at the level of a 7th grader with the absolute minimum of multi-syllable words.The case of Robert Hannsen is absolutely fascinating, but this \\"book\\" definitely is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Schiller Fails to Tell the Story","review":"Schiller completely fails to tell what should be a best selling and exciting story.

I worked with Robert Hanssen at the FBI for over 18 years and this \\"historical novel\\" based on a screen play is mostly fiction made for TV. The book does not focus on Hanssen's espionage activities and is of no value to those who wish to find out more about perhaps the most damaging spy this country has ever had.

The combination of the two results in patterned noise (not related to ISO noise) in all photos. I have had the 580EX into Canon service once already, Canon admitted the problem and replaced parts. On return of the 580EX I tested the two again, but with marginal improvement. Canon service suggested returning both the 580EX and 30D for service, which I have done, and now waiting for their return. The 30D makes very sharp photos with no flash or with the pop-up flash on the 30D. This has been most frustrating as I purchased the 580EX at the end on Oct 2006 and today is Jan 11 2007. I can only assume I have had a problem with the 30D which never showed-up until adding the 580EX.

After searching several places for the best price on the 580EX I found that Amazon provided the best selection. The flash works great. After putting it through several tests, indoor and out, I have found it to perform to my expectations. I am leaving on a trip to Hawaii soon and am confident the pictures I take will be wonderful.

In spite of it's relatively small size, it is THE most powerful flash I've used of any brand. Having replaced a non-Canon brand flash that was supposed to work with the 30D but didn't, I could not be more delighted with the 580X. Whether you're shooting in AV, TV, P, or M modes, you will not be disappointed with its performance.

It is a five star product in all respects. As stated in a number of reviews it is a costly accessory but worth every cent. I did not read the reviews until after I ordered the 580EX. It seemed a sore spot with a number of the reviews was the battery compartment door and the difficulty in use. I found the directions straight forward and the door no different than most other battery compartments. One reviewer commented he had received a \\"Grey Market\\" version because the distance indicator was in meters and not feet. A quick glance at the instructions and the push of 2 buttons changes the readings from meters to feet. So you have the best of both worlds.

He could have pared the whole thing down to one inspiring quote. Instead, his repetitive rambling takes all inspiration out of his words. Truly, I love any book that inspires me or gives me ideas for working with children, but this book was AWFUL. The author also spends a lot of time tooting his own horn. I tend to roll my eyes when he does, because he makes ridiculous claims like, \\"I spoke with this child for ten minutes and he went from a high-school dropout to a brilliant doctor.\\" I made that up, but that's the gist.

This novel chronicles the general events that take place early in the Slayers Next TV series, but things are so different from the TV series interpretation that you'd hardly recognise them.But different doesn't necessarily mean bad and the differences are a refreshing change from what might be expected.

Ali fails to take this opportunity to address the well-known problems such as the grammatical and historical errors, and instead adds words throughout the text to make it more palatable to Western readers, in many places changing the meaning completely. In fact this distortion of the text should be considered blasphemy, if not for the fact that some adherents consider deception to be an acceptable means of advancing the cause.The fact that all reviews for this item seem to have been quietly removed perhaps speaks volumes about the plain meaning of its unadorned teachings, discomfort with what Ali has done, or the power of its adherents to silence doubts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is my book?","review":"I have not received my copy of this book yet...... do not know how to get in touch with anyone regarding this.

I don't give it a 5 star only because the English can be a little more updated to today's usage, and I've seen more beautifully written translations such as the one by Thomas Cleary.

Great care was taken in the translation. The commentaries are very helpful in explaining the context in which some of the verses are written, and they do not, in my opinion, reflect the thoughts of the translator, rather they are inspired. There is no blasphemy here in these pages, words added are always deliniated so as to be plain to the reader that they were added for understanding, they are not incorporated to appear as to be part of the Prophet's writings, may peace be upon him. All in all this is the most accessible translation of the Qur'an I have ever read, as it is faithfully translated from the Arabic.

Lovecraft film adaptions as a teenager, eventually getting both the Simon Necronomicon and the Necronomicon Spellbook. At the time I purchased this book I was pretty sure it was a hoax, as the author explains kind of early on. The Necronomicon has its uses both as Lovecraft's literary device, a prop in an entertaining B movie, and as an interesting occult grimoire. This book has everything on the Necronomicon anyone would want to know. Also some stuff on Aleister Crowley and Anton LaVey. The hoax is explained in all its infamy. The Necronomicon and maybe this book are must reads for those seriously interested in the occult. Be warned, though- this is some disturbing stuff.

When I put it down to go eat or take a phone call, I'd start thinking about when I'd be able to start reading it again.The book is about a girl Courtney and her life. Nothing extraordinary happens in the book, but the way it's narrated makes it a great read. Courtney's boyfriend, who is starting college, breaks up with her so they can be \\"free and clear\\" (which Courtney thinks sounds like something from a cell phone or a zit cream commercial).

When you purchase this set, you will get three CD's of great music made by guys that really knew music. Granted the third CD has some songs that were attempts to keep in step with the other bands of the late 60's and are not the greatest records cut by the group. However, Frankie Valli and The 4 Seasons made so many hits that the few that are not chart toppers do little to dilute the greatness of the collection. If you are a big fan of The 4 Seasons this is a good collection of their complete recording history. However, if you just want their well known hits, better get the Anthology, which has 26 classic songs. In my book, they are better then Beatles and many of the pop stars today.

It takes a little longer to spread the batter than a traditional pan, but it's not that difficult,... just work your way around using a spatula to push the batter out of the bowl into the pan, then pick up the pan and give it a couple of shakes to spread the batter to the edges. I generally use boxed brownie mixes and bake according to the minimum time, then allow it to sit for several minutes so that the edges harden while it cools. I use a bit of Crisco around the edges and the whole thing can pop out if you want to flip the pan.The only think I really don't like is that it is \\"hand wash only\\".

As it stands, our brownies had perfect edges on 2 or 3 sides - but all were of slightly different lengths when we cut them... - not the perfection the pan seemed to deliver in its message and a shame given the thought that was put into the pan.

You will definitely have to use the toothpick test. I recommend taking notes of your baking times the first time you make each of your recipes. I found that brownies took 2-4 minutes longer in this pan than they would in a normal pan with the same dimensions. This pan is well made and easy to clean. Overall I do recommend this pan for edge lovers. The negatives do not out weigh the positives. I think I will make some Brownies right now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great product","review":"What a great product. This thing is built like a tank. The description says \\"heavy gauge aluminum\\" and they mean it. This is not a flimsy piece of bakeware. Very nice look, no sharp edges, and it works as advertised. I've baked brownies and blondies in it. In addition to have at least 2 edges on every piece, I like the fact that you can basically cut a piece of as big or small as you like. The pan comes with a small plastic spatula that's sized perfectly this shape.I had read an earlier review saying that it was kind of a pain to get the batter into this pan. I was a bit leery when I read that, but decided to try it anyways. It does take a little extra time to pour the batter in, we're talking about maybe an extra minute. Using a spatula, it's really not that difficult. It's a fair tradeoff if you really like edges."},{"rating":"2","title":"Edge Browniw Pan By baker's Edge","review":"Best baking item I have ever purchased - soon bought a second one, and cannot live without them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for those that love the edges!","review":"I just received the Baker's Edge Nonstick Edge Brownie Pan as a gift for my father-in-law as he loves the brownies with corners and edges. But then I thought that I should also make a batch for him to have right away. Oh wait, maybe I should make a practice batch. I know, I'm bad!I liked that a regular brownie mix fit perfect, but that they also provided some recipes. It had a non-stick coating and it didn't stick. The spatula was a nice extra.Overall, it was neat. It was a little expensive for a pan, since the pans probably aren't mass produced. It seems to be a good, heavy aluminum pan. It was a gift and I would have spent that much anyway on something that he probably won't be this excited out.For those that love the edges on brownies, this is a good pan for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you love to bake, then you will HATE THIS PAN!!!","review":"The Seller for this item was outstanding & would buy from them again, but this pan is A NIGHT MARE TO USE.

In short, I very much dislike it. Everyone knows that the very best part of the brownie is the middle, and this pan all but eliminates this. After baking, there was approximately 6.4 cubic inches of actual edible brownie. Very wasteful.Quite frankly I am disappointed with this product and anyone who thinks an 'all edge' brownie is preferable to the warm, delicious center."},{"rating":"2","title":"edge brownie pan","review":"The edge brownie pan, although quite expensive for what it is, was a quite successful Christmas gift. However, one should note that if the female college student for whom you purchased it (I assume this is the target demographic) knows that it takes TWO (2) standard brownie mixes (and presumably a doubled regular recipe) rather than one (1).

The smaller boxed mixes require less time...so watch carefully the last 10 minutes :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Brownies Ever","review":"A friend had one of these and told us about it. When we received ours, we popped it out of the box, ran it through the washer and made brownies all in the same afternoon.

Everyone, especially my wife, was excited (I was excited because they were - I prefer the soft center cuts). I searched for it on the internet and, of course, Amazon was selling it for much less. My son purchased it as a Christmas present for his mother. She was delighted and it works as a advertised, producing perfect brownies with edge cuts in every bite. Everybody is happy, but me, as I am just not an edge man. But I am happy because everybody else is and because I'm more healthy for eating fewer brownies.

It bakes up beautifully, so evenly, and comes out of the pan easily. It is a little hard to get the batter in the pan evenly without dripping on the \\"sides\\" but it is well worth the extra care to do it.

It turned out better than great. Later I tried the brownie recipe that came with the Edge pan and it turned out dry and hard. I'm basically a \\"bake from scratch\\" person, but the packaged brownie mix combined with the Baker's Edge pan is really good and foolproof, and that's what I do now when I want brownies, and they are always good. If I had tried the recipe that came with the pan first I might have hated this pan. Don't give up on it. The lasagne recipe was great, too.

It is art theory, semiotics and Foucault in the same plate. Based on the analysis of Margitte's \\"This is not a pipe\\", he argues that modern art became autonomous from the language that lied buried in representational realism. While Klee and Kandinsky used abstraction to destroy syntax of the traditional (XV-XIX c.) visual art, Margitte used literalism to undermine itself.It is not an easy reading but since you have picked the book (for whatever reason you did so), I believe you will enjoy it. Take your time, don't swallow it all at once, consume the words along with the images in the back of the book and I bet you won't regret it.My favorite quote: \\"A day will come when, by means of similitude relayed indefinitely along the length of a series, the image itself, along with the name it bears, will lose its identity. Campbell, Campbell, Campbell, Campbell.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Fine","review":"Foucault's brilliant little text about the art of Rene Magritte is probably the closest to structuralism Foucault ever got. Looking at the two paintings of pipes by Magritte, Foucault interrogates the formal nature of representation itself. As a good semiotician, Foucault is incisive in separating the image from the text, the resemblance from the copy. This is a play of simulacta-although not as decisive as Barthes, Foucault is able to re-associate resemblance and affirmation. This curious little text also includes reflections on Klee, Kandinsky, and Apollinaire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something's afoot!","review":"The MP3 samples of the \\"Mr. Lucky Goes Latin\\" are NOT from named recording BUT are from the recording \\"The Latin Side of Henry Mancini\\" I am quite disappointed as I have been looking for the MLGL disc for quite some time.

Not only does this third rate amateur use a synthesizer to commit his evil crime against Mozart, but he can't even play the notes correctly! Thankfully, I didn't waste my money on this one. Unfortunately, my local library did, so I could witness first hand the butchering of truly fine classical music. Yeah, sure, so baby can fall asleep to it.

I rented this after having read The Devil In the White City and was hungry for more details about H.H. Holmes and this DVD did fill me in. However, it is almost impossible to adequately do so in such a short amount of time.More details about finding the Pitezel girls in Canada, the condition of the bodies, etc. since they didn't explain it like they did in one of the books I read which made me despise him even more that he could do that.I know this is probably ridiculous to ask but a computer generated image of what the castle looked like from the inside to get a better idea of the horrors within.I know I am sounding like a ghoul, but it is such a unique case. In any event, it was nicely done and worth watching again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"I never heard of this killer.","review":"Serial killers are actually households names in the United States, but I have never heard of H.H.

But I just couldn't get past the fairly amateurish production values, the bad unnecessary reenactments, clumsy story telling and the redundant information. Also it seems the filmmaker could have reached out to more than the three experts he interviewed, one of which seemed off puttingly enthusiastic. But if you're more interested in the story of H.H. Holmes than watching a good film, it might be worth your while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh...","review":"Learning about HHH was interesting, but the film itself is sub-par.

The title song (Death Unlimited) is arguably one of their best songs. If you want a good album to introduce you to Norther, let this be it. I feel they put a lot of time and emotion, force, and strength into this album. There is a slight problem, however. This album was written to a black disk (the shiny side is black), and it doesn't play in older computers or CD players. It does look cool, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Solid Offering","review":"A killer follow-up to 2003's outstanding Mirror of Madness, Norther continue with the fierce, but melodic music on this album.

While it is fairly good in substance, I really didn't learn anything new about satan. I am well aquainted with his tricks, personally!! I did have a little trouble with the music part though. The author seems to think only one type of Christian music written years ago is God-breathed and legitimate. Doesn't he understand that at one time the Psalms were contemporary? What really bothered me about this book is the grammer. In reality it is probably the publishers fault but it is abysmal! For most of the book \\"lair\\" is used for liar and that's just one small example. And if you saw the word diffidently, what would you think it meant? I don't remember it's intended use now, maybe it was defiantly. It is really hard to tell who's talking at times.

I did not realize when I purchased it that it was a documentary. The whole film revolved around aging lesbians and what they went through in the 50's and 60's. Would of been much more entertaining if most of the women interviewed weren't mostly butch. Actual footage of that by-gone era with a broader range of women would have been welcomed and preferred. The mini scenes with the two young women were the only interesting part of this film and probably comprised 5 minutes total. I applaud all of the women that have paved the way and made life easier for todays lesbians. However, the movie portrayed these older women with a lot of hard past relationsips, which was a bit depressing for my taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"not all part supplied per Amazon description","review":"I do not recommend ordering this Item from Amazon.

After measuring, I now realize that my tank would need 52\\" x 90\\" at minimum to cover. What is worse is that the fiberglass gets everywhere once you take it out of the packaging. You need gloves, long sleeves AND MOST IMPORTANTLY a mask. I wore gloves and a long sleeve t-shirt and my arms still itched all over and I was coughing (HACKING, really) for hours after. CAVEAT EMPTOR and if you must buy it, wear heavy gloves, thick clothes and a respirator."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it!","review":"I purchased this product based on other reviews. Well, this 75\\" blanket doesn't fit on my 50 gallon heater. I thought I was smart to measure the tank's circumference before ordering it, but I forgot one thing.The circumference of the tank is 75\\", and so I thought it would be a perfect fit. Well, it turns-out that the blanket is 3.5\\" thick and so I forgot to compensate that the blanket's thickness will reduce the overall length as I wrap it around the heater. So now it's 1 foot short and I can't close both of the ends.Besides looking ugly, it wouldn't be effective in its job to save energy. Now I will have to go look for an insulation piece 1 foot x 4 feet long from Home Depot to cover the silly opening.It's funny that they're advertising this product for 60 gallons when it doesn't wrap my 50-gallon tank that has 75\\" circumference.

It was too small...just barely making it around the heater, but worse...there was loose vinyl fiberglass everywhere on my clothing (my lungs???). After carefully reading the directions, I did find that I was supposed to use nose protection when working with it. Who needs the mess and possible dangerous side effects?

The insulation falls off of the sheet under it's own weight if not held correctly while installing which for me was very hard due to where my water heater is placed.Afterthoughts:It would have been a lot simpler to get some kind of big roll of insulation that isn't very wide, so i could wrap it around the water heater and the pipe that is coming out of the side of the water heater would not have been an issue that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"This guy is very artistic, however not enough instruction.","review":"This book is very pretty.

John Nettles does not reveal the murderer but sometimes in the clips that are shown during his interview the murderer is shown in the act. This, of course, ruins the viewing of the episode. As for these episodes, they are all very good - Blue Herrings is my favorite. I have to say that I found Sergeant Troy's immaturity and lack of respect for practically everyone in any category but his own, grating. For this reason I am much fonder of the series with his third partner and if you haven't seen any of the later episodes, you should give them a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"When I purchased this, I got it for a price that you usually pay for just 4 shows, so I really got a bargain to have 10 shows on it. I wanted some of the shows with John Nettles and it was really neat that these were the shows that he picked for various reasons.

Maybe it's one of this hit-n-miss products because other reviewers haven't had a problem.So why am I, someone who never fished, buying this, and despite what I received, giving it at least 2 stars? Well it's a bass isn't it? I don't know if others buy things like this to hang in their living room or let their kids play, but I really only bought this bass to bring to parties and hang-outs with friends and you know, drop it.And it looks like it can do that just fine.

I would say MOUSE WENT OUT TO GET A SNACK is a combination of your typical mouse book such as MOUSE MESS and a counting book such as Eric Carle's THE VERY HUNGRY CATERPILLAR. The essential plot is that very sensibly \\"Mouse went out to get a snack. Something like a piece of cheese.\\" However, overwhelmed by the table's bounty he ends up with \\"1 piece of cheese, 2 plump plums, 3 baby carrots, 4 fried chicken legs, 5 ears of corn, 6 tasty tacos, 7 assorted jelly beans, 8 colorful cupcakes, 9 jolly gingerbread men, [and] 10 slices of chocolate cake.\\" However in his greediness, he failed to take into consideration two things: the cat AND the size of his mouse hole!

How he responded to segregation -- by simply being the BEST -- is a model for all people to follow. Overcoming obstacles (poverty, prison, and discrimination) is a recurring theme in the book.As a parent, I am less wild about reading how poorly Satchel Paige did once he was admitted into the Major Leagues, because he would not follow team rules (refusing to show up for team practices and arriving late for games...)

The transition is emotionally charged and sometimes bringing the child to depression - especially if the child cannot identify their life with any other children. The mix of personalities and a happy life that Charlie Anderson leads transitioning between two families is something any young child can identify with and derive comfort from. I know my child did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Charlie Anderson","review":"Although the story should be a great read for children having difficulties with split families.

The book would have been excellent had it not been for this one page. I suggest it be re-written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Children of divorce are not lucky","review":"I thought this book was about cats and friendship with cats, until I read further and realized this book had an underlying message. The message is that Charlie is a lucky cat just like Elizabeth and Sarah. Elizabeth and Sarah are children of divorced parents and have to spend half of their time with each divorced parent. I understand that this is a fact for many children and they must make the best of it, but I wouldn't exactly say they were \\"lucky\\"! I quickly made up my own words when I was reading this story to my own child , so that she wouldn't be subject to the underlying theme of the book. How sad, that the author feels that she must tell children they are lucky if their parents get divorced. Children of divorce know it's not true and this book is very patronizing in my mind.

The banana bread, for example, contains 3 cups of sugar and butter, and four eggs, but only 2 cups of bananas! I wasn't able to eat more than one slice before it made me sick. Many of the so-called \\"vegetable\\" dishes contain more cheese and eggs and bacon (!) than vegetables! With the exception of the pancake mix, EVERY one of the twenty or so recipes I tried from this book turned out much too greasy and heavy and salty.

Sadly, David Nurenberg's debut novel does not fall into this category. It is not only poorly written, full of platitudes and cloying sentiment, but seriously in need of editing. Mr. Nurenberg is not only in love with the sound of his own voice, he is obviously married to it and in need of at least a trial separation. Nurenberg's characters are flat and lifeless, leaving the reader apathetic about what happens to them. As for this being a \\"Herotown\\" novel, where exactly is this town? It might be advisable to steer clear of all roads that lead there--there cannot be redemption there and if I were any of you, this is one light that I would be very afraid of.

My daughter is specifically interested in anything and everything Sesame Street but was bored with this video because the characters she knows and loves (Big Bird, Bert, Ernie, ELMO, Cookie) had only bit parts. The main characters were ordinary monsters that she doesn't recognize and the songs were none that she'd ever heard before.

As this was a specially organised event shouldn't there be more footage available?US - A rather strange sound mix that loses Mick Box at times!But whatever its shortcomings you can crank the volume up and relive this band at their best.What about the BBC archives? - UH actually performed the wizard on TOP OF THE POPS!And, lastly, you really have to like Easy Livin because it appears here in mutiple versions!BUY IT!

I installed the TEW-424UB on a brand new XP PC with the AP located 15 ft away. I rarely saw good signal strength and the data rate rarely peaked. All this was acceptable since my broadband connection only supported ~1Mbps anyway. What really annoyed me was the fact that the connection would die 2 or 3 times a day, requiring reseting the driver or sometimes physically resetting the dongle. After I replaced it with the DLINK G122, I saw excellent signal strenght and 54Mbps data rate from the same exact location.Given the low price and the fact that the TEW-424UB is not even WiFi certified, what I experienced probably should not have been a surprise.

Also, they have some serious privacy policy issues because when I filled out a replacement request online for the broken one the sent me, I could see a list of all the previous owners and the technical support notes that were logged in. The previous owners had the same problems I had...what a surprise!

Simply, it does not work. Once I realize that the included software was the better choice, everything was fast and painless. On top of this, I now find that this wireless adapter is even slightly faster than my wired (cat5) network. I will see how it goes in the next several months. Otherwise, even for a slight increase in speed I might just get rid of all the wires and reclaim some of my living space.My concern was that I just wanted the device to work and not having to spend countless hours and workarounds.

End-of-chapter problems are provided. Particularly interesting were the chapter on experimental methods and the most straightforward discussion on units I have yet seen (units in magnetism are notoriously confusing).Although published in the 70's, the book still has value if you want to learn the fundamentals.

Luckily it fell toward the inside and just rested on the roof, and the rear wheel was still strapped in. Needless to say, that was the last straw.I had been reading about the Rocky Mounts Pitchfork trays and bought two of them.

And Erik's astounding brilliance disappears and he turns into an overdone and unbelievable Scottish man. As far as the author's choice of \\"Phantom's\\" to base her character on...Gerard Butler? Not so much, Gerard was a decent Phantom, but certainly not good enough to truly embody what Erik is all about and he certainly does not deserve a book dedicated to him and his half of a performance he gave in the movie.

With her education, this book should have been much, much beter as far as grammar and such.

I will not tell you how the book ends as it is a surprise, but I will tell you that the ending is good. I have read this book twice now and found it was better the second time around. One point should be noted: You will need to see the movie before you read the book, as the book picks up where the movie leaves off, and mentions several points from the movie.

This mind you was with my old 32 inch tv when I found out how bad this stuff was, unforunatly for me after trading and buying my friends newer 42 inch LCD tv he used the same stuff so yet again I spend over an hour cleaning the tv screen.

The heat will dry the stuff to fast, and prevent you from being able to apply it properly.Spray, generously half the screen with the Monster cleaner, and wipe as you would cleaning any other glass surface. Don't worry about the rainbow-like streaks for now. Repeat to the other half. Let sit for about a minute or two.Spray plain ole water down generously to the whole screen. Using a different towel (I use shamwows- but it'd be nice if the kit came with two of the those microfibers. I've since lost mine, but it's no biggie) wipe off the water, and the rainbowy streaks will come right up, and the screen will be super super clean.

After reading the great reviews I tried this product. After spreading on the entire screen and wiping off I noticed what another reviewer noticed, lots of streaks. These were not your ordinary streaks, they were on there good (or bad). I rubbed and rubbed all the while worrying about hurting my screen. Finally I went over it with another (non-Monster) product called CleanScreen that came with some cables I bought. This seems to have helped with the streaks but buyers beware...if you have a newer Samsung you will be very frustrated with the results. This stuff is getting shipped back tomorrow. This is one disappointed customer!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Water did the trick","review":"Of course I don't know if it'll work for everyone but I had the same streak problem from this awful product (had streaks for days after re-wiping numerous times) and decided to just use water.

The product works great. I was a little hesitant to buy this because there were quite a few reviews of people who said the product left streaks behind. I think they must have been spraying the solution directly on the screen, which you should NOT do. Just read the instructions - make sure the monitor has been off for a few hours (so the screen is cool), put a little spritz on the lint-free cloth, and gently wipe the screen. That's all you've got to do.So far, I've used this on a 2011 55\\" Panasonic Plasma, a 2007 37\\" Panasonic Plasma, a Samsung LCD computer monitor, a Dell Laptop and a MacBook.

That was not in my package for some reason.3) While it does clean, it DOES NOT REMOVE INK!

I find this album very enjoyable overall. Fans of late 60's early 70's rock/pop should also find much to enjoy with this release. If you just like the radio hits, a best of collection might be good enough for you. But if you want more Bread that shows the true versatility of this talented group, this is one to own.

Being able to pour water on something besides each other's heads is a bonus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work for me AT ALL","review":"A few things this toys description neglects to tell you, or even warn you of: In order for you to have enough space for all of these parts to work, your kid has to stand up in the tub. I don't know about you, but my 2.5 yr old isn't allowed to stand up in the tub. Theres no way they could reach to put the water in and let it fall through all of the fun parts while seated. It just doesn't happen. Secondly, if you have a molded plastic tub/shower enclosure, the suction cups don't stick. Yeah, you might get one or two to hang on for a half a minute, but they're off ALL the time, and god forbid your toddler touches one, then they definately fall off instantly. Maybe this toy would be fun if you had an older child that likes to stand in the bathtub and a tile shower enclosure that the toy might stick to. This was a waste of money for me and my child was disappointed and confused."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suction fell out","review":"One of the sctions fell out for the water wheel and will not go back into place, very dissapointing, only after about 2 months of infrequent use."},{"rating":"1","title":"it doesn't stick to the wall","review":"The idea is great and fun, but the for some reason the suction cups do not stick to the wall; so this bug makes all the fun go away;"},{"rating":"2","title":"Neat Bath Toy","review":"I purchased this toy about 3 months ago and we still have fun with it at bath time. We have not had any problems with the suction cups. My 15 month old son pulls on them and they don't break free. We love to continually change the order of the toys so it's always new and exciting. At the same time, my son is learning about gravity and cause & effect. My only compaint is that wheel inside the orange monkey in our set is very tough to turn so when the water hits it, it only turns a little and then stops. But my son doesn't care and still has tons of fun with it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gets old quick!","review":"Toy is fun, makes bath time a little more interesting but it is hard for my child to reach the top so he can pour the water in. Would return if I could."},{"rating":"2","title":"best multi ever","review":"I usually feel ill with most mutli vitamin supplements no matter how much i eat before taking. This mullti is the first that has not made me sick and really like the high level quality. A winner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for moods!","review":"I suffer from a mood disorder and this supplement was recommended to me by someone who had bipolar disorder. Both her and I have had wonderful luck on it. This supplement works better for my moods than any prescription ever has!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming and fun. Lotta Scales is a lotta librarian!","review":"As a corporate librarian by trade and a public library volunteer, I had to buy this book for myself. However, as much as I (an adult) got tremendous pleasure from the book, it was even more enjoyable to see the rapt faces of the children to whom I read it at the local library. They loved the story, and were impressed with the bravery of Molly Brickman as she educated the Library Dragon on how children can responsibly enjoy the library. In my copy of the book, the dragon actually felt scaly, though I am not sure if it was deliberate on the part of the publisher. Great book, I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Library Dragon book","review":"The product was as advertised and arrived as scheduled. It suits the purpose for which it was ordered. Definitely would order again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read!","review":"I am not a big poetry kinda of dude. I think most poetry is too snooty and most folks like to talk about it but not really understand it. Not this book. Very earthy and down home writing that really appealed to me. I like tech journals and general geek type books, so I bulked at this book first. However, I was gave this book to read on Saturday and I just could not put it down. Excellent read, very deep stuff that had me saying, \\"Yeah that is what I mean when I feel like this or that...\\" From the book:\\"Our treasure in jars of clay, so very mortal! For in a moment A lifetime gone\\" Heavy Duty stuff... Pick this one up and just enjoy the ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this skillet","review":"We owned a Berndes skillet that we loved and used daily for 15 years until it finally fell apart. We purchased a replacement that did not last 15 months until the coating blistered and peeled. When we contacted the US distributor we were told that we would have to ship them the pan (we pay for postage and packing materials), and pay them non-refundable $15, and then they would let us know if they would honor the warranty. Sadly, the poor quality and warranty administration adds up to a pass on Berndes' products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid the \\"Specialty\\" line","review":"Berndes cookware is among the very best, but the Specialty line was cheap, shoddy, and mass-produced in China. I bought the 9.5 in. skillet and the handle literally fell off after only three months of use. Buy the Coquere or Signocast lines instead. Worth the extra $$!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not complete, but extensive","review":"Phil Ochs is one of the great singer-songwriters of his era and he's shamefully underrepresented in modern culture because, let's face it, everyone just looks back at that time and place and talks about Dylan.
