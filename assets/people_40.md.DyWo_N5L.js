If you consider yourself knowledgable on cars and want to complement your collection, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grossly biased and tendentious","review":"This deplorably assured, thoroughly biased narrative regarding the 1876 election should be avoided by anyone looking for a serious account. Every possible inference is deployed against Republicans white and black alike. Outright lies are asserted regarding Grant, and the evidence is never weighed where it might result in a less-damning conclusion. A complete waste of time for anyone interested in the history, despite the author's lively style."},{"rating":"2","title":"HIstory Well Told","review":"1876 election was corrupt and ended an era and prepared for the beginning of another. It clearly marked the end of Reconstruction and influenced the subsequent 90 years. Essentially, in the election of Hayes who is portrayed as a decent individual and Republican party giving up its commitment to Black rights we see the end of the battle for equality.The story is told well by Mr. Morris. It is impossible to read this without drawing comparisons to 2000. Some of the reviewers have argued that there were differences but some of the similarities are striking. Tilden like Gore made fundamental errors immediately after the votes were cast. IN each case there was faith in a legal strategy that did not work while their opponents out manuevered them on the ground. Also Florida was the place where the work was decided.I suggest that anyone reading this book also read 1876 by Gore Vidal to understand how different society was at that time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff","review":"I read this book, and found myself drawn to the author. A bright, talented kid, doing extremely dangerous things, in the spirit of getting the story. I was struck, most, by her honesty. She portrays her life, warts and all, and doesn't apologive for the person she is.I passed this book on to a friend, who raved about it, and passed it on to her step daughter. This is a book about women, for women, and for guys willing to see world events from another perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"didn't know what to expect, but was pleasantly surprised","review":"I bought this book while walking around a bookstore. I wasn't sure what to expect out of it.. I saw the title and, being an aspiring photographer myself, decided to see waht it was about.I was pleasantly surprised by the book. I liked reading about her adventures, though there was one part in Romania (the orphanage) that was pretty hard to stomach. She does talk a lot about her sexual encounters with the men she happens upon in her travels, but I don't think it's what the book is about.... it's just what people are focusing on. SHe didn't write a book about getting laid.. it just happened to be a big part of what went on then. My only complaint, and not enough to knock a star off, is that there were more pictures. She's very descriptive, but there were some things that I wish I could've seen through her lens that weren't included.It's a very inspiring book if you give it a chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Want to waste a few hours of your life? Read this book.","review":"This book should be in the romance section, because the photography part is extraneous. The photojournalism parts were pretty good, but I couldn't stand wading through all the crap about who she's in love with or having ... with. In fact, I couldn't even finish the book because it ... me off.Gee, we're all really proud that you can stoop to the low level that men do and be as promiscuous as humanly possible. Way to go. By the way, no male I have ever known was as bad as this woman.Anyway, if you want to read a good book about a woman photographer, read the autobiography of Margaret Bourke-White. Her life was *amazing* and she speaks about her huge accomplishments with a great lighthearted air."},{"rating":"1","title":"Our book club agreed....","review":"general concensus was that we didn't care for it. \\"Shutterbabe\\" was a bit whiny - she was offered an incredible opportunity at a young age, obviously she grew up in a family with money, and never seemed to show the appreciation for what was given her, based on the choices she made. Some parts were funny - but we do wonder what her husband and children will think of down the road when they read her exploits with other men."},{"rating":"1","title":"over rated","review":"Well I must agree with those 1 star reviews. This woman seemed to be on a personal sex quest and brags about it. How boring. Her pictures lack emotion as well. Too bad a woman couldn't bring more light to this subject other than to tell us how many times she was raped. Please...get real."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the reviews, trust your gut...","review":"This one let me down. There's a credibility issue that I can't completely explain. And...well...the real story here is one of a young woman's encounters with men and the bric-a-brac that goes into it. At times I found myself offended that war was used as a backdrop for what seemed like a psueudo-erotic fieldtrip abroad. The connection between the author and the tragedy of war, the cultures and histories involved...well, it isn't there, or, if it is, then it did not resonate with me. Instead I was reading a story where being a \\"photojournalist\\" comes across as being a cool and engaging cover for tramping through distant corners of the world. But even getting that much out of the book, after finishing it I can't say I understand why she chose to write it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great beginning, but loses steam","review":"I know the book is about finding one's self, but the convoluted, twisted story structure gets old. I rarely stop reading books until the end, but this one I just had to put down. The beginning of the book started out great. Then about mid-way I got sick of reading about the author's sexual conquests. I certainly hope that this book is not a true reflection of the lifestyle of a young photojournalist.If you want to read it, save your money and go to the library or buy it used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tells you what makes photojournalists tick -- male OR female","review":"This book is full of wry humor, much of it self-deprecating, and yes, the author WAS clueless when she started out, which makes the book all the more horrifying and funny at the same time. Her descriptions of her own frame of mind, her colleagues' (most of them male), and the situations they all find themselves in for their work are fascinating and say a lot about the profession and what it takes to get ahead in it. Those who mistakenly believe that she is either championing some form of feminism for others to follow or who are disturbed by her honest accounts of her sexual adventures are missing the point -- that this is a coming of age tale, where she describes how she finally gets over her wish for cheap thrills and starts looking for something more substantial in her relationships."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good read","review":"Someone else said that 4 years does not a memoir make. I disagree, Debra lived a complete life in four years and then moved on to a new life. As a photographer I found the story both entertaining and informative. The trails and tribulations that she goes through remind me of why I chose not to be a Photojournalist fulltime. Still I enjoyed reading it and would recomend it to anyone. Debra lives her life like in much the same manner that a man in her position/job would and succeeds for the most part. Society doesn't approve of women living this way but that is a seperate issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, raw, honest","review":"I read this book while traveling. It is honest, raw, entertaining and a fast read. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"If it wasn't non-fiction, you wouldn't believe it.","review":"Deborah Copaken Kogan has led a remarkable life already. Like a real-life Lara Croft, she is an amazingly tough and resilient person. She wins points for the feminist movement through action and achievement, not rhetoric, since she endures things that most men I know would not dare face. Parts of this book are shocking enough that they will rip you out of your comfortable Lay-Z-Boy. Beware though, you will probably be jealous of Deborah's life if you have any sense of adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shutterbabe:","review":"This is an intriguing look into the life of a professional photographer who went everywhere from the caves of Afghanistan with the mujaheddin to the Red Square of Moscow when a coup attempted to oust Gorbachev. Her stories are as captivating as her photographs."},{"rating":"1","title":"so short of its potential","review":"This book had unbelievable potential and ended up falling flat (and occasionally offensive) on so many levels. The biggest problem is immediately obvious... the author gives each chapter a title corresponding to the man she is interacting with at that time, as opposed to highlighting the corner of the world/piece of history she is exposed to. She consistently appears more driven by her current relationships than her incredible position as witness to world events and the extremes of human lives. For someone to have the amazing experiences she did to have proven as shallow as she seemed time and again was truly depressing. I felt she could have been such a champion for strong women (could even gone with her sexual \\"liberation\\" in that spirit) but I had no respect for her at all at any point in the book, other than her incredible dedication to her children at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money.","review":"Poorly written.By page 34 you have heard about 19 sexual encounters (although without any redeeming detail). Remember the Wilt Chamberlain book or the Geraldo Rivera (Jerry Rivers) book that were basically about putting notches on belts? This book is the same but written with even less skill.I would be much more interested in a book by her husband and how he could possibly want to spend the rest of his life with a woman who had casual sex with the frequency of a bad ham radio.Unless of course many or most of the stories are untrue..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honesty sells","review":"A truly brave and honest first-person account of this woman's life as a photojournalist. The unique way she wove her story through the lenses of her lovers was a stroke of brilliance. And she has guts to say war is an adrenalin rush for journalists of all ilk and also is able to talk about men in a way that is refreshing and honest. This total warts and all account of a life lived without a lot of B.S. yet without resorting to becoming a jerk is truly a gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required Reading for Photojournalists","review":"Great Read! I bought this book because Bill Jay from Lenswork magazine recommended it. It's a book you can't put down! I absolutely loved it. My only negative comment would be the title--it sounds so barbie-like and \\"fu-fu\\" whereas the book is meat-n-potatoes photography. This IS the required book for any woman who wants to be a photojournalist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shutterbrat: Adventures in Casual Sex and Self Importance","review":"The quality of the writing is poor. There is nothing extraordinary about the authors adventures. Spending a couple of weeks with Afghan rebels does not constitute war coverage. The title implies that the author experienced war. It certainly wasn't in Afghanistan, France, Switzerland or Zimbabwe or Potomac, Maryland. Maybe there was actual combat in Romania or Delaware. I stopped in the middle of the chapter about one of her sexual conquests in Bucharest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shudder Babe","review":"Proof, once again, that no one should be allowed to write an autobiography before the age of 65."},{"rating":"1","title":"The price was right","review":"I found this book discarded in a hotel in Europe.

I passed the book on to my mom, who was also in Europe at the time. She hated the author as well. In fact, she said she wanted to thwack her with her own book. And, please note, it was the hardcover version.

Track #6 on the album, that she narrates to the audience is written by her brother, Brian Gari. Mr. Gari has got to think that she did his song proud!Bottom line is that this wonderful collection of songs, really need to be a part of any music lovers collection. I felt that I was actually a part of that live recording audience.One last note, Ron Snyder on piano - Bravo! Where has he been hiding?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"an excellent introduction","review":"The book is easy and refreshing to read. Assuming only a minimum of prior knowledge, all the relevant aspects are covered. The focus is on practical applications, with numerous examples, simple equations and plenty of practical advise for the user.As should be the costum with every scientific introduction, the authors are at great pains to clarify the relationship between the different flavours of EC and to show how they historically developed.The book does not provide much on the mathematical level, though. Not even a basic graph theoretical analysis of mutation and recombination.This said, the book is still perfect to get you started."},{"rating":"1","title":"this man cleary doesn't know what he's talking about","review":"just as the title says. I've done months and years worth of reserch, and about %40 of the book is a complete lie, i would not recomend this to anybody who is a first time mouse owner. For example, he says that mice are able to eat things that are potentually fatal; things like cheese,white millet, and other things. He Also doesn't tell you every thing a first time owner would need to know. I looked on the back of te book and found a biography about him. It says that he is a cat surgon, so he would probably know more about cats than mice.

For instance, there are modules to allow adjustment of color and brightness, but they are disabled. So all you can do is look at them. Customer service requires an ID number which is not provided with this version. So the only way you can get help is to pay for phone support.

I also did not like the black mess band as well as the silver mesh or linked bands. I did however, like the mother of pearl face on this watch.

I originally purchased this CD several months ago and didn't like it so it went to the bottom of the pile. Have decided to give it another chance. It didn't get any better. The structure of the melodies may be correct but they are played in a lifeless manner. Wipe Out, Pipeline, Hawaii-5-0, and Apache are particularly weak. Walk Don't Run Sounds as though it is played 1/2 beat to slow. I kept wanting to speed it up. Listen for yourself and you will see what I mean. The single star is because it sounds like the recording of \\"Tequilla\\" is the original. It has some life!Better choices would be to search for a named group such as Challengers, or The Ventures, then follow the links to what others have bought. Dick Dale is a good starting place for a high adrenaline sound in this kind of music. Listen before you buy. If you think this is as good as it gets you are selling yourself short. At least I got a good recording of \\"Tequilla.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Customer Service","review":"This book was allegedly sent, but was never received. Either it was lost or misdelivered.

As good as a Rolex at a fraction of the price, but still a lot of money. However, if it lasts more than a dozen years, it will have paid for itself, and I'm expecting it to last more than a couple decades.The band on my Invicta 8935 Pro Diver Japanese Quartz broke after seven years of faithful service, so instead of buying an new band, I decided to buy the much better Swiss Automatic, which should last even longer.

This watch's build quality is much more comparable to any high end brand and their diver series.Very accurate, has performed in sync with my atomic clocks to the second. Very smooth Swiss movement.

You will hear many styles of music on this CD, which is like a breath of fresh air after listening to carbon copy artists singing carbon copy songs in their carbon copy voices time and time again. My favorite song so far is \\"Hit The Ground\\", but the more I listen to the CD I find that it's hard to have just one favorite. The songs are diverse and interesting and will fit many moods..

Sorry, Lizz, but \\"Salt\\" was a much stronger album. I couldn't put my finger on what kind of sound Lizz was going for this time out, but I guess that's what happens when you use one producer for your entire album. \\"Open Your Eyes, You Can Fly\\" and \\"Salt\\" are classic material in my opinion but the only track that I even like remotely on this album is \\"A Taste of Honey\\". After that track, I lost interest and began dreaming... except I was anything but wide awake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liz Wright becomes Nora Jones","review":"I heard a Taste of Honey on my local jazz station weeks ago.

This IS CHOCOLATE.Dreaming Wide Awakestarts with a version of \\"A Taste of Honey\\" - in 4/4 time. Lizz's voice is subtle but so, so rich. I've heard \\"A Taste of Honey\\" all my life.

She is by far one of the best artist of our day. Her band is spectacular as well. We love you Lizz!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lizz Wright","review":"Superb analogue sounding recording. Her voice is deep, somewhat reminiscent of K. D. Lang, but without her depth of tone. She uses her vibrato tastefully, and mixes some of her own music with covers.

I bought the CD's in the reverse order of their release, Orchard, Dreaming Wide Awake, then Salt. Orchard is outstanding! The music is varied and interesting and accompanied beautifully. Dreaming Wide Awake is not as good, but shows growing sophistication and maturity. Salt (is this too politically incorrect?) is too ethnic-sounding for my taste. I cannot wait for the next CD. What a voice! What control! What emotion!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Soulful and mesmerizing!","review":"Dreaming Wide Awake is a real must-listen! Lizz Wright's rich alto wrapped up in acoustic grooves first capture your attention and really keep you drawn in. She is much like a cross between Tracy Chapman and Norah Jones.

In some ways, it seems kinda monotone. In any event, this isn't about Salt, so...my favorite cuts are I'm Confessing, Stop, A Taste of Honey and Wake Up Little Sparrow.

I just know this one is 15 dollars more, then you need to turn around and buy the adapter, which is not even listed on Amazon?Also, the driver installation was a pain because after Windows XP installs its drivers, you have to disable all the USB controllers on the card, download the Adaptec driver, then it will install the Adapted drivers. That took me about an hour to find on the Adaptec website.

Unless you plug in the \\"optional\\" power supply. Which is not available off the shelf in most stores. Sure, I was able to fashion one myself, but why should I have to?

Check out Unforgiven, good guitars, lousy vocals. Even John Oliva, the voice of Savatage, does a poor job. I wonder why they didn't let Lemmy sing on Nothing Else Matters? Most of these remakes lack any personality. The shining exception is the Jake E. Lee and Chuck Billy rendition of Seek and Destroy.

This movie is much too boring to be 'so bad it's good'.The full frontal nudity was boring and does not redeem the movie. The actor wasn't that good looking and the scene, like the rest of the movie, wasn't interesting to watch.This movie is so amateurish it's hard to believe it was originally released in 1989.

Screws that hold the hinges to the timbers strip the composite plastic and will fall out. 4. Cost--something this flawed that also has high shipping charges will leave you angry and frustrated.

(See my separate review of kits, stacking joints and anchor joints.) I considered buying some of these boards to use with left-over stacking joints that I replaced with anchor joints when I set up the first six beds, but it turned out to be more economical to buy kits due to this seller's shipping charge of $11.55 per board. The 4' x 8' x 12\\" kit comes with twelve boards plus twelve stacking joints for a delivered cost of about $50 less than the delivered cost of twelve boards from this vendor. So I'll just give the excess joints to friends who prefer to build wooden beds."},{"rating":"1","title":"the shooter is terrible","review":"The batmobile itself is nice and stylish for a boy who adores batman.

So-called conservatives like Glenn Beck preach about personal responsibility but ignore the responsibility to help the poor and unfortunate parts of our society.so-called conservatives like to talk about morality but become mute when the President engages in an illegal, unjust, and immoral war. They keep talking about morality, but, are suspiciously apologetic when people like Rush Limbaugh, Bill Bennent, and George W. Bush are exposed as liars.These are the main contradictions in Glenn Beck's thinking. Instead of calling the book Real America, maybe he should have called it Real Hypocrite. The unintentional ironies abound in this childish and crude excuse for a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fairy tale","review":"Political correctness, personal responsibility, and fake patriotism. These are the themes of Glenn Beck's book. Beck is a Bush apologist with a hyper sense of new age spirituality. He is pretty funny in an adolescent way and some things he says make sense. But, the subtle and not so subtle references to his right-wing ideology slithers up your spine as you read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rhetorical Masterbation","review":"This is a book for the right-wing who are firmly set in their ideological ways. Close-minded folks like these see the world in black and white. \\"You're either with us or agaisnt us,\\" or \\"you're either liberal or conservative.\\" This leads to their simple-minded or retarded view of the world. As an Australian, I am fortunate to have an outsiders view but, this excessive stupidity on America's conservative groups is mind boggling. It's like a permanent race of buffoons with fascist tendencies.For those who like Glenn Beck, Grow up. There is no such thing as santa claus and George W.

It stinks to high heaven."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Whiner","review":"If you have ever caught Glen Beck on the radio then you recognize his shrill voice in an instant. He's the one who whines about how others whine, yet his voice is always tinged with a mixture of yelling and that of an elementary school kid crying cause he broke his crayon. His \\"Support America\\" rallys are nothing more than attempt to sell more books, get his name out there and further capitalize on dying troops. If he were really in the business of \\"supporting\\" them, then he'd fight for better water supplies, higher wages and them not having ot pay out of pocket for their own supplies while Halliburton rakes in billions. Save the dog and put Glen down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Radio Loudmouth","review":"It's usually the case that the loudest voice belongs to the dumbest person. Glenn Beck's radio program is testament to that. His book however, gave me a chance to see what this guy was trying to say without being turned off by his loud mouth. Unfortunately, his words were just as obnoxious, idiotic, and loud in print as it is on the radio.

If you want to read it just go to your local book store, buy a coffee and sit for about 30-45 mins a read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It'll make you think","review":"I enjoyed the majority of the book. Glenn Beck makes you think about where we've come from, and where we're going. He shows us America is still the land of opportunity, and anyone can pull themselves up from the bootstraps . . . again. There were things that challenged me in my own life and I'm a better person for reading this book.I don't agree with Glenn's religion (Mormonism). If you've listened to his show (which I do), you probably wouldn't have guessed that he was a Mormon. He's not your typical talk show host . . . and you come away knowing that he does love America and all it stands for. Read it, be challenged, make a difference !"},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece in Beck's own down-to-earth style","review":"Just finished the book, and it is a masterpiece. Not in the sense that it has plot twists and turns and words most of us have never heard of. Not that it has the power of 14 Harvard brainiacs behind it. It's powerful because it is written from the heart, with real ideas from a sincere man.When I met Glenn in Cleveland, I realized he is a down-to-earth guy beholden to no one; this book emphasizes his commitment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does Amazon censor these reviews?","review":"What Glenn Beck represents is free speech on non-pc topics like:-Why are pols looking away from illegal immigration that is destroying our country (or not - make your argument)-the use of charges of racism as a war against white people in the USetc.OK - I posted a critique on Amazon of a pc book about Islam that portrayed Islam as a misunderstood, peace-loving religion, as I remember. My review was pulled after a few days due to back-room censoring.What an eye-opener!Anyway, what I am saying is that Beck and his ilk are our white knights tilting at a fortress of leftist schemes carried out by the schools, the demonrats, the media, and yes, the republocrats.Now we sit and neither Bush nor the demoncats say or do anything about our borders, our poor, our loss of jobs, the collapse of our economy.Go Beck!

The most significant thing you said was \\"blah, blah, blah.\\" I'm sure you were kicking yourself in the behind for such an assinine presentation. You're book got a semi-plug. Glenn Beck sucked up big time to Saun Hannity just to get on his show. Anyways, Glenn Beck came off badly, just like his radio show which I have tuned out a long time ago. Even his website is lame, posting false news stories just to hype his book. Still out of the top 100 at Amazon and not even being taken seriously by the major media outlets.

The disturbing aspect that should give readers chills is the book's new age feel that reminds me of a cult. Glenn Beck and other Country Club Conservatives are always whining about the Left's supposed demand for Politically correct debate. However, these corporate jet conservatives are the ones who are redining PC by labeling any sort of dissent and disagreement with the Cowboy Deserter in chief as unpatriotic and treasonous. Intellectual consistentcy isn't Beck's strong suit and his ad hominmin attacks on liberals are inside jokes that only he and his group of cheap labor conservatives will enjoy.

Her performance sounds like a mere amalgamation of the notable performances of the past (Milstein, Grumiaux, Szeryng) but without any of the same individuality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good music, bad pictures","review":"While I highly enjoyed this cd, I don't understand why she had to be naked to sell her cds. ...BR>While the performance isn't exactly authentic (something I always look for), and she uses more vibrato than I like, I still thought it was performed very well. It was one of the more expressive versions. I have Hillary Hahn's and Rachel Podgers (very, very authentinc) and both recordings seem a little lifeless compared to this. I even like the sound of her violin more (again, don't know why).

My overall impression was that the playing seemed to lack confidence."},{"rating":"2","title":"The artist is a Bach player \\"to the manner born\\"","review":"If ever there was a musician born to play the Bach unaccompanied suites for violin solo, this album proves that Lara St John is that artist. Every note in every phrase carries an absolute sense of direction and purpose with the conviction that the composer's message is sublime and ineffable. The gorgeous tone and effortless technique is just so much icing on the cake in light of the passionate and heartfelt depth of these interpretations. The artist is still quite young and her characterizations of certain passages are slightly weak; but this caveat in no way detracts from the amazing achievement and accomplishment of this wonderful virtuosa. One can only hope and dream that Ms. St John will continue to record more Bach."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've heard it all, and this is nothing special.","review":"A decent recording but one that has nothing extraordinary to offer. The tone and technique are excellent but the interpretations are pedantic and, at times, flimsy. Far surpassed in every respect by Hilary Hahn's recording of these pieces."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Sex, Please. We're Classical !","review":"When this CD was first released, there was a general hue and cry from the classical music votaries. Without first listening to Ms. St. John's performance, the recording was condemned because of the photo of her on the cover. It seems that people who like classical music don't like girls, or, if they do, the females must be prim and proper, for that's what classical music is today -- the music preferred by those of a prudish persuasion.Another problem that Ms. St. John faces is the common preference for a sweet and soothing sound from the violin. Although she, like many other important violinists of our day, studied at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, the tone Ms. St. John's gets is more similar to that of the great Russian violinists of the previous century (that's the 20th, geezers).All in all, Ms. St. John provides a remarkable performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad you'll want to hit yourself in the face.","review":"Maybe not quite that bad, but at best another mediocre rendition of these works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break","review":"Do record companies really think they need to have their femaleartists appear almost naked to sell CD's? This is really poor taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mature, refreshing.","review":"Lara St. John has very well-nigh perfect technique, and despite other renditions (and there must be a hundred other performances) her's has one of the most fiery, refreshing I have heard recently. (Menuhin, Vegh, Menuhin II, Grumiaux, Szigeti, Milstein ...) She has technique to burn, and it shows. Some may not like the over-virtuoistic manner of these performances but they do show a great love for the music, and a great sensitivity to the music. On the whole the CD is not well-filled (50++ min) but that's no problem. My opinion? 1) Ignore the cover 2) Buy the CD 3) Play and be impressed :) 4) Start writing to Well-Tempered Productions and hope they start producing more of her Bach.

The set only covers their RCA releases (A&M in the U.S.) but includes all their big UK hits - Everyday Hurts, My Oh My, La-di-da, Nothing Left Toulouse, Strange Little Girl etc. Unfortunately, the selection misses out their biggest U.S. hit \\"Run Home Girl\\" which wasn't a single in the UK but this is available on the two for one release on Renaissance which has the whole of their Facades album and the U.S. version of Misplaced Ideals. With the recent death of their lead vocalist, Paul Young, this is a timely anthology which might inspire RCA to release their \\"Ole\\" album which is also one of their finest hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad Indeed!","review":"It's \\"greatest hits\\" packages like this that leave many fans wondering in awe about how songs get chosen for these type of things. Sad Cafe's best moment was \\"Run Home Girl\\", a Hall & Oates-styled pop song with cool vocals, nice sax bits and a wailing synth/guitar solo that brought British rock and American soul together in fine fashion. MISPLACED IDEALS and FACADE were the band's two biggest albums (both for A&M) and both are on a 2-disc reissue via Renaissance which is a superb buy and complete value-for-dollar CD. This set, however, is downright SAD. It doesn't contain \\"Run Home Girl\\" or any of the really great songs from FACADE. It limps along with a majority of cuts from far inferior albums the band released for RCA when the vim and vinegar were long-gone. Contrary to the nice cover and the full title of this so-called \\"anthology\\", this isn't the set you really want of you're a fan of this fine seventies Britpop band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking......","review":"This compilation does little to give the listener an accurate picture of just how good this band was. The track selection is questionable and the sound quality is mediocre at best. As of September 2009, new import 2-fer remasters are available and all 4 albums included are really good, especially \\"Fanx Ta-ra\\" & \\"Misplaced Ideals\\". I have them on order and am anxious to hear how well they've been upgraded sonically.The \\"Misplaced Ideals\\"/\\"Facades\\" 2-fer on Renaissance is also a worthy buy. The sound on those CD's is quite good. (Trivia bit: The title of the \\"Facades\\" album is an anagram of Sad Cafe) This was a solid band with excellent songs, great harmonies and fine musicianship. I'm happy to see this stuff available again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Produces as Advertised","review":"I bought a 120 GB USB 2 External Hard drive a few weeks ago and was very happy with this easy to add storage--except for the speed. It was adequate under USB 1.1 but you really needed to dedicate some serious time to copy large amounts of data. Last week I installed the Adaptec 6-port USB 2 Card--what a difference! The card was very easy to install and my Dell 8200 running XP had no trouble using the Adaptec driver. The Adaptec web site offers a lot of good support information as well as a comprehensive help forum. Before USB 2, it took about an hour to copy a 3GB data file. Under USB two, about 5 minutes.

I read a review here that said this card slowed down their system by 50%. I did not experience any slow down. To be sure of this, I ran a benchmarking program before and after installing the card, and the results were the same within the measurement error (determined by running the benchmark a couple of times before installing the card). I installed the card on a WinXP (SP1) machine with an AMD Duron 1.3 GHz CPU and a KM266-8235 motherboard. Perhaps the other reviewer had problems due to an older system? (just a guess).Installation of the card was easy. Just plug it in and WinXP identified it immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some things are not what they seem to be!","review":"This promising 6 port USB card caused my machine to \\"hang\\" because of the substantial overhead required by the USB 2.0 operations.

And they are some of the best young traditional players I've heard. The oldest one Alex plays harp next Sam with the fiddle and Simeon on cello. Their playing is excellent. Even without considering their age, I would say their playing is worth listening to, but in light of how young they are, it's incredible. On their first cd: A late summers air, the youngest is only 12! Also they have great original pieces, written by Sam. Some of their slow airs are truly beautiful.

I will NEVER EVER EVER buy another Invicta watch.I know that it was inexpensive as far as professional dive watches go, but I have had $30 cheapo watches from Wal Mart that lasted longer.I would recommend to anyone in the market for this kind of watch to save their money for a while longer and go with a more reputable brand... definitely look at something other than Invicta."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Value","review":"Great looking watch with excellent wrist feel.

I think that the band is actually more solid than the Rolex model that it looks like, and as I said in the headline, it keeps better time than my Brietling. One hint on keeping it wound... I find that a winder that rocks back and forth works better than one that rotates. It may just be this watch, but the self-winding mechanism seems to \\"get stuck\\" with the rotating ones. However, no problem at all with the back and forth type."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out for this watch!","review":"This was a gift for my husband. It never worked.

The tone of the book is altogether depressing. Even the spirituality didn't come through to me as being uplifing. The joy that Rosemary should have as a child of God, and a minister didn't come through. Also, her condition wasn't even addressed at the conclusion. So many of the mini-scenerios weren't wrapped up. I finished this book in total disbelief and confusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened to.....?","review":"This book would have been a better read, if Ms. McMillan had stuck with the main characters instead of trying to deal with so many different themes.

Whew! Then, she threw in a few historical lessons about Detroit, as if there wasn't enough to distract from the basic plot.The only thing that kept me reading was a really complex and interesting main character.

There were so many story lines and character references taking take I found myself backtracking quite a bit to get a full understand of the who and the what and the how so I could follow along with the story. Nevertheless I hung in there and ultimately enjoyed the book. I wish she could have dealt a litle less with Rosamay and her confused self and a little more about Kennedy and her partner. It seems I kept wondering about Issac and Kennedy and if they could at least have tried to work something out.

The book felt forced and unrealistic. It was hard to get into the story because Morgan just didnt feel like the Morgan you get so close to in the rest of the series. With out Hunter, the story seems empty. I almost regret reading this book becasue it ruined the essence of the sweep series. I would still recommend reading the book, but just be prepared for a major let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Super Sweep?","review":"Well it was an okay book but left me empty inside. It was not as emotional. I love all 14 of the regular series but this one kinda made me mad. Morgan seems TOO powerful, like no challenge can come in her way. In the Sweep series shehad to figure out things and well there was a bit of luck to it. But in this book she can do just about anything. And Hunter dies in the beginning, that is what should happen, none of this o wait never mind he has been trapped on an island without food and such for sixtenn years! come on, like that would EVER happen. Moira is just a little twit with no real emotions. Plus all that happened in the book was WAY predictable. Over all if you liked the series and thought of your own happy ending on what happened with Morgan and Hunter, dont read this book. It is a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"blank","review":"i don't think this was as good as the other books, i didnt like how morgan had been writen in this book and i think it was set to far into the future.in the other books they had a realness to them but to me this one was a bit fake( no_one could survive that long on an island).if you read and liked the other books them read this one, but otherwise don't bother.."},{"rating":"2","title":"exciting!","review":"This book shoots you forward in time and shows some of the book through Moira's eyes(Morgan's daughter). I really like this book, but it wasn't as good as some of the others; it leaves a lot of space between the last book and this book so there are some things that never get figured out. But i thought it was really good. I read it in about 2 hours. I couldn't put it down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor series...sigh.","review":"Okay, I hate writing bad reviews, but I was very dissapointed with this book. I even got bored every once in a while and my book sat unread for a bit.I was so dissapointed about Hunter, but the end, I'm sure HunterxMorgan fans will totally love :-DNow, don't get me wrong, if you have read the whole Sweep series, I encourage you to read this. It's basically an epilogue.If you liked the ending before though, maybe you don't even want to read it, which might be a wise decision.As a complete Sweep freak, I must say...this book was awful. :)Heh, sorry Cate."},{"rating":"1","title":"What an incredible disappointment","review":"Sorry to sound so pessimistic, but I think this series has gone on far too long. Cate has clearly run out of storylines and she really repeated herself in this book. What happened with Hunter and Morgan was very predictable and unnecessary. Moira was just like Morgan and everything that happened to her was so repeatitive of what happened to Morgan. Morgan was adopted and was close to her foster parents, Moira was close to Colm who she thought was her real Dad. The dark wave scene was just like the one in Eclipse with Alisa (except I much preferred Alisa to Moira) and the fight scene with Iona went on far too long and was annoyingly repeatative. On the whole, I was quite disappointed with this book. I thought it could've been done much much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Let Down","review":"Okay, I'm a 29 year old librarian that loves reading Young Adult Fiction. I read Sweep 1-14 over the course of about 3 months and LOVED the series. However...I am so angry at the buildup of 14 books worth of Morgan and Hunter's relationship, only to be seriously let down in the first 20 pages of book 15. I'll be honest, I put the book down to read something else and haven't picked it back up. What's the point of 14 excellent books leading up to what happened in the beginning of 15?? It's just cruel. Anyone reading this series needs to stop at book 14. Trust me."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS CD ROCKS THE HOUSE!","review":"Way to go, HAS!

They are clear and articulate from low (conversation level) volume, to cranking \\"The Fast and The Furious\\".Like any product from the heritage line of Klipsch, it is an investment, I have had mine for over 20 yesrs and they handle the new digital technology with the same incredible sound quality they did back in the analog days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite good enough","review":"I agree pretty much with Bob Denhaan in that these are not really very secure. I had to fool around a lot in adjusting the fit of the caps on the rings to get them to stay closed but they still pop open easily with the slightest bump. Mine are basically OK for now because I keep them on an air rifle propped up by the back door to nab an occasional squirrel, but if I had to rely on these for a rifle being carried in the field, NO WAY! I'll never buy another one.Update 2/27/2012These covers have gone from bad to worse. It has now become impossible to keep them from staying closed even for a minute on their own.

It was very enjoyable putting this together until I got to detailing the figure (Jeff Gordon) that goes inside the car. When I went to add the decals to the Helmet everything was too big for the figure. The only decals that actually fit were the dupont flame symbols that went down the legs (the part you cant see though the windows). But then again, you couldn't tell they were flames because the paint pattern and the decal pattern were practically the same color. I have not gotten to the actual car yet but they look like they will be correct. I think that if you are going to put something in a model, take the time to figure out the dementions. If you are good enough to do your own paint detailing on the figure this would be an excellent model. You could then just toss those decals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this one","review":"I should have passed on this one. It cowtows to the authorities so that its most important message seems to be that it was invented to make money. Nothing new or revealing here that David Lipsky's \\"Absolutely American\\" doesn't have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"This book is about the life of a few cadets in a year at the USMA. The author does a good job in describing the routine and schedules of the cadets, providing good details of specific events. The biggest problem with this book is that it lacks the reality of cadet life. The author, while showing a few tough moments, doesn't represent the actual feelings of the cadets. All the cadets are too happy all the time. They are never shown being normal college students making mistakes, and being frustrated with their surroundings. This book comes off as an official publication for West Point, but is still a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"proform 950","review":"Great machine!

It was the second season released by SOM, I believe. I've tried other games over the years and nothing else comes close to statistical accuracy in replay and attention to detail. Everything is taken into consideration, pitcher stats, hitter stats, fielders, weather conditions, etc. You can play a game using the advanced rules in about 30 minutes with the board game. I use the computer game, that can be set up to show the individual player cards. You can play any games you want, and have the computer play the others.

They brought a Tribe Called Quest/Roots type vibe which offered a nice change of pace from all the tiresome tough guy faux-posturing and bling bling imagery of most modern rap. Things have steadfastly gone downhill though. It seems mandatory that this shift towards commercialization and radio-friendly compromise is required of most up and coming artists, be it rap or rock.Fergie is definitely irritating, I don't find her talented at all. She just brings the T and A factor which helped the Peas gain more recognition. Also, while I like positive hip hop, this stuff just gets so smarmy and poppy it makes me sick to my stomach after a while. BEP definitely \\"made it\\", but good music is not what they're \\"makin'\\". If you want a musically diverse, positive and talented rapper than check out Blackalicious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why don't alvin and the chipmunks rap?","review":"When I heard this album I posed this question upon myself.

A friend of mine purchased this CD and kept it playing all the time and it got me! A set of very good produced songs with groove and to party on, specially if you are with a girl. Pump it, the James Brown Track, Bepop, Ba Bump are absolute great; Disco Club and Feel it have great female vocal harmonies. Not all the tracks are in this same league: My Humps is too much for my taste, but one or two bad songs do not disqualify the album. Two years ago I would have catalogued this as total garbage, now I realize how close minded you can be with music. If you have never liked a little Kool and the Gang, The Temptations, James Brown or a very few good rap acts, avoid this CD at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Definite Decline","review":"I have been listening to the Peas since Behind the Front came out. Both Behind the Front and Bridging the Gap were great albums, and while Elephunk was more pop-oriented and less lyrical, it was still a very good production. That being said, Monkey Business is a sub-par performance, going one step further than Elephunk into the pop netherworld. If you really liked Bridging the Gap and Behind the Front, this album will definitely disappoint. If your first exposure to BEP was Elephunk and you liked it, you'll probably enjoy Monkey Business, but it goes so far overboard you may not. Anyway, Like That is a very good song (with guests like Talib, Q-Tip, John Legend and Cee-Lo, it would be hard to screw a song up), but there aren't really any other standouts on this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get The Phunk Outta Ma Face","review":"Okay. I see three Black men on the front of a CD and the CD is titled \\"Monkey Business.\\" Talk about buffoonery. I couldn't get into this because I'm not really into mainstream watered-down hip-hop. I don't care if these guys are popular right now and have 3 number one hits. I don't like what the whole MTV crowd likes or considers music. The Black Eyed Peas act like they're doing something hip and innovative on this CD, but the sampling is out of control and there's absolutely nothing new being brought to the table. Everything sounds the same and Fergie can't sing or dance. The only thing Fergie can do is pose and act cute when she's actually not. Her only reason for being in the group is to make it more appealing to the mainstream masses. \\"Monkey Business\\" is wack to the max and is something soccer moms would jam too because they want to be \\"cool moms\\". Skip this at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black Eyed Piece of $!@#","review":"What a shame. I remember in the mid 90's when Black Eyed Peas (minus that annoying female singer) put out amazing, uncommercial hip hop songs. Great beats, conscious lyrics, they were a hip hop group with a lot of talent and substance. Unfortunately however, they seem to have become an unoriginal, annoying pop group over the last few years! This album and Elephunk are some of the most brainless, commercial pop I've heard in awhile. I guess money and fame are more important that putting out quality music with integrity."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad triumph of greed over quality","review":"BEP was one of my favorite hip-hop acts of the late 90's. Their Debut album \\"Behind the Front\\" and even their Sophomore album \\"Bridging the Gap\\" continued a musical approach and ideology more akin to Tribe Called Quest, Talib Kweli, De La Soul, and the Roots than the current Gangster Rap trend.After this however, BEP apparently figured out that they can make more money with intellectually depraved dance tracks than they can with original music. And it's a shame.Money Business is a perfect example of an album crafted from bottom to top for pop appeal. In 2004 (with Elephunk) BEP left the Artistic music community and joined the commercial music community. It was sad to see them go."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT THE?","review":"Ok, so every piece of music deserves a chance. But I'll be honest-this is garbage. I mean, my humps? Come on.

Whilst this is till very good and gives us more of the rap/dance/vocal mix we like, I find it less satisfying that \`Elephunk' and there a more tracks I will skip past. Saying that, the tracks I like are so infectious it more than makes up for it. The album opener \`Pump It' gets your arms pumping in time and \`Don't Funk With My Heart' has a chorus that gets you yelling along with abandon and a beat to get you out of your seat dancing at the same time. This also has some daft songs and I can never take \`My Humps' seriously, despite its popularity.

Listen to it with a great sound system and a 15 inch Subwoofer and you will see why i like it. The bass is out of this world!

As for the track \\"My Humps\\", which is the song most ridiculed on this album, its supposed to be funny. Come on, there are plenty of superficial girls out there who actually think like that.

I know I'm among the few giving it one star amongst all of these people raving about how great this album is. Honestly people. The music has been done, there are no surprises. What I'm trashing most about this album is the lyrics. I'm not one to shy away from music based on lyrics, but this takes the take for Worst Lyrics Ever, and that's saying something. Has anyone read the lyrics to \\"My Humps?\\" Just looking at the song titles gives you an idea of how dumb the lyrics will be (Don't Phunk With my Heart). Really, what were they thinking.

Each album that followed seemed to have less and less of the genius of their earlier outing.

The rhymes are childish and self-congratulatory, which is fine if you splice in something intelligent here and there, but that is not the case.

For the fans of Elephunk, this is more of the same, done better. More bouncy beats ( Ba Bump, Don't Phunk With My Heart), Justin Timberlake camoes( My Style), and chorus's guaranteed to get stuck in your head( Don't Lie, Dum Diddly). The Peas also try some new stuff, which sometimes works( They Don't Want Music, My Humps) and sometimes doesn't ( Union). Lemme sum this up; like Elephunk? Then you'll like this one.

BEP sold out, everyone knows it, and to call them talented is a half truth. They can be talented, but the choose not to be. The only reason that good MC's like Kweli and others will even appear on their record is because they used to be good. Listen to \\"Like That\\". The weakest parts of the song are performed by BEP.

This song is infantile, moronic and devoid of all meaning. \\"Bebot\\", \\"Ba Bump\\" and \\"Dum Diddly follow the same brainless mould while others songs such as \\"Don't Lie\\" and \\"Don't Phunk with my heart\\" are filled with constant repetitions capable of driving people insane.\\"Monkey Business\\" may be a commercial success, but in reality that sucess is not achieved through music but through Fergie's sexually charged antics.

BEP brought a fresh face to underground hip-hop when they came on the scene, with the release of Behind the Front. Since that album, each new one has increasingly lacked creativity and thought. They have become the ignorant, corporate-driven, uninspired rappers they originally mocked. If you want to listen to the Black Eyed Peas and not the Wack Eyed Peas, pick up Behind the Front and MAYBE Briding the Gap but leave the rest of it alone as it's all a waste of money on a group that traded in its completely original and positive style for a ridiculous person named Fergie and some pop-driven, unoriginal, garbage lyrics in order to please the consuming masses."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD kills brain cells","review":"I have never heard a song as stupid as \\"My Humps\\", except perhaps Ba Bump, but that is a very tight race.

The cd (behind the front) that sounds nothing like this garbage. I know, we all say that, so it's a cliche and I'll stop.For the small group of folks who supported them way back when, we are a different audience. We aren't the bubblegum fans and why should BEP care? Their cd has been on billboard top 100 for 15 weeks. I just wonder who is buying all these copies. I guess it's a lowest common denominator thing. It's background elevator music that wouldn't possibly offend anyone.The issue that I have is that they are on the rap and hip-hop charts as well. Since they clearly aren't rap or hip-hop anymore, why are they there?"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you liked the spice girls....","review":"The antithesis of good music.This is pop pop poppycock...

I rememeber them when they first came out during the '90s, and they were embracing the neo-soul movement that was popular then. The problem was that everyone else was doing it too. Finally, the BEP's got smart and teamed up with Justin Timberlake for \\"Where's the Love?\\" and the rest is history. This disc is more of the same with a stellar guest performance by John Mayer on \\"Gone Going\\". Another great song is \\"Don't Phunk With My Heart\\". The video for this one was ingenious! The new single \\"Don't Lie\\" is a typical pop song, but for the Peas, it will be a hit. I recommend this one if you are looking for more of the same from the BEPs.

HP insists it is the toner cartridges and had no solution.A waste of $249. I like HP printers (my workhorse 2200 is still running about about 6 years) because you don't have to buy a separate toner cartridge and image drum, but this machine is a piece of junk.

I wrongly believed that by buying two HP products, I could avoid any compatibility issues. I WAS WRONG. Although the 3050 works fine as a stand alone copier and fax sending machine, it does not work with the HP Vista computer. There is no Vista scanning software, so it is worthless as a scanner.

Then you either must run the \\"scan hotfix\\" off of the hp website or turn the machine off. This happens about 1 out of every 4 faxes or scans. You'll know when you scan something and see the horrible results. Stay away from this machine if you need it for faxing or scanning. Printing... sure.

Worked great on my USB1.1 interface for 2+ months. Then...I installed my new DFI mobo. Everything went fine until I tried out my Cruzer mini.\\"No disk in Removable Drive G:\\" \\"The drive is not formated\\" \\"Would you like to format now?\\" .... NO, I DON'T WANT TO FORMAT. I WANT MY FREAKIN DATA!!! I followed the steps that call for removing a couple registry entries. Nothing. Tried the drive on 10+ computers at a local retailer. No access anywhere. I even went as far as just trying to reformat. \\"Drive could not be formatted\\" What a joke... at least I can warn others since I work in technology.I'm so incredibly PO'd at Sandisk for making such a fragile and inconsistent piece of hardware. It's solid state memory for crying out loud! I was foolish for putting so many important files in one place for a backup. I've lost 3+ years of lab work from college, and I will never buy another device from Sandisk purely out of protest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value thumb drive","review":"This thumb drive works as well as any other.Due to the storage manufacturer's misuse of the term 'megabyte' this device has an actual formatted capacity of 244 real megabytes (which is also true of all other \\"256M\\" flashdrive out there), so just be aware.Also, like any other flashdrive it is only good for about 100,000 erase cycles before it gives up the ghost so don't use it for files you'll be modifying frequently each day and so I wouldn't recommend editing directly off of the drive.Speed for this drive is average, it took a little more than a minute to fill up the entire 244MB.Pros:- really small! (look at your thumb, but half as fat)- faster than a usb 1.1 drive- no drivers neededCons:- no keyring attachment- not as fast as some other 2.0 drives- not bootable (for me atleast...)Bottom line: Very cheap but works as well as most other drives out there. At this price point it makes sense to buy it to just have around, because you'll never know when you'll need it =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"coolest prodeuct among the same types in market","review":"I got this product as a gift from my friend two weekes ago. Before this one, I always used a FUJI 256 MB one. obviously, this Cruzer Mini belongs to next generation, since it equipped with a USB 2.0 interface. For data transfering, it is much faster than my old USB 1.1 FUJI one. Also, the volume and weight of this cruzer mini is so small, thus it is really \\"MINI\\". So easy to carry!!!With windows XP home and professional in my home and office computers, the use of this is a breeze. I am a guy need to transfer data every day, so, this cruzer mini really gives me big convenience.The only cons: this product will be more convenient if it has a clap (as most of the flash drive in Market). But, do not be mislead by me - as an alternative, it is really equipped with a strap holder and comes with a nice neck strap.Excellent product, I will strongly recommend it to any one who needs transfer data a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice when it works","review":"Purchased first through Amazon.com.

Recommend you do the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great USB Drive","review":"I've had my SanDisk cruzer for a year and a half now, and have never experienced a single problem. It has worked with every computer I have ever tried. I use it for school, mostly word, PP, and excel files so I don't need that much space. However, recently I purchased a new computer and it was incredibly helpful in gettign all my files trasfered.It is very durable, no scratches after all this time. Once I even accidently send it through the washing machine. Afterwards I let it dry for a couple of days, and it worked just fine. Not that I would want to repeat that.One negative point . . . the cap begins to crack after a couple months of use making the fit not as tight. It does come with two extra caps, but if you've been using one for as long as I have that's not enough.Overall, a great product . Once you buy one, it will be hard to believe that you could ever live without it. I take mine everywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"good drive","review":"I own two thumb drives a 256mb PNY attache and this one from scandisk (techincally mine is the 512mb model but the differences are minimal other than storage size). I would far recommend the Scandisk as the better of the two. It can encrypt files, is small enough to fit into any USB port (unlike some USB drives that flare out at the base and won't fit into some USB ports) and it even comes with its own lanyard with a quick relase so you don't have to muss your hair pulling the drive cord over your head. This last poitn may seem trivial but its the sort of lanyard that office supply stores sell fo $8 or so, so its definetly worth mentioning. Finally it can encrypt and password protect your files, so those love letters and tax returns you put on your drive are safe (so long as your password is at least)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good for the Money","review":"This little guy appears to work well.

Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so Mac friendly","review":"Unlike other flash drives I have bought, this one seems buggy with the Mac and doesn't like many of the files I try to drag into it. Unsure why. It rejected some folders that had very simple names, such as 'open invoices,' but would copy all the files inside. Not useless, but enough of a bother that I would not recommend this to anyone with a Mac.Also, the added value applications are all executables. I didn't want them anyway, but not being *able* to use them is different than not *wanting* to use them.Unsure how hard it is to make a flash drive that's plug and play for Mac, but other drive manufacturers seemed to have mastered this trick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"When I first bought this, I made the mistake of not trying it out right away. When I did so about a year later, I found out how shoddy the work was.If you look in the section that is entered into the USB drive, there is a hole section, and there is the little shelf-like object. The shelf-like object was created a little too big so I could not plug the drive into my laptop's USB port(or my sister's laptop's USB port) without fearing to damage them. After spending another year or so hiding it away in disgust, I took it out, forced it in by constant wiggling, and was able to use it. I am extremely reluctant to use it in fear of damaging the USB ports; however, the fact that once in, it works fine is the reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1.In short, I do not recommend this product for its poor manufacturing quality. I cannot say the same for how well it works because I fear to use it on a regular basis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy Case Design","review":"Let's be honest. For most of us any USB flash drive will work as good as any other. I learned the hard way that one of the more important features to look at in choosing one is the key ring and case design. This model has a flimsy little plastic \\"bridge\\" across a cut-out on the side of the case. You're supposed to thread a small lanyard through this cutout to connect it to a keyring. I did this, and within a week the plastic piece broke off and I lost the flash drive. Look for one that has a sturdy loop or key ring connection on the case design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed after 3 month","review":"I bought this device 3 month ago and it worked fine until today. My Win 2000 PC stopped recognizing the drive and Win XP machine displayed an error \\"Hardware Malfunction\\".

I heard about poor quality of SanDisk products and I experience it myself.I gave this product 2 stars for a nice design and good customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't work with Mac Keyboard port","review":"I've been using a 128MB flash drive for about a year and found the space limiting so I decided to buy the SanDisk 256 MB Cruzer Mini. I just opened it and placed it in my Mac's keyboard USB port only to get a \\"low power warning\\" saying it wouldn't work. This makes it useless to me unless I go out and buy a powered USB Hub. All the convienence of this device is lost if I have to crawl around behind my tower, unplug a cable, and then plug in the flash drive everytime I want to use it. And of course since I use it primarily to move data from home to work I guess I'd need to buy a powered hub there as well. I guess I should return it but I had to mutilate the packaging in order to get to it. I probably would have been better off buying a second 128MB flash drive and just carry two around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this product!!!!!","review":"My disk worked for 2 months and then stopped.

In the beginning I had thought it was because of the poor design of USB port in some computer, but I asked my friend to try his memory drive and everything works fine in his (a different brand). So I don't recommend it to you because the main function of a flash drive is help you to work on different machine. If it only works in some machine and you will never know whether the machine you are working is good to it or not, I think it has no use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works just as expected.","review":"I've had it about 4 months, and it's been totally reliable. (However, I certainly would not use it to permanently back-up data -- that's a bad idea in so many ways.) When I got it, I could not figure out how to attach the lanyard, so I just keep the drive in my shirt pocket. I go back and forth from Mac to PC all the time with no problems. Have not tried the encryption. The size of the drive is very good because it can fit side-by-side with another USB plug. Some of the other flash drives I've seen are quite fat, and cannot do this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product , Nice Buy","review":"I bought this product 5 months back and is working fine.

I love Earl Grey,but it has to have a good strong flavor and aroma of Bergamot which is only found in teas that have Bergamot oil as an ingredient. Twinings Earl Grey teabags have \\"Bergamot flavor\\" (not Bergamot oil and most likely less expensive). It has a fake, almost bland flavor and aroma. Might as well buy straight black tea it is much less expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most taste-less Earl Grey ever","review":"I love drinking tea, and Earl Grey has been my choice everywhere I go. I enjoyed brewing tea from tea leaves, a habit that I have given up for the ease of tea bags. Twinings tea had always been my pick until this last purchase from Amazon. Earl Grey totally lost its poignancy. Even two bags of tea could not brew a decent cup of tea.At first I thought it was the recent degradation of Earl Grey tea as a result of climate change etc. Then I tasted other brand's Earl Grey and found acceptable. I went to the length and bought another pack of Twining Earl Grey tea from a grocery store, and I tasted alright. So I can only conclude the tastelessness of Twinings Earl Grey is associated with packages I bought from Amazon.I found this to be true with Amazon's Darjeeling tea as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Earl Grey Tea","review":"My tea came after three weeks and it was only one pack instead of six.

However the last batch from Amazon was so mild and lacking the flavor that I had grown to love, that it was almost bland. Do not know how genuine the report on Wikipedia is, but it seems Twininigs, in their infinite wisdom has tweaked the original formula in April 2011. Going by my experience, it sounds about right.Sad when a company has to tweak a great and well loved flavor, and still sell it as 'classic'.I will not be ordering it, till they bring back the original 'classic'Shame Twinings.Update: And just so you folks know..Twinings had said that they would send me a pack direct, to make up for my dissatisfaction. It is over 3 months and I am still waiting. I will not hold my breath. Looks like they changed their customer service formula too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a fan","review":"My favorite of the traditional Earl Grey teas is Bigelow. Personally, I find Twinings too light and a bit sour. My favorite Earl Grey is made by Revolution, and includes lavender as an ingredient. If you want an Earl Grey that doesn't hold back on the bergamont, and you don't mind some extra tannins, I'd suggest Rishi or Tazo. If you want to try an Earl with a unique citrus zing, go for Stash Double Bergamont. I think it includes grapefruit flavoring (just my perception). Lady Grey by Twinings also tastes great, and includes small blue flowers, which you can see in the loose leaf version. Cool visual effect against the dark black tea leaves."},{"rating":"1","title":"CAVEAT EMPTOR! TEA LACKS FULL FLAVOR!!!!!","review":"It's not the regular, strong Earl Grey Twinings I come to love.

Since I never owned the track, my knowledge of it is 100% radio based, showing that Billboard is, shall we say, shading the truth a bit in its claims. In addition to on the original Yes album \\"90125,\\" you can also find the complete version of the track on Vh1's \\"The Big 80s: Arena Rock,\\" along with a few other interesting tracks.But for the other tracks (back to the Billboard 84 CD), I don't hear any problems.Billboard puts out a good product overall, I also recommend the 1979 disco CD if you like that stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough already","review":"[....] Give us a break.

The sound of keyboards and the fiddle with their long musical introductions is of very bad taste! I am truely disappointed and hopefully other Somali singers will stay more true to the beautiful sounds of authetic Somali music and not be tempted to make some horrible fusion with celtic or any other european instruments.

Cheesy creature, lame actors, non-sensical plot, this movie has all the criteria for a B-movie. The lead girl is pretty sassy, and the main black guy is hilarious (again in a bad way). I rented this, and had to bring my friends in to watch it because I couldn't believe my eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"guidecraft child's rocking chair","review":"The guidecraft rocking chair is cute but, I don't think that it is very durable.

It is used by the college I attend for Medical Coding purposes. Granted the teacher we have is a poor excuse for one. This Book is also very complicated for the novice coder trying to learn how to use the book and/or coding. This book assumes you are already familiar with the issue of coding itself.If you are looking for a good solid book to help you with the beginning stance of coding. I suggest: Glencoe Medical Insurance, Student Textbook (Paperback), Nenna Bayes as the writer. The ISBN is0028048792 ."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST HAVE","review":"This is much better than \\"At the Top\\" which has horrible audio and focuses too much on the band and doesn't show enough of Buddy.

Good camera angles on this too; although a brief camera shot under the snare drum on one of the solos doesn't make any since - it is my only complaint."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"I was excited about reading this book because I figured it must be quick reading since its only about 150 pages long.I'm a beginner and was hoping it would show me how to host my website.

I had to respond to the previous reviewer as I did not think it fair that someone should trash this product due to their own (judging from what they said as much as the number of spelling errors in their review) ignorance. The 1/72 scale for miniatures is a long established standard, and one that I enjoyed very much as a child. They generally come molded in one color plastic, and can be painted, but do not have to be to be enjoyed. This is not a toy for children less than about 10 years, and certainly not for small children, as they are small and would be a choking hazard."},{"rating":"1","title":"figures are very very small...not what I expected","review":"This product was not at all what I expected, maybe I didnt read it right but the figures were very small.

There are several Chants that I absolutly love on this cd (Amba Amba, Rama Lakshmana Janaki). While most of the chants are set to more western music (as opposed east/indian)it is still most enjoyable and uplifting. Very helpful to changing the landscape of ones life. Can't think of a chant cd I'd recommend more if you are just starting to exspose yourself to sanskrit. Gentle for the uninitiated. I still listen to this cd even though I have gone completely into authentic indian/sanskrit chanting. My preteen daughter loves this cd as well. Amba Amba (for the protection of children) is her favorite too."},{"rating":"1","title":"A misleading follow-up....","review":"For anyone who has heard Garcia's Euro-Reggae single, \\"Kalimba De Luna\\", you would be inclined to think that this group is a gonna be a big Euro-dance factory....however, I bought the \\"Imagine\\" single under this impression and, man, was I disappointed. Let me explain - this is not a bad song....it's just not a dance song. It is a lite Euro-pop, almost ballad. Mediocre song, but it's gonna go with the other CD's I never listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ballad","review":"Garcia are releasing a non Summerdance track? yes!

When I first saw it, my impression was that it would be too frustrating for him. He's not that interested in building with blocks BUT he has a great imagination and once he figured out how to put the pieces together(about 20 minutes), he had so much fun. Everyone in the family has enjoyed creating a variety of critters, machines, tools...it's a blast! We just discovered that you can even use the case as a building platform. A fun idea: throw in a package of feathers. They stick really well into the little blue rods...adding a little magic and spice to your critter or machine. This toy is not only fun but educational. It has inspired story-telling and has increased my son's understanding of structures and space and how things work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My son doesn't like many toys but this is a huge hit!","review":"I have a little boy who happens to have autism.

I was thinking he might to build something because it had wheels inside. Well I was right. He was asking his Dad to help build things that where in the picture book that came with this toy. He loved it so much I bought the same kit again so he could build more then one at a time. Its a nice sturdy toy!

I also learned a great deal about women in the church, then and now, and much of it was interesting. I applaud Mr. Stanford's research and his writing was superb also. Both the general reader and students of religious history would enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author with an axe to grind","review":"If you read what Peter Stanford writes in newspapers, you'll quickly learn that he's deeply ideologically committed to a range of agendas that happen to be at odds with the teaching of the Catholic Church, one of his favorite subjects. The Church's apparent unresponsiveness to Mr. Stanford's shrill demands that it change its ancient teachings, practices, etc., to suit his tastes is apparently intolerable to Stanford, who as another reader pointed out, is certainly no scholar or historian, but an amateur.You'll find better reading elsewhere. This is a load of junk - unprofessional, unscholarly, and unreadable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Geraldo Does the Papacy!","review":"The legend of Pope Joan is worth a good book. Was there a female pope and, if so, how could she have deceived all the people at least some of the time? If she is a legend, why did the legend start and why did it persist for so long? Stanford's not the man for this. He's another self-absorbed 20th century reporter type who keeps inserting himself into the story and talking down to the reader. Sometimes I thought I was reading his resume's account of his journalistic & research abilities. One of these abilities is not reflection, which is notably absent in this book. What is present is a wishful pushing of his arguments, which hurts his case more than helps it. As the Kirkus reviewer notes, he turns suppositions into facts. Disappointing book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many threads","review":"Did a woman ever become Pope under false pretenses? Peter Stanford says it happened. And I may even concur with his assessment of the historical evidence. Given the darkness of the age, anything is possible.What is on to make of it? Not much, I'm afraid. The problems start when the author wants to use this factoid to discuss deeper issues involving the Catholic Church: The pretension of direct descent from Christ, the role of tradition, the role of women. All of these subjects are best discussed on their merits, not through the distorting lens of the reception history of a woman Pope.Good in flight entertainment.

The whole thing feels like it was written during business travel or while gulping down lunch. It raises a lot of interesting points but never seems to tie them together into a cohesive argument, or even series of arguments. Anything that can be made to pass for supporting evidence is merrily dragged into the mess so that teenageer's fashions, Nazi movie directors, economics and urban planning are all treated as part of some greater whole. Don't get me wrong, there were several places where the book gave me a new perspective - but on the whole I found this to be sloppy work.My views may be in the minority but I would still recomment the average reader keep some aspirin handy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Preaching to the Choir","review":"Postrel manages to do nothing more than preach to her choir. Those who believe that our obsession with appearances makes us shallow and easily manipulated will merely point to Postrel as an example of that shallowness and lack of self-perception that makes her easily manipulated; those who accept Postrel's thesis will believe that her opponents are the ones being manipulated into lives of dullness and little imagination.Neither side, and Postrel is particularly guilty of this, can respond to the other with anything more than polemics and platitudes.More importantly, if this is the biggest issue Postrel can find to write about, her world must be a very safe and just place. For those with more pressing concerns, her book is a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Substance to 'Substance'","review":"I was disappointed with this purchase.

She argues that even poor people, given a minimum of stability and sustenance, will enrich their lives by decorating their houses or by buying Gucci handbags. Thus, design and aesthetics in general become as important as function.She proposes a variation to Maslow similar to microeconomics theory: the marginal value of some needs drops faster than others' as we move up on the ladder. Therefore, the pyramid is rather dynamic, and we move back and forth on the available options depending on what options are available and at what costs.Is this a general human trait or just a 21st century phenomenon, driven by globalisation, more refined marketing techniques and access to new technologies?Find out in this well-written, economically justified book full of psychological insight. An aesthetics manifesto."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written, lacking in charm","review":"A very disappointing read. I purchased this book in the faint hope that I could find a writer that equalled Georgette Heyer in wit and charm in this genre.

The plots and subplots are exciting, and I can't wait for the next volume to see what happens."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"the beginning was interesting but it was boring and long winded after a few chapters. the pace is tedious and the characters are un inspiring. i finished the book and was happy to give it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deja vu","review":"Here we have a troubled Northern family with a noble patriarch (held hostage), guarding an unsuspecting world against a eldritch menace on the other side of a mysterious wall. Hmm. Where have I read this before? Or, rather, where have I read a better-written version of this before?Wait, wait... let me think. It'll come to me..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunate","review":"I was very excited to see Tad Williams returning to heroic fantasy. That is, until I read the book. This is probably my shortest review EVER, because I just don't know what to say about it. Memory, Sorry and Thorn was a masterpiece, and I was hoping for something of the same here. It was a huge letdown. And yes, I agree with another reviewer - it's still better than Terry Goodkind. Then again, almost anything is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shadowmarch","review":"Let me preface this review by saying I've read Tad Williams's Memory, Sorrow and Thorn (The Dragonbone Chair, Stone of Farewell, To Green Angel Tower), but haven't read the Otherland books. I've found those books to be difficult reads, but ultimately rewarding. This one I wasn't so sure of until the end. I enjoyed it but not to the degree of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn. I do look forward to Shadowplay, which I believe is the second part of this series, but to the new Tad Williams reader I have to say that Memory, Sorrow and Thorn is the better place to start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long and Boring...not epic","review":"Shadowmarch has quickly (or slowly I should say) found its way to my top five worst books. I really liked Tad's style of writing and I really wanted to ejoy this book. But Shadowmarch is TOO LONG AND SLOW. Nothing happens in this book. It is chapter after chapter of the princess crying over her family's misfortune. The book started very promising and I was really expecting a great story. But the plot is stretch sooo thin. The book may have been good if it were about 200 pages shorter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I like Williams and had high hopes for this book. Unfortunately, until the last 100 pages or so, I was wondering why I even bothered to start reading this. The book really plods a long without getting anywhere. I'm usually patient enough for a set-up, but I thought too much of this book was spent on irrelevant and wasteful precursor. Boring characters at this point, and quite frankly, I'm sick of adolescent protaganists.Still, it's a 100 times better than Terry Goodkind."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great story full of mystery and intriguing characters","review":"\\"Shadowmarch\\" is one of the best post-Tolkien fantasy books I've read. Tad Williams has created some great characters in this series. The twin royal children Briony and Barick are all-to-human characters thrust into power due to unfortunate circumstances, and forced to deal with an invading fairy army and various other nefarious plots around them, and Chert the \\"funderling\\" and Ferras Vansen are the true heroes that every good fantasy needs. There are many more mysteries to still be answered by the end of this book that will keep the reader in suspense. The depth of the characters in this book match authors such as George R.R. Martin, but there is less gritty naturalism and more fantasy heroism in this book, which makes it more to my liking than Martin's \\"Song of Ice and Fire.\\" This book is a must-read for any fan of fantasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fairys, swords, evil stepmothers, war, all you could want.","review":"A consumate master of fantasy writing begins a new series. There's a very simple way to see if you like this book. Go read the first five chapters at shadowmarch.com.You can expect a tale of fairys and swords, evil stepmothers, kidnapped rulers, invasions, betrayals, monstrous creatures roaming the hills, nightmares, magic, and the mysterious, misty Shadowline that marks the boundary between the lands of men and their inhuman enemies - and which seems to be starting to move. This is the first novel in a trilogy that is almost certain to be a great success."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruined by a character","review":"I started Shadowmarch with high hopes. I've always enjoyed Tad William's work in the past and thought this would be another chance to delve into one of his richly detailed words. In that respect I wasn't disappointed, William's has a unique art for creating believable and fantastic worlds and Shadowmarch is no exception.So why 2 stars you may be asking yourself. One word, Briony. I had to put this book down with 70 pages left because I could not bring myself to read another chapter through the snotty princesses' POV. Indecisive, annoying and terribly dull, one character ruined a perfectly decent book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrelieved, boring gloom","review":"Yhis novel is ponderous, slow-paced, and absolutely depressing.there isn't a single moment of relief to despair, gloom, misery and tragedy. It's only a Tolkien in negative."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Diificult Truth To Acknowledge","review":"I absolutely loved Tad Williams' Memory,Sorrow,and Thorn series. When his sci-fi series came out, I eagerly read the first novel, and regretfully concluded that Williams' sci-fi style was not to my taste. When War of the Flowers came out, I bought and read it as well. More mediocrity. Finally, Shadowmarch was released. Surely, when allowed to write in the sub-genre which originally catapulted him to fame, he would once again release a polished and engaging tale. I have never been more wrong. Williams makes the mistake of thinking that the more main characters there are, the better. The result is a book with characters that you never know well enough to actually like. I have concluded, reluctantly, than Williams is something of a hack. If you could buy a \\"Write-By-Numbers\\" Kit, this book would be the result."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Williams I expected","review":"Having read Robin Hobb's Farseer trilogies and Martin's Song of Fire and Ice, I expected better of Mr. Williams. I am a huge fan of his and every book I had read until now was a milestone for me in every type of fiction. His fantasy and science fiction were excellent and I thoroughly enjoyed The War of the Flowers. Here, it seems he has lost his way. There is not enough character development and the little there is reads like young adult fantasy. I believed Mr. Williams would once again take the notch further up, if not completely outside the box. And if we are supposed to stick with it and see what happens later, well, I must admit that I no longer have the patience for this when book prices are what they are. I don't want a 600+ page prologue. Thanks but no thanks. Maybe next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho hum","review":"Tad Williams has written better; I enjoyed the first couple of books of his Otherland series, The War of Flowers was a good book, and the Memory, Sorrow, Thorn series was a respectable bit of fantasy literature. Shadowmarch just feels weak. I had trouble making it through this book, finding it a potent sedative - handy if you have trouble sleeping, but not an endorsement generally."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"I started this, and found it was too dull and I was not interestedenough in the character to continue. Boy, with little people advisers,gets in trouble, etc., etc., I suppose my tolerance for standardfantasy trilogies is getting less and less all the time. This was verydisappointing compared to the excellent Memory, Sorrow and Thorn,though. Get those instead if you are considering Williams and haven'tread anything before."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is an insult to its readers","review":"I wanted an overview of this big industry that EDA is and this book sounded perfect... I changed my mind not too long after the first couple of pages.The book is rather short (200 pages) even with HUGE fonts and useless appendixes (like remind the reader that 1 is \\"one\\" 10^0, 10 is \\"ten\\" 10^1 and so on)I kept the best for the end, the entire book was written like a kid's book: it's only dialogue!!! (Ms. Newbie (sic) new to an EDA company (Sandbox) talks with other employees).It's a complete insult to anyone's intelligence.Stay away, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Childishly written - somewhat useful content","review":"The book is written mostly as a conversation between a new employee at an EDA company and various people. It's very hard to read, because the entire time you're repeating in your head \\"Does the author really think people talk this way?\\" It's distracting. The content is somewhat useful, if simplistic, so the book doesn't rate a \\"1\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written description of this arcane field","review":"Excellent writing and superb Table of Contents - poor index though. Technical and non-technical audience can understand and appreciate this comprehensive review of this important industry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basics & features explained, great tips","review":"This book is an essential for getting the most out of this powerful program. The basics are explained simply and thoroughly and the most valuable tips as well as features new to Illustrator 8 are highlighted.Menus & dialog boxes are illustrated throughout, helping the user find the right buttons & settings. Well designed output samples show what is going on with each step, making the transition to the advanced features a smooth one.Some of the things I found most useful were detailed information on the use of Photoshop filters in Illustrator and extensive coverage of third party plug-ins. The chapter on type showed me some great new ideas.There is a color gallery in the middle of the book that shows off the fabulous potential of Illustrator 8. Most of this art is on the CD-ROM included with the book, as are a number of demos & plug-ins, some are only for the MAC."},{"rating":"2","title":"Use it with other references","review":"A great reference too for Illustrator.

We thought it would be appropriate for him to practice his beginning reading skills with a book that portrayed a current episode in his young life. It worked sooooo well! He was encouraged to read it to everyone who would sit with him & he shared his loose tooth story by cementing a penchant for reading at the same time. Timely for sure; good shipping time line also."},{"rating":"2","title":"When Will I lose a Tooth?","review":"From the time our granddaughter turned 5 she has been asking when her teeth would begin to fall out. Our family immediately related to the story! \\"My Tooth is About to Fall Out\\" is a comforting story about a young girl who discovers she has a loose tooth. She talks about it wiggling and jiggling. She wonders when and where it will actually come out and what she might be doing. All, I believe, are realistic concerns for a child losing a tooth for the first time. It makes for an identifiable experience for young children and a great book for early readers. The vocabulary is more than a beginning reader can tackle independently, but the illustrations offer specific clues for the content. This is of high interest and nicely written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this CD","review":"stand outs include Expensive shoes, Hunter's lullaby, Glue & Frozen Pool.

Right away began experiencing extreme fatigue- I could easily take 2 of the regular l-theanine; I decided to take one of these on the few days I tried this; I felt very drugged, and by early evening I HAD to sleep. A nap before bed time!Take with caution; perhaps this would be better only taken at bedtime ( for me) , but this fatigue was a hole body experience that was very disturbing for me.

When it came and I opened it I was appalled. I've no idea how the product picture was taken! There is no way anyone could use this. First of all, it is NOT adjustable. One size fits all. Secondly, the plastic is so stiff and unbending that it's almost impossible to wrestle it into anything resembling the picture. Even if your head was big enough to fit in it, there is only a thin cloth strip sewn along the edge of the hard plastic to keep water from simply pouring all around you. If it were actually like the picture, it would be a great thing. How the other person who wrote a review got this to work on a child, I cannot imagine!

This tubing will not compress easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a book for believers","review":"This is not a book for believers. Anyone of the Jewish, Christian or Muslim faith should not pick up this book because you will be seriously offended. Mr. Kirsh takes several Biblical passages out of context to use in his argument. His attitude towards anyone who believes is devoutly religious and believes strongly in the words of the Bible is extreemly condeceding. He says \\"If you read the Bible with open eyes and an open mind\\". Therefore presuposing anyone who does not see things his way is narrow minded. It was not until I got trough the first 30 or so pages did I realise that none of the \\"rave reviews\\" he received were from any clergy or religious orders. Further I realised that Mr. Kirsch views are not stated out in the open. You don't see his perjorative view towards the Bible, Moses and God until AFTER you've got into reading the book. I would only recomend this book to aetheists and others who are contemptuous of the Bible and the above faiths."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kirsch is a detached biographer...","review":"...too bad he is not a more passionate writer. He seems to miss so many crucial elements in the life of Moses. Yes, there is much missing about this great man known and loved by millions, but Kirsch seems to exult in the petty. He writes as an uninvolved observer of this extraordinary man. There is no love, no passion, no sense of deep respect for Moses in this text. I kept waiting for the page that would reveal some astonishing, delightful insight into this spiritual giant but I read in vain.Kirsch chooses wonderful subjects but leaves the reader with less information and more questions than when they first picked up the book. More insightful and intiguing studies have been done on the life of Moses. I suggest looking elsewhere for inspiration, no offense to Kirsch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Scholarship with an Axe to Grind","review":"Kirsh's work is third rate at best. Yes, he has read a great deal of supporting text (midrash, commentary, etc), but he fails to present it in a balanced way. He opts instead to focus on what ever grabs his fancy. For example, where he chooses to attack Moses or the text he often does not offer the reader a traditional Jewish explination or, worse, presents it and then belittles it. This can sometimes boarder on the amusing, such as when he holds up Freud's text on Moses as illuminative, when scholars are near unanimous that it tells you more about Freud then it does about Moses.If you are interested in this subject, there are far better texts. Start with a bible with traditional comentators and go from there. Like with Frued, this will tell you more about Kirsch and the biases of a liberal Jew in LA then it will tell you about Moses."},{"rating":"1","title":"False Packaging Advertised","review":"The advertisement for this product is for a case of tabs, including the original case price marked down.

When it stays it stays, the cap got you covered. Period. It is good for conditioning, oil hair treatments, perms, body art quality henna applications(for hair), painting the ceiling and walls(not to get paint on your hair), sanding and priming the car (no dust on hair).I always henna my hair once or twice a year and this fit the bill; this is a universal fit, not like some stores that have caps and they tend to be on the small side.For the price I paid is a steal for 30 caps. These will last me at least very, very, long time; if it isn't ripped I just rinse the stains off and let dry and reuse 5 times until it gets, too, gnarly.

Whitmore elucidates the advantages of a criterion-referenced instruction program based on having employees practice new skills and tasks. This differs from traditional or academic training programs in that skills are evaluated through performance rather than tests. As he explains it, you can feel how much he believes in teaching job competence through practice. However, while this approach might work well for certain skills that lend themselves to being taught readily through repetitive practice, it may not work as well for tasks that involve creativity and non-routine thoughtful activity. Thus, he may overstate the advantages of his one-size-fits-all approach. The book provides voluminous detail about creating systems to organize and deliver skill-based training, so we believe it will have specific appeal to its target audience: learning officers, training managers and human resource directors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make sure you get what you order","review":"Be sure and check what you get immediately when it comes in.

The mystery takes up 5 pages in the beginning, 5 pages at the end and is all but forgotten in the 300 pages in between. The heroine Francesca Cahill is supposed to be a clever sleuth and charmingly naive, but instead came across as nosy and clueless. There is not enough interaction between the heroes to make us believe they would fall madly in love w/each other. I was irritated all the way to the end when the idiot savant once again solves the crime before the superfluous hero rescues her...again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deadly Pleasure","review":"I bought this latest book because I was familiar with most of her previous productions. It really should be titled \\"Deadly Dull.\\" I was dismayed at the very poor level of writing. If this were a \\"1st book\\" I would never buy another. The dialogue was wooden. The plot was developed in a choppy way and was largely unbelievable. The heroine was impulsive, intrusive, insensitive, and so annoying that her appeal to the males (Bragg and brother) was beyond comprehension. I thought her brother-in-law's response was most reasonable and was sorry he didn't hit her or worse, so that we could see if she might actually be able to learn some restraint. I will carefully peruse any further publications purporting to be by Brenda Joyce before purchase. This one goes immediately to the second hand book store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deadly Pleasure","review":"I loved all of Brenda Joyce's previous books. I purchased this based upon how much I enjoyed her other writings. This book was not only not interesting but down right boring. It in no way can this compare the any of her others.

I hope this book isn't an indication of her books to come!"},{"rating":"2","title":"++","review":"I would definitely rate this book and the Cahill/Bragg series a 10.

It already looses some pages and the worst thing is that all the pictures are totally blurred and often hard to understand since they are all black and white. This makes it really difficult to figure out what the meaning of all the statistics or graphics are since you don't know which line is what. I'm quite confused since the book should be an original but it looks like a cheap copie.

It has a rich, deep, aromatic flavor and goes well with a bit of sugar and milk or just plain. Higgins and Burke decaffinated Orange Pekoe is lighter in flavor than the Bigelow, but still offers deep amber richness. The third isn't sold on Amazon, but hopefully they'll add it as they carry the Peet's brand coffee.

However, my 1 year warranty is up in May and I am on my 3rd camera! They will give me 90 days on the 3rd one and that is it. I am going to have to buy their extended warranty program through HP because I fear in 3-6 months, it won't work again.

Even if he is dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete letdown.","review":"What really amazes me about this book is that it is the second half of a book originally published as one large selection of Bukowski's short stories. I have read the collected first half which is called \\"The Most Bueatiful Woman In Town And Other Short Stories\\" and liked it emensily. However with this book everything fell apart and I did'nt even read the last few stories. Strange indeed. I guess my first experience with Bukowski was fresh and new. Now my second experience was just putting up with a boring drunk. This could quite probably kill any desire to read more of Bukowski."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Big tits and ass and eyes like the sky after a good rain\\"","review":"The great Charles Bukowski was obviously drunk out of his mindwhen he pounded out these stories, but if you sift through the pornographythat constitutes most of the book you will find some genuinely inspiredpoetic brilliance. ( Really! It's there! )"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I may run contrary to the other reviewers here, but I really didn't like tales. The book, first of all, doesn't even read like a Bukowski book. The writing style is totally different from any of the novels or short story books, especially Hot Water Music and South of No North. I really don't believe that Bukowski wrote this book, sorry. I think it was some kind of posthumous ghost writer, and not a very good one. Second of all, the stories are terrible. They don't make any sense. Things happen in the book and you're not sure what's going on. The plots have no sort of logical flow to them. So even if Bukowski DID write this book, which he didn't, it still wouldn't be worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jackass: The Book","review":"The longstanding question of what someone will say to get attention has finally been answered. Charles Bukowski has crafted a novel with all the hideous ugliness of a movie like Buffalo '66 but with none of the underlying artistic skill or creativity. It is a remarkable bit of irony that Bukowski is a so-called poet, but we learn this in the pages of a book that should never have been written, much less published. The book jumps from one pointless and often disgusting story to another with no rhyme or reason and leaves you wondering why you just read it all the way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Congrats Mr. B - What a pile of drivel!","review":"Congrats Mr. Bukowski!

Almost all symphonies in this set are performed correctly from the technical stand-point but the real musical issues are not resolved appropriately. As an example one may consider the passages that symbolize vulgarity in music. These are key points in Mahler's symphonies but Bernstein conducts them with a breadth and solemnity that makes them and the rest of the music sound ridiculous.

This one is not one of my favorites. Once a child is signing, this may be a good choice as it presents a larger vocabulary than most other signing videos.

He knew how to identify many objects because of the dvd. We have volume 2 too and at 17-months old, he's mastered 90% of the signs in vol. 1 and about 50% of the signs in vol. 2. He selects what he likes to identify and learns the signs and words. In our case, signing definitely helped him start speaking early rather than delaying his speech development."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Times","review":"Let me just say, I've been dying to get my hands on this series without breaking my wallet. I'm happy to say that everything went quite smoothly with my expectations. I'm a huge fan of 80's style anime, like Dirty Pair and Robotech. It just has that look that anime now a days just can't replicate. First of all, most if not all of the series was made by hand and not computer help. It just shows a lot of blood and effort on that part alone. They also took great care in making each episode on movie standards, all quite polished thanks to the remastering. I would highly recommend putting the settings of audio to Japanese and subtitled, since the english is a bit crappy, America back then was just getting into anime and unfortunately not every voice actor was good at expressing emotions or tone for that matter.

I gave this to my 6 year old nephew and he was not interested in it at all and I do not blame him. The tricks were unimpressive and not particularly \\"magical\\". It was definitely too difficult for somebody his age to pull off. For example, one of them required you to squeeze a cylinder to keep the ball inside.

I doubt he will play with it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected better","review":"I expected a better made product that was easier to use. One of the tricks (ball and cups) was too tricky for most of the adults in the room to do and this was likely because of the poorly made buttons on the sides of the cups.

Dr. Hogan's research adds depth to the story told in the letters from Jacob Greenawalt to his wife Rebecca. The story will be especially of interest to those living in Western Pennsylvania, as familiar place and family names jump off the pages and even minor characters come alive under his pen. However, the story of love, war, and longing has universal appeal. For those with a particular interest in this period of history, the book adds new details of the contributions made by the people of West Newton and the surrounding area. It is one of the finest books that I have read in quite some time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be there with Jacob","review":"Dr. Hogan takes the reader of this wonderful book right into the Civil War, and even deeper into the life of Col. Greenawalt. You won't want to put it down.This is a story that will etch itself into your heart. As you read, you will come to know and understand Jacob's feelings on the war, his relationships with his fellow soldiers, and most of all, his intense love for Rebecca. The descriptions of the battles he fought in are so realistic that you'll feel you are there at his side. The pain and longing to see his wife that Jacob feels when he is dying in the army hospital is likewise just as real.The author of this book did a great service to both the memory of Jacob Greenawalt, and to the people of Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, by writing this book. Having grown up in West Newton myself, it was especially moving, but you don't have to be a Pennsylvanian \\"Wildcat\\" to appreciate this great story."},{"rating":"2","title":"1080 Straight Grind Rail (flat)","review":"This grind rail isn't too bad. It's easy to assemble and disassemble which makes it highly portable. Its probably not the most sturdy rail on the market, but its sturdy enough. It can be raised or lowered to 3 different heights which is pretty cool. I think the legs may have holes in them if you want to secure it down to something. I compared the reviews of this rail to many others before purchasing, and this seemed like the best option to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good price, not so good skateboard rail.","review":"I was super excited to receive this rail, and especially excited for the low price.

It is square which makes it easier to balance while grinding and held together well after repeated use. Convenient to have at home and light enough to be easily moved and broken down. Unfortunately it was stolen, so I decided to get another one for his birthday. Box came in with a hole and when I opened it, the pins and rubber feet were missing. Ended up buying some pins at the hardware store an split some rubber hose for the feet, then duct tapped them on. This works well to keep the rail from sliding. Not sure where in the process the hole in the box came from, but others have noted the same issue. Purchased on Amazon because of the price, but ended up spending another $10.00 to replace the pins. If you want to go through the hassle of a return, or spend the money for missing parts, the rail is a good choice for the beginner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Conditions","review":"Excellent conditions and shipping package.

First he starts with the statement that you should not learn these techniques with this book and search a center. I assumed that he wrote this to avoid liability lawsuits. But reading on I found it very wordy and difficult to follow. I guess all the positive reviews were written by people who actually visited a course. Then I read about the \\"ovarian breathing\\" which apparently is a cornerstone of the practises. The descriptions on how to do that are very poorly written and you cannot follow them without visitng a course. The pictures are not better either. How can it be so difficult to explain a breathing technique in simple clear steps with half the words?Most of us don't have Tao courses nearby or can afford to visit one. If you must visit a course anyway then why should you buy the book?Maybe google delivers a clearer decription of the techniques, I'll have a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Healing Love Through Tao","review":"Great Book, Highly recommended for the beginning tantra student, offers all the technicalities,yet is nowhere near in describing the true effects of tantra training and its possibilities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't be learned from a book!!!","review":"All of Mantak Chia's books give the impression that these practices can be learned from his books.

Princess Elizabeth of Wyndborough met a man at a masked ball and although she is a virgin, she has sex with him that night and ends up pregnant.He is actually Prince Raphael of Thortonburg who has spent his life avoiding those annoying Wyndborough princesses because both royal parents would just love to see their children marry and unite the families. When he discovers his lover is Elizabeth he lashes out that she was setting him up, when he discovers she is pregnant, he cruelly taunts her saying that it's probably not his.Elizabeth never comes alive and Raphael is such a jerk, and unfortunately their relationship never recovers. They get their happily ever after, but I didn't really care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my kind of hero.","review":"This is the first I've read by Ms. Winston & it'll be the last! Prince Rafael of Thortonburg is certainly NO prince of a guy. He always jumps to conclusions & really rips into Princess Elizabeth with his hurtful accusations & recriminations. Although he apologizes soon after, the damage is done. I really think there should be more on-your-knees-grovelling before he's forgiven. Overall, this is the worst book I've read in the Royally Wed series so far.Don't miss the 1st 3 books in the series: Alexandra in \\"Royal Baby on the Way\\" (ok start), Katherine in \\"Undercover Princess\\" (the best), Serena in \\"The Princess's White Knight\\" (not bad).

Why is it that people believe that if its called \\"Heavy Metal 2000\\" it should only contain heavy metal music? Duh! It's the magazine name the licence is based on, not the artists on the soundtrack! (get it Mr. Censored?) To make a long story short, the original movie and soundtrack are about 100 times more worthy of your hard-earned money than this doo-doo. Avoid this CD and the coming movie like a syphyllitic donkey."},{"rating":"2","title":"help","review":"i dont mind this movie at all, a passable (if obviously) american attempt at mature animation with adequate music, the name of the movie alone undoubtably lets a majority of people know if they'll enjoy it. one thing is driving me utterly mad, and this may not be the place to ask, but the song in the scene where Tyler is marching on the holy land with his reptile army, i may just be missing it, but i cannot find it on this album.. if someone else has, or knows the song i'd greatly appreciate it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching Scores","review":"I recently attended a lecture given by the composer of this score, Dan Jones, at Weston College.

I watched this on a HDTV with an upscaling DVD player and I noticed that the whole movie seemed to be just a little out of focus. I'm not sure that's on purpose or if it was a problem with the upscaling.Bottom line is that while this is a watchable zombie movie, there are much better ones out there.

The hook can't be in the \\"to hang\\" position if you need the light, and vice versa. Can't say I much care for handle either. Not enough angle between it and the chuck(?), and it's all fat at the bottom. You know, where your hand kinda gets smaller what with the little pinky fingers, and all. However, for the pos: re-charge time for the battery is about 15 minutes, and the little guy sure does punch above his weight.

They gutted most of the elements that makes the books so charming and gripping, as TV networks often do, in their oh-so tepid attempts to broaden the appeal of the show to gain more viewers. What SF channel failed to realize is they could have made this a very popular SF show a la Battlestar Galactica by getting talented writers, producers with some imagination and let them run free with little interference and make some really memorable, striking storylines.Instead we got Harry Dresden lite, and this show died an early death. I watched the entire series on TV and ended up forcing myself to watch the last few episodes, groaning most of the way through.

The names were the same as in the book series but the people and situations weren't. Still, the TV episodes held together with their own internal consistency. I can see why Bob is not just a skull, that Murphy doesn't look a thing like the Karen Murphy in the books and so on.However, the acting quality is pretty good. The stories are typical television fare, but the series is much better than the run of the mill stuff. I like the TV Harry Dresden. The changes make sense. The visuals that recreating the book would require wouldn't make good video. And, the guy who plays Bob is excellent. If you're okay that the series only loosely resembles the novels it can be a lot of fun. I'm sad that the show only ran one season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dresden Files Review","review":"I loved this series, why did they have to go and cancel is after the 1st season. It was only a handfull of episodes and most were just the beginning of what happens in the books written by Jim Butcher. The only thing a would have to say was disapointing was that there was not enough bonus content on the season. Overall it was a great value $22.99(CND) I really hope they do choose to continue the series sometime in the near future."},{"rating":"2","title":"There's a right way and a wrong way to use Magic. A path of Light and a path of Dark.","review":"Based on the ultra-successful book series of the same name, this Television program brought its fans a fantastic mix of familiarity and newness to their beloved character of \\"Harry Dresden\\".Ask yourself:Do you like Firefly?Do you like Angel?Do you like Buffy the Vampire Slayer?If you do, you WILL like the Dresden Files. The show needed a bigger budget for its first season, but even with what they had the episodes are increasingly more entertaining and more entertaining with each one. And they are a heck of an addition to the MARVELOUS book series.Here's to hoping there is a Second Season of the Dresden Files. Here's to hoping that you buy and love this series as much as so many others who gave it a chance already do.~AH"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the show!","review":"We were disappointed when the show was cancelled. I got a couple of the books for my husband and he got hooked on the book versions. The audio books are read by James Marsters (Spike from Buffy)and he does a fabulous job! The televsion versions are a little different than the books, but we enjoy seeing the chemistry between the Harry and Bob characters. Glad to be able to see the television version again while waiting for Jim Butcher to publish again."},{"rating":"2","title":"not my favorite ..but the best SCI FI could do...","review":"..i thought the episodes sometimes felt a little rushed and not so solid... but having the episodes released in the wrong order probably had something to do with some of that - But Still.. i got into this show which was too good of a show for SCi Fi to keep around.. they just want crappy low budget movies on their channel i guess"},{"rating":"2","title":"Being a fan of the books, I was not prepared to like this show","review":"Just too many changes to suit my taste. The hockey stick instead of his staff? Murphy in no way resembles Murphy? Bob is animate? He drives a Jeep?It sounds like small stuff, but taken en toto it seemed like the series would not be too much like the books I have loved since the beginning.Bob's first appearance convinced me that sometimes change can be very good. The hockey stick's making sense, too. Okay, I still don't like Murphy. I wish Valerie Cruz had been Susan Rodriguez and the cute, perky blonde who played Susan was Murphy. So--I mostly ignore Murphy and concentrate on the things I love about this series.I hope this one lasts a long time, but my track record for picking winners on TV is very low. Grab this one while you can if you enjoy the books, it'll surprise you. If you like paranormal detectives, you'll like it, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Style, imagination, and wit.","review":"The Dresden Files was a wonderfully entertaining series with an outstanding ensemble cast. Paul Buckthorne as the witty Harry Dresden and Terrence Mann as his \\"oh so\\" British sidekick ghost had their roles nailed. Together they had a humerous tit for tat \\"buddy\\" relationship that was enjoyable to watch. The other regulars--Morgan, Murphy, and her skeptical lieutenant detective--were also strongly written characters and beautifully portrayed.As the series progressed and the writers settled in, the scripts got better. Given a little more time, the Dresden Files could have become a classic. Why the Sci-Fi Channel canceled the show is a complete mystery to me and the thousands of other Dresden fans. (Have you seen their Flash Gordon series? Snzzzzz!)The Dresden Files had style, imagination, and wit. It was a must-see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series - hope someone picks it up","review":"The Dresden Files is a well-written, funny, solid drama that was canceled due to SciFi Channel's apparent need to get rid of all of its fans. Paul Blackthorne does a great job of portraying the Harry Dresden of Jim Butcher's books. I can easily hear Blackthorne's voice as I am reading the books despite the fact he is British. (That's two actors - the other being Hugh Laurie - that do a great American accent.) The Dresden Files is easily one of our favorite shows on TV (me and my two teenagers)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magic Even If It Ain't So Pure","review":"No it isn't as good as the book, but if you have any trouble visualizing Harry this is the ticket. You'll love Terrance Mann as Bob and won't ever be able to think of him as just a skull. And Murphy...the blond Murphy of the books isn't really up to a toe to toe with Valerie Cruz, no, the exotic Murphy of the television show will steal your heart. And what about the show, you ask? The show is the window even if too brief and adapted for twelve year old television viewing audience, into the wonderful world of Harry. Houdini better watch out, there's a new Harry in town and his name is Dresden. Don't let this series slip away buy it now and bring magic into your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series!","review":"Dresden Files was a wonderful adaptation of Jim Butcher's books.

I knew nothing of the Dresden Files, Harry Dresden nor Jim Butcher. The one good thing about this show is that it made me start reading Butcher's incredibly fun and entertaining novels, something that essentially the tv show did not capture. This show took alot of liberties with Butcher's Dresdenverse and in some cases made outright changes to the characters themselves. I personally am happy to see the show go away, and my hope is that eventually someone will come along and write (maybe Butcher himself) a suitable screenplay that truly captures his vision. Maybe one day it will make it to the big screen. But if it doesnt, he has written over 10 incredibly rich and incredibly entertaining novels that should keep new and existing fans happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected.","review":"I love the books that this series are based on. I was very excited when I say that a series was based on the books. That being said, after watching the first session it's easy to see why it wasn't picked up for a second. The description on the DVD should have said it was very loosely based on the books. I was very disappointed in the show and I would not recommend this series to anyone who enjoyed the books. It was a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dresden Fails","review":"WARNING!! If you are a fan of the book series DO NOT watch this show. The Dresden Files is the most amazing book series I have ever read, it is incredible and I love every new book more than the last.Jim Butcher and Harry Dresden are my heros. However.....the TV series is soooooo bad, I cannot even begin to describe how horribly awful it truly is in comparison to the books. None of the characters in this show are anything like their novel counterparts,the acting is extremely poor, and the story is completely wrong/different that is no longer the Dresden Files and is instead just a bad show about wizards and stuff.I will never understand how such an amazing series of novels could become such an absolute failure of a television series.Read the books, please."},{"rating":"1","title":"One season too many","review":"The books are fantastic. They would make an amazing series ... of movies. It would require an investment of time, money and talent equivalent to what was done with Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter. On the other hand, this series was so rushed, poorly written, poorly acted and cheesy that it probably harmed the ability to attract investors to do a good, all out movie.When this came out I wanted - REALLY WANTED - to like it. Week after week I found I just couldn't bring myself to watch it. It impugns, by association, the quality of the books. There are many one-season series I miss, and believe were cancelled for the wrong reasons, but this one wasn't cancelled for the wrong reasons. It really did stink."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original","review":"This series that originally aired on Sci-Fi channel was very original. It's a real shame they cut it before it really got a chance to gain a following. It wasn't put in the most viewer friendly slot to begin with considering it's target audience age groups. It was a good series, with a good premise and some very original characters. It's worth the time. I was happy to add it to my collection of series TV shows that have to do with Magic and Mayhem."},{"rating":"2","title":"good is not always better","review":"As a fan of the Dresden books.

After seeing a few episodes I immediately decided to order this set it reminded me a great deal of the X-files combined with a much darker Harry potter theme. I was sad to say this great show only went up to twelve episodes I wish there could have been more. I do recommend to viewers that some of these episodes are very hardcore and while not extremely gory they are still bloody. That aside I would say to any person thinking about this to look at some of the episodes and see if you truly wish to buy this but I will tell you now I think it is definitely worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dresden Files- First Complete Season Review","review":"Great DVD easy to get hooked on and to watch over and over again.Makes one wish for a second and third season of the series.The series is well written and acted and filed in Canada and was aired on the Scifi channel on Sunday nights.

As I am an avid reader and lover of Science Fiction and Fantasy, I am at a loss as to how I missed these books or the show.I am a big fan of cop shows with interesting consultants like Psych & Castle. The cop show genre has grown stale (as 3 CSIs, a million Law & Orders, and 2 NCIS shows prove out.) It seems like every time we get something interesting it gets cancelled. This series has excellent casting, interesting stories to solve, and an evolving plot line that lasts the full season/ series.One thing to keep in mind is that Amazon has this posted as (surely due to the publisher's misleading request,) \\"The Complete First Season.\\" This is the only season. It should read, \\"The Complete Series.\\" Don't be mislead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Dresden","review":"This is a very good portrayal of the characters from the Dresden Files book series.

I think that they are brilliantly written and wonderful. I expected something similar to the books in the show and found it was not there. It would have been nice to know that this TV series was based on the books, and only loosely at best. Paul Blackthorne, although a good actor, does not carry the persona of Harry Dresden, it just doesn't work. Second, I'm sorry but Murphy is described as being a petite blond warrior, not a somewhat tall, petulant, brunette. I was also looking forward to seeing Mouse. The other continuity issues I had were Harry's apartment being completely wrong, the blue bettle being missing, and Bob. If you are a huge fan of the books, please don't buy this item, its really not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Copy protection is getting ridiculous","review":"I bought this, quite frankly, to bring my order total over $25.00 to get free shipping. I had read a couple of the Jim Butcher books in e-book format and they weren't too bad. The movies, when I finally got the dvd to play on our TV's dvd player, were actually quite well done, if you like dark fantasy. My problem is with the ridiculous copy protect scheme on this dvd. I couldn't get it to play on my computer at all (Win XP Pro, SP3)after trying it on 3 different dvd player software suites and downloading several updated codec packs. Even the dvd player for our tv set had some problems with this disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not near as good as the books. Read them instead","review":"Read the books...then watch this. You will be disappointed. Most of the book lore is trashed in this series and a lot of it could have been fixed. Dresden carries a staff but it must have been too hard to find him a piece of wood so they gave him a hockey stick. Yep, if a magical hockey puck has you down just call for Harry!! The stories are ok but they don't include the atmosphere and strength of the books. The show didn't have enough money to do this series justice and unfortunately it shows. There are worse shows out there but not by a huge margin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could NOT play in the USA!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Unbelievable!!!!!

I love them all. I tried watching this when it first came out and hated it...mainly cause I was SO shocked at the watered down version of the books...so watered down as to be ALMOST but not quite unrecognizalbe. I have since tried watching it again and if I watch it on its own merit and forget the brilliant books it was based on...well there are STILL glaring problems, but these could have been overcome as with any new series kinks have to be worked out. I think it could have continued to grow and become even better. I actually enjoy it on its own merit. I think Sci Fi is extrememly stupid to take such a promising premise, ruin it, and then not even give it a decent chance. It really was a promising, well made show....too bad sci fi isn't as promising anymore...guess it isn't worth their time if it isn't really stupid and dumbed down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dallasite","review":"Not impressed.

Only disappointed that only one season was done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely first rate","review":"Have you ever noticed how so many Sci-Fi and fantasy shows start strong... and quickly degenerate into the same old personal conflicts you find in every soap opera? The Dresden Files is not like that. In fact, every single episode is better than the one that precedes it. Each one tells you a bit more about Harry, his history, and what he's capable of. No doubt that's because the shows are each based on one of the novels, with all (or most) of the story line of the novel compressed into one powerful episode.Regardless of how they did it, this is a first rate show, with tight scripting, excellent acting, and some very clever special effects. The show, and the character of Harry Dresden, are like nothing you've seen before. I was introduced to the show by friends who are big fans of the books and the show, and even though I didn't think it would appeal to me I became an immediate fan. There's only one problem with the show: There's only one season of episodes! :-("},{"rating":"2","title":"Dresden files","review":"I love the fact that while the series is different from the books it remains true to the vision of Jim Butcher. The special effects are good,and I think it's cool that Nicholas Cage has a hand in producing the show. Everyone needs a little magic in life so the Dresden Files are like Harry Potter for adults. My only complaint is not having more of the seasons on Prime."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really enjoy the magic","review":"This series was very entertaining. It had a good story line and good acting. I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend it to others.."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was an enjoyable show to watch.","review":"The Dresden files never really caught on big, which is why the show only ran for one season. I enjoyed the show while it was running quite a bit though. I was very pleased when I saw the series on the Amazon Prime list. I've enjoyed being able to watch the shows again. I know that there are a number of fans of the books who were very displeased because the TV series had significant differences from the books. I'm really not put off by that.I enjoyed the show. I thought it was well acted and directed. In some ways, I find SyFy's current hit series Lost Girl, to be rather similar. In some respects it also reminds me of much older series Kolchak: The Night Stalker. I wish there could have been a couple more seasons of the Dresden Files."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as you could reasonably expect.","review":"I watch the series, then read the books. I can tell you this show would have had four hour long episodes and a billion dollar FX budget to make it like the novels. The show is great for what it is...a TV show. It manages to entertain you, keep your attention, and still have space to sell ads and pay for itself. If you have already read the novels, you might still like it if you keep this stuff in mind. If not, you'll probably come back and give it one star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even with a DVR, I planned my time to watch it!","review":"Hello...this is my first review. I write in support of this great TV series both because I will purchase the DVDs, and in hopes that the series will continue for many years to come. I've read all the Harry Dresden books and found, for once, the books and the TV series do justice to each other. The actors are perfect for the roles. No TV series can exactly follow a book but this keeps the heart and soul of the world Jim Butcher built for Harry. The stories are appeal to that magic younger demographic but also to us beyond that simplistic boundary. And I hope the producers remember we have money to spend too. Why encourage continuing the TV series here on Amazon? This is where I will buy more series DVDs! I sincerely hope this program will be renewed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dvd leaves me wishing for more","review":"The Dresden Files grew over the very short time it was on air from an echo of the great Jim Butcher books to a fully fleshed out TV creation that stood quite well on its own dramatic merits.

Shame on you Scifi for not giving Harry time to prove true."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series","review":"I am a Harry Dresdan fan. So, when I saw that there was a Dresden File series, I got excited. This series delivered. The actor that played Harry Dresden was perfect.

Hardly...same names (mostly) same locations, and the existence of magic. That's it.If you like the Sci-Fi original movies, this will be fine.

Can't wait for another episode."},{"rating":"1","title":"No magic here","review":"As with other reviewers, and as a fan of the Jim Butcher books, I too wanted to like this series. I've watched the first episode and am struggling to find the enthusiasm to continue. Why the TV writers felt the need to rewrite the characters is a mystery to me. Bob the visible sidekick? Well, maybe. But Murphy as a tall brunette with a kid? WTF? I think Butcher has created some well-drawn memorable characters, so why did the TV writers decide to scrap the entire book series? It seems as if all they did was take the character's name, none of his traits. Where is Dresden's trademark duster? Why does he drive a Jeep and not the Blue Beetle? If the rest of the series is a badly done as the first episode, my copy of the DVD set will soon be transported to the trade-in store."},{"rating":"1","title":"See the show before reading the books","review":"I've always found that if I read the book first, the movie will disappoint. This is most definitely the case for the Dresden Files series. The books are amazing and I found myself glued to the pages, laughing, and being thrilled by the endings. The show was probably the biggest letdown I have had since I found out about Santa. Taken of itself, the show actually isn't bad at all. It's middle-of-the-road fare -- not bad own its own. However, it just doesn't compare with the books. To be fair, it would really be difficult to do them justice. Any show or movie that did would quickly run up a large fan base... sort of like an adult Harry Potter fan group but with a wicked sense of humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something a little extra for the fans","review":"Q&A With Dean Martin is a re-release of two early SFK EPs (7 tracks), Answer to Both Your Questions and Dean Martin (3 tracks).Both were before their first album, Elsewhere for 8 Minutes, but the instensity of that release was obviously already there.Heavily rock based, with loud guitars and a great rhthym section, Q&A is a welcome addition to SFK's catalogue. Of course, the best part of the album is Paul Dempsey's lyrics, and the tortured voice which delivers them.Lyrics range from pondering everyday activites (\\"I used to tie double knots...\\" on Clint) to anger at the way people treat others (All you can say is 'It's alright'...WRONG ANSWER'\\" on the sensational Dean Martin).This release just reinforces SFK's talent, and it still confounds me as to why they aren't even more popular than they are.

It seems Grace had some problems adjusting to royalty, including the fact that her mother-in-law, Princess Charlotte, despised her. But as years went by, it seems Grace and Rainier became closer. The fact that Rainier is still a widower and always poses for pictures in front of her portrait shows he will always love her!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A real woman, but not \\"promiscous\\"","review":"The media reviewers quoted here harp on Grace Kelly's supposed \\"promiscous\\" behavior, the main point of the book, as far as they are concerned. Anyone who actually reads the book will find someone who had a few discreet affairs before she was married, who took her marriage vows and commitment to her family and role as princess seriously, who worked very hard throughout her life to meet her commitments, and who had a comforting relationship with a kind younger man when her marriage turned lonely as she got older. If she wasn't quite the cold, virginal image presented by Hollywood, good for her.It's a very good book about a real woman of extraordinary beauty who could have settled for a society matron's life in Philadelphia but who made an extraordinary life for herself through her own efforts. Read it for that and not the sensationalism."},{"rating":"2","title":"A detailed account with fascinating research","review":"This is a deep, probing account into the life of the actress turned princess which analyises her relationships with her family and co-stars.

The red hair is lovely and it feels great, too. Her outfit is good and the purse goes great with it, a perfect accessory. If anyone likes the Fashion Fever collection they should buy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tour of Hell","review":"This is truly a brilliant piece of work that successfully places the reader in a vivid, hallucinatory nightmare. \\"Kiss Me, Judas\\" will probably be compared to the later works of James Ellroy, but this author has a true voice of his own. This book weaves a dark spell and captures reality as a twisting nightmare. The author deftly combines jolting plot twists with sharp, accurate characterizations. Also, he skewers the typical hard-boiled cliches into a dark, hellish poetry. This book defies categorization by any genre. Read it and you will feel the effects of a morphine/heroin injection at the base of your spine. Go ahead. I dare you."},{"rating":"1","title":"He has great potential but for now...","review":"I grimmaced at first when I saw the subject matter. This sort of internet urban myth plotline usually seems kind of pathetic, but Baer is a strong writer. At times the images and the language deserve the highest of praise, but overall the writing seems too calculated. I think he definitely is a writer to watch, and the last line was one of the more memorable in years, but as a book on its own I think the characters are a bit too involuntarily cartoonish for me to love this book. I think Baer might write an incredible book oneday, I hope he does, cuz he's a truly gifted writer, much more talented then basically every under-thirty or so writer out there except eugenides. So good luck baer, and to anyone who thought reservation road or any of those other discover books were good, you should be taken out back and shot. Baer deserves to win based on being the only \\"talent\\" of the bunch.

The characters, including Phineas, are superficial and Hollywoodish. Every sentence feels contrived, like Will Christopher Baer and his editor sat in a hotel room in Las Vegas and placed the most random, arbitrary words together to form a meaningless(ful?!) sentence.The last ten chapters contain so many typos, I wonder if the author even proof-read it himself.I love a book filled with foreshadowing and symbols, but most of the effort is hollow in this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"After the first chapter, I was disgusted,almost angered by how awful this book was. Cliche? Yep. Predictable, lazy writing? You betcha. I typically don't write book reviews on Amazon but I had to go out of my way inform my fellow readers out there how awful this book was. Avoid"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ponderous, pedantic, and pretentious","review":"It's not so much that this novel is both immoral and grotesque (which it is), but that the love that is supposed to bind it together is so preposterous as to make the novel unreadable. I found myself giving up around page 100, frustrated by the all-too-precious prose and the absurd idea of a man who's had his kidney removed by a woman only to fall in love with her. I don't know about you, but there's only so far I can stretch a metaphor. Take away my kidney, and that's where I draw the line.UPDATED: It was very interesting to see how all the bad reviews of this novel received multiple unhelpful votes while none of the good reviews did. I wonder who the voters are? Can you say author's friends and family?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good plot","review":"An original voice in genre writing can often be hard to come by. Someone that embraces the genre, while at the same time brings something fresh and something relevant to the table. Baer does just that.While the second half couldn't keep pace with the amazing beginning, it still delivers such a trippy and moody world that it kept me fully engaged and wanting to turn the page.I will definitely read the next book in the series and keep my eye out for anything else by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"strange and wonderful","review":"I'm not much of a literary critic, so I'll keep my review short. I think Baer has an amazingly twisted mind. This book takes you through a warped chain of events and ends suddenly. This noir style read will leave you wanting more. I for one am seeking out my next book by Baer that I am going to read. Definitely buy it, you'll race through it."},{"rating":"2","title":"So it begins","review":"The first book of a fantastic trilogy. A must read for fans of noir, neo-noir, the transgressive, and deep, layered writing. One of my favorite books ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb writing","review":"I thought the writing was superb but the plot thin at times. The in and out of dream sequences worked but I was a little disapointed with the ending. All in all, I enjoyed the novel and would absolutely read the authors next effort. Mr. Baer is a true talent. I could've read his dream-like prose for another hundred pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"A genuine page turner!","review":"I picked up this book and was quickly drawn in by the plot and characters. Stylish noir at its best, this author has no equal, his style is original and certainly dead-on; these people live in their own fascinating world. It is no coincidence that the main character is named Phileas Poe, this guy has some major issues. I am a die-hard mystery fan and have to admit that I have never read anything like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE MOST AUSPICIOUS DEBUT... EVER (?)","review":"I was lucky enough to get my mitts on a proof of KISS ME JUDAS and, boy, while reading it I felt like having a live wire plugged to my brain. Press releases compare the novel to David Lynch's flicks and whatnot, but I think ANY comparison is totally unjust and demeaning. Will Cristopher Baer's book is a true original: a hopiated, hallucinated, darker-than-dark tour thru a surreal world; a doomed love story from hell; a stylistic tour de force. Oh, and don't forget the \\"noir\\" slant, too: compared to this gem, Jim Thompson's oeuvre (which I love) looks like something straight out of the Cenozoic age. Gettin' to the point: KISS ME, JUDAS is true literature for the new millenium, and W.C. Baer is going to become a cult figure in no time. Just wait and see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holy Crap","review":"I had no idea what to expect when I picked this up. Wow was I surprised. This story is completely original. Phineas is a very strange character. I found myself wondering if this all was a brief hallusination, or if these things were in fact occuring. I would love to see them weave this story into a movie. This book is not for all. I loved to be grossed out, and read things just for pure shock value. Any book where the protagionst awakens with a missing kidney-is a book I love to read. I would reccomend this to anyone who enjoys anything out of the norm."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you liked Memento, you'll like this","review":"Its not a backward moving story but it is about a dark journey by a man in search of something he has lost. This time, its his kidney. The femme fatale this time around is a cute asian woman with a military background who gets off on harvesting black market organs. She picks on our hero, Phineas Poe, and so begins a fantastically dark and deep story.There are two stories here: the story of the kidney (who has it, who wants it, whose the fat guy with the gloves?) and the unfolding back-story of Phineas Poe's tragic past.Not to everyone's palate, but if you dig dark and moody, you'll dig this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DJ Andy","review":"This Cd is alright, not as hard as she is live at crobar.

I find it to be the best and better than the other DVD sets. I loved the Hawaiian movie but the Wedding in Las Vegas has to be the most entertaining in the SBTB series. If you didn't catch them when they were on TV, you MUST watch them!!! I loved the high school years, loved the College Years a million times more, but these are my favorites! My cousins are digging the series and they weren't even born when it started on TV! You won't be disappointed if you like the series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure, cheeseball fun!","review":"I just received this DVD as a birthday present about two weeks ago. I grew up watching Saved By the Bell, and was thrilled to get the DVD. If you love Saved By the Bell, you'll love these two movies. The series' distinctive cheesiness is apparent in both movies (although probably a little bit more in \\"Hawaiian Style\\" than in \\"Wedding in Vegas\\").The DVDs are great, and it's wonderful to finally own these guilty-pleasure movies, but I do wish that the DVD had some sort of special features on it. If there had been special features, this DVD would be a five-star rating.Verdict: Must-own for the die-hard Saved By the Bell fan, but don't expect anything extra."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice","review":"Came very quickly.

It is really disapointing to hear so much about a series and to then realize that both the English Dubbing and the Japanese subtitling was atrocious, the animation was sub standard and the plot was mind-numbingly boring. Poke-mon has more depth than this. The episodes were repetive replaying just the same animation from past episodes and in some it seemed as if there was about 5 minutes of new animation. All together one of the worst anime I have ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plenty of better options out there","review":"These are going cheap these days and the main reason is that many computers now ship with built-in digital sound ports.

I really like this tent, particularly the size and ease of setup. But, the rain fly is poorly designed. There are two small plastic see-through windows in the fly and after a couple of times used, the plastic windows tore. It started with small cracks that eventually just ripped when pulled tight. Not sure why the windows are needed where they are but you are better off choosing a different tent with a better design for the fly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for windy conditions","review":"I tried setting up this tent in windy conditions on the beach and it was close to impossible to set up. The stakes aren't that thick so they kept coming out of the sand whereas other tents I owned the stakes were thick enough to hold firmly. If your camping on hard ground or in not so windy conditions, I'm sure it will meet your expectations.

I was intrigued, and it was on sale, so I figured what the heck. It is, by far, one of my most favourite books, as it blends a modern fantasy borrowing heavily from catholocism, voodoo, santeria, and incorporates the mystic legends behind the Delta Blues. It's the story of Robert Johnson (real life blues legend) who, with his dying breath, endangers all of the world by breaking the Eye of the World. As the story progresses, Robert and several others band together to try to save the world from becoming Hell. Add to it a bunch of musical legends, including Elvis, and you've got a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts good, but progresses into the complex topics in a convoluted way","review":"The book starts pretty good, explains a lot of basic stuff in simple language. Where things start getting bad is when the author takes a nasty personal attack at some economists he does not like. Delves into the personal lives in uncharacteristic fashion for any economics author.The other aspect that rubbed me the wrong way is he is not able to explain complex but remarkable stuffs of the 80s and 90s pushed through in simple language.

The front section and back sections of the book were very good with some weakness in the middle part. My main problems with the middle were it gets bogged down somewhat in scientific history and repeats scientific experiments such as the quantum slit wave/particle test which have been rehashed to death in numerous other books of this type (although a first timer might get more out of it). The book does a great job of making the metaphysics-science connnection while discussing the Theory of relativity and Quantum physics. Better than most I've read that have made the same effort.

My favorite story in the collection is about two sisters who marry two stars in the sky. There is also an adorable story about an inquisitive ant who asks all the animals to tell him who is the strongest. The American Indian flavor of these plays are evident, and will add a unique spin on typical children's theatre. Some plays even include American Indian language, phonetically spelled out for the young actors. This book of plays is a gem for directors of children's theatre. I suggest anyone that works with elementary level children, or is interested in American Indian mythology, to go out and get this book today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sporty Ping Pong","review":"I am disappointed with this purchase.

I thought the story of four high school friends who attend a seven-year high school reunion to see if they've reached their goals and sort out unfinished business would supply a story full of uninhibited passion. Instead, the plot is weak, the characters are one-dimensional and the sex scenes lack heat. The only part I found remotely sensual was the one in which Julia seduces a young musician during a photo shoot. I just couldn't get into this novel. To make matters worse, some of the scenes are degrading in ways that the author hadn't intended them to be. At least I don't think Ms. Zoe Le Verdier wanted her characters to come across as dumb, demeaning and superficial. This is the weakest Black Lace offering I've read thus far. Skip this book and read The Captivation by Natasha Rostova or Menage by Emma Holly instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Degrading to the African-American Race","review":"I read this book and was horrified to find that an African-American man could feel so bad about his race. This book is full of sterotypes that the media bombards our people with. How can one love himself and hate where he comes from."},{"rating":"2","title":"REALISTIC, UNREALISTIC","review":"I enjoyed this book, even though I had trouble with it. Now I know some pretty successful brothers but they all don't drive Jags and Mercedes. For all the brothers to have it together and then all the sisters to have these stereotypes: ghetto, money hungry, high maintenance, and perfect. That was unrealistic. Now the brother tripping over his daughter, the interracial dating, and the brother with the 12 year olds I found that to be realistic. It was fun to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"unrealistic","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. Everyone in this book was very unrealistic. Everyone owned their own business with a BENZ or a Jag. And what's up with Angela & Vanessa having to wear fake wedding bands to keep men from approaching them. Who does that??? Also, the dialogue was weak. There were also negative comments about overweight and uneducated people (women especially). And I thought it was so tacky of him to plug his own book, Never Satisfied: How & Why Men Cheat. Maybe next time, Micheal...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Grammar?","review":"Well, I gave the book one star (because it is the lowest) and I have not even read it. I was going through the reviews to see if I wanted to order. Comments were from one extreme to the next but when I read the comment about a few grammar errors I stopped there. No book, no matter who the author is, should be released and expect to get high ratings with grammar errors. The story line may be good to a lot of readers but we should not settle for poor grammar. If it was the publishers fault I hope the author has a new one. A book published with errors is an insult."},{"rating":"1","title":"One question: Why?","review":"Michael Baisden's \\"work\\" were referred to me. I was told I'd enjoy and laugh at his novel. I'm still waiting to laugh. Firstly, every one of his characters is a stereotype, none of them are developed, and the \\"plot\\" (thin as it was) was not even sitcom quality. Maybe the author should spend a little less time doing speaking engagements, and more time learning to write."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than stellar","review":"I was really expecting this book to be great! I was wrong. The title was gripping but the story itself was less than stellar. While the idea of the story was interesting, I felt the characters were under-developed. The only character that you really get any kind of feel for is Derrick, and you still don't get to know him all that well. You never have the opportunity to get to know the characters. You read about one facet of their lives, but that's it. I found the characters to be one-dmensional, the writing bland, and the story line predictable! Desite my view on the book, I applaud the author for his effort and his dedication to his dream!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Author Is Cool, But This Book SUCKS!","review":"Black Men Won't Read for Long If They Have To Read Junk Like This! Give me a break - What the heck is this crap anyway? Michael Baisden is as cool as they come (I've seen him on TV and heard him on the radio a bunch of times). But he should stick to TV. This book is beyond bad. Characters who bored me to death, story-lines as weak as kindergarten fruit punch and a cover that lacked imagination are among the BETTER things about this nonsense. No wonder it's self-publsihed, self-promoted and self-destructive. I wanted to self-destruct when I read it and still wonder what Baisden's point was. If flipping the script on sistah's is where it's at, \\"he ain't even there.\\" Note to Mike - You're cool. Why don't you get a TV show or something? Leave the books to the writers and the promoting to guys like yourself. Ever thought about infomercials?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost made me cry too","review":"When I bought and read this years ago, I expected something really DEEP. Baisden has very passionate opinions, and I hoped he would reveal them in this novel.\\"Men Cry in the Dark\\" was sometimes funny and entertaining, but never DEEP and stimulating. Perhaps 'cry' was a metaphor for talk because these men did talk in the dark, but no meaningful tears were shed. I did not sense, wipe, or taste the drop of a tear from the men nor myself.This one almost made me cry tears of disappointment, but I still enjoyed his other novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did he write this in the dark?","review":"My son read it and asked me to read it so we could reference it in a life-long discussion we have on male/female relationships. I purchased it, took it along with me on a vacation and couldn't get past the first few pages. I think Baisden was either lazy or unskilled when he wrote this book. I never made it to the ending, and it's doubtful I'll pick up the book again.Check out \\"The Season of Beento Blackbird.\\" It's a more thoughtful and useful book about relationships."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do you Blacks write trash on each other?","review":"As a white male, I don't know much about the Black experience. Of the few books I have read that are written by Blacks, they all have this venemous hatred of self and each other. If I had wrote those things about Black women as were mentioned in this novel, I would have been labelled a racist. I wish Baisden and his Black audiences all the best. You all need God's help in writing, reading and living. By the way, I did get a refund for this book not due to the subject but the inability to follow it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Story That's Easy To Read","review":"I had heard so much about \\"Men Cry In The Dark\\" that I finally was compelled to pick up a copy and I'm glad I did. Michael Baisden did a fine job writing the story of four friends dealing with various issues in their lives; meeting the right woman, dealing with the crazy ex-girlfriend, dating woes, and interracial relationships. I liked the character Derrick the most. He seemed very human-like, down-to-earth, a little bit on the egotistical side, but still a regular guy at times. The story does pull you in and leaves you wanting to read more of Baisden's works."},{"rating":"2","title":"entertaing male perspective of relationships","review":"Michael Baisden did an excellent job of sharing a males perspective concerning the trials and tribulations of relationships; Men Cry in the Dark was entertaining,interesting,insightful, and filled with unexpected twists and turns. Angela, you go girl, your character is truly an inspiration on how to deal with those men who choose to do wrong by you. Lastly, thanks Mr. Baisden for avoiding a predictible ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Men cry in the dark\\", was exciting and I loved it!","review":"Michael, Your book was and is very good. I am also Ms. Westside and I can really relate to Angela. I also enjoyed meeting you at our spirited sister of color expo in columbus, ohio. I read Never Satisfied and enjoyed that book also. I was so impressed with you until, I had to get your autograph twice. Keep up the good work and keep the books coming. I hope to see you again in columbus. Take care and keep up the good work again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Help me to Understand","review":"People in general don't need a college degree to be labled as educated. I know a lot of people with college degree's thats dum as hell. I was tired of hearing the characters in the book refer to woman, that didn't attend college as \\"uneducated\\". The old saying is \\"Education is the key to Success, but I think a Education is very important but not the key to success\\". (but helpful in some cases)Besides my obvious complaint, the book is great!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, Beyond Belief","review":"Like most Black women, I am a fanatic about books, especially OUR books. Men Cry in the Dark was a story I needed to read mainly, because I needed to know if men really did cry. All too often you get used to the dog mentality that you face on the dating scene, but this book restored my belief that Black men should be valued for their gifts and strengths. The characters were so real and had real-life dramas. I have recommended this book to everyone I know. I also love to see Black men reading. Finally, there's a book out here that gives the male prospective for them. It's something I've been missing in my readings of other African-American novels. Brothers are tired of hearing only about the dilemmas that face that Black women and so am I. Thank you, Michael for bringing males issues to the surface. Never stop writing, if no one else reads your books, I DEFINITELY will."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much pre-publication hype!","review":"I was rather disappointed in this book. I had heard so much and all I got was Dynasty/Knots Landing served a la ghetto! The author provided too much free advertising with constant brand names. The interracial thing was not written well. The author makes this bro out to be some kind of coward. And why was Angela in the wedding? A round house kick to the groin? What was that? And high fives played out years ago. Instead of buying another novel from this author, I will save my boredom for something else and just donate the money to the author for creative writing lessons."},{"rating":"1","title":"....","review":"I had to return this book and get every penny back. It is not worth a second-read much less a spot on the book shelf. I didn't appreciate the author's style of switching between first and third-person.P.S. Was it my imagination or did every fifty pages mention the man-woman ratio in Atlanta? Give us a break."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"Like some others, I was told this was a must-read by a good friend of mine so I had the expectation of something at least halfway decent. I had already read the joke \\"Never Satisfied\\" so I should have known better than to waste my time. Michael Baisden is humorous and I can almost see where he tries to go but it's too bad he never gets there. Who told this man to keep trying? What's up with switching POV's over and over? If it was in any way consistent, it could have worked but that would have been too much to ask. If you want to kill time, read this book. If you want to kill brain cells try Baisden's \\"Maintenance Man\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"I cried too, tears of pain","review":"This was the worse book I've ever read. I would give it 0 stars if that were an option. I got this book because I usually enjoy reading male authors, especially black male authors. The subject matter was good, but the book seemed more like a first draft then the finished product. I wanted to cry, really. It was self published, but not profread. There were grammatical errors as well as typos. There should be no typos, especially when the book is poorly written. The characters were shallow. He failed to make the characters real, something more than fictional ideas. I only finished the book out of sheer determination. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"good idea, bad book","review":"The language that this book was written in was so simplistic I felt like I was reading the writing of an amateur. The prose was neither interesting, flowing, or well thought. It was choppy and very nondescriptive. The book failed to go into detail in to the lives of the characters. It brushed over central themes for each character, but missed the little details that make prose seem more lifelike. This is a book that you can read in a very short period of time and not have to think about too much. It is all spelled out for you. IT was ok. That is the most credit I will give it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm glad I waited for the paperback","review":"I give the author credit for coming up with an interesting premise -- the relationship between three 30-something upper middle class Black males and their day-to-day struggles. I even liked how the lead character left a cushy job at a big company to pursue entrepreneurship. But the lapses in the storyline and the numerous grammatical errors are distracting. And even though most of the affluent Black folks I know do NOT carry on the way these characters did in this book, I think I know what he was trying to do. It seems like he was trying to present an image of successful people who remained down-to-earth. Still, this book fell far short of my expectations and all of the hype. The elements of good fiction are a compelling story, multifaceted characters, and prose that flows. This book didn't have any of that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of Weak","review":"This wasn't the worst book I've read, but it was far from the best. Considering the author was a man writting about male characters, I was expecting more of a \\"males point of view\\" and not the typical stuff we always hear, I was very disappointed. The characters and over all story line was weak, predicatable and almost boring. I kept waiting for something exciting to happen, but it never did. Also, Mr. Baisden needs to find a new editor, there's no excuse for the typo's in this book. Better luck next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"one word WONDERFUL","review":"I HAVE READ MANY BOOKS BEFOR BUT NONE AS GOOD AS THIS ONE.I FIND MYSELF ASKING FOR MY BOOK BACK AS SOON AS I LET SOMEONE READ IT.MICHAEL THE BOOK WAS SO LIFE LIKE I COULD SEE MY SELF MOVE WITH EVER MOVE THAT WAS MADE.PLEASE KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK AND GIVE ALL MEN AND WOMAN THE CHALLENGE TO PICK UP A GOOD BOOK AND READ.I HAVE LET 4 PEOPLE READ IT AND I TELL EVERBADY ABOUT IT ON THE INTERNET.THE INTELLIGENT THAT WENT IN TO IT SHOULD BE TOLD TO ALL.IF U HAVEN'T READ IT READ IT IF U DID READ IT AGAIN...THANXS NOW WE KNOW."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!

I belong to \\"Open Gates\\", a book club that just celebrated it's 10th year anniversary. We meet at the Cumberland County Public Library in Fayetteville, N.C. \\"Men Cry..\\" was our selection for the month of March, 1999. I do not wish to be overly critical; I applaud the brother for expressing a point of view that may not often get expressed. However, I did think most of the characters were trivial, with facades of success, without much substance. However, I did read it. Other members of our group had very strong, negative reactions. I suppose it was a natural sequel to \\"Never Satisfied\\", which I also read. Since I have little time to read, I would rather, however, spend my time reading books that have more substance. I'm sure there is an audience for Mr. Baisden's work, and I wish him every success."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage!","review":"Someone please tell me what the purpose of this book was? I have never read so many cliche in all my life! For those of you who have the book...go thought it again and just see how many references he makes to movies and TV shows: \\"It was a scene right out of.....It was just like.....It was a scene just like...\\" I though author were suppose to be creative! Whats up with all those ridiculous high fives? Every other page someone is slapping five....it a wonder anyone has any skin left on there hands. Why was angela in the wedding when she only met the other \\"charaters\\" once?! This book way tiresome, made too many refernces to name brands and a simple waste of time. In fact the book was just plain simple. Nice try Mike....but no cigar"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Book About Fashion","review":"This could have been a really good book. I felt like the characters were not developed enough and too much talk about the flashy expensive clothes and cars. I still have no clue as to what the title has to do with anything. And I really hate to mention all the typos! I'm really not a critic, but this one was not very good at all!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Two stars for effort","review":"Sorry I bought the book in hardcover. I wish I had just checked it out of the library. While the author's efforts at presenting the male side were good the book itself wasn't. The changes in point of view were confusing and his lack of research made the book far less credible. The author should consult others if he is not sure. No one does a roundhouse kick to the groin. That is not possible. Additionally people don't go to undergrad and major in law (it is pre-law) and then decide not to go to grad school to get their law degree. Law is a professional degree. Also, Angela's credibility was shot when she told Michael, I mean Derrick, that she bought this outfit for him. Everything else she did contradicted that. Not to mention the book was full of typos, unnecessary changes in point of view, grammatical errors, and misinformation. Mr. Baisden should take a creative writing course before he writes another novel and hire an editor before he prints more copies of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial","review":"The members of my book club selected this book in my absence. It was only available in hardback at my bookstore. What a waste of money! I was not enamored with Waiting to Exhale, therefore, this male version was not my idea of a thoughtful, complex read. Yes, it was entertaining but shallow. The characters were engrossed ad nauseum with materialism (luxury cars, fancy clothes, supposedly fine wines and chic restaurants--white zinfandel and Bennigan's--give me a break!)as well as their physical endowments. Emphasis upon these superficial aspects overshadowed the central themes of the story and as a result the characters were one-dimensional. In a word, the author's efforts are sophomoric."},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel that the book gave a negative image of black women.","review":"This book made it seems as though Black women are still behind in many ways. My biggest gripe is due to the fact that if you did not have a degree you were seen as ignorant in the eyes of these men. Then you have \\"Brothas\\" discrimantaing on \\"Sistahs\\" because of something in the past. That is ridiculous. Some of the things that the character that dated the white girl let slide tripped me out. Black men know that they won't let a black women get away with these types of things, but it is alright for them to be done by a white woman. Also when they were in the Drug dealers house and they saw the room that contained the drugs don't you know that they would not have made it out of there. The book was a little too fake for me and I didn't like it at all and don't recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"too stereo-typical with no plot","review":"After much anticipation I was thoroughly let down by this book. Michael Baisden came on KJLH pumping up this book like it was all that. None of the characters were interesting, neither were they believable. I only finished reading the book because I payed $22 for it. The only likeable character in the book was Angela, she was actually real and had it together. I hope that there is no sequel. The book was total fantasy. At Toni and Tracy's wedding, why did Tony pick everyone who was in the wedding? Tracy had no relationship with the women in the wedding. Usually the bride chooses her very best friends. Baisden tried to incorporate every black stereotype he could think of in this book to the point of overkill. The book read like a very badly written soap-opera. I would never recommend this book or the author to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put the book down","review":"My husband really bought it....he was talking too long to read it.

I really loved \\"The Maintenance Man\\" and had really high expectations for this book. This book started off on the boring side and didn't heat up until the last 100 pages but right when it was getting to the climax the book ended.... What the hell happened to Geno and why such a blunt ending? I have so many unanswered questions. Micheal has really turned me off with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Relationships","review":"A truthful look at how men feel about women and how women act toward men.

Great read!!!","review":"I cannot wait to get my hand on more of Michael's books. Men Cry in the Dark was the first of his books I had ever read and I was not sure what to expect. Boy was I in for a surprise. It was GREAT and if anyone disagrees they need to read it again. His four main characters are very real and ladies...if you want to learn a bit about the brothers, especially those you want to get involved with, read this book so Michael can school you on the various \\"brother\\" personalities out there.

No one liked it. It was full of cliche and name/designer dropping. There were also a number of grammatical errors.

First, there were so many errors in the book (grammatical, spelling, etc...) that I almost gave up reading it. It's bad enough not having an interesting story (which this book did not have) but it's even worse when the writing is horrible. After I finally attempted to get past the numerous errors, I found that this book just did not have much substance. The characters seemed superficial and one-dimensional and I just could not get into this book. I know that Michael Baisden has another book out (\\"Maintenance Man\\") but the bookstore would have to take EVERY book off the shelf besides that one in order for me to try another book by this man. Do not waste your money on this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"\\"Men Cry in the Dark\\" is preachy, sermonizing and cliche-ridden.

Aside from very poor story development, I was appalled at the many, major errors (first person, grammar, etc). Baisden said this book is self-published. Every author I've known who self-published was very sure to utilize a professional proofreader/editor prior to sending the manuscript to press. By not doing so, Baisden has demonstrated to me that he is lazy, greedy, insincere, and disrespectful to his readers by publishing a faulty product.Also, the author needs to do his homework and research the subject(s) he is trying to write about. It is very obvious that he is writing from his imagination about affluence. Baisden has a credibility problem and I would never call him a real \\"writer.\\"I guess I heard to much publicity about his book. Then I read it.

Will not recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Book!","review":"I'm typically pretty patient with slow reads or books that tend to take a while before the story gets good. With this novel, it was like watching paint dry. The premise to the story is completely ridiculous: men who treat women as objects find that the tables can actually be turned on them. The dialogue between the men discussing their latest catches was corny and non-believable, and I found myself skimming through the monologues of each character because the author tried to hard to have the reader \\"get to know\\" each character, when in actuality, I felt like each annoying detail was getting harder to read. Stupid storyline and no real depth in the characters or story."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE AND UNINTERESTING","review":"This book was no good at all to me.

If this was a first draft I would say, it was a good start, but since it's a final draft I'll say bad finish. I wasn't exactly lost, but I didn't feel the characters were well developed, nor did I care what happened next in their lives. I didn't understand the meaning of the title. Men Cry in the Dark? O.K., and? Women Cry in the Light. What's the difference? This book had some really good scenes in it...no doubt. But the book as a whole needed some work.

The story remains around the arrogant character Derrick whom has a profile like Michael Basiden...that didn't take much imagination. Basiden never really develops the other characters like Mark and Ben and when did these men really cry? Please let me not forget the most unromantic oral sex scene I've ever heard of...Basiden must not have an appreciation for true oral love...only someone who didn't know what they were doing would wash it. Last who would dare compare Basiden to Terry McMillan...Terry is a storyteller...Basiden is just out to make some money off his Playa experience.

After a while I took out a red pen and began circling all of the errors. Not only was it a distraction to find that many mistakes, but the content of the story line begain to lack as well. The dialect selected for the conversations between characters was out dated and should have been revisited. Over all the book gave good examples of the different kinds of relationships that we often have to endure but the numerous errors were far too distracting while reading the book and unexceptable for a second book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe your old job in Chicago will re-hire you, Mike!","review":"We all read this novel for our women's bookclub. By the time we met for a critique, we were divided three ways: the few who liked the book, others who were angered and insulted, the rest were like me -- laughing so hard at the author's incompetence.We took turns finding inconsistencies, mispellings, racist remarks, bad syntax, missing punctuations. We were on the floor laughing by the time we realized that all this novel achieved was free advertising to all the brand names which were mentioned as a front to cover the author's ignorance on the subject of the lifestyles of the rich and famous.Even though I am not crazy about anything Terri McMillan writes, it is obvious she didn't play hooky from English class, like Baisden apparently did.Men Cry in the Dark? Well, Baisden, we women cried from laughter at your arrogance which was only superceded by your incompetence expressed in print for the world to see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected more....was disappointed.","review":"Book dwelled too much on description of skin color, cars, clothing, etc. Should have worked harder on developing the characters.

Maybe its just me, but I don't know too many young \\"Blacks\\" that have so much going for them at such a young age. Also, why did we need to know about Angela putting on her \\" rolex watch, diamond necklace, and boucheron perfum? Why all the put down on fat people and \\"brothers that were unattractive\\"?

Michael Baisden, himself, gave me a copy of \\"Men Cry in the Dark\\" as well as two of his other books after meeting me at a workshop in L.A. His attempt to impress me fell far short of my expectations. The problem with Michael is that he really thinks he's a good writer but he just doesn't have a clue. Suffice it to say I got through 10 minutes of the book and I couldn't bare it anymore... Uninteresting characters, a boring plot, trite sterotypes, and glaring grammatical errors. I could go on and on. Aside from the fact that he's a dreadful writer, anyone that knows Michael also knows that he is extremely cocky as well as very sexist. For someone with such subpar talent to be so arrogant really puts the nail in the coffin for me. Save your time and your money and read the work of some real literary geniuses like E. Lynn Harris or Eric Jerome Dickey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made Me Cry","review":"I was extremely disappointed in this book. Throughout the book there was no draw to either the story or the characters. The author's attempt at sounding genuine and \\"real\\" was feeble. The events seemed forced and the characters where not believable. Not a single character in the book has the depth required to keep the reader interested. The author spends most of his time trying to impress the reader with needless and poorly placed details about his characters relating to the places they have been, the radio stations they listen to, the cologne they wear and the cars they drive. I may have passed the book over as simply having been poorly edited until I got to the section where one of the main characters starts praising another book the author has written. The book was one cliché after another. I was offended that the author felt he was \\"telling it like it is\\" for the Black community of America."},{"rating":"1","title":"Men Cry in the Dark","review":"The title of the book and the picture caught my attention, but that was the only thing that held my interest.

The gage fits fine, though you will need pliers to tighten it enough to stop leaks. The drain valve is a handy feature, but the clear fuel line will harden after the first use, making it aggravating to use. The schrader valve connection has a rubber gasket inside that will deteriorate after a couple uses, causing the connection to leak and make the gage useless. This is a proprietary rubber seal, and local auto parts will not carry parts for these cheap gages. I have tried an o ring without success.

Roy recorded many more songs for MGM than he did for Monument, and Rhino did an excellent job of sorting through them to bring us the cream, in wonderful sound and with loving annotation. It must be said that this does not equal the brilliance of his Monument period, but, taken in it's own right, is a wonderful collection of music, showcasing arguably the greatest rock vocalist of all time. A 5 star winner. Thanks again, Rhino!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll wonder why Roy's music wasn't more popular.","review":"This album highlights music by the Big O that will make you wonder: why haven't I heard any of these songs before? You would think that with such beautiful songs as \\"Here Comes the Rain, Baby\\" and \\"She\\" that they would be American classics, but that's the mystery of Roy Orbison... why haven't we heard more from him and more about him? This album is terrific. The only short-coming is \\"Twinkle Toes\\" (dumb song)."},{"rating":"2","title":"It feels so good.","review":"This CD collects the \\"best\\" of Roy Orbison's recordings for MGM Records. These songs were not as successful as his Monument Records songs, and have been virtually forgotten nowadays. But they are still mostly of a high caliber. The first seven songs on the CD comprise his seven chart singles for MGM, in order of release. The rest of the CD features album tracks and non-charting singles. Orbison fans who want to discover his \\"lost\\" years should get this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classic Orbison...NOT!","review":"All I can say is...there is a REASON Roy's MGM material never stays in print for any length of time. It makes his Sun output look stellar! This is a classic case of an amazing artist who made it big with a small label and then got lured away by a big label with more cash and the promise of a movie. And in the process lost his artistic bearings and soul. Very few of these songs even scraped into the Top 40 and for good reason: They are lame and a shocking mockery of what he had done at Monument. Roy lost his ability to write or pick songs, his movie was a stinker, personal tragedy after personal tragedy struck and it was a fast nose-dive from the top of the pop world to doing oldies package tours. All these songs just seem to have a \\"I am phoning this in and doing it for the money\\" feel to them. This is far from classic material and I can only recommend this for hardcore Orbison fans or the curious."},{"rating":"2","title":"saladgirl","review":"All of Patsy Clines' best.

The same cannot be said for the seat bottoms. They bunch up and just don't seem to fit, and when you shift around or turn to step out of a tall 4x4, the whole seat bottom cover turns with you because the vinyl is very tacky. Another problem is that these covers are not breathable at all. The center console cover does not stay in place very well, and prevents the cover from latching. On the positive side, the color matches very well to Ford light grey, and the stiching detail looks like factory original to me, though I haven't looked at Ford's leather seats to compare."},{"rating":"2","title":"This adapter works well for me","review":"I bought two M-202s to upgrade my old 802.11b WEP adapters to 802.11g with WAP.

The adapter worked once I downloaded and installed the hotfix. On my first installation, only the administrator could access the adapter. Other users could not access the wireless connection. Then I decided to uninstall the software included in the installation CD and let Windows XP manage the adapter using only the driver included in the installation CD. Everything worked well after these minor setbacks. I have two M-202 working seamlessly with an old Lynksys WRT54G router. Connectivity is good in all areas of my house.

It was Rinaldi who \\"got me hooked\\" on historical fiction book, so when I'm at a loss for book to read, I always turn back to her. She usually writes historical fictions about better-known historical occurrences (Salem Witch Trials and The Civil War, for example), and she usually has strong heroes and heroines as her protagonists who overcome their troubles. With this book, neither is the case. Unless you're familiar with Fletcher Christian (who I don't think is even in the history textbooks anymore, at least that I've experienced, and I only know about him through the movie \\"The Bounty\\"), or if you want to read about a weaker protagonist who hardly stands up for herself, this book may come as a slight shock to you, seeing as it is an Ann Rinaldi book.

Quo Vadis is not one of those books. Some translations are terrible and flat, while others ring true with the lucidity of brilliant writing. The W.S. Kuniczak edition is probably the finest rendition currently available in English. However, if one is looking for a biblical work of fiction that truly inspires in English- try Ben-Hur, by Lew Wallace."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Absolute Best Book Ever!!!","review":"This book is without question the greatest of the classics that I have ever read. Involving suspense, romance, death, and survival; it will lead you through one of greatest adventures of your life. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reads like a romance novel","review":"This book reads a bit like a trashy romance novel. That is to say, it is a very easy read, the vocabulary is relatively simple, and the story gets you hooked from chapter to chapter. Not to mention it kind of _is_ a trashy romance novel. But on the other hand it does give one a nice picture of the first Christians and Rome in Nero's time. The characterization of Nero is especially funny. Not to mention it has a nice/happy ending so you feel all warm and fuzzy at the end in spite of all the nasty things that happen in between. (Hope that was not too much of a spoiler) All in all, an entertaining read, but don't expect big revelations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative and well-illustrated.","review":"This book offers great insights into the structure, function and proper care of the equine foot.

COMPLETE GARBAGE!","review":"One of the stupidest horror films I have ever seen. The plot is so contrived and the setting so unbelievable that you can not even begin to care what happens in this ridiculous and far inferior retread of 'Texas Chain Saw Massacre'.After a cop puts a bullet in a sicko's head, the maniac escapes only to show up 4 years later when the cop who shot him is in charge of a program for community service candidates who have to clean an old hotel so the homeless can live there(how nice). The only problem is it's infested with roaches, rats and god knows what else. This place would have to be completely fumigated before anyone would be allowed to even step in it! The goofballs sleep, bathe, eat and have sex in this disgusting place before .....Guess who comes a knockin' The Freakin' Maniac who was shot by the cop! DUH..DUH..DUH...DUH....DUUUHHH! You get the picture? For pure masochist only!"},{"rating":"1","title":"See no scary","review":"I'm really getting bored of these movies where a bunch of 20 something losers get stuck in a creepy mansion and get hunted down. But wait! There's a twist ending! A twist that you pretty much figure out at the beginning of the movie. The killer guy, Cane, is not scary. You see him pull out someone's eyes. Ok. After the 10th time, it's not even creepy anymore. Why was he saving them anyway? And I couldn't care less about the people he's killing. A bunch of Abercrombie and Fitch models who I'm supposed to believe are criminals.Why don't they make a movie about Barbara Bush? Now that would be scary"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definately blood and guts","review":"Ok, I thought that this movie was very original with the \\"work group\\" coming to a hotel and cleaning it up. There is one thing that they didn't realize is that they are the \\"food\\" for the hotel and the residents that live there. I thought the story was imaginative and did have it's scarey parts. Yes, it is very much a \\"slasher, blood and guts\\" movie. I highly recommend this movie to anyone that loves slasher flicks with an imaginative story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly awful","review":"This is a wonderful and amazing movie full of wit and humor as long as you want to see a movie with a dog urinating into an empty eye socket. In fact, I respect the filmmakers that much more for not caving into some sort of pressure to use gore for the sake of gore in their dog urinating into the empty eye socket scene. The dog urinating in the empty eye socket is tastefully rendered and one of the best scenes of a dog urinating in an empty eye socket ever (excluding that dog urinating in the empty eye socket scene from The Breakfast Club which also has its fans.) For years, horror afficiendos have been clamoring for the quintessential scene of a dog urinating in an empty eye socket and now they have it.Unfortunately the rest of the movie does not live up to the high standards set by the dog urinating in the empty eye socket and you have to wait an awfully long time for that dog to urinate in the empty eye socket."},{"rating":"1","title":"And the Winner IS.....","review":"Ladies and Gentlemen, you're looking at the winner of the 2007 Golden Raspberry Awards (aka Razzies) even this early on, I doubt that there's gonna be any movie more awful and stupid coming out this year to even compete with this one.

Are you people serious? Not to sound like a snob here, but hot damn! This movie takes everything that is good about movies and throws them out the window, after first defecating on them. A bunch of models get killed in a non-scary way by some big guy who wrestles men for a living, and is also non-scary. Calling this movie shallow would be an insult to shallow people and shallow pools everywhere. Also, I'm pretty sure this movie was about 13 minutes long, and almost every line spoken by the \\"hot\\" blonde chick was a lame cliche. I did like it when her cell phone was literally shoved down her throat, though. spoiler alert! Titanic was a scarier movie than this poopy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cockroach Sex??

They are rude crude hardboiled, stab you in the back type personalities. The first few minutes of this trash begins with a very promising scene and realy grabs your attention, but that was only the first few minutes, after that, push the Stop Button and seek elswhere for a better movie becaue they dont get as bad as this one....OH, I frogot if your paying attention, there is abrief scene of to large Cockroaches having Sexual Intercourse...Palllleeezz No!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unable to watch because of Region Difference","review":"Why wasn't this DVD listed as being unavailable to watch in Australia?

The cop loses one of his hands.4 years later, the cop is now a guard of a juvie detention center. 8 teens are taken to a condemned hotel. In exchange of a reduced sentence, the teens must clean up the hotel to have it presentable when it becomes a shelter.Like the 10 little Indians, the teens start dying one by one. Killing them is Jacob Goodnight, the same killer that the cop thought he had killed 4 years earlier.Overall, simple and predictable and spiced with gore.

Very unique, intriguing scent---unlike any other cologne I've come across.My only complaint is that on me, the scent doesn't seem to last all that long. The lady at the department store where I bought this was shocked to hear that, but said that colognes react differently to each person's skin chemistry, and suggested that I try \\"layering\\" it with the matching deodorant and soap.

The sound quality is not great, but the tone and mix seem to capture my idea of a good military-sounding band just right. No fancy kitchen piping, just a lot of good old standards mixed with some light newer stuff. Pipe Major G.S.

Don't Worry This Compilation is Nothing Like It!","review":"If you are anything like myself, and feel like slicing your wrist after listening to more than two songs in a row on any Morcheeba album then take this compilation for a spin. I stayed away from it for years after its release for two reasons. It had Morcheeba on the front cover, and the Back to Mine Series is very unpredictable. Their albums are usually a stong hit or miss for my electronica tastes and the artist(s) featured in the mix has no correlation to whether I end up liking a particular Back to Mine or not. Definitely keeps you guessing.Anyhow, I picked up a copy of this album and quickly placed it in the hit pile for Back to Mine compilations. A great set of eclectic tracks that gel very well together. Full of cool tracks that make me groove verus suicidal!4/5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is really good","review":"love this cd by morcheeba. the people who gave it bad reviews should clean their ears out and get their narrow minded heads out of their own anus. by the way the annette peackock song hated by one of the clowns who reviewed this is very cool. the two best and most diverse cd's in the back to mine series, this one and the new order one are the ones that always get bashed by the ignorant amazon reviewers. i say, ignore the rest of the series and pick up the aforementioned two."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a rip-off!","review":"The CD is clearly labeled with Morcheeba as the artist.

If you buy it expecting to hearmore tracks like what you'd find on their own albums,you will be sorely disappointed. This is a collectionof various styles of music, mostly blues-inspired piecesand soft rap and hip/trip hop tracks... most of whichI found more irritating that anything else -- not at allwhat I would consider sitting back and \\"chilling\\" to.The one track by Morcheeba themselves isn't bad,but the majority of the other tracks just drag thisalbum down. If you really want to hear this album,I suggest waiting until it surfaces in the Used bins.Shouldn't take long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Back to the supermarket","review":"A terrible, terrible waste of money. All this CD serves in doing is to illustrate what a knuckle-head Paul Godfrey is. Face it: no one gives a sh@t about Morcheeba anymore, we're not interested in who 'inspired' them, (poor Annette Peacock - has anyone told her?).

Based around memorable riffs, crunchy distortion guitar, the band also use the infamous Casio to great effect, most noticable on \\"Portamento\\" and \\"Spray Water...\\" The album is a great mix of studio perfection and the classic lo-fi sound that defined them earlier in their career.

She is learning how to grab and move things, but she is still not very good at it.

She only has to get the toys close for them to stick together, and she is delighted by that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but useless","review":"I've had these stackers since my son was about a month old - I saw them and fell in love with them and figured maybe he would too. He's 9 months now. I've tried him with them several times throughout his life.They're cute, but they're just hard, awkwardly shaped bits of plastic. They're awkward for him to hold, and there's not much for him to do with them. He'll chew on them for a few minutes but then toss them aside.They rattle, but you have to shake pretty hard to hear the rattle.

The magnets are not strong enough in my set to hold all 6 together when they are picked up. They are just the right size for small hands and they fit quite nicely in the mouth too! They are reasonably quiet too and so will be good for a plane trip during the day. The noise is only that of a small bead rattling inside each bug. The magnets are helping my 10 month old little guy to realise that things can be stacked so I guess they have some educational value although not much. He is quite enjoying them and so I am happy to recommend them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great printer but unreliable","review":"I bought this printer after my HP 2100TN started needing us to press the button on the printer every time we queued a print job. At first the 3052 seemed the answer to our needs. It was very easy to set up for our home office and kids machines. It printed and copied fast and sharp. That lasted for about 100 pages and then it started producing a huge white area down the middle of the page. Removing and shaking the cartridge would fix this for a a few pages and then that stopped working. Faced with a long and frustrating time on the phone with support I decided to just get a new cartridge. This did the trick for about 200 pages and then it started missing the whole center section of the page again. Shaking the cartridge fixes it temporarily. Of course, it always does it when we are in a panic with a customer proposal or homework due that day. I am using genuine HP cartridges which are $55 each. My advice is to look at the competition. Great idea but it doesn't print!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It is a fine product","review":"I needed a printer that can do fax and make copy in the office, so I picked this one in a rush thinking All-in-One should have all functions.

The texture is slightly more watery than lotion. You apply to skin with cotton and remove all the make-up, rub and rinse. It does a fantastic job of removing eye make up. The smell is very clean and gentle. Your face will feel soft. It is not oily like other make-up removers, though in my personal opinion it doesn't quite get the make-up off as quickly as with something like Bifacil by Lancome. It's quite a nice product, though and can be effective.If you are looking for something that will both clean and remove make-up at the same time, this is not your product. However, if you're like me and always will be removing the make-up first and then rewashing, this is worth a try. Moreover, if you're tired of oily make-up removers or can't find something that doesn't sting your eyes, I would also put this on the list. I was actually happily surprised by how gentle on the eyes this product is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written for the sole purpose of making you buy the next book","review":"Nothing makes me more angry than a book that is written with the sole object to make you buy the next book.

The thing is that the website is ....... one page with one paragraph text saying to email them the question. THAT'S IT!! So I emailed them few days ago and until now ..... no reply at all. If Im buing a book, I expect it to teach me things.

It is written by a couple geeks with clearly no inclination or talent for teaching who manage to express even the simplest concept in complicated ways. That maybe could be forgiven, but they also do not seem to have a really deep understanding of the subject. For all but the most general notions and , especially important, for all the configuration , intallation and deployment nuisances you are left on your own.

Although they were simple to put together, five months later, all four of them have fallen apart. The welds have broken apart, leaving the stools useless. The backs of each stool have also fallen off at the welds. I recommend you stay away from these bar stools, and spend your money elsewhere on a better set. For the $130 I spent to have four stools delivered including shipping; it has been the worst investment I've made in a long time.

However, within less than a year, the legs got bent out of shape (probably because we often leaned against the chairs as opposed to sitting directly on them) and the chairs became unstable.

She is discouvered by Yuki and Shigure, members of the Sohma family who invite her to live with them in their house. She soon discouvers that there is a curse on them though, which makes them turn into an animal of the zodiac if they are 'huggled' by a member of the opposite sex. This causes many adventures as Tohru slowly begins to meet more members of the Sohma family, and as she tries to understand them and their emotional anxiety and pains as she tries to make everyone happy.This is truly an exceptional story which is bound to make you cry at some point. This first dvd contains the first 6 episodes of the series (of a total of 26 episodes), and so it should be worth buying!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series, DVD was a little confusing though","review":"I'm a subtitle-only viewer, and at first I thought that I had discovered one of the worst subtitle jobs I'd ever seen for an anime. I typcially don't use the menus on the DVD to set up language & subtitles - the DVD player I have allows me to set those up direct from the remote. There are 2 sets of english subtitles...something I'd never seen before on an anime DVD. Be sure to pick the second set if you are a subtitle-only fan. The first set seems to drop a lot of subtlties, and there are no translations for the occasional Kanji or Hirigana."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disappointed","review":"It is soo not fair that this does not have a second season! Although if it has a second season it would somewhat ruin the story. I think that if they were going to do an anime on the manga they should have at least done the whole thing, not stop right in the middle of the series. I mean, come on.And hey! who does Tohru even go with, ending up with no one? Kyo or Yuki? The rat or the cat? This is really not fair. I am really disappointed that they only made the anime up till the eigth volume.Some reviews say that they dont like tohru because of her personality. Without her goody-goody, naive personality, how can the sohma family get through their sorrow and pains? It is not like anyone else can do so. Although, Akito is not an actual evil person (if you can count abusing Yuki as evil)almost all the characters have a complex personality.

This is due in part to the unique nature of the Greek Islands, which are a very diverse and complex collection of locations, cultures, landscapes, and even climates. There are significant logistical concerns because getting to some of these islands can be tricky. And there's also the fact that, while some places cater to package tourists and are overrun with people during certain times of the year, others are far more remote and peaceful. Sadly, this book fails to capture any of these important themes, much less convey them in the kind of detail necessary to make a useful travel Guide. People headed for the Greek Islands should do some more research and find a better guide than this one. Your efforts will pay off in the form of a very enjoyable trip if you bring the right tools with you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works for the equipment we have.","review":"We have a lot of Equipment that are 24 volt systems and this just what we needed to service them.

It is a fine, stately novel, written with a grace and intelligence that makes it read more like an English family saga than an American one. Not surprising, considering that author Elsie Burch Donald is a transplanted southerner living in England and France.There's something satisfyingly old fashioned about this book, which is refreshing in this day of the overheated Southern family saga. Characters are developed with care into surprising people, and while the plot covers a lot of ground it does so at the right pace. Donald has caught the rhythms of the long hot afternoons, the family expectations, and the maneuvering to keep up with a changing world.There are plenty of unexpected turns in \\"Nashborough\\" and the novel will keep you engaged from start to finish. Take this book and find a good hammock.

As a band, they're tight, and they were in great form on 12/31/05. Joe makes his Stratocasters sing with seemingly no effort at all. Bnois King counterpoints beautifully with his jazzy style and raspy-velvet vocals.

Just a wonderful ensemble and hilarious writing.But this episode was atrocious. The writing by rote and the actors barely present outside of being stereotypes of themselves.Did they fire all their writers??? There is no excuse for this garbage.It's the final season and if this is any indication they're just totally over it and just waiting for the show to end. Which is a shame. I guess everyone's more interested in their next projects, I suppose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfying Conclusion","review":"All in all this was a pretty good ending to this series which lasted for seven seasons. I think it was a good time for this show to close at this point. The story had gone as long as it could and the emphasis should shift to a younger generation of fire fighters to whom these guys pass the torch.Denis Leary closes out especially well. His character attains a certain degree of maturity and makes better decisions about where to take his life next. The other guys fall in line as well. Miracle of miracles, the wife and girlfriend don't bother me either, which previously has always been the weakest part of the show for me.There is a certain amount of humor in this closing out as well. The substitution of cake mix for ashes is especially a winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love","review":"Really wish Rescue Me was still on TV, but at least you can buy the Seasons to watch over and over"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Finale Unfolding","review":"I still like the wife and girlfriend the least but I am enjoying seeing the other firemen and Tommy come to the end of the trail. The dynamic among the men is very good and in this episode you see how much they truly love fires--really, more than anything. Tommy also connects with a woman from his past who now has cancer. The two of them tend to bring out the best in one another, unlike the other women in combination with Tommy. Of course, this woman is more intelligent than both the wife and girlfriend put together so that helps. Leary as Tommy actually did a fair amount of comedy in this episode which I was glad to see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ringo is God","review":"Ringo Starr is a bless.

My favourite number is the beautiful Oh My Lord. You can feel the emotion in his voice. This song is a sincere tribute, a homage, a truly gift to George Harrison. Buy this cd rigth now.

A very sobering and rational surveying of what was known about the actual Bavarian organisation Illuminati, and what accusations and rumours thereafter surfaced regarding the Illuminati.

This book seems too old to note that modern occult societies OTO and AMORC have grades/levels that use the word \\"Illuminati\\" in their titles, and the \\"IOT\\" uses \\"Illuminates\\" in their name.

Miserable direction; you can tell a bad director when every line out of everyone's mouth feels forced. This felt at nearly all times like a bad tv movie-of-the-week. I like Statham but he's wasted here and clearly needs a director with a better feel for realism. Snipes is ok and Phillippe is too, but his role is overwritten and just seems fake. I didn't buy one second of this movie.Sure, there's a twist at the end, but when nothing that came before makes you care about the tale or the players, what's the difference?

Once the new firmware is upgraded, the player is virtually problem free. The only fault of this product is Philips obviously does not know how to market this product very well. It is unheard of by many and not in many stores. It would have been new to have come with a belt-case like that of the IPOD instead of a bag. I would have also liked to have some type of song rating built into the player. The menu animation affects are unneeded. If I wanted just a player, the IPOD would have been slightly better (I want the wheel), but if you want to record also, this is the way to go.

The iPod costs the same and has the same capacity, yet has a far greater range of features.

For syncing with a PC the iPod comes with Apple's incredibly popular iTunes jukebox software that works on both Macintoshes and Windows computers. The iPod also comes standard with a cradle that the iPod rests in rather than a cable that will clutter your workspace. On the iPod itself there is a scroll wheel which may ease navigation, of which itself and the control buttons contain no moving parts.

However, the clip doesn't always stay on. Chairs and other items can snag the holster and pull it off your belt. Hopefully, you notice when this happens. The other downside is that the clip slowly wears down your belt, but only in the spot where it is clipped. When mine wore out, I replaced it with a holster that has a belt loop.

One person lifts up the TV, the other one slips the unit under it in just the right spot.Anyway, I've had the turntable for a day or so and it seems okay now. I recommend buying the swivel only if you have some patience with this kind of thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"Works great.

Some of the melodies are OK and some of the lyrics are OK, but overall it has very little energy or inspiration. The band seems to be very unsure of itself and has no confidence in its sound. It tries to copy other bands like Wilco or Uncle Tupelo, but comes off as much lesser versions. There doesn't seem to be any original thoughts here, no fresh ideas, no creative energy. And only one of the singers has a decent voice. The others have no business singing on any recordings.

The audible controls are a little confusing at first. There are many different modes you can play in, including mascot mode, where your whole team is made up of school mascots. I think, overall, it is better than Fever 2002. I haven't played Fever 2003 or Madden 2003 yet, but if you like college football, you should get this. I would recommend renting the game first if you can because Madden and Fever 2003 might be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great, but...","review":"Well, I was of the same opinion as the other reviewers, but I ran into a severe problem with the game after three days of play. After I had finished playing a game I received the XBox black screen of death indicating that my disc was damaged or dirty. I of course took the steps recommended on the XBox website (cleaning the disk, powering off/on), yet I still received the same error when I tried to access my saved season. I exchanged the game for a new copy and I still got the error when trying to access my season profile, so I finally called the 800 XBox number. They said that I had to delete my entire NCAA data block in order to correct the problem since apparently the game \\"choked\\" during the save process and made the file errant. The 800 number explained that they have received numerous complaints exactly like mine for the game SPECIFICALLY, so unless you like having ALL of your saved data deleted I'd wait for the Sega NCAA (hopefully it's better!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a superb game.","review":"EA Sports has done all of us with fond memories of going to Saturday tailgates a great favor with the release of this game. My alma mater's stadium, fight song, uniforms, and all aspects of game play are present with exquisite precision. It really evokes nostalgia for the whole college football experience, both in terms of being at the stadium and watching the game on TV. I really enjoy watching your team's ranking go up in the polls as you win each successive game. Graphics and sound are great--they even have Lee Corso and Kirk Herbstreit (where's Chris Fowler, guys?) announcing the games that would be televised on ESPN or ABC. All in all, an excellent, excellent addition to your XBOX collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"NCAA 2003 Joey Harrington Cover","review":"This game is actually going to be in a collection of Joey Harrington merchandise of my boyfriends.

In reading each of the books, I realized that \\"Good Owners, Great Cats,\\" almost always had the best, most common-sense advice written in a very \\"no holds barred\\" way. Kilcommons doesn't mince words and he's very opinionated, but his opinions seem to be right on the mark. I've only owned dogs in the past, and without reading this book I think that I would be clueless in how to train/discipline a cat. In the few short weeks that I've had the cat and the book (which I've purchased) I've used its hints and advice innumerable times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great insight into the feline mind and behavior!","review":"I read this book a couple years ago, but the lessons and insights into how a cat thinks and how that effects behavior were invaluable and unforgettable!

The covers, the design, and the engaging stories, take the reader back to a time when crimes were solved by guts, brains, brawn, and the occasional beauty mixed in just for inspiration. I can't wait until the end of the day to escape into the shadows these writers imagined so well in these stories.Richard Powells \\"Say it with Bullets\\" is not only gripping, and entertaining, but the author has a sense of humor that just doesn't quit.

In this collection of short works (poems, essays and stories) he weaves an intriguing pattern of philosophy, conviction and experience that resonates within me. I was inspired by much of his poetry (e.g. \\"The Mirror\\" on p. 91 is particularly haunting and speaks of a profound experience of the Absolute), but the part of the book I found most interesting was part III, a more freehand set of writings on many different topics that really spoke to me. His collection of aphorisms at the end are penetrating to anyone paying attention. I find myself wondering more about this person and his life. Who is he? Why are these topics important to him? How does he know?I recommend you check out this book, and let Richard Rose speak to you of what he knows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring poetry","review":"This is spiritual poetry.

MacLeod contorts the English language, in attempts to be witty, or perhaps iconoclastic, which invariably fall flat on their faces. His usage of alliteration is ludicrious. His style remains pretensious throughout, and most of the time unbearably so. In short, Cosmonaut Keep is a Herculean effort, in which MacLeod assures that the audience is always conscious of his effort.MacLeod does do some things very well: his imagination is vivid, and his ability to describe the world that he has created is wonderful. His balance of narrative and dialogue is excellent, but his characters never have anything to say. The storylines that he creates are interesting, but the linkage comes too late to save the drowning plot.If, as the cover proclaims, MacLeod represents a SF revolution unto himself, the genre is dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disjointed","review":"MacLeod has a good story to tell in Cosmonaut Keep, unfortunately his writing style lacks a lot to be desired. This novel is full of speculative ideas from politics, intrigue, physics, and the nature of the universe, wrapped into what could have been a good story about real people. The writing is disjointed, almost hackneyed. Most of the novel is parallel threads, one set on 21st century earth, and the other a colonized planet at some point in the future. The back and forth between threads is not handled with particular aplomb, so it takes a while to get &#65533;into&#65533; the story and feel comfortable going and back and forth. And while the two threads come together at the end, the denouement is less than satisfying.Overall the general concept of the story is intriguing. There is a lot to be desired in the execution."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm losing traction on this one","review":"I'm feeling defeated by a combination of factors: the story is a bit confusing early on and the kindle edition uses a non-standard font that is way too heavy for my taste.

Many times before triumphantly turning the final page I felt as though I had to bite down on a leather strap to make it through the ordeal.The storyline has all of potential to have been an epic on the level of Frank Herbert's Dune, but Ken MacLeod turns away from that challenge by offering trite characters, a shallow plot and an overemphasis (running throughout his work) on marijuana use and an odd fascination with portraying communism as a triumphant ideology.

It plays actual clips from the movie before each level (and after if you find a hidden item). The first 7 seven levels have the same goals (find various rings by doing different tasks--skateboarding to grab stars, finding cat treats, locating face blocks etc.) The last level is fighting the boss which is done in a plane.

This will go better as background music for a martini party than for a dance party."},{"rating":"1","title":"A few bright spots, but overall....pretty grim","review":"The only reason I can muster any \\"stars\\" at all is that 3 of the 15 tracks actually brought a smile to my face.\\"War,\\" agreed, is a song that should probably have gone untouched from its original version. Having said that however, the new mix is fun.\\"Smiling Faces Sometimes\\" is probably most loyal to its original version. A few subtle changes here and there, but this song is hard to screw up. The new version holds up well.To my surprise, the highlight of this \\"Remixed\\" CD is \\"Let's Get It On.\\" Again, the 1973 version is pretty darn perfect. But I have to admit, old Marvin himself might get a kick out of this one. Still sexy, with a new beat, and it should gain a whole new audience.Can't say much good about the rest; in fact some are unbelievably awful. I would not have believed that there is a way to screw up \\"My World Is Empty,\\" \\"ABC\\" and \\"Tears of A Clown.\\" But someone found a way to do it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Joy?","review":"The original Motown hits were popular because they were uplifting, zesty, and fun. The remixes here suck the life out of each song by using urban beats and slower -- dare I say boring -- accompaniments. I have to disagree with the majority of reviewers: these particular classics need more remixed originality or should be left alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look To Others","review":"Plain and simple..... The pits! You have all the big names and they ripped the tracks to death. The first track sets the pace. Totaly rips the song apart to only the words and perhaps the melody finds it's way thru the disaster yet to come. The Temptations, Rare Earth and sadly... even Stevie Wonder sounds tired. Fresh remixes???? Not. Sounds like I'm watching a PBS special. Look for and buy any \\"Verve Remixed\\" or \\"What Is Hip\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kind of lounge/cocktail-ish","review":"Bulldog Dave commented: this will go better as background music for a martini party than for a dance party.I've been listening to a lot of lounge and cocktail music lately and I think that's why Motown Remixed appeals to me. It's as if the DJs were all thinking the same thing: This is classic stuff; I'm not going to try to reinvent the wheel. Nothing here tries to pass as the next club anthem, and I like that! The more I listen to Z-Trip's remix of \\"I Want You Back\\" the more I love it. And the first time I heard the \\"Let's Get It On\\" remix, I couldn't help thinking, This has got an R. Kelly feel to it. The remixes are subtle but effective. Over all, this CD is better than I expected.So if you want to throw your hands in the air and wave 'em like you just don't care, you might be disappointed. That doesn't mean you can't dance to this wonderful compilation--I think you can. It's just that you will probably glisten more than sweat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sacrilege! Not for die-hard Motown fans","review":"I seldom ever write reviews about music but this could not go unspoken. The first cut on the CD which is Jackson Five's \\"I Want You Back\\" is ok, but then it's all down hill from there. As a Motown fan of the originals, I expected a contemporary mix to add some \\"bump\\" to the old tracks, but this is just crap, plain and simple. I almost the threw the disc out the window of my car where I first played it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remixers butcher the original beauty of motown classics","review":"I bought this on the strengh of hearing a remix of Lets Get It On, from Marvin Gaye, which gave the song a new feel and managed to preserve some of the charm of the original. Sadly to report this was not the case with many of the other remixes here, which have suffered from having most or all of the original instrumentation removed and the vocals messed around beyond all recognition. The Jackson 5 remixes suffer worst of all. This is nothing but a hatchet job and should be avoided like the plague by any true Motown fan. If Motown want to bring the music to a new and wider audience they should consider digitally remastering and/or remixing using the original tapes. What has been presented here is nothing more than butchery of the Motown tradition and history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Remixes..","review":"I believe that this CD deserves 4 stars in part by virtue alone of the great, well-crafted Motown tunes that today's producers got to work with. I liked the interesting take on The Supremes' \\"World.\\" Now I'd love to hear what Motown's producers can do with their \\"Up the Ladder to the Roof\\" and \\"Stoned Love,\\" which are my two personal favorite songs by the group. Would be great to hit the dancefloor to modern-day remixes of those two singles that really nail their great sounds.

No Stars.","review":"Some people will do anything for money. Money must be the only reason why the younger, one dimensional producers at Motown would put out a piece of garbage like this. This only demonstrates America's ever growing taste for mediocrity is in full bloom. I gave this record 1 star only because Amazon's computer made me do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unoriginal","review":"This Cd is very bad. The songs don't even sound like the originals. My favorite song is 'My world is empty Without you' All it has is the original singing. But even that is slowed down. Do you own the cd 'Supremes Number ones' The last song has a remix of 'You keep me hanging on'. That does include the original background music, and some new instruments. If you like new sounding stuff, then buy it. If you want it, to at least sound original dont buy it. Overall I dissliked this cd. Please if you are buying this cd, listen to the sound clips. poor excuse of remixes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"As my friend (who was a childhood friend of Eddie Kendricks) and I listen to this, we just shook our heads. Unfortuately, this remixing takes the life out of these brilliant recordings. We broke out one of the original \\"Temptations\\" albums for comparison. There is no comparison. A lot is lost in this remix."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply The Best","review":"This CD has been around for a while. It really is the best. The old songs sound new and the new ones quickly become favorites. The blend of these voices is amazing. The range and harmonies are outstanding. I have never heard a better female bass.

This oven is a lower cost toaster oven, that has been modified with stick on black numbers. They then charge a lot more money of course. Just not what I was expecting. In some was it makes it harder to operate because these numbers actually cover up the original operational features/numbers on the product. I did not try to return because I know the return shipping cost would just be too expensive.

This rare book tells of life in the Amana Colonies at the turn of the century.The Amana people voted in 1932 to live under free enterprise, incorporating their land and businesses as the Amana Society and establishing a separate Amana Church Society. The people brought their own homes and many opened small businesses. With their traditional German family style restaurants, the Amanas today are Iowa's premier tourist attraction."},{"rating":"1","title":"A vast ocean covering the world of mathematica, but only 1 inch deep.","review":"I believe this book was written to used up as many pages as possible. The structure of the book is as follows. The author presents an idea in about two sentences (which has less insight than Mathematica's own help file), then demonstrates the idea with a series of one-line Mathematica statements over several pages. The statements are all very similar to each other, and the same ideas are repeated from one chapter to the next. Rather than presenting abstract ideas, the author iterates over many possible configurations of a command.In short, this book is an iteration over many combinations of Mathematica symbols. The book is broad in scope, but is thin on insight.Be sure to check out a preview of this book before purchasing it. If you are looking for a reference that will hand you a statement to accomplish a particular task, maybe this is the book for you. If you are looking for a deep understanding of Mathematica, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Book","review":"Absolutely terrible book.

I paid $40 each time. I will not buy another from this company as the blue box lasts for maybe 2 seasons and then comes unglued. The heating element worked fine but as I read the other reviews- there is a stability issue as well. I placed the heater in the dish and then placed a weight over it to keep it down.

There is a complete lack of focus, however, and unless you are a historian (ie. professor) this is difficult and cumbersome reading; I wish I had visited this site before buying it. Many of the sentences seem awkward, as if directly quoted form other sources. A good educator provides illumination and insight into historical events, within a synthesis of thought; this is merely a list of historical events in haphazard order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best book on islamic extreamism.","review":"The author does have much factual information in the book, but he paints Islam as a religion of nothing but extreamists(IN MY HUMBLE OPINION). He grasps at straws in some parts of the book trying to link certain terrorist groups together. He even suggests that it is likely that Al Queada and HIzbollah cells in South America will team up with Marxist groups like the Columbian FARRC and Neo Nazi groups to attack America. While this is not impossible it is grasping at straws and when he talks about these (Marxist) groups in some detail it gets off track of the books intended subject matter(Fundmetalist Militant Islam)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"This product is a disappointment because powerwasher makes really good products. The water outlet is aluminum and not brass. The inlet is plastic and not brass. Because it is plastic, the inlet water pressure cannot exceed 80 to 100 psi. I have strong water pressure where I live and it exceeds this requirement. I wish they would have put it on the product description because I had to return it for this reason.

Right out of the box I noticed paint chipping off the design. The tuning peg holes look like they were carved out with a dull knife or possibly a pen. The frets are pretty sloppy as well. Regardless of its bad manufacturing I wanted to hear how it sounds. It was not pre-tuned. I busted out my tuner and went to work. All was well until I relized that when you tune one string the last one tuned goes out of tune. This is because of a lack of a truss bar (which keeps the neck from bowing). My intentions were to teach this child how to play a guitar. Not to give her another annoying toy. Spend the extra cash and get a youth size Gibson or something comparable. If your kid is serious about playing don't cheap out like when you bought that Hyundai instead of the Honda."},{"rating":"2","title":"like a guardian angel","review":"Writing for school is very stressful and not knowing what is expected makes it even more so.

We just couldn't justify the cost with the dismal programing offered. We did miss the old shows on TV-Land. With the release of vintage programming like The Andy Griffith Show on DVD we can use the money that we've saved through cancelling cable for the purchase of quality programming that we can enjoy as a family. This first season DVD is a classic. The video and sound quality are excellent. There are morals to the stories and it's fun to watch for all ages. We can watch The Andy Griffith Show with our young son and not be embarassed by inappropriate content. As we've added to our DVD collection we're now able to watch TV that we want, when we want. We've set up our own programming schedule. The Andy Griffith Show is played in our home every Sunday night at 7, before our son goes to bed.

As a matter of fact I canceled my cable subscription and with the money I save each month I buy DVD's. No more searching endlessly through hundreds of channels to try and find something good to watch. I get to watch all of the shows I like without those annoying commercials.

I have seen every episode countless times, and yet they still charm me, make me laugh and stir up warm fuzzy feelings each time I watch.The very best part of having the whole first season on clear crisp dvd format is getting to see them uncut. Some of the best scenes in the show are often cut to fit more commercials in to broadcast syndication. Scenes at the beginning or end of a show that are not essential to the plot are usually the first to be cut. These scenes are often the funniest ones in the show when Andy and Barney simply \\"take off\\" on each other. It is so good to see the shows as they originally aired on CBS in the sixties.My only disappointment is that there are no real extras on these dvds. It would have been nice to get some interviews from the cast or some \\"behind the scenes\\" stuff or even some commentaryI am eagerly awaiting season two."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Andy Griffith Show...Complete 1st season","review":"Kinda waste of time to make a review on The Andy Griffith Show.

No subtitles, no commentary, no inclusion of the Danny Thomas Show that launched the Andy Griffith character, no discussion or information about the show, no special features, no nothing. This show is a treasure of Americana, and Paramount goes the laziest, greedy route (the V.P.'s at Paramount and Universal home entertainment divisions must continually compete to see who can do the worst job and still turn a buck) and simply slaps their celluloid onto a DVD and send it down to Mexico to get mass reproduced.

For years, I've seen small, random sets of Andy Griffith Show episodes, and I've dreamed of the time when I could collect my all-time favorite show by season. To my delight, the time is now. The season one four-disc set consists of four slimline cases in a collection box -- a nice touch. Each disc contains eight episodes, and there are absolute classics on each disc. The \\"Play All\\" feature allows you to view them all at once. In complete fairness, I wish the set included the pilot featured on \\"Make Room for Daddy.\\" Additional features/commentaries would be welcomed too.

Everything about this game is perfect. The graphics are outstanding, but what makes the game the best is its gameplay. The A.I. is just the perfect level. Unlike other sports games, where once you get used to the controls its easy beating top-notch teams, the A.I. in this game is challenging. It is very difficult to beat a powerhouse team, unless you are one yourself. Also, this game gets the emotion of college ball just right. From when the players take the field to the sound of the final whistle. The dynasty is the best part of this game. You get to schedule your non-conference games. So you get to decide if you want to play pushover teams or really tough teams, like Nebraska. It basically has every trophy you can think of. For example: if you do dynasty mode and you are UCLA and are playing USC, you compete for the victory bell.

If one has been in a cave their whole life and has never read a book or been part of an organization, perhaps some of the many Peter Drucker or Edwards Deming quotes may be interesting.Beyond that, there are numerous grammatical and factual errors that give the book a feel of being written for the sake of getting something to market. For example, page 159 of the hardcover version, \\"The Ford hunger march on 7 March 1932 was reminiscent of that occasion back in 1812 when the Luddites marched on Rawfold's Mill in the North of England. Two hundred and twenty years later history was repeating itself.\\" Evidently the author doesn't know how many years separates 1932 from 1812 which, considering the contents of the book, doesn't surprise me."},{"rating":"1","title":"As much fun as closing a door.....oh wait!","review":"That's all the game is Mario closing doors with horrid cut scenes.

As a President, he focused ont he needs of his poorest citizens, which cost him the support of the elites. He tackled corruption, prosecuted the Macoutes, and defied the world's greatest superpower, all to save those who could not save themselves. All this at the cost of his political power, his freedom, and his ability to return to his native land. A Spartacus for the modern age, Aristide knew he could not win, but fought the good fight anyway, not because he felt it would be easy, but because it was the morally proper thing to do.

The best part, though, is that there are thick parts and thin parts, so there are plenty of good grab points, and the ears, nose, tail, and feet are all good (and apparently qualitatively different) spots for mouthing. The toy overall is a good size--not hard to find, but small enough for the average diaper bag.

As previously stated, reading military history without maps is a frustrating and ultimately worthless enterprise--a downright stupid and rude thing for an author to do (and its done too often!).

Once I had Esposito's atlas, I returned to Chandler and was able to appreciate and follow what was going on a lot better.Since Chandler, I have read other Napoleonic titles, always making sure to have Esposito open to the appropriate page on the table nearby.

St. Ignatius Loyola knew that it is mostly impossible for lay people to follow a 30-day retreat and therefore designed the \\"Annotation Nineteen\\" that gives an opportunity for busy people to do the retreat individually and consult their retreat giver by mail, or now, by email. The book consists of guidance for the retreat giver (on the left pages), and the retreatants: the biblical texts and prayers to meditate on (on the right pages). The Spritual Exercises are really tough for the lay, but what I like most from this book is that it prepares the retreatants to come to a spiritual atmosphere which gradually moves them to be closer to God and enter the meditation and contemplation as required."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rhino finds the right mix of the common, unusual & obscure","review":"I bought this record because I have been looking thirty years for a relatively obscure song,\\"It's Good News Week\\" and this album had the best mix of songs of the three albums that Amazon.com had in stock with my song on them.

For example, change a couple words and update the arrangement and \\"It's Good News Week\\" would be a hit today because it captures the superficiality of our connection to a troublesome world so well-- and it applies to today when protest is almost dead better than to the time in which it was written.

I have been exposed to the hypocracy, fascism, intolerance and irrationalism of the Islamic faith, and am concerned about the plight of freethinkers in the Muslim world. Ibn Warraq, I believe, has has done a very good service in discussing such subjects as the totalitarian nature of Islamic Sharia, the spread of Islam in part through military conquest, the subordination of women, and the less-than-divine origin and contents of the Quran.

Don't waste your money. Not to say that one's experiences don't influence the filter from which we view life, however, if one has little understanding of their faith, any faith, then they can easily assume that the things done to them whether by Catholic Priests, everyday Muslims or Orthodox Jews are the main tenets of that faith.Religion is neutral.

He constantly refers to the lack of rational and critical thought of Moslems, Christians and Jews, but he himself is not open to any informed opinions on them, quoting those scholars with a like bias.

That position is much harder to accept after reading this book and learning more about Islam from other sources. The religion does not seem to have undergone any reforms comparable to those of Christianity, nor is there any evident movement or path toward such reforms. The teachings are so absolutist that it's hard to be optimistic that its billion adherents can be integrated peacefully into the modern world.

He describes all religions as \\"sick men's dreams,\\" and most of his co-authors agree with him. His and his sources' comments about Christianity, in one of his books, are so biased and extremist as to seriously undermine his arguments against Islam.

The authors discussion of the palce of women in an Islamic society is again poor - anyone with an elemenatry knowldge of Islam would be aware of the facts.When summed up - I wished i hadn't purcahsed the book and found the reading of it not at all informative or helpful in my attempt to understand Islam."},{"rating":"2","title":"The negative reviews prove the point","review":"I read this book long before September 11th, and now it's an absolute 'must read.'

It is unsparing in its analysis of how the Koran and sharia law came into existence. It portrays an unflattering picture of the prophet Mohammed. Finally, it compares Western philosophy and political theory to that of Islam, and finds Islam to be ossified and lacking in human values.It quotes widely from both Islamic and Western sources and gives the reader an overview of the theological premises discussed in much less detail in Bernard Lewis' books, such as What Went Wrong.A minor criticism is that it is not tightly organized and often overlapping in arguments from one chapter to the next. This is far outweighed by the force of the arguments presented, and the searing criticism of Islam that more timid texts (eg., Karen Armstrong) are unwilling to make."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book is OFF Big Time","review":"Listen, I don't have anything against critcizing anything or anyone, including my religion. I do however have a problem when people use lies to do so and Ibn Warraq's sources are extremely skeptical even among Muslim scholars. How he derives his arguments and the texts he does it from are rejected by the majority of Muslims. The text which he seems to miss the most about is the Quran which Muslims regard as infallible (something he doesn't mention again).

Islam doesn't rely on Muhammad the same way Christianity relies on the Prophet Jesus(who never heard the word \\"Christ\\", food for thought) which is a very difficult concept for any human worshiper to grasp. The book does point out bad Muslim people/governments thoughout history, needless to say those are human faults and not the religion's. Moreover, the writter doesn't challenge the recent studies of the Quran as a mathamatically composed book in such a way that its a physical impossibility to detect such patterns(not code) without a computer(1960s) even though those studies are easily and freely available on websites(submission.org).

But I would like to say one thing, and that is that every religion at the beginning has had a harsh truth in it. First of all, the Jews were the one who crucified Christ, and the Christians were the ones who brought in the crusaders who caused a huge massacre. EVERY religion had a brutal history so Islam is no indifferent. And honestly, I have never heard not even once in my life about Muslims treating any women in the HISTORY of Islam in any way barbarically. I am a recent convert of Islam because I realized how much Islam praises women and gives her more rights and appreciates the woman as well as her body more than any other religion.

But I was relieved when I heard the whole cd- it's still the same group. Tim's voice is one of the best in music and the lyrics are what punk should be.This isn't emo or pop punk garbage, it's the real thing and it's great to have another cd of it.

They have a pretty good sound but it's kind of generic. The singer doesn't have good range so the songs start to sound the same after a while; kind of like Pennywise, Bad Religion, Social D singers. They're OK, but without range the singing melodies can't be stretched or changed dramatically. The music is generic rock. It's heavy rhythm, little melody.

Suitable background in electronics is given for the book to be used as a textbook, yet the approach is that of a helpful cookbook. Going beyond the PC, the important topic of microcontrollers is addressed. Best of all, important problems in data measurement using PCs can be addressed with very inexpensive hardware easily built (a complete novice might need a Radio Shack style guide to how to do soldering). Software is included in source code form on disk, an added bonus. Reading this book won't get you an EE degree but it might be the next best thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Electronics Today\\" treatment of the subject","review":"Relatively complete treatment of the basic Centronics and Bi-directional modes. About 5 pages devoted to EPP and ECP--nothing about protocols or support from any (modern) operating system. All examples use Bios calls which are unavailable after DOS. Looks like a re-tread of a much earlier work. Hardware-software examples are fine, but utilize many parts which have been out-of date for years. A real disapointment..I sent it back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, direct, effective book","review":"This is a book written by a person that clearly understands his job. It is also fairly complete in its scope (the use of paralell port in data acquisition and control) and simple to follow. Almost immediately you get suggestions to fullfill your needs. It is an ideal book in two situations, I think: if you are begining a project and have not a lot of experience or if you are just studying.

I took it out of the box, unwrapped it (it was shrink wrapped in plastic), and the legs promptly broke off one side. The bowls are quite small - even though I knew the dimensions of the bowls before ordering, I was surprised how tiny they looked in person. They'd still work, but large cats may not be able to get at the bits left in the bottom of the bowl. In any case, it's irrelevant, since I threw away the metal frame and am using the bowls as craft bowls or around-the-house-work-bowls. The entire product is horribly made. I've had my current steel bowl dishes in a metal frame for 9 years and they're still going strong - it's unfortunate that I can't find another set for the downstairs area.

He deserves tribute albums. These artists are the right people to record this album.But the album is SO DARN SAD. Every track is recorded like a funeral hymn.Now to be fair, some of these songs can't really be recorded any other way. Upbeat versions of \\"Marie\\" or \\"Waitin' Round to Die\\" would be perverse.But \\"If I Needed You\\" doesn't need to be a lamentation. And Robert Earl Keen (whom I love dearly) bafflingly turns the rapid-fire, raucous celebration of poker, \\"Mr. Mudd & Mr. Gold,\\" into a slow, weary wail. The most perky-sounding track on this album is, wierdly, Delbert McClinton's \\"Pancho & Lefty.\\"Don't get me wrong; this is a beautiful album. Maybe sheer grief at the Master's passing has made it such a sad album. I know Townes, like Leonard Cohen, has a reputation for writing sad stuff. This tribute album seems to accept that reputation. It's a good album. I only wish it could also have celebrated Van Zandt's joyous side."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mud and Gold","review":"I looked forward eagerly to this tribute album but was ultimately disappointed. None of the cuts come close to the great man's own interpretations. Only Steve Earle and Delbert McClinton give acceptable renditions of 'Two Girls' and 'Pancho & Lefty' respectively. My advice would be to get the real thing in 'Live at the Old Quarter, Texas' or any of Townes' own (especially live) albums. This album was Mud to Townes' Gold, only this time Mr Mud didn't come out on top!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You Are Not Needed Now","review":"There are some great names singing great versions of great songs here, but when all is said and done I heartily recommend you get your fingers dirty with the real thing. Let LIVE AT THE OLD QUARTER or REARVIEW MIRROR be your introduction. This guy's like a cross between Hank Williams & early Leonard Cohen. Needless to say, he was not afraid of the dark.Like the cheesy cover of POET, this star studded tribute (whose heart is in the right place) is just a white-washing of the crooked, meandering fence Townes set up between Nashville and what has come to be known as \\"Alternative Country\\". In short, the originals kick the guts out of any the cover here.It certainly isn't a bad record, but who needs a new car when the old jalopy runs just fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"ordinary","review":"a pretty ordinary compliment of music, did not do Townes any justice.I would not recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the real music of townes Van Zandt"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Tribute to Townes","review":"Really like this CD, great renditions of Townes music...would totally recommend it;I didnt give it a 5 star rating as I will always loves Townes Versions."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Winner!","review":"Townes is indeed a 'Poet' and some wonderful interpretations.

She is very happy with her life, until a deadly disease comes through her town. Her mother sends her on a dangerous mission to get help for the children of Clifton. She escapes but the second she does her life changes forever. I really loved this book. It is exciting and scary at the same time. It was an amazing read.

Her mission is to leave Clifton where it is 1996 and get modern medicine. She also must go through the guards that are trying to keep her inside Clifton.I liked the book a lot. The book was very intriguing. If you like time travel, you would probably like Running Out of Time. At the end, the book slows down just a little bit.

It's 1996.In the village of Clifton, diphtheria begins to grow. Her mother wants her to go outside of Clifton to get help, but she doesn't think it's right because it's dangerous. Her mother tells her to go outside of Clifton, so Jessie does. She's supposed to call a man named Mr.Neely. There are a lot of things she doesn't know.I thought the book Running Out Of Time was a very enjoyable book because it was cool to try and see what Jessie would do in the modern world.

At the time, there weren't many books with female leads that weren't over-effeminate, which is fine; but it can get tiring. I came across this book again years later and I still love it. The suspense builds right from the beginning as Jessie states some of the peculiar behavior among the town's residents. You will not be able to put this book down as Jessie must find help for her neighbors while eluding the grasp of those who want to keep her quiet. The ending was good in that it was realistic, even if it sort of fizzles out instead of wrapping everything up and leaving nothing to the imagination. Highly recommended for younger readers (grades 3-6) in that it gives many opportunities for discussion and 'What if' questions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teacher's Grade: A","review":"This debut novel by Maragaret Peterson Haddix is a compelling story that will have students begging their teachers to keep on reading. The premise seems simple: in 1840 the children of Clifton Village are hit by an epidemic of diptheria, and many are dying. To save the villagers, one of the mothers confides to her daughter that it is really 1996, and that the daughter will have to venture out into modern day America in order to save her family and friends.This is like the Truman Show in that the people of the village are largely ignorant that their every move is being watched by tourists, and filmed by closed circuit TV cameras. It is exciting to read about the escape, and reading about the girl's encounters with KFC, cars, and indoor plumbing is humorous. There is a lot of suspense, and an ending that will have you wishing for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply a classic","review":"This book is Margaret Haddix at her best. Don't let me trick you into thinking that this is her best book: that is Turnabout. But this a superb work of absolute genius.The plot is fresh and original. It takes shocking turns and tricks you every step of the way. It is a delightful read- fast-paced, exciting, and nerve-racking. I simply couldn't put it down.The thing that I don't like is that the book cover gives away the main detail of the plot too soon. I don't want to tell you the plot because it'll ruin the book's true experience. DON'T READ BOOK COVERS! THEY BLURT OUT WHAT THE AUTHOR HAS TRIED TO HIDE UNTIL THE END OF THE BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Running out of time review","review":"I thought this was a great book! Margaret Peterson Haddix has a way of always making you want to read more. The last sentance is usually the most exciting so you'll want to read more. The girl in the story I think probably relates to a lot of us. She thinks that she is brave, and she is, but going in to a whole new world where nothing is the same made her realize that she is not as brave as she thought. This book made me look at things a lot harder. It shows how we take things for granted. For example we have electricity. Jessie had never even heard of electricity. There are a lot of things that Jessie had to do that we have Machines for now. Jessie was also lied to for thirteen years. She really thought that it was 1840.

Habbix. It was published in 1995.The light woke Jessie, though it was just a glimmer downstairs. The main idea of th story was that Jessie had to sneak out of the historic site where she lived. The reason why she had to sneak out is that there was a sickness and they weren't getting the modern day medicine.The exciting is when... Jessie woke to the pale sunlight on her face. Her head hurt.She'd been having a horrifying dream about Roy, Tol, and Mr.Neeley all chasing her in a rusty brown car.I think others will like this book. It's bassed on a real story, it has action, and it ha a surprised twist in the plot.This story will make you cry, but it will also make you laugh.My rating for this book is ten out of ten."},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought the book was excellent!","review":"The book was very, very, good.

My teacher read this book outloud to us and it was terrible. i don't know why this book got a kid pick seal, because over 1/2 of my class thought it was bad, too. It was hard to follow sometimes because of how jessie goes from a pioneer country to 1996 and all of a sudden she just finds out it's the 90s. why would a mom tell a kid that it's the 1800s when it's the 90s? read something better than this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste you TIME","review":"This is the worst book I've ever read in my entire life.

Ms. Haddix made everything seem so real in Jessie's quest to escape from Clifton to get medicine for her sister and all the other dying children. You see, Jessie thinks she lives in 1840, in a small village called Clifton. But really, Jessie lives in 1996, in a tourist site where people can come and watch her do her chores, etc. When a diphtheria epidemic strikes the village, Jessie's mother tells her the truth, and sends her out to 1996 to find medicine for the children. Right before she leaves, Jessie's sister comes down with it, which makes Jessie try even harder. This is a great book about learning a new culture and trying to fit in. It might not strike you immeaditly, but this is a book about fitting in, as well as murder and trying to get help. This is a book that you will love for many years to come!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My All Time Favorite Book!","review":"I'm 11 years old and I love Running Out Of Time! It's my favortie book ever!

Then I came back inside and thought about all the things that Jessie lived without. Light-bulbs, T.V., the radio,the telephone, cameras. It seemed scary. I wrote down a list about everything the book made me feel, and everytime I feel like nothing goes my way, or something's not fair, I see my list and I remember that I can't complain about anything. I live on \\"easy street\\" compared to Jessie. I'm grateful for that. And if Margaret (the author) ever reads this, I want her to know that I did her book for a book report, and I loved it so much, I would gladly use it for another!

Total page-turner I would recommend to children and adults alike (I am 29 and reading about Jessie's harrowing escape made me as excited as a kid would be!)Haddix's descriptions aren't hackneyed or played-down for the younger set.

When a disease sweeps through the town, Jessie is told the truth and sent out into the modern world to find a cure before everyone dies. She has to quickly learn all of the modern ways in order to survive and complete her task, which isn't easy and makes the story exciting. You are held in suspense throughout the book to see if Jessie succeeds or fails to return with the cure. It is truly a matter of life or death. If you like this kind of book then read Flowers for Algernon and An Audience for Einstein as well. All are very good stories"},{"rating":"2","title":"Too close for coincidence","review":"As I watched the film The Village, I figured out the ending about halfway through. Why?

However, it was very early in the book that I realized that I would not be happy with either the plot, the character development, or writing.The writing is probably the most frustrating. There are so many random statements made throughout the book that aren't clarified. Or, the main character will jump from thought to thought, again without explanation or well written transitions.The Plot and character development are much like the random statements made throughout the book, poorly done."},{"rating":"2","title":"my all time favourite book!!!","review":"Running out of time was the most interesting, fabulous and provocative I have ever read.

She has to go through a lot of personal chllenges.This could be a great book for any type of reader (even those who do not like reading).If you have read Among the hidden, you will love this book even more."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is an adventure that is breath taking","review":"During the novel's adventure, Jessie takes risks as she moves from 1840 to 1996 that jeopardize her life. These risks include getting out of Clifton and drinking possibly dangerous water. Also, she has to get away from Tol and Ray, a couple of creeps--so she runs like the dickens--also, she is held captive in an apartment. (Jessie had to crawl down a wall to escape.) She calles a news confrence to spread the word about diptheria in Clifton and passes out. When she wakes up she has saved everybody except Abby and Jefferson. Then she gets to go back to her parents and live a 1996 girl life.

At first you will probably think there actually in the 1840s, but its really 1996. The people in Cliton have to pretend that they are in the 1840s but only the adults know that it is 1996 because the kids dont get to know the secret until there old enough, but one kid finds out and she is sent on a mission to find modern medicen for dyptheria."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Review","review":"I read running out of time by Margaret Peterson Haddix.

Jessi's mom said that they were not really in 1840's but in 1996 so it is jessi's job to get the medicine from the outside world can she do it find out by reading this book and how jessi struggles to save her friends and most of all her sister and the town."},{"rating":"2","title":"You decide....","review":"This is a great novel for young and old. I actually liked it much more than the movie, The Village. In fact it probably would have made a better movie. At any rate, one can see where M. Night Shyamalan could certainly have gotten the idea for his movie, The Village. This book, unlike the movie, The Village, is action packed. A good fast read. So buy it, read it, and decide for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time by Reading Running Out of Time","review":"Running Out of Time is a fictional story about a young girl, 13 years old, and her name is Jessie. She lives in a small town in Indiana called Clifton, where it's 1840, and in the outside world it is 1996. In her little town there is a dangerous disease called diphtheria, and the doctor is not allowed to use modern medicine. Jessie has to escape Clifton and go forty miles to the state capitol, Indianapolis. She has to find a doctor by the name of Mr. Neeley and get medicine before time runs out for her friends and family.I didn't really like Running Out of Time because it was too predictable, and I didn't like the ending at all. It needs a sequel, but with this book there isn't a sequel yet. Margaret Peterson Haddix writes in third person, that means the narrator tells the story. I would recommend this book to a child 10 or 11 years old because it's not too long. It's only 184 pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Book","review":"This book was a very good book by one of my favorite authors, Margert Peterson Haddix. This book was an easy read, but it was written very well. I enjoyed this book because it was written in a past to present format. Haddix writes many books about teenagers in a different world. This was like a history book. You learned about the things children used to have to do every day. They had to grow their own food and bring water up from the rivers and other things just to survive. They were taght in a one room school house and that school house had grades 1-8. There was one teacher who was very strict, the chidren were also taught different things then we are taught now.In this book Jessica, the main character, has to complete a dangerous mission. On this mission she finds out things are not as they seem."},{"rating":"2","title":"okay","review":"This book was fairly enjoyable overall.However, this book did not strike me as original. It probably came out first, but there are so many books and movies that have the same plot that it gets a bit old. Basically, there's this entire civilization living and believing that it's the 1800's (or was it 1900s?). The same thing happens in The Villiage, and The City of Ember. It's sad.This book was good overall, but lacks true character development and plot. An enjoyable read, but typical. It gets rather boring and dull at times as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"great concept, disappointing delivery","review":"This book has a fascinating concept- growing up in a 'heritage' village believing that it is really 1840. But the concept is never really developed- we only see a juxtaposition of the two worlds in one brief scene, and the adjustments required of the heroine are rather perfunctory. The story quickly becomes a pretty scary chase story where there are no safe places and all the adults- even the few well meaning ones- ending up being frightening or intimidating to the children; the bad guys are very wicked indeed, with explicit Nazi 'better race' overtones. The rationale for their wickedness is lame at best. Even the end is dispatched too quickly, with no tying together of past and present or what this all means to the parents, the children, or the family as a group. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"My reveiw","review":"I read Running Out of Time by Margaret Peterson Haddix. In this book there is a girl named Jessie.

I heard that 10 mins skipping rope is equal to half an hour of jogging on the road, so this little jumprope was perfect for me. It doesn't make a huge footprint in the house, and I can work out without any equipment setup."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the price","review":"This rope is definitely nothing fancy nor is that what it is intended to be. This is the traditional style rope that most of us grew up with. It is functional, smooth, and serves its purpose well. For $6 you can't go wrong with this product. But, for any more serious jumpers I would suggest a speed rope by Everlast. Overall, I would recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy for excersising!","review":"It may be good for kids.. But still, It depends what to compare it to.I purchased it for exercising as fun fitness option - I liked jumping when I was younger.And it is very slow! Very very slow! You will get bored with this rope rather fast and through it in a farthest corner of your room. It will be another thing that you bought, used once and now just keeping.It does not allow much of tricks.I had to buy another one. Actually the 'Everlast Leather Weighted Jump Rope', also from Amazon. And it is way better!The good thing I can tell about this jumping rope is that you can take off some chains and make it shorter - so it is adjustable for height. I've got 8' rope and still had to take 1 or 2 chains off. I am 5 feet and 3 inches tall. So finally, the size was good for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too lightweight","review":"The jumpropes at my gym kind of looked like these so I wanted to try them. These are too lightweight.

If fans don't support the season releases, the networks will not improve them, they will stop issuing them. The Odd Couple is one of the finest sitcoms of the 1970's,and while I would prefer to have the series DVD's uncut and of high quality, I'll accept a few deficiencies rather than not have them at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"An absolute classic","review":"I think we can put this entire series up there with the Honeymooners \\"Classic 39\\" Episodes as one of the BEST comedies on television. The first Season originally came out as a Time Life release - as soon as I saw it I had to get it! Now it has been released for the masses. For once, Paramount/CBS DVD is doing it right. They are giving us uncut episodes, with an excellent transfer. I didn't notice any music changes in the shows, the Neal Hefti music is there, the \\"guest\\" musical numbers are not cut out (even though the packaging mentions musical edits). Both Season 1 & 2 are well worth the money, though I like season 2 better, the set it different and as they say in the beginning of the show it is \\"shot in front of a live audience\\", canned laughter isn't added in the post production."},{"rating":"1","title":"Live audience kills shows","review":"It happened to this show, it happened to Happy Days. It happened to every show that went live. Imagine if the first two classic seasons of Bewitched had been before a live audience. Well, they wouldn't be regarded as classic seasons.With a live audience everything is so exaggerated, and the interplay between the audience and the actors is not always beneficial to the shows. Audiences egg actors on and cause them to overact or overreact, makes them self-conscience and too eager to please or get laughs. Also, the show gets stuck on location and rarely moves, rarely goes outdoors, nothing.I give Season one 5 stars. This season and subsequent Seasons deserve 1 star only."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only one fault","review":"You can't fault the transfer of these episodes, they look fantastic, you can't fault the show itself, it is practically flawless, my one fault with Paramount's versions of the Odd Couple DVD's (compared to the Time Life version of Season1) is the lack of extras. Time Life's Season 1 DVD package had commentaries by the stars (Klugman included), Garry Marshall introductions and Klugman's home movies. Where are the outtakes and season/episode TV ads? There have to be some that have survived. Paramount is just churning them out with little or no respect to the show and its ravid fanbase that has survived for over 30 years. I am a WPIX Channel 11 in NYC re-run baby who discovered this show in the late 70's. It's a treasure to see these in remastered quality but give us some extras Paramount."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent transfer quality. Great to see the previously edited scenes","review":"Reviewers have already mentioned that the songs used in the episodes are intact in this series, so I won't mention it again. Oops, I just did.Anyhoo, the transfer quality is top notch. After watching this series for so many years on Channel 11 in New York and occasionally on TV Land, it's wonderful to see the rich vibrant colors of the 70's on the dvd. My senses are so alive! Example, watching the \\"Golden Earrings\\" episode last night, I noticed for the first time how beautiful the greyhound was. What a nice doggie!Also, even the hardest of hardcore OC fans will find scenes they never saw before. All the scenes WPIX, TV Land, and syndication edited out are back in. Each edited scene is like a wonderful little nugget of discovery as you watch these episodes again.Gratzi! Mille Gratzi Paramount!

The people who wrote reviews with a star higher that two have either had the toy for less than a week or they know something we don't.

The next day I went to open it again and it did not open so I waited till the evening and tried again. I got a little frustrated and so I went in a quiet room and tried again and it worked. So I Have a few ideas that you might want to try if you have been having some troubles with your Password Journal 3,1.ALWAYS BE IN A QUIET ROOM.2.ALWAYS USE A LOW VOICE WHEN YOU SAY YOUR PASSWORD.3.WHEN YOU MAKE YOUR PASSWORD BE SURE YOU SAY A SHORT ONE. I still have a few problems with it but when I use these tips I have an easier time with it and I have faith in it to work perfectly soon!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good-looking product, poor privacy.,","review":"You might want to buy this journal that claims to keep your secrets safe and only opens to the correct owner's voice and password, but it has very poor privacy. Not only that, but I also agree with ivanx that it almost never opens to your voice (and often will open to someone else's voice, even when you have it on \\"high privacy\\" mode).Any no-brainer would be able to open the object by opening it just enough to hit the 'change password' button with a pencil or pointed object, and change the password and hack in. Or, they could just stick the key that goes with it in, and it unlocks. With just a regular diary, you only need the KEY to get in.Don't go for this type of journal, if you want your secrets safe. You're better off with a regular diary. But me? I won't write my secrets anywhere now that I've learned--as you can never be sure that they're 100% safe and someone will blab them out! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This product is non-functional","review":"Both my daughters have a password journal and once you set the password good luck ever getting it open again.

When you set-up your password, it only responds to your voice. O.K., then when you try to open it you spend 10 minutes tring to get it to open ( or right.) And you have to have the exact same voice. So you have to pull to get it open. And the privcey is not high. So insted of getting this, why don't you get the kind with the locks and keys. MUCH more privcey. And a nother thing, when the paper runs out,I tried useing reg. paper,but it will fall out. This also seems pricey,(thats what I think.) But I do like the gel pen. (Becase blue is my favrite color.)

She finally had the necessary money and was so excited and the thing just won't open. You have to say the password exactly the way it was recorded. If your inflection is a little off then it won't open. If a fly is buzzing somewhere in the house and wasn't when you recorded the word it won't open. The best advice I can give is don't buy this dumb toy. If you have and don't want to return it, there is a little reset button inside a hole next to the battery case on the back. Stick a pin inside it, the journal will open and you can try reseting the password. Also, make sure that the security setting inside the password is on low. If you don't like to see your kids frustrated to tears, don't buy it. Maybe it would be a good gift for the class bully."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment. . .","review":"I'll give the thing 5 stars for educational value because journal writing is a great exercise. . . However, aside from joining the many others who have complained about the voice recognition (HA!) software (we had more success with a single letter - like \\"p\\" - than a word or phrase), I have to say that it's not much of a journal. The \\"journal\\" is a tablet of paper that is glued down to the machine itself. What are you supposed to do when it's used? You can't easily attach another.

Even after reading the bad reviews here. Well, I should have listened. This thing doesn't work. Well, maybe I should be more specific. The logic that the PJ has is very simple, and becuase of that, once you record your password, it must be spoken exactly the same way as you recorded it (tone, inflection, volume, backround noise, etc..) very hard to replicate EXACTLY even for an adult (believe me, I tried).

The pump size is too small to do that. Second off, look at the photo of the pump, do you see were the garden hose goes? While, if you leave that valve pointed up (without a water hose) it won't even pump water (that is how weak the pump is). The only benefit is the pump is quite.

I put a 50 ft hose laying on level to the exit door and it did not have power enough to push it through the hose that I had just checked to be open. Cut the hose to about 10 ft and a slow stream came out until I raised it about knee high and the pump would not force the water through the hose.

Hey, one of the best compilations of any music collection!!But Quicksilver was one of the GREAT bands of the 60's & 70's bar none! Combining Jazz, Blues, and just plain innovative music styles. A very unique band. The keyboards, drums [powerful rhythms] and Dino's voice, tell ya, the 60's live in these guys.Sad to say, the music of today just doesn't have it. No comparison.

This one is thinner than my current blanket and is no where near as thick as the robe (both were the same thickness at one point).It will make a good living room blanket, not a bed blanket.The blanket is really soft and will be warm, but not winter warm like the ones I got while in Korea.

So obviously I was really excited when I bought this interview CD. Here's the stinger. You will only hear Tori talk a few times. It is narrated by some English woman. All the Tori speaking parts are taken from the interview used on the In Conversation Tori Amos interview CD. So if you want to hear the original interview buy that CD instead. Most of the facts that were supposedly researched for this CD are completely untrue. The only plus side is the great photos in the booklet and mini poster you get with the CD. Overall I wouldn't even recommend this for a hardcore Tori fan since most of the information is not correct."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thoughts on the CD","review":"I bought this CD, and when listening to it I felt [taken].

While critics will view their time era (1973-1988) as an \\"uneven\\" or \\"scattered hits from several record labels\\", this song list should not be taken lightly. \\"Midnight Train To Georgia\\", \\"On And On\\", \\"I've Got To Use My Imagination\\", and \\"Save The Overtime For Me\\" are R & B classics.The packaging is superb: exhaustive, enjoyable liner notes with a few pictures during the time period.

All decisive British victories with massive American casualties.It's interesting to note that Daniel Morgan told his troops that they must on no account cross bayonets with British redcoats at Cowpens.

(The composition seemed to be much better thought out than the other photos and the photographer's \\"fuzzy\\" style worked well for the situation. I definitely have a bias towards sharp pictures.)The color seemed especially bad too. I'm not sure if the color was part of the photographer's style or if it was poor printing.

I agree with other reviews that the rear speakers would be better served with a separate volume control but the entire speaker system coupled with the really good valued 5 disc upconverting dvd player is a wonderful value. I paid about $320 with no shipping, no tax with amazon. The purchase was delivered very quickly during Christmas and it was perfect.

Not the ones I tried.","review":"I'm sorry to report I've brought two of these home in the last week, and in both cases the main unit won't recognize my existing standard HDMI cables. Both cables work fine with all other components I've tried. Panasonic tech support, after running me through setup and reset processes, says maybe laying out an extra $50 for their own HDMI cable would help, but a Circuit City guy tells me this is nonsense - cables is cables. Either way it's disappointing that a reputable company like Panasonic would market this as HDMI-capable without telling you the limits on the claimed capability."},{"rating":"1","title":"unsatisfied customer","review":"The wireless rear speakers are not wireless. If your room is over 20 feet wide, there is no way you can have the speakers on each side of the room.

You have rear speakers connected to a remote box by wires."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad NEWS","review":"I thought Panasonic was a reputable brand. I regrettably sold my previous DVD Home Theatre System which was also Panasonic for the SC-PT750. First off the Ipod dock doesn't work w/ my 4th gen Ipod period. It charges it but that's it. Second it kills my Wi-Fi connection like mentioned in a previous review I seem to have ignored. Third it doesn't work with my HDMI cable which is the entire reason I bought it!! I called customer service only to be put on hold and eventually hung up on. I am assuming they would tell me to buy a Panasonic Cable for $50 which is ridiculous considering my $20 cable has worked fine on my PS3. Looks like I won't be listening to music while on the internet (internet only works when the system is comletely off, not just the rear speakers, I think I may just unhook them all together)! Needless to say I am exteremely dissapointed in the system. STAY AWAY.

Non conventional perhaps, but he is learning about object permanence for sure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great beginner soft sorter - start with this one and upgrade to plastic later","review":"I actually bought two of these. The story is as goes - when my oldest nephew was eight or nine months old, we got him this toy and he loved it to bits. When he grew older, however, (he is four now), he thought it would be a good idea to let the doggies play with it, with rather predictable results.So, when my second nephew got old enough to be interested in such toys (he just turned one), we bought a replacement. He loves it, and the dogs are waiting on the sidelines for their chance to have a go at it :PKids learn shapes, colors, and you can keep them busy for literally minutes at a time! Different textures and sounds add to keeping kids interested. The fact that the pieces are soft is a plus as well - no collateral damage when the bits start flying around. While this is not dog-proof, and older kids can force the pieces through most any hole, Lamaze Multi Sensory Soft Sorter is a great beginner sorter nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be better","review":"I purchased this toy to help my 14-month old learn her colors and shapes, but this toy doesn't really do this. First off, because the shapes are made out of soft material, nothing is quite right - the circle isn't really round, the square has rounded edges, etc.More than that, though, this doesn't work at all as a sorting toy as the hole for the square is large enough that all the shapes fit through it. What good is a sorting toy that doesn't require the child to sort? And this is ignoring the top that is velcro'ed closed - it took my DD less than 5 minutes of playing with this toy to find that, and she only needed it as she wasn't convinced that she'd gotten all the toys out by reaching her hand into the hole for the square (she had).I gave this 2 stars as it is colorful and despite the fact that it's not teaching her anything, my DD seems to enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A winner!","review":"I got this toy for my niece when she was 9 months old and it has been her favorite toy for a whole year! Her parents have to bring it along wherever they go! It's very good quality and will resist through many washes. It's also extremely soft and the colors are very attractive. My niece loves the different sounds that each ball makes. She also loves to peak through the openings and has recently taken to actually sort the different shapes (although she enjoyed the toy before she understood the concept of shape-sorting). I have since bought this as gift for two more kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the crinkly noises","review":"My baby loves the crinkly noise that the flap makes and the different sounds made by the shapes. Nice soft toy by a trusted company.

The shapes have different noises/textures, so it keeps them interested. There are variable levels of interaction - when he was little, he just wanted to shake the shapes to hear the noise. Now that he's older, he likes filling it up and dumping them out. It's a great toy that will provide your child variable interaction as they grow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for older babies","review":"I love this toy, but my daughter (9 months old) is not quite ready for it yet. She plays with the pieces (the triangle, square, etc.), but she can't yet figure out how to put the pieces into the box. I love how soft the whole toy is though and I know that she will enjoy learning the shapes and colors once she is a bit older."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have bought a plastic version","review":"The problem with this product is that a baby can just stuff the shapes into the wrong slots as they are soft. It does not hold them back the way a plastic version would, so how are they supposed to learn their shapes? Also, the lid on the top is very prominent, so my son either puts the shapes in through that way, or just stuffs them through the wrong hole. Plus, the shapes are big so that they fill up the inside quickly, making it hard to fit them in all together (even when going through the correct hole). At first I thought that when he got older he would use it properly, but now my son is 15 months and I just don't see that happening. The fabric is nicely sewed and vibrant, however. It was nice to roll the shapes and shake them when he was younger, but now it is useless to me and I will have to buy a plastic one. Wish I knew this before, now it is another toy lying around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality and functionality at an affordable price","review":"The HP 5110 is a terrific all-in-one, far superior to the HP 710 that it replaced.

Less than a year later, however, the cartridge jammed to the right of the machine and quit working. We had a warranty at that time, so we turned it in and ended up with a refurbished one. Now it is less than a year later and the machine has the same problem with the cartridge stopping on the right. I am a home school mother, and it is important for me to print papers up on demand. It is a very big inconvenience for me to lose a printer and not be able to print work out. The last HP printer we had did not do this in all of the years we had it. I am very disappointed in this printer and would think that HP would have fixed this problem long ago. I wonder if I will even get a credit toward another printer for all of this inconvenience, but honestly I doubt it.

The problem is that,one nice day when I turned it on to make a copy, the digital panel displayed the message \\"Open door, carriage jam\\", from then on, this Hp OfficeJet unit is no longer usable. What a waste of money $200 for less 6 months of use. I bought laserjet IIIp in 92 and it is still working fine.

As of this model, not even the hardware is good anymore.Even before it died hard with the notorious Carriage Jam failure, it would frequently and randomly stop jobs without warning. Getting it to work again required not only a power-cycle and reconnet, but often a complete software reinstallation.Never could get it to work reliably as a shared or network printer using HP's own drivers, but finally found a Gutenprint 5 solution that worked for about two months before the hardware itself died.I was the last person in my family to have a good feeling about HP printers, and that includes my brother-in-law who works for HP.

I took her out a few months ago, and have nothing but Paper jams, loud painful noises and error messages. I went to the HP website and walked myself through some of the fixes ; however after about a total 200 pieces of paper that have been successfully printed on, I have the \\"CARRIAGE JAM\\" error that everyone is complaining about. The printer/copier/scanner is completely USELESS! This machine costs over 200.00 and if I calculate it correctly only worked for a total of about 7 months straight.

I just love it and I'm glad that I made the small investment, this will last me for a long time.One thing that may bother some....it does stain and I would not recommend bleaching (bleach eats away fabric fibers just a little and cheesecloth is already so loosely woven I'm afraid it would just fall apart).

RR Preschool is also out of this world!By the way, my second child has apraxia and couldn't talk AT ALL until the age of 4.

I sit and do it with her, but she can also now do some of the games herself....coloring, bubble game, flashlight game. And she has only had it a short while.

It also explains how to maximize \\"comps\\" (complimentaries) with very easy to understand recommendations.Frank writes clearly and with personality, explaining everything in a manner that came across with sincerity and authority.

Yet here he is recommending giving up 5 of those before even considering placing a bet. I wonder if this is the \\"Golden Touch\\" they speak of...having you hold your bets until a hand is almost over.As like so many other Scoblete craps books, it is long on unverifiable claims and short on beneficial advice.

One of them is dice control and he tells you just what you have to do.He also has an excellent chapter on the Captain, the man who gave Scoblete so much food for thought, and we readers so much information on how to really get the edge at a game such as craps.Now I am going to learn the Golden Touch Craps dice control method and I should be on my way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scoblete's Best Book Yet!","review":"If you are the least bit serious about craps, this is the best book I've ever read on the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Ever","review":"This book was very informative and insightful.

Someone once said that true genius was recognizing the obvious about reality that no one had ever recognized before. Scoblete has done this. If you like to play craps, and have a modicum of intelligence, his insights and observations should be a revelation. Get this book before you place your next craps bet!

This book is obviously a negative critique of the policies of George W. Bush, but it also serves as a dire warning.

If, after reading it, you can still justify placing a vote for this ticket, then this country has more to fear than mere terrorists. In fact, the true terrorists bent on destroying what makes this country great are already ensconced in the White House. John Dean merely presents the facts in a very logical, easy-to-read format. I just hope more Americans will read this before it's too late!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the bunch","review":"Of the myriad books about the Bush administration, this one is certainly among the creme de la creme. This is not a screed by a reporter, pundit or \\"commentator\\" (although those can be fun too). Dean knows his way around Washington, and the White House, and indeed, around Republican presidential administrations, from personal experience. Dean's writing is engaging and effective, both because he pulls no punches, which is refreshing and rare, but also because he succeeds in large part in making the world of the Washington insider accessible to the general public. I believe that this book, unlike many others, will be persuasive even to those who are not already inclined to think as Dean does. I certainly think that, if you are looking for a book to give some perspective on the current presidential administration, you can do no better than to begin here."},{"rating":"1","title":"As bad as Watergate?...maybe","review":"As an idea, comparing Bush's presidency to the presidency of Nixon, its an intriguing theory. Dean offers an interesting perspective of the secrecy surrounding the White House.However, he doesn't offer much proof. Its more in line with the reasoning the Bush admin has stating there are WMDs in Iraq, although there is no convincing supporting evidence of it. The end result is a book where it reinforces your beliefs going in--if you don't like Bush, you'll love it, if you do you'll notice its flaws. (For the record, I dont like Bush, but I cant support the book as flimsy as this)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overblown with iccuracies","review":"This book was a waste of my time.

As retribution, Dean has criticized Republicans every chance he gets, even during the Clinton impeachment hearings. So you have to take this book with a grain of salt. If you're a Democrat, you'll like this book. If you're a Republican, you won't like it. If you're an independent, do your own research. Or you can be like most people and believe everything you see in print."},{"rating":"2","title":"BIGGER THAN WATERGATE","review":"Watergate, in essence, was about a third-rate burgulary. It was about one political party spying on another. Who cares about that? The real crime was the coverup, perjury, hush money, et. etc. As this book so clearly demonstrates, the crimes of the Bush Administration are far more serious than anything the Nixon Administration did. The most important responsiblity a president has is to decide on whether or not to take us to war. And George W. Bush took us to war based on very flimsy evidence and outright lies. He took us to war because he wanted to. Clinton lied about sex. Nixon lied about a burgulary. Warren Harding lied about a land deal. No charge is more serious than the one currently before the Bush Administration. As a direct result of Bush Administration lies, Nearly 700 of our bravest and finest are dead with no end in sight. Countless innocent Iraqi men, women, and children are also dead. Impeachment proceedings should begin now."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Little Tidbit on John Dean","review":"I am responding to [those] who don't think much of John Dean. This I heard on NPR Radio:During the Senate Watergate hearings, There was a glitch in the recording system so that all the testimony of one day was lost. One of the Senators asked if anyone could fill them in. Mr. Dean raised his hand and said, \\"I could.\\" As he talked, the senators gradually realized that what they were hearing was not Mr. Dean's version, nor a synopsis, but the Actual words that the witnesses had said - yes, John Dean had/has a perfect memory, and was playing back the exact testimony out of his head. Thus when he testified later, his testimony carried immense weight with the Senators.I'm with the Senators, and the folks that are saying John Dean knows exactly what he is talking about, and when he talks, we should listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liars","review":"I found the book informative, well written, and further corroboration of what we all know: Bush/Cheney are out and out crooks (and both convicted criminals).

Similar posts are made to usenet by neocons who didn't see Michael Moore's stunning F 9/11, but feel thay have the knowledge to judge it.I hope enough Amricans realize just how bad this guy is and boot him out of the White House, as he clearly deserves."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful book by an insider of DC politics","review":"Great book. The author really lets you known what's going on and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very intriguing","review":"This book is shocking and intriguing at best. This is a devastating assessment of the Bush Administration and how much worse things can (or will) be for them should Democrats willing to seek the truth on behalf of the American public, gain control of both houses of Congress. That is all it would take to begin impeachment proceedings against our leaders. It is startling to see how much these men could be guilty of. Indeed, Watergate is nothing compared to the level of corruption this White House, according to Dean, has engaged in. If you're tired of the way media presents the news, glossing over our leaders, making them look better and more principled than they appear to be, then this is definitely a book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST-READ!","review":"This is a real eye-opener, filled with facts and giving clear evidence as to why G.W.Bush must be impeached.

I'll have to buy an AC adapter at Radio Shack if I want to use the speakers without a PC/USB available, but since I bought these primarily for use at work, it's not a big issue.

Just throw in in your luggage, plug into your mp3 player in the hotel room, and adjust the volume.

Not to mention the crowd of about 100 extras (not very convincingly positioned to resemble a sellout crowd), looked and sounded about as axcited as if he had just drawn an intentional walk.

The music in this movie is terrible, and I was cringed while I listened to it. This movie does not resemble baseball. Superstar athletes are inspired by others, but definately not to the point of this movie's main character. What bothered me the most was really a, if you think about it, an embarassment to Braves fans and baseball fans. In the last game of the season, when the player hits HR #62 you barely see the ball go over the fence. You could see empty seats all over. In addition, if the Braves won they would enter the playoffs. In real baseball, all 30 teams would have packed stadiums filled, with the probable exception of Montreal. This is the worst sports movie EVER. The romance is tolerable, but these newlyweds seem to hate each other. The wife doesn't want her own HUSBAND to see her. Doesn't sound like love to me.

I have seen them live many times going back to the late 60's. I have all their vinyl albums and an almost complete set of singles.(Complete as far as I know). When their stuff came out on CD in the 80's I bought the DUNHILL Records CD's :Greatest Hits Volume one and Volume two. They were very good (At least I thought so at the time.)This set is much much better. Not only is it much more inclusive but the sound quality is far better. More open sounding, cleaner.I looked in my BILLBOARD book of top 40 hits. The Grass Roots hit the top 40 fouteen times, and all the hits are here.I recommend this set to any Grass Roots fan or anyone who really wants to hear what 60's pop beyond the Beatles was all about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun in spades!","review":"Great collection (including both CDs) if you love the fun rollicking sound of rockabilly! Rhino has selected a great number of rockabilly hits from early years to mid-80s, and they are all enjoyable...and they even include occasional snippets of commercials from the 50s. It's great for both rowdy parties with beer and thorough housecleaning with Lysol. The notes are also quite thorough to provide insight into the history & artists of rockabilly. Do wish they had the Cramps on the set, but they DO have the Blasters on the 2nd CD.

This CD gives us her first two albums from 1961 and 1962. These contain collections of classic folk songs and Judy does a very good job of singing them (as you would expect). These albums are certainly the beginning of her career and they show the beauty of her voice but also the need for her to stretch beyond the standard folk songbook. It was after these wonderful albums that she began to add the new songs of her contemporaries and in doing so, she added strength and conviction to her recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"useful guide","review":"Thomas Bien provides an accessible, useful guide to using mindfulness in therapy that will be helpful for novice, as well as seasoned, clinicians.

The bookwas not very family friendly. A lot of the material reviewed was common knowledge. The only highlights were the web sites and phone numbers for stores that specialize in storage space. The book was not very practical. How many people in real life are going to hire an expert to help with organizing our homes?I think that this author may have insight on how to help with basic organization. However, if you are a mother who needs advise on how to manage organizing your house while working, cooking, cleaning and spending time with your family I would pass on this one. Unless of course you want to hire an expert to remodel your kitchen for 22,000 dollars. (This was one of the options for organizing your kitchen.) I just need help on how to keep my kitchen drawers clean!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"This book reads as a 280 page advertisement for various online organizing and storage retailers. They also throw in such helpful hints such as: fold your clean towels before putting them in the linen closet and keep a pad and paper next to the phone for messages. I finished the book mostly for the amusement factor. I still don't know what they intended by their suggestion that we store our HAIR in the cabinet under the bathroom sink! Don't waste your time or money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who doesn't already know this stuff?","review":"There isn't much in this book that benefits real people. It reads like a catalog for online resources and household items (\\"Yes, this stuff really works as advertised!\\"). It also leans heavily toward people who are building their homes from the ground up. The rest is just obvious common sense (\\"if two people are sharing a dresser, each person should have his or her own drawers\\"). The only somewhat redeeming chapter is \\"Taking Charge of Your Day\\", which attempts to help maximize time spent during the day through priortization. Again, mostly common sense advice which served more as a reminder of what I already knew than an original, concrete approach. Overall, I learned more from my mom growing up than I did from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a joke!","review":"What a waste of money! Too bad I didn't come to Amazon first to read other customer's reviews before buying this book. The author spends too much of the book discussing what furniture and appliances to buy. If I'm like most people who would pick us this book, we just want to know how to organzie the things we already own. For example, the entire chapter on organizing the laundry room is about what type of washer/dryer to buy and how to wash your clothes properly. Nothing at all about organization! I didn't learn one new thing, but it will make a nice donation to our school's annual book sale/fundraiser."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unintended motivation","review":"Tho it probably was not the author's intention he gets you in the mood of throwing junk out with this book being the first item.

The Author, Stan Byrdy, is a local historian and broadcaster, and an Augusta insider! This is an oversized, coffee table, book. It provides amazing historical information and Masters stories, but the best thing about it is the vintage photographs of each of The National's original holes. The book also has yardage-book-style drawings of each original hole (circa 1934), and the modern-day hole -- so you can make side-by-side comaprisons of how each hole has changed over time. The complete architectural history of each hole is also provided!This is a very important book for the golf fan, and a must-have for everyone interested in the Masters, or the Augusta National Golf Club, Bobby Jones, and Alister MacKenzie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this one","review":"I started taking lessons about a month ago and right away my instructor insisted I get a new chanter. This chanter did help me figure out how to play the nine notes and grace note scale but it sounds funny when played along side a better quality chanter. It also has some defects tht my instructor pointed out. The top three holes are not lined up making it difficult to play at times. I have recently replaced it with a Dunbar chanter sold by \\"Universe of Bagpipes\\" for a kit price of $99. That $20 extra is worth spending on a quality chanter unlike my self who now spent $178. $79 of which was wasted on the Caledonia chanter kit. Other quality chanters for a fair price are Naill and Gibson plus others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some great 60s' fun rock tunes.","review":"About the only thing I didn't like about this CD was the title.

He created a truly memorable character and has a rare gift for language. Unfortunately, those qualities don't always make for a good novel; that's certainly the case here. It's frustrating that Parry places his hero in a bizarre, over-complicated plot when the Civil War provides such rich ground to draw from. The opening chapter is excellent; wryly grotesque and involving, but things collapse after that. Too many plot threads, too many contrived situations, too little connection to history. The low point for this series so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the usual palate","review":"A wonderful read, as always, shedding new light on our tragic national conflict.

I have no friends or family that have been adopted, or adopted a child. This book was recommended by someone close to me who has worked with the author. I have to say, that I had nightmares after reading some parts of this book. The raw emotion and honesty brought forth, revealed to me the insensitivity and cruelness that this young girl had to endure. Kasey offers hope of healing in her story, I hope that others who have been in her situation can find strength and personal restoration as she has."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Read","review":"Both the book and the courage it took for Kasey Hamner to write this book is incredible. No matter your position in the adoption triad you will benefit from her life story. Wheter you can relate to all of her pain and struggles or just some of them, you will better understand what it means to be an adoptee. I highly recommend this book to everyone involved in adoption!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book for anyone touched by adoption","review":"As an adoptee, I could relate to Kasey Hamner's book in very many ways. I almost felt like I had written it in some parts. Knowing that she went through the same events/issues that I did was comforting, especially the fact that she conquered them and is a healthy, productive citizen. Too many people only view adoption as a wonderful thing, something that every infertile couple (or fertile) should do. But have they ever asked an adoptee or read any of the books? I'm not saying that adoption is a bad thing, but for those of us whose birth mothers were forced by societal influences,or by family to give us up, there can be terrible results.I wish that everyone who knows an adoptee could read this book, especially adoptees who have reunited with birth family members, as I have. No one really understands unless they have been through it. It is a frightening and wonderful experience. Read this book and find out what it was like for her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting! A \\"must read\\" for anyone touched by adoption","review":"Could not put it down! Read it cover to cover in two sittings. Kasey Hamner has \\"gone where no one has gone before\\" with this refreshingly honest autobiographical account of her life as an adoptee from relinquishment to reunion and beyond. Her candor and highly readable writing style are impressive, and she manages to touch all the issues that we adoptees seem to share in common.Although it is hard to disaggregate issues that stem from being adopted vs. issues that result from growing up in a dysfunctional family, Hamner continually reminds us of the core emotional experiences of the genealogically bewildered adoptee: depression; anxiety; fear; anger; guilt; and ubiquitous problems with relationships, intimacy, and trust.I highly recommend this book to anyone touched by adoption, as well as to teachers, therapists, and pediatricians."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful","review":"As an adoptee I felt so much for the author, her strength is unbelievable.

Not so here, though. Peck & Sachet depict modern Turkey and its imperial predecessors in exquisite detail, weaving modern realities and the rich desiderata of history into a surprisingly enchanting narrative.

I have 5 children and have always taught them basic baby sign language to help them communicate before they could speak. I have always used the Baby Signs board books which I think are great. My youngest child is 22 months old and was just diagnosed with speech apraxia. Although he knew basic signs from the board books, his speech therapist gave me the first set of these cards to expand his signing skills. I bougth a $2 photo album from Wal-Mart and put the cards in the photo sleeves in order to protect them (they are a bit flimsy, unlike the board books) and my son loves to carry around his \\"book.\\" I would recommend this product to any mom or dad that wants to teach their baby useable signs. Signing with your baby is fun and it is a great step in teaching your child how to learn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Money","review":"These cards are great for learning basic signs with your kids.

It was very difficult to get it to take any cards, and then it only took cards from one side. I sent it back and got a replacement. That didn't work either. The top part between the stacks of cards was not attached and it appears there was a flaw either in the design or the one I got so that the pegs to go through the holes in the base to hold the top part on were not long enough or deep enough. I returned the second for a refund and bought one at a local store instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY Poor Quality","review":"I purchased this card shuffler to replace one of a similar design that I had owned for years. However, this card shuffler was far below my expectations. Upon opening, the gear mechanism was loose and could be shifted around in the case, even underneath the card platform. The first time I tried to use the shuffler, a spring supporting the shuffle button flew out onto the ground, rendering the card shuffler useless. Luckily, Amazon's offering me a refund.In sum, don't waste your time on this shuffler, it just made of terrible quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"card shuffler","review":"This shuffler is poor quality!

The politics, economics and dynamics of the Berlin Blockade and Airlift are clarified with out the feel of a textbok. All together, it is quite enjoyable reading and filled with photographs and accounts of the actual people involved.

In my opinion, this is the Dead Kennedys' best album. In God We Trust, Inc. Is OK, but the real treat here is the first 14 tracks- the original Plastic Surgery Disasters.This is one of those great albums you can listen all the way through without hearing a bad song. The opener (not including the intro) is Government Flu, which perfectly gets the listeners into that political mood. The 12 tracks after that are spread out well, including the classics Riot, Terminal Preppie, Moon Over Marin, and Buzzbomb (among others).Sure, you might as well buy the original CD of this if you can find it, but the music is great no matter which one you buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A band at the height of their powers","review":"Tried hardcore in 1981s In God,and a more eclectic betterproduced mix of styles (psd).In hindsight too many different styles to take all fans with them and lyrics much more wordy,moving already to Biafra spoken word rants.Moon over marin,buzzbomb,riot and government flu are still brilliant,as are Dog bite and Nazi punks and the Rawhide cover version would have been top 20 uk if they'd wanted the fame..............A pair of brave,experimental records pushing themselves to the limits"},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential for DK fans","review":"Sure, this ain't \\"FRESH FRUITS...\\", but it still makes a pretty damn fine hardcore album!

Jello Biafra's lyrics are as sharp as ever, and East Bay Ray's guitar hooks still stuck in to the head. Best songs here are 2Terminal Preppie\\", \\"Buzzbomb\\", \\"Winnebago Warrior\\" and especially \\"Moon over Marin\\", where Ray's excellent surf guitar and Jello's apocalyptic lyrics make it an instant Dead Kennedys classic.

Almost all of the lyrics were written by him, and the instrumental quality of the rest of the band is, well, not the selling point.

Effie Leland Wilder says that she was well suited for being a wife and mother. I'm sure she was great, but I wonder what exceptionally delightful literary works she might have written if she would have started her writing career a little earlier. Written in a journal format that is easy to read and understand, this book will keepyou laughing. I found that I didn't want to put it down.

It still has good actors, even if a few small rolls are not oscar-worthy. When it was over, my girls just could NOT stop raving. They claim it is the best movie they have ever seen.

I don't find anything touching or funny, other than the actors try to sound smart. The plot is somewhat confusing intentionally set up by the writer who may think this is smart.

Can you say cronyism... Also, the jokes and lines are corny. More thought could have been put into the script. Then there's the plot... where's the climax? and they could have made it clear that she was or wasn't sleeping with both of these two men at the same time. If so, I think it's kind of inappropriate for such a PG film. Lastly, the characters are Ugly! Even Alyssa Milano is losing that charm (no pun intended) she once had...maybe it's just age.Sorry, but I laughed and shook my head at the overall quality of this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"REALLY BAD movie","review":"I am really surprised that anyone else liked this movie. I LOVE romantic comedies, and I did not enjoy this movie at all. The story could be believable but is not because of how it is written and directed. It's clear from the very beginning who she is going to choose, and it is never clear why she is even interested in the other guy. The movie spends hardly any time on that relationship. There is no chemistry between Alysa Milano and either of the male leads, which makes it even less interesting. The acting is flat as can be. I had never noticed that Alysa Milano had a kind of annoying voice and was fairly one dimensional in her acting, but there was so little else to focus on, I ended up focusing on that. Finally, the movie was not funny to me. I can laugh at almost anything, and there was really not much to laugh at.One thing I did like about the movie was the opening credits.

This movie is bad.","review":"This is one of the most boring, poorly acted movies I've ever seen.

It doesn't need nudity or sex, it needs more compelling characters. The female character is particularly annoying to me -- the only time she seems special enough to warrant attention of two presumably great males is in the first two cafe scenes. Most all the acting comes across to me as weak, unconvincing. I pushed all the way through thinking it will liven up, but it never does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising!","review":"The conversations were clever and the characters were lovable. I watched this the first time on Netflix and wasn't expecting anything special since I had never heard about it in the theaters. It turned out to be the best romantic comedy I have seen in a long while. I also loved that it wasn't full of bad language and I could watch it with my 5 year old playing in the room. I'm definitely buying this when it comes out. Ditto to the other reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, Clean Fun!!","review":"This was cute!! So enjoyable and completely different from the typical raunchy romantic comedies that seem so popular today. This goes to show that you don't need nudity/sexual innuendos, bad language and crude behavior (although some are noteworthy) to make a movie enjoyable. The best thing is that i can recommend this to friends with young impressionable teens knowing they won't cringe while watching it with them. This movie was sweet, the characters likeable, the plot totally predictable, like from the first 5 minutes, but you're stuck with a goofy smile throughout regardless. Low budget through and through and totally worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the effort","review":"this movie made absolutely no sense, there were very few funny or even relevant parts....very disappointed, i bought this because of Alyssa Milano, and she wasnt even worth watching in this film, again, VERY disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute movie","review":"This is a cute movie with a great cast.

Steve Swallow, one of the world's great jazz bassists, together with nonpareil singer Sheila Jordan and an allstar ensemble including pianists Steve Kuhn and Lyle Mays, has set a series of Robert Creeley poems to music. But...it isn't a stiff exercise. It COOKS! The songs swing hard, but leave ample room for appreciation of Creeley's brilliant words: these songs are sad and funny, ironic and sincere, and very human. Swallow's compositions are brilliant and gorgeously played. This is one of my favorite records, and one of ECM's hidden gems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks for validating my feelings","review":"Loved the book. It was great to just have all the things I have been feeling by being with a widower to be validated. Had no idea the emotional rollercoaster that exists with being with a widower and its great to see that everyone experiences a lot of the same feelings. Thank you so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Woman's Journey As the Wife of a Widower","review":"This book was well written and very insightful. I would reccomend it to anyone who is about to embark on such a journey as this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read!","review":"I found that all my WOW issues & concerns were raised in Julie Donner Andersen's book plus things I hadn't even thought about. After reading the book, I felt the world had been lifted off my shoulders! I was reassured that my feelings about being a WOW were normal. What a relief! 'Past Perfect Present Tense' helped save my relationship & my sanity. Thank you Julie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Offensive!","review":"I am a young widow and I was deeply offended by this book. One suggestion written was to \\"accidentally\\" break the Christmas decorations belonging to the deceased wife, so that the widower could no longer use them. I am so glad that I borrowed this book from the library instead of putting money into this \\"author's\\" pocket. She's no author. All she did was combine stories written by other widow/ers that were posted on online chat groups. Did you receive permission for all those excerpts Ms. Andersen? This women has also been sending emails asking everyone to write a favorable review for her book, especially since her feedback on eBay has turned sour. Can you say \\"trolling for feedback\\"? This book is nonsense and Ms. Andersen simply doesn't have a clue about understanding widows or widowers."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have $... to waste...","review":"Send it to a therapy fund for the spouse or step-children of a WOW who employs Ms. Anderson's tactics. They will surely need it if they are subjected to a \\"WOW\\" who follows her lead.In Ms. Anderson's \\"extensive research,\\" she apparently learned nothing about compassion, understanding, and giving of one's self to soothe the sorrow of someone they love who became unmarried by death and not by choice. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank You Julie! It's good to know I'm not alone!","review":"I am a young woman dating a wonderful man... who happens to be widowed... and have two beautiful children from the relationship. Because of my age and circle of friends, I don't know any WOWs (women/wives of widowers). This book was very helpful to me. When people were saying, \\"why isn't he over it\\" and \\"it's not been enough time\\" it made me angry. I didn't know that my feelings were very par for the course. For all of you dating widowers, it is a challenge and a there will be many obstacles in your path. But if you are willing to work through them, BE PATIENT, and most definitely read this book-your difficulties will be well worth the wait. I hope that I am as lucky to marry this man as Julie was to marry her husband. Thank you Julie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good place to start","review":"I read this book three years ago and I have referred to it often. While it may not be the end all on the subject or the most sophisticated, it is certainly an excellent place to start. If for no other reason than to validate certain feelings you may be having as you negotiate the often difficult terrain of dating and then marrying a widower. If you are dating or considering marrying a widower, I would strongly suggest reading up on the subject. No matter how smart and evolved you may think you are, there are certainly new issues which arise that one simply cannot fathom in advance despite a well developed imagination. Those issues are in no way the same issues that arise in relationships with never married men or divorced men."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!!!","review":"I have been a WOW for 11 years now. I HIGHLY recommend this book to allprospective WOWS to be. The author really captures what it is truly like tobe the WOW. I know she touches alot of people's sensitive sides because sometimeswe don't want to hear the truth. She tells not only what difficulties she went through, but also the pain her husband went through. These are men we love and just because they have loved once doesn't mean they will never love again. I know myhusband LOVES his late wife, and yes he LOVES me also and if by some chance I should leave this world he may LOVE somebody again. The only regret I have is not having had this available to me 11 years ago. My husband is now reading this bookand said for the portion he has read it is pretty sraight forward to his feelingshaving become a widower at a young age with two AWESOME kids!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer, beware!","review":"This'book'is merely a collection other womens' experiences, strung together with her own uninformed, judgemental and patronising 'words of wisdom'. She portrays herself as a mother earth, appealing to vulnerable women in relationships with Widowers, as hers is virtually the only reading material available. Her only qualification appears to be having married a widower following her failed first marriage. Woopy Do! Not a good reason to buy it though and like the other reviewer, I wonder if Mrs DA seeks the permission of those who have shared there innermost thoughts with her via her blog, before publishing her own take on them! The tag line for the author 'helping wives and girlfriends of widowers since 1997' - helping them to what one might ask!! Get thoroughly depressed reading this sanctimonious claptrap one might venture. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"An absolute Godsend!","review":"This book is a Godsend for anyone contemplating a relationship with a widower, or already in a relationship with someone who has previously lost their partner. The author writes with the compassion and understanding of someone who has been there. She has thought of every type of situation and often complicated scenarios that arise, which can be difficult to handle.This book is like a guidebook to help you ease your way through these obstacles, providing invaluable advice and finding solutions to help resolve sensitive issues. The chapters cover ethics and protocol and the author pays meticulous attention to details and issues that can often be overlooked.I think that the review from \\"book critic\\" must have been submitted by someone with a personal vendetta against Julie Donner Andersen. Maybe a poor writer who hasn't achieved such great success as Ms Andersen?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Author's Insight or author's own monster?","review":"PAST: PERFECT! PRESENT: TENSE!: Insights From One Woman's Journey As The Wife Of A WidowerThere was nothing in this book that helped me as the wife of a widower to work through the early anxieties I was going through.It is not a book of practical advice which allows the reader to see her own situation or plan her own way forward. I think this is what this kind of book should be about.Although this book was written from the heart with intentions to help, there was too much of the author's own anxieties in it that made me think it was written as a way of releasing her own emotions. Insights is probably a good indication of the contents as it really is only insights and nothing more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cold Hearted Woman-","review":"What a waste of Money& a load of diatribe. This woman has no substance to her at all.Hope she never experiences the devastation of loosing a spouse.Then again I have seen many nice widowed Men ending up with her ilk. What a shame. Pure & utter rubbish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!!!","review":"As a girlfriend and now fiance of a widower finding this book has been like winning the lottery. For months I had struggled with feelings of low self esteem and insecurites that come with dating a widower and wondering if you will ever come to terms with the presence of a late wife. Julie's book has been so helpful in many ways but mainly I realized I wasn't alone, crazy or anything but plain normal. This book will help women who date and marry a widower find ways to communicate her feelings and have a lasting wonderful relationship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suggestions lean toward disrespect","review":"I read this book after it was promoted on a widow message board of which I am a member. As a widow with lots of widowed friends, I thought the author showed a lack of respect for deceased spouses, which shows a lack of respect for the husbands too. One of the saddest examples was when she says that WOWs should \\"accidently\\" break the late wife's Christmas ornaments so they won't be able to be used. Is destroying the husband's memories really necessary? She also uses the term \\"get over it\\", which is very hurtful to bereaved persons. Julie Anderson would be considered a DGI by my friends...she just \\"doesn't get it\\". Maybe her advice will help other WOWs, but I don't see any benefit for their husbands or stepchildren to have this kind of uncaring attitude in their lives. She makes me wonder why she married a widower if its such a struggle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sutton- Man's Man, Lady's Dream","review":"This is the best book I have read in years. I fell in love with Sutton, but what woman wouldn't? He is the quintessential storyteller- you are right there with him, weather he is swimming with dolphins or in a murky European sex den, he really tells it like it is.Morgan has an intellectual's vocabulary and an enlightened point of view. This is really a subtle love story told through centuries, and is insightful and endearing. Though this is a complex web of hundreds of years of life, lies, murder, love and death- for anyone who has lost a lover, or lost a loved one- this book will give you a 'warmth in knowing'. You may be surprised to find answers you didn't know you were looking for, and ideas you never considered, in the middle of all the murder and chaos! I was.I can't wait to read The Sorcerer's Promise.This would make a great movie!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reissue!

Anyone who doesn't like this band learned their taste from MTV, God love 'em."},{"rating":"2","title":"PEEK-A-BOO!","review":"I love NRBQ for their sense of humor, their refusal to be pigeonholed within a specific genre, and most of all for their extraordinary musicianship. I've seen them play twice and I can tell you they are a GREAT live act. Along the way, they've also happened to record some terrific tracks. Some of the highlights from their first 20 years are collected on PEEK-A-BOO. Personally, I would have chosen the version of \\"Get Rhythm\\" from GROOVES IN ORBIT and \\"It Comes To Me Naturally\\" from DIGGIN' UNCLE Q (both of which kick up a real storm) but that's a minor complaint. As an overall view of NRBQ's career, it's a terrific collection. All the \\"favorites\\" are here (eg.- \\"Me And The Boys\\", \\"I Got A Rocket In My Pocket\\", \\"Riding In My Car\\", and others) and every one of their albums up to that point is represented as far as I can tell. I have them all on vinyl, but PEEK-A-BOO is just the thing when I need a quick fix of the only group I've ever felt comfortable calling \\"my favorite band\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"This collection truly personifies the band","review":"Really good mix. If there is one NRBQ release to buy, this is it. The best of a great alternative band from when alternative meant something."},{"rating":"2","title":"...heavy on the heavy, lite on the quirky...","review":"An essential item for any legit, music collection. Love the band...but the novelty-quirky songs never really appealed to me('Girl Scout Cookies, 'Puddin' Truck, ect). thankfully this collection trimmed away most of the corniness, and just laid on the great songs and nasty/tasty playing...great music.

Avoid at all cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful, poignant, beautiful","review":"There is no point in saying which is the \\"best\\" Phil Ochs album. Personally, I enjoy listening to his acoustic solo albums and his highly arranged pop-rock recordings as well. But this recording of a live concert in Vancouver is highly recommended, both to intense Ochs fans as well as others just discovering him.I've been listening to music for nearly 50 years (ever since I was a young tyke digging Elvis) and IMO Phil Ochs had one of the most beautiful and haunting voices of any singer ever, in any genre. In this live concert, the beauty of his voice is still present but you can also hear the anger as his early idealism was becoming embittered. Many people think of Phil Ochs as primarily a \\"protest singer\\" but he was also a poet of the human soul, including of his own tormented soul. During this concert, you hear a good range of his more personal as well as his political works. All sung and played in straight-ahead, unadorned fashion."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best representation of Phil Ochs","review":"It has to be said; Phil Ochs' aspirations exceeded his talents. He was good, but Bob Dylan he wasn't. For that matter, Tim Buckley and Arthur Lee wrote circles around Ochs whenever he'd try to wax poetic. But he still left several songs that stand with the best of the Sixties and this live album catches him at his solo best. His greatest song, \\"Crucifixion,\\" is given here in a chilling rendition that reeks of sorrow and rage; this was, after all, the year that Robert Kennedy joined his older brother as an assassin's victim. And so many others on here--\\"There But For Fortune,\\" \\"The Scorpion Departs But Never Returns\\" and the masterly \\"Pleasures Of The Harbor\\"--roll off Och's tongue with an ease and grace seldom displayed in his studio work. He was a troubled man with more than a few pretentions, but this album does prove that he was also a very powerful artist on several occasions."},{"rating":"2","title":"trying to keep the faith","review":"Having heard 'Phil Ochs in Concert' what jumped out at me is the contrastingly darker mood of Phil's verbal intros (set against the aftermath of 'the Chicago experience')and that he might not remember all the words to his songs. His spare guitar contrasts with studio versions with orchestral or rock backings and work to good effect. Appearing at a peace and poetry concert, the interspersed 'non originals' (Highwayman, the Bells) and his 'artier' songs play off against the straight political stuff. Highlight of the concerts are 'The Crucifixion', the intro and performance of 'I ain't a Marching anymore.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite there, at all","review":"Oh dear. A disheartening, disappointing album that should never have been released. Phil Ochs, obviously shattered by the events in Chicago, stumbles through his live show, rambles through his between-songs introductions, rarely making sense, and -- especially on the slower songs -- loses the tune entirely. Saved by a stunning version of \\"Another Age\\" that renders this song timeless (someone, quick -- cover that tune!)and an equally brilliant \\"The World Began in Eden and Ended in Los Angeles\\", but otherwise his version of \\"The Scorpio Departs But Never Returns\\" is distressing, and he absolutely murders \\"Changes\\", veering off-tune repeatedly. This could not have been a pretty sight, and Michael Ochs' observations on the concert are far, far off of the mark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best I've tried so far","review":"I love this product, much better than all the other products.

They are simply put, fantasy jewels for all ages. They remind me of Diana Wynne Jones at her peak. Don't hesitate, they are marvelous books for children or adults.

Not everybody especially those who hasn't heard her before is going to like it, her voice shows her age but still has that sensual quality about it. The guitar accompaniment is equally beautiful. Her rendition of La LLorona is absolutely haunting and dramatic. A wonderful experience, but should not be an introduction to Chavela Vargas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Her voice completely gone on this album.","review":"This CD is really only for collectors who want to hear this particular concert. However, be prepared, Chavela's wonderful voice is not to be found on this album. All the songs are familiar, but the voice isn't. Her voice cracks constantly, forcing her at times to speak the words rather than sing them and to remake the song to avoid the difficult notes. The crowd is boisterous too often calling out to her in the middle of a song-- which makes the CD hard even harder to listen to.You would not give this CD to introduce him to Chavela. There are much better albums for that: the hard to find \\"Volver, Volver\\" being the one that most springs to mind. As I mentioned previously, this CD is only for collectors who feel they must have every last album of hers.

She has the ability to paint pictures in your mind that you never forget. Stag may have offered the listener a new group of songs to learn, but with the exception of Johnny Rottentail, I understood only a word here and there of the cuts that followed. The engineer pushed the instruments to the edge of distortion and the vocal line was the loser. This album could have benefited from an included text but it was not there. I will keep Stag for the cool cover photo, but I am sorry to have missed so many of Amy's songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Disappointment","review":"This album is a real disappointment.

And, after seeing the Butchies open for IG once (and not being impressed in the least with them), I was also wary. Nonetheless, I bought it; knowing that, in fact, this is NOT an Indigo Girls or Butchies album.With that in mind, I found the CD to be an interesting mix of Amy's styles and causes. The Butchies actually mesh pretty well with Amy's voice and the end result gets at least a B+ or A-."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stag a fork in me I'm impressed!!","review":"I've been a fan of Amy Ray and the Indigo Girls since the begining. It caught me by suprise when Amy sucessfully branched out. From the minute I heard the first Hoot n' Hollerin' strains of \\"Johnny Rottentail\\" to the pounding ballad \\"On your Honor\\", I was hooked. Yes it did seem weird without Emily, but at the same it was captivting to hear Amy's talent showcased in this low-budget, fine, fine LP."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Solo Effort!","review":"If you're an Indigo Girl fan, you've come to recognize the Amy/Emily differences: Emily seems to be the softer touch, a bit more humorous, while Amy has the rough edge and seems to go flat-out non-stop. Those expectations play out on \\"Stag\\", and they do so without disappointment. Hold on through the weak point of the album, (disappointing because Joan Jett contributed but the tune isn't one of the better ones), and you'll be impressed by the end.Criticisms are similar to others here: Too short - yep, when the music's this good, you simply want more. The mix hides the vocals - partially true, but that might be due to the harder distorted-guitar sound than the engineer, either way the songs are still great. I'm just hoping this won't be the beginning of the breakup of the Indigo Girls... if I was Emily, I'd accuse Amy of holding out some of the good stuff from their collaborative recording efforts!"},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"Worst book I ever read.

Humans are portrayed in it as curious, rather unsympathetic creatures, whilst the dog at the center of his love, is romanticised despite the loving detail with which the author describes the bodily functions of the animal. I can understand though, its appeal to those with an obsession with their dog who find humans too argumentative, contrary or difficult. An instance of \\"horses for courses\\" so to speak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"The author's devotion to his pet, Tulip, and his determination to attend to her well-being were very touching. I also appreciated how he admitted to his mistakes in \\"dog-rearing.\\" However, it seemed to me that all he talked about were the dog's biological functions, be it elimination or the reproductive cycle. There's nothing wrong with the topics but they took up the entire book--in particular, he went on for chapters about the dog's heat cycles. I started flipping through the pages very quickly toward the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unpleasant albeit very well-written","review":"The book focuses on various earthy canine activities in somewhat off-putting detail but without really providing good insight into the character of the dog herself.Moreover, the author is irritating as he constantly deprecates other people for their class or appearance.On the other hand, the prose is superb; the sentences classically polished and balanced to a degree rarely seen today. But I felt this just made the contrast with the book's substance dispiriting.The book is primarily useful as a sort of a window into an earlier, more easygoing world - one before leash laws - and for that it may be of interest to some."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops, I'll pay closer attention next time.","review":"Beware!

I suspect Tulip would not have been amused ... and neither was I."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not a fan","review":"I read this book for an animal studies course I was in. I am also an avid animal lover who owns pets so I thought I would be able to relate to this book. Boy was I wrong. I did not like the parts where he described the whole dog mating and reproduction very in depth (like literally describing the parts). It's not that I was disgusted about it or anything, I just felt it unnecessary and not my thing. I also didn't like how he treated the dog in some parts and just irresponsibly dealt with the puppies. It's like he went through all this work so Tulip could get pregnant than just didn't care about her young. I was left thinking, what was the point? So she could experience mating and pregnancy once in her life? At the end I didn't get the point of the book, it felt like a waste of time to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hair-raising; not for dog lovers","review":"Well, a lot has been said about others about the grittiness of detail.

After going thru all sorts of misadventure trying to breed her, and watching the birth with fascination and tenderness, he immediately goes for a bucket to drown some pups because he's just realized that he can't have that many dogs in his apartment.

I found it to be offensive from cover to cover. This is a man who professes to love his dog, describing her genitalia in disturbingly rapsodic detail, and then decides to drown her puppies, because all he really wanted was for her to have sex.

I'm not sure, but it appears that the WAKA kickball is actually larger than 10 inches.The ball itself, however, has been perfect. It's much more durable than the WAKA ball.

The graphics are acceptable and the replay device let's you see what happened fairly well. Would have been nice to have a playbook or a function to see the diagrams larger and longer than in play calling mode. I play against the computer and allow the game to generate the action so I don't have to use all the keypad responses.

However, if your garden area is infested with nut-grass (Cyperus rotundus) you can forget about the method the author propounds. I covered my garden area not with newspaper but with cardboard boxes, broken down and laid flat. That was four months ago. The nut-grass wasn't even fazed; it punched right through the cardboard and the 4\\" of mulch on top of it like those impediments weren't even there.

These songs represent the Lords career as a whole and aside from the one Lords \\"mistake\\" (redoing Madonnas \\"Like a Virgin\\"...what were they thinking?) it is a fantastic view of \\"Goth\\" music in it's early days and is highly recommended to anyone out there who wants a peek into some great 80s tunes by a highly underrated band.

Luckily it had just got done raining so the lawn area to be aerated was pretty soaked. I have just a few small areas of my lawn that are really packed pretty tight. Rather then renting a commercial core aerator I thought I'd try the Yard Butler. It's not for aerating an entire lawn but for a small area it works great. I have a yard loaded with clay soil and every insertion of the Yard Butler kicked out a core. I do have one area that's sandy and after two or three insertions it plugged right up and was rather difficult to clear. From now on I'll stay away from the sandy area of my yard. I give this small handy manual aerator a B+."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does a good job","review":"I have a small area in my yard that always dries out and turns brown much sooner than the rest of my lawn. So instead of renting a commercial aerator, I used this product to aerate that area to see if it will help it retain moisture. The Yard Butler did a good job. It has been a wet spring in this area, so it was fairly easy to push the tubes into the soil. Occasionally, one of the tubes would get plugged up and I would have to use a screw driver to unplug it. But that was due to the stones and heavy clay in the soil I was aerating. It took me about 15 minutes to aerate a 200 sq. ft. area.Overall, the product seems very sturdy and I expect it will last for many years. If you are looking to aerate as small area, this will do the job for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage.","review":"Live in a creek bottom in central texas - soil is very silt-y and can get extremely compacted in high traffic areas. Figured this little guy would help uncompact the various dog trails around my yard.Totally useless. The \\"tines\\" on the end just fill with compacted soil, no cores ever come out the top. After cleaning out the tines, you get one, perhaps two presses into the ground before it just starts to bounce off unless you throw your entire weight on it and jump repeatedly.Of course, if you throw your weight on it repeatedly, like I did, you'll just bend the handles and the bar between the tines at the bottom.I ended up grabbing my pitchfork to finish the job, and hucked this thing in the garbage where it belongs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lawn Aerator","review":"Good product for a small lawn - much more effective and easier than using a garden fork on heavy soil."},{"rating":"2","title":"Labor-intensive, but flawless!!","review":"It's back-breaking work, but hey....great looking lawns always are!

It sheared in half after only 10 minutes of use. It's made of steel, but in at least two parts: the shaft is joined to the fork with a light solder. So unless you apply perfectly even downward pressure, the joint isn't going to hold. By the way, this isn't the first core aerator I've used. I borrowed my neighbor's for two seasons of heavy-duty use and had no problems. Wish he hadn't moved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Horizontal bar bent first time I used it.

I was able to bend it back and use it for another minute before it bent again. The tubes aren't even welded around the entire tube, only on two sides, hence the bending and eventually breaking. i returned it the first day.

Very easy to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aeration lawn tool works great!","review":"I had better luck using the tool after the ground was watered well. I live in Texas and just couldn't get this into the soil otherwise. It works great. It's a great alternative to paying Chemlawn to come out and aerate, which is ubber expensive. It is a workout. But, I weigh 105 lbs. and was able to do the yard no problem. I read too that some people were trying to clean out the tubes after each use. Don't bother, just keep using it, the soil pushes through and pops out the top. Love it. Good value for the price. I did shop at Lowes and Home Depot and was unable to find this in the stores for purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"so far so good","review":"used 3 times, yard needs to be moist. works pretty good. no complaints. gave it 4 out of 5 cause im one of those picky customers, and it pulls plugs out about 8 out of 10 times. my guess is its as good as any other quality aerator. i am satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I looked at every store I could think of, but could not find a core aerator at any of them. I recommend the core aerator over a spike version because it removes the plug and helps loosen compacted soil, which the spike version does not. After using the product just once so far, I have already noticed an improvement in the brown spots in my yard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works good","review":"I decided to try this product because it's concept made sense. Before I used it when I would water my lawn the water would soak in to the ground very little. Now the water soaks in much better and my grass is greener. Great product recommended if you have the time and energy. Yes the holes do get plugged up but I use a big bolt and a rubber mallot the clear the holes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, don't waste your money!","review":"There is one word that accurately describes the Yard Butler Coring Aerator: JUNKIf you add up the amount of time you'll spend unclogging this worthless tool, you'll find that you could have gotten a part time job paying minimum wage and would have earned enough money to go down to your local rental center to rent a real coring aerator that actually works (with plenty of cash left over for some slyders at White Castle). Seriously, I followed the directions exactly and watered thoroughly 2-3 days prior to aerating. It doesn't matter: Dry lawn, wet lawn, moist lawn, whatever - this thing clogs no matter what! Please learn from my mistake and don't waste your money or your time on this so called aerator. This thing suuuuuuucks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy, inexpensive and easy to use","review":"I needed an inexpensive way to aerate parts of my front lawn so the water wouldseep in the soil instead of running off into the gutter.

The water is now staying where it belongs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tool","review":"Works great and better than I expected, Used on a large area which took time to complete, but was willing to put in the time to save money. Now I have a great tool to continue to maintain my lawn and repair patches."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good product","review":"I dont care what people say. It always gets jammed and it takes a long time if you want to do it right. Unless your yard is 10 foot by 10 foot I would look for something else. I feel the concept is right but it gets frustrating when the tool gets jammed and your always trying to get the plug out. I am at this point looking for something different and gave this tool to my neighbor for helping me with some yard work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product-one of the best lawn tools I have","review":"This was a fine aerator, and I would recommend it to anyone. I have a front and backyard of about 1000 square feet total, and it took about 30 minutes to aerate the lawn as instructed. It can become a bit of a workout, but compared to the cost of a hiring a company to do this, it pays for itself the first time you use it.When used in conjunction with other lawn practices, watering, fertilizing, the use of this tool did improve the health and appearance of the lawn.The durable construction combined with the need to aerate once a year, should ensure this product will continue to be used for years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"Definately alot more work than a mechanical aerator, but it works as intended. A wide steel toe workboot fits on the platform and the padded handles work well for someone 6 feet tall. It doesn't take stomping, but rather just pushing body weight (195 lbs) onto the tool and it sinks flush to the ground.The paint / coating wears off quickly from the prongs, but I would expect that. You also need to clean out the prongs with a screwdriver or the dirt will harden and block the plugs in subsequent use.Don't plan on doing a big yard in one day. It is manual labor, so spreading the work out over several days/weeks is a suggestion for success."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great if it worked","review":"My Yard Butler core aerator broke the first time I used it. The metal is too weak to handle hard compacted soil, even if damp. Considering I bought this exclusively to use on hard compacted soil, I was a little disappointed. The vertical metal bar bent after only a few steps. It was still somewhat usable, but just barely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought even after reading bad reviews","review":"Core aerator works as expected. Hard work, physical labor. Most plugs cleared by stepping hard and fast. Sometimes,it took several steps. Using screwdriver to clear plugs compacted and made problem worse. Dowel or bamboo with hammer worked best. Its designed for staight up and down not leverage as a shovel. It became slicker with more use. Best after deep water the day before.

The next day, under the same conditions, the cores were not ejected. While it still made holes, without ejecting the core, it compacted the soil even more.

Only major problem. But when it finally starts it is the best thing in the world for your cold hands.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crummy Design - NOT Recommended","review":"Both the top heat shield and the burner head have no retention mechanisms beyond a slip fit so of course they slip off constantly. You can squeeze the sides of each of them together and get a tighter fit temporarily but before long it's loosened up again. Zippo should be ashamed to put out such a poorly designed product. In addition my burner head would not ignite even after putting some drops of fluid in the head and igniting the warmer, which would then flame merrily for about 30sec before going out. Also tried some gentle blowing to keep ignition going, but that failed as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it!","review":"Despite their claims, this handwarmer is mediocre at best. I bought two of them. One works for about an hour, the other quits after 2 to 3 hours. They never get very hot, despite using the best quality fuel.

I wish that I could get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"It goes cold when needed most.","review":"I got the handwarmer as a Christmas gift to help keep warm while fly fishing. Unfortunately it works great indoors but as soon as I'm outside it goes cold. I'm sure I've got it filled properly and that it's started. It's very warm before I put it in my pocket.

I bought this hand warmer & absolutly could not get it to light. We added one drop of fuel to the wick & filled the base until it was just starting to stay wet & it would light a flame, but not ignite the wool. Eventually I took the wick cap off and pulled the bottom \\"wick clip\\" and platinum wool out (on a paper towel & DO NOT breathing in fibers). The pad was 1/8 inch so I fluffed it up to 1/4 inch. I used tweezers and needle to tease and reinsert the wool/clip (not easy to put clip back). Now I light it (as said above) & it works like a charm. Please note: it DOES need some air flow or it wont stay hot... any of these will vary in temp as they starve for air. If you overfill, do not tip it or it may leak fluid. Also, in a dark room, you will see a \\"working\\" wick glow if you GENTLY blow on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"POOR QUALITY & SERVICE","review":"I purchased this item new and when I received it the top was loose which seems dangerous as it has petrol which is ignited as the source of heat.

And it tends to \\"flame\\" for no apparent reason, which leads me to conclude that the heating element has burned out. Both of my hand warmers have stopped working after only 3 - 4 uses.The manufacturers should market an appropriate lighter along with the hand warmer, and make it clear that a specialized lighter is needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mediocre product.","review":"The temperature of this heater varies from toasty warm to barely lukewarm for no apparent reason relating to fuel level or ambient temperature.

All in all this is not a dependable device."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the trouble","review":"I bought this hand-warmer to use during the cold Kansas winter when our infantry company was out for weeks at a time training. I found that when it was in a warm setting, indoors for example, it was hot to the touch, however, as soon as it was actually needed, it was useless.As soon as I got out in the cold, it was barely warmer than just putting my hands in my pockets, and only then, for a brief time. When I actually held it in my hands, it lost all its heat in a matter of seconds.I used premium fluid and followed the directions to the letter, measuring the fluid carefully. I'm quite sure it is working at its full potential, but it just doesn't get very warm when you need it most. I won't be bringing this out with me in the future. Waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"It just doesn't work","review":"The hand warmer was a very poor copy of the 'Peacock hand warmer'. Almost impossible to get it to work properly as the top keeps on pinging off. The catalyst element was in parts when it arrived and needed re-assembling but didn't want to stay in place.

This book has none. One cannot fathom the author's purpose other than to be an outlet for his thorough knowledge of economics and the current world economy. But knowledge and wisdom are two very different things. The author explains the pros and cons of capitalism over and over and always stops short of picking a side or point of view or reform. Generally he seems concerned about too much capitalism but you never know if this is real or just a necessary artifact to have something to imply beyond mere description. If you missed economics 101 in college or want a general review of the international economy maybe this book is for you. If you want a point of view on what's going in the world try MIlton Friedman's books for an explanation of free trade or Understanding The Difference Between Democrats And Republicans for a point of view on the politics of capitalism"},{"rating":"1","title":"He has GOT to be kidding!","review":"First, I agree that \\"Europeans spend more time with their mistresses\\" to be a ridiculous pseudo-fact.

Finally, Luttwak's claim that the organized crime movement is the key to Russia's salvation, as the yakuza saved Japan and the mafia saved Italy, was just too laughable for words. On the plus side, I do agree with Luttwak that this \\"turbo-charged capitalism\\" has led to an increase in the gap between the rich and poor.

BUT unless you have incredibly flexible hands, the design of the actual game box is dreadful. There is no comfortable way to hold it (even if you're ambidextrous). It is not heavy enough to stay put on a table or flat surface on its own. Might Namco consider adding a handle to it, or some other way to keep it stable without cramping your hands? As others have rightly pointed out, the so-called \\"twist\\" joystick leaves a lot to be desired -- it simply doesn't respond the way a real joystick does.

With the old Atari joystick, I could at least get to the banana, and the movement of the stick was easy, easy, easy. That is not the case with the new longer stick. Also, the boxes are square, which make it hard to hold.I love the concept of the TV version. This is a great idea, but the joy sticks are terrible. Every time I try to play, I get frustrated; my hands hurt from holding the stick and box.

A great idea but a missed opportunity. If they worked properly (and stayed working) people would love them. As it is, there's just no subsitute for the real thing. Emulations, simulations - they're all just pale copies of the real thing.If you want to experience these great games as they were originally presented and as they originally played you'll just have to seek out a vintage arcade machine. Otherwise you might be fooled into thinking the games weren't as good as you remembered them to be. They are, it's just these new cheap simulations that stink."},{"rating":"2","title":"4.5 Stars if it Worked...Recieved a DEFECTIVE UNIT... : (","review":"Been Waiting weeks for this game. Just got it from Amazon and opened it up, put brand new Energizers in it and powered it on. Everything works but the picture is HORRIBLE! BLURRY - I called the manufacturer (jakkstvgames) and told them - they said I probably got a defective unit. I asked jakks if they ever heard of this happening with ms. pac man - they said no \\"you are the first one to recieve a defective ms. pac man unit\\"- (...) I Love Amazon, just a little sad that I got a defective unit. Looks as if the games are pretty good if the picture came in good. : (I will write a follow up to this if I get this all worked out)...."},{"rating":"2","title":"ITS ONLY 20 DOLLARS","review":"hey people, its only $20.00. if you are gonna gripe about the joystick then go out and buy a refurbished upright arcade version for $3,500.00. its supposed to be fun, its not a highly tuned race car. we not only also have the same problem with the joystick, but most of the time if you are smooth enough with the controls you will have no problems. we are about to buy our 2nd console since we have played it so much that we almost wore the joystick out...remember how they used to get in the arcade...lol. not to beat a dead horse, but if the joystick messes up, simply finish the game or hit reset and start over. beats putting a quarter in every time."},{"rating":"1","title":"From a Huge Galaga Fan","review":"I am an arcade Galaga fanatic, but I cannot recommend this device to other hardcore Galaga fans.THE FIRE BUTTON IS ON THE LEFT SIDE.This virtually makes Galaga unplayable for me. The arcade Galaga has the fire button on the right (like all normal arcade games) so you handle the joystick with your left hand and button mash the fire button with your right hand.Also, like other reviewers stated, the up-down is very poor on Ms. Pacman. Xevious is no good - again for the left handed fire/missle buttons."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Joystick Stinks","review":"I bought this game with high hopes as I am an avid Ms. Pac Man fan who longed to play the original arcade game at home without having to spend $2500 on a real freestanding arcade game.This game was a real disappointment. The joystick is very unresponsive. It has a hard time moving up and down....really it has a mind of its own.Also, after eating a power pill the ghosts don't move back toward Ms. Pac-Man as they did in the original arcade version.Lastly, there is no 2 player capability.The Pole Position game was pretty decent, the other games were pretty boring.I think I am going to send this game back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"There have been some improvements on this version. The base of the game is easier to hold. Also, there button to pause a game. However, the joystick is difficult to use and the picture is far inferior to previous versions. With a faulty joystick and a blurry picture these \\"improvements\\" are of little value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty Joystick - Widespread Issue","review":"This game should be immediately recalled, as the joystick does not work in Ms. Pacman. The joystick is unresponsive in the up and down directions.I thought I had a bad device and called the manufacturer, but after reading the latest reviews it is clear they have a problem on their hands.The first device had a better joystick but the physical design was so bad that it hurt to play. Now this device has a better design but the actual joystick is not working properly.Makes me wonder if this company does any testing at all.The other games seem to work fine but Ms. pacman is what you want."},{"rating":"2","title":"Namco II","review":"I say Ms Pac-Man isn't a game you will like because it is hard tomove her up and down instead she will turn sometimes into dangerzones that's the only problem. If you like Galaga though you will need batteries because you will play that game alot. I ratedthe game 5 because I play Galaga alot now and I am getting goodat it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"My boyfriend loves Ms Pac Man, so when I saw this I figured it would be the perfect birthday gift. Buying it was a HUGE MISTAKE because the joystick doesn't work - Ms Pac Man would go straight when you tried to get her to turn (or turn if you wanted her to go straight). At first I thought maybe it was a problem with the unit I purchased, so I exchanged it for another one...same problem. The game was not playable, because you couldn't get away from the ghosts.The problems aren't confined to Ms. Pac Man alone, either. We experienced joystick issues on the other games on this unit.I finally returned the second unit I purchased.I wish I had read the reviews before buying it.Unless you're a glutton for punishment, don't buy this..."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME once properly mounted!!!","review":"Length:: 2:59 MinsI got this from my wife to be in 2005. We didn't use it much until I got it out recently for our son, David, who is 15 months to screw around with. He kept putting it upside down, so I decided to mount it to make it less confusing. In the process, I discovered that I had transformed a toy I didn't much care for into one I've since spent several hours playing, because now it works like it ought to.Apparently having to hold the thing upright is a PITA for adults too, we just don't quite realize just how much so!I've learned a *LOT* about the importance of ergonomic design in toy engineering from this toy, so, five stars for educational, LOL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Malfunctioning Mess","review":"We had the same problems everyone else mentioned here (confusing pole position controls, inability to control ms. pacman, etc. ). However, we had an additional problem that no one else seems to have mentioned (and it could not just have been a fluke as we bought and returned 2 separate units and experienced the same problem for both).On Galaga, our fighter gets captured, and an additional fighter does not appear; the game is basically in a holding pattern and you have to restart. Has this happened to anyone else?Also, on Ms. Pacman, the sound gets screwy and you jump from the first level to like the fifth level for some reason sometimes. Is it just us???"},{"rating":"1","title":"It didn't work - froze on various games","review":"Funky behavior on all the games. On Galaga when you're freeing your ship after it has been captured, the freed ship just spins in mid-air...forever. Other games just froze. It may be just this one console is bad, but I sent it back for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like everyone else, Disapointed with Ms Pac Man","review":"Yes, the joystick stinks on Ms Pac Man. I also went through the passage to the other side of the screen and the ghosts turned blue, and a power pellet disappeared from the screen, although i was nowhere near it. Galaga works well, as well as Zevious, and Mappy. I love the steering on Pole Position. The first time I played, I went off the course and could not get back on. I thought it was broken, until i read the directions and it said to use the yellow ball at the top of the joystick to steer. Great, idea, the handling on that car is awesome now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"JAKKS JOYSTICK SUCKKS!","review":"Just received my Ms.PacMan tv game today... Talk about a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT! The joystick works great with Galaga & Xevious; but for Ms. Pac Man (the primary game I bought this for), the joystick is utterly useless! It is complete inaccurate and it doesn't go where you want it to go. The main problem is that the joystick is a 8-way joystick and not a 4-way joystick like the original game. 4-way is up,left,right,down. However, 8-way joysticks have notches in the positions between those; often causing the stick to get stuck in an invalid position and ms.pacman not moving...I can't believe that Jakks released this with such a cruddy joystick! I returned this.My recommendation is DO NOT GET THIS! Their pac-man game is good b/c it actually has a 4-way joystick, but not so with ms pac man. :-("},{"rating":"1","title":"Ms Pacman's the only good game on this console Unlike Pacman","review":"I really Mrs pacman better than Pacman, but Ms. Pacman wasn't out yet when we got Pacman, but we love all the games on it. Don't leave it on or the batteries will die. We now have the Mrs Pac also, but that is the only game we like on that console."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!!! GAME IS GREAT, JOYSTICK IS HORRIBLE","review":"I bought this thinking what a great idea, I love this game. On a scale of 1-10, playing Ms. Pac Man is a 9. The re-creation is great (somewhat slower than arcade, but great). however, the quality of the joystick is so horrendous (about a 2 on scale of 1-10 on best day when brand new) it will drive you to insanity. I am sure they sacrificed build quality to make this product $20. Let me assure you I would easily pay double for a joystick that was even decent. To bad a great idea was destroyed by such low quality. Now if you are getting the game for Galaga or Pole Position, the joystick is not so much an issue. Only true problem for Ms Pac Man. Hope this info saves you from throwing your money away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Killjoystick on Ms Pac-Man","review":"I got this game for my wife because she is crazy about Ms Pac-Man. But it seems no one bothered to do any quality control on the joystick action because it doesn't let you play the game as intended. This is not our first experience with Namco products; the first one (Pac-Man) we had to return four different times to Wal-Mart before we got one that worked half decently.This is our second Ms Pac-Man and it's going back to Wal-Mart tomorrow. Just another case of a company having riches in the palm of their hand and fumbling the ball horribly.My wife says this product does not have a joystick; it has a \\"killjoystick\\". That is what the problem must be!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a piece of junk - do not buy!!!!","review":"Do NOT buy this game! My husband bought it for my son yesterday and when we unplugged it, the audio input plug broke off and is now stuck in the TV and we have to call a professional to come and get it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds to good to be true because it is. . .","review":"Our family is technically savvy, but we couldn't get the unit to work at all. We figured there was a problem with the first one we bought, so we took a gamble and got another, which also doesn't work. We shouldn't have been surprised, since the instructions direct you to a long list of tv manufacturers and their customer service lines (asking that you call your tv manufacturer first to trouble-shoot). . .Namco must have anticipated the angry callers. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG Disapointment","review":"I loved the idea of getting 3 of my favs on 1. Too Good to be true. I cant get mrs pacman to do anything but side to side and up. I move it to the middle but it rarely goes down. I even let go of it completly. this totally defeats the purpose. I hope the manufactures get a clue and fix it. . i love galaga and pole position is fairly easy but it will get old fast. Luckily i only paid $12.60 for it, im still reurning it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Fun","review":"I've read many comments about this game.But I LOVE it.I got this for my birthday and I have no problem with it.

The joysticks for this game are messed up. You may only really notice it while playing Ms Pacman, but thats enough to drive you crazy. The graphics are poor in comparison to the first Pacman game, and by a long shot too! I wanted this game very bad, but I returned it, and got my money back. No exchanges.This is just the perfect example of good ole america, make it fast, make it cheap, just sell! sell! sell! You bought this game for your kids so some tycoon could by a porsche for his.

It was really frustrating at first because the darn joystick was really non responsive. What we learned is that with constant use, it eases up and \\"breaks in.\\" The stiffness wears out and it plays just find. The joysticks knob actually turns for pole position.The office consensus seems to be that Ms. Pac-Man and Galaga are the best, but there's some good solid Mappy lovers anjd a pole position geek here and there. We only play Xevious when we get bored or worn out of the other ones.The batteries wear out rather quick, and the scores are lost as soon as you turn the joystick off (we bought a journal where we write down scores, I kid you not).In short, keep playing that baby, it will soon roll easily to your touch, no matter how frustrating it is to begin with."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},O={class:"card-container"},C=["disabled"],x={key:0},H={key:1};function W(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",O,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",H,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",x,"See more"))],8,C)):b("",!0)])}const N=d(B,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-e925a454"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/40.md","filePath":"people/40.md"}'),P={name:"people/40.md"},G=Object.assign(P,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(N)]))}});export{j as __pageData,G as default};
