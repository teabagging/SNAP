I always prefer this type of connection because I do not have to buy a bunch of adapters & waste time finding the correct size. Also if noise, sound quality, etc are a personal pet peeve for some, please remember that each connection, adapter, plug, kink in wire, etc that is added between speaker & receiver increases the Db loss = adds noise & reduces sound quality.Another FYI, speakers not specifically designed for wall hanging but there is a sturdy recessed plastic loop on back of speaker that I threaded some picture wire through then hung them on wall."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 inch mini cube speakers","review":"These little speakers are just what I wanted.

Maybe some of the nitwits writing the the fluff on the radio today, could sit down listen and learn something about melody and professional songwriting.

However, there are a couple of songs here that break away from this mold, namely 99 and Georgie Porgie which actually have some soul.

If you are like minded, and wish his films featured him more, you will want to own it just for the fact that he is the main focus of this film. His hair looks wonderfully long and soft, and he makes some great, uh, facial expressions in this one. Watch it and you'll see what I mean...The film itself is a bit lacking, but who cares-- it stars our Alan. 'Nuff said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Historically Inaccurate","review":"While there is no complaint about the acting and sets on this movie, this Hollywood script is wildly, ridiculously and sadly inaccurate. I'm giving it two stars instead of one because Alan Rickman, the lead actor, gives a sensitive performance; unfortunately--and probably not his fault--the character he portrays has nothing to do with the historical Mesmer, who most acknowledge as the father of hypnosis.I advise my hypnosis students to avoid watching this film at all costs. A far better depiction of Mesmer and his famous baquettes, although only taking up a small portion of the movie, can be found by watching James Ivory's fabulous film, \\"Thomas Jefferson in Paris,\\" starring Nick Nolte as Thomas Jefferson (perfect casting; who would've guessed it?!) and featuring a young Gwyneth Paltrow.Booklet: The Amazing Doctor Mesmer (Hypnosis and Guided Imagery)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Messmer","review":"Movie was a little weird, but now I know why Rickman was cast as Prof. Snape. Same moves, good with a cape and wanted to fire an arrow at someone by just his thoughts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"Given the fact that the subject matter should have been fascinating and that Alan Rickman was the star, why was I disappointed in this movie? I'll tell you why--because the events in the film were confusing enough without a barely audible dialogue. By the end of the movie I wondered why I sat through the whole thing. Go ahead and rent this at your local video store if you don't have anything else to do, but don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT Alan Rickman's best work","review":"Normally I enjoy Alan Rickman's work, and while he gave a decent performance, the movie itself was not worth watching. In several parts, some of the dialogue was not audible without turning the volume up so loud that the rest of the movie would have been blaring. The plot was stagnant for most of the film, and there was no resolution at the end - it wasn't just that there were some loose ends that were not tied up, but they didn't resolve a single issue of the whole film! Don't waste your time on this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"I ordered this film because I am a huge Alan Rickman fan; but, it is is so poorly written and edited that even Rickman's formidable screen presence and acting ability can't redeem this abyssmal mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was that?","review":"Even Alan Rickman couldn't save this conglomeration of images which attempted to depict the life and times of Franz Anton Mesmer. Truly an interesting story, Mesmer's life is not well portrayed by this movie. Unless you are already well acquainted with Mesmer and his theories, watching this movie will not explain any of the man's intriguing ideas. In fact, I found myself more confused by the end of the movie than before I'd begun watching it!The sound was not good at all for a portion of the movie and it was very hard to hear some of the dialogue adding to the overall confusion. There were some exquisite uses of light and shadow- very artistic. But alas, the movie ends very suddenly without explanation of any sort and left me sitting there with open mouth and a blank expression. Maybe I had been mesmerized. I often am mesmerized by Alan Rickman!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm gonna get crucified for this","review":"I've extolled how amazing Alan Rickman is in just about everything he's ever been in. He can take a bad script and turn it into gold just with his delivery. But in this movie, he went WAY over the top, and not in a good Sheriff of Nottingham way. There were times when I felt he wasn't chewing scenery, he was swallowing it whole!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Charlaton, fraud, or genius?","review":"I'd say moron, based on this movie. This character was a joke, as was the whole film. I might reccomend it as being so bad it's funny, but most of it is just boring as all get out and badly acted. Rickman makes Mesmer seem ridiculous, it's like a parody of his role as Rasputin (which is much, much better). The few scenes that are entertaining are that way because they're (unintentionally?) funny, such as the mass-hypnosis scene towards the end which is totally absurd. This is a weak, craptastic movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool CD!","review":"I absolutely love mixes where they tweek these great songs so it becomes a great dance track!

Harry James probably had control over the trumpet better then anyone in his time! I would say the band he had in 1943 was the best. And the female singers were excellent also. Helen Forrest, Kitty Kallen and Betty Grable. Dick Haymes did the male singing. This album shows off the band and singers very well with songs like \\"I've heard that song before\\", \\" I cant begain to tell you,\\" Ciribiribin\\" to name a few. I would say to anyone who liked the music of this era to buy this album. Dont think you could go wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best big bands of the '40s - a good collection.","review":"Harry James' big band perhaps isn't remembered as well as the Miller, Goodman, Basie, or Ellington bands, but he was one of the Goodman sidemen - drummer Gene Krupa was another - who left to seek fame and fortune on their own. And he deserved every bit of it. His trumpet playing, his good looks, his marriage to Betty Grable - he had a lot going for him. This collection will appeal even to listeners who, while they may not have heard of Harry James, will say, \\"Hey, I've heard that number before.\\" Included are several vocals by Helen Forrest and Kitty Kallen - and a Betty Grable number. The sound quality is pretty good, mostly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks Dad","review":"As the title suggests I owe a big part of why I like Big Band Music to my dad.He grew up listening to it and as a result so did I.

It takes place in 1855-1856 in Vermont. It is great for teaching about the Underground Railroad and how it worked. It really gives readers a sense of how it must have felt for any young people who traveled by foot afraid of being caught by slavers. This book is very action packed, especially toward the end of the book when he begins his journey to freedom. The book addresses so many conflicts, such as when he finds out he is part African. He also faces a struggle in society, since he is to be sold as a slave now that his identity is discovered. The book is told using Jip's point of view, and this really gives the reader of sense of how he feels.

I've since purchased his DVD's and books. And still find this DVD to be he best of the bunch when it comes to simply explaining the two swings and why someone would choose to try one over the other.I agree with the first poster, the only thing that would be better is if they could have had some shots of actual swings using either Mr. Hardy or Mr. Utley's techniques.

Johnson \\"pitched\\" when a pitcher only had to bear down on about 15 or 20 pitches per game; Grove pitched when any pitch could be hit out of the park, and lobbing in all of your pitches was suicidal. Grove won 9 ERA titles, all of them while pitching in hitters' parks, including 4 as a southpaw in Fenway Park after his 35th birthday; Johnson won 5 in a pitcher's paradise.So the book's biased premise is not only flawed, but untenable. Poor writing, presented in support of a nepotistic agenda, makes for a poor read. Sorry, Grandsonny, but Grove was better, and both Pedro and Roger Clemens may prove to have been better yet, when they are done.Jim Fahey"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine read about baseball;s greatest pitcher","review":"This biography, by Johnson's grandson, fills a gap in the historical literature of baseball. Though Johnson comes through as a very admirable character, by all accounts that is an accurate portrayal of man respected by all his peers. For a Washington Senator fan, the book was especially welcome, as the exploits of one of baseball's most hapless teams is rarely the subject of any publication"},{"rating":"2","title":"For fans of Senses Fail & Thursday","review":"This CD sounds great!

This is an ACTUAL band, that happens to make incredibly awful music. It shouldn't come as a surprise to you though.. this is just one of the countless no talent, un-original groups that exist in the world today.

I discovered ATFEH in May when they released an Mp3 on the Warped Tour page. I've been anticipating this since. This CD is the most complete record of the year. Compelling lyrics, guitars ranging from hard metal to soft acoustic-type riffs, and drums that fit perfectly with everything going on. Songs like \\"February\\" and \\"99 With An Anchor\\" blew me away, and are the stand out tracks. Also listen to \\"Next of Kin,\\" another great song. For anyone who likes anything in the range from Taking Back Sunday to Alexisonfire to Coheed and Cambria to Thrice or is the slightest bit interested in emo, you'll love this record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't let the band name deceive you..","review":"This is hardly the average \\"heart on the sleeve\\" type of band.

Great amalgamation of pop and metal."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really want to like it...","review":"...but the production is just terrible. Think demo quality, but worse.

Eventually their rarely catchy and even less often amusing brand of screamo-pop will drown right along with all the other bands who believe using the word \\"beautiful\\" in a negative sense is an edgy tactic to get kids hooked on their music. This debut full length on Kickball Records is background, high school party music at best. There is some obvious instrumental talent displayed here; but in the end, the majority of the tracks are downright nauseating.

There is a reason why it grossed so little (about twelve million dollars or so as I recall). I then bought the book to see if the book was better than the movie. Nope.But Jennifer Lawrence played her role well. The setting of the movie (in a very poor part of the country), and the type of character Jennifer played was similar to the role of Katniss Everdeen in \\"The Hunger Games\\". I think she may have been selected to play Katniss specifically because of her performance in Winter's Bone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oscar Nod for Lawrence?","review":"Great film, new Southern gothic. I agree with critic Derrick Bang: \\"This film is so far removed from soulless, bombastic crap such as Killers and Marmaduke that it shouldn't even be regarded as the same medium. Winter's Bone has the same pedigree -- the primarily unknown cast, the carefully constructed atmosphere of authenticity, the memorable script shaped by a skilled director -- that made The Hurt Locker such a similarly welcome alternative to Hollywood fare last year. I rather doubt Granik's film will go on to similar success -- it's awfully hard to watch, and its rewards are subtle -- but this much is certain: If Lawrence doesn't get an Oscar nod for her starring performance, there's no justice in this world.\\" More: [...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most important American movies!","review":"Never ask for what ought to be offered... Winter's Bone is one of the most important and best American movies ever made. If you want a slice of truth and reality, this is an excellent antidote to Beverly Hills anything.

I was so turned off by the dragging story line. A 17 year old girl who is put upon to take care of her two siblings and wacked out non verbal Mother. The girl wanders all through the woods going to different homes mumbling about looking for her Dad, an apparent \\"crack cooker\\" whom we never see. She wants to prove he is dead so the family homestead is not lost. The characters were played too flat no emotion, I kept waiting for the real story to start......

If you are a Hunger Games fan you will know why Jennifer Lawrence was chosen to play Katniss. The characters are very similar; the family situation that Ree/Katniss finds herself in is almost exactly the same. Understanding the time limitation forced upon the Hunger Games movie, Winter's Bone offers more of the character development that did not transfer from the Hunger Games book to the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleeper / Cannes Award / simply the best","review":"Its too bad Cannes movies dont get advertised and never make it to a box office because, this movie would have taken everyone's money.It is a must see!

Right up to the end I expected him to make an appearance.Predictable, boring, stereotyped. As the movie goes on the dialogue becomes longer and more laborious, a sure sign that the director and screenwriter were out of their depth.The female lead does have a certain Renée Zellwegger quality. If that allows you to watch it to the end, more power to you.Not for serious movie lovers. See it at the drive-in."},{"rating":"1","title":"One note.","review":"A movie with very little to offer than one note. Scratch that, two notes: the root and minor third. By the time the buzzards make their debut, you don't have to be an art house baret-wearing clown from New York to see what this is all about: poor white folk. Toothless, gray, American Gothic meets the Joads meets Boys Don't Cry, etc. If it wasn't presented with such ham-fisted drudgery, perhaps with a tinge of humor or a sense of salvation (not the cheap kind that just comes at the end), it would have done the photography justice.In short, white poverty, meth, bad teeth, poor, banjo, squirrel gets skinned and eaten, bad teeth ad infinitum. Almost a parody of itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Wizard Of Oz","review":"I'm sorry but I just couldn't get into this movie. It's billed as a \\"thriller\\" but it's nowhere near that. It reminded me of \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" like Dorthey going all over the place to no end looking for the Oz, but here it's Ree looking for her father. This film was quite dull and uneventful and nearly put me to sleep. They didn't even show Ree chainsawing her father's hands off at the end. At least show us something memorable and gory after we spent hours watching her look for this guy. Another thing is I'm not into any movie that deals with the crystal meth thing. I don't find it entertaining and I don't want to go down that road! I guess I was disillusioned, especially hearing it had Oscar buzz and all that. Different strokes for different folks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and boring.","review":"You know a movie is bad when you keep checking your watching every 5 or 10 minutes. That's exactly what I did as I was watching this dud. The ending was predictable. I lost interest whether the girl would find her father or not. (Frankly, I didn't care after a certain point.) I found little to no character development. This movie is very overrated. I know a lot of people will probably say that they liked the themes of how sometimes we have to do what we don't like to do in life and the importance of hope. I say: big deal. Don't waste your time or money seeing this dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"watching movies with the Silver Surfer","review":"its like a Lifetime cable channel movie..if you know what i mean...not bad, but not a thriller ..dont believe the 4 or 5 star reviews"},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie review","review":"Great story line that kept me interested.

But at the same time it's wrapped in this complex and little known world that resides in this dark, yet altruistic American subculture. The writing and direction manage to carry the movie through the slower, more visually stunning transitions. Jennifer Lawrence proves again in her role here that she is destined to by one of Hollywood's greatest. John Hawkes carries his role impressively, delivering his best performance yet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it!","review":"To me, a great director is someone who just tells the story and keeps your attention throughout the movie. Winter's Bone is such a film. Nothing fancy, just the story. This is a bleak but excellent film. I couldn't believe all the negative customer reviews. People are such morons! Jennifer Lawrence's performance just blew me away. The rest of the stellar cast wasn't bad either. This film held my attention to the very end. Very very good, I really loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ozarks in muted tones","review":"Definitely a solid outing though of unremittingly dour tones. The story has been effectively outlined by many reviewers and needs no further exposition. I like the reference to dustbowl photography as, while watching, it felt like Walker Evans had stepped into hillbilly hicksville to unwind a contemporary plight. The homemade feel of this movie is crucial to its narrative. The actors (though I confess my Aussie ears have difficulties with some of the articulation and regional patois) seem so natural, as if they'd been lifted from the location with uncanny ability to deliver the script. It's a tough survival story and the lead girl shines throughout weathering the violence of kith and kin in this closed community; every bit as gripping and tense as the ghettos of The Wire."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"This is a fantastic movie!

It was a waste of time. We would give it a negative score if we could. The plot consists of, \\"Have you seen my dad?\\". Well, the ending is no surprise. If your relatives are into cooking meth and you are brain dead, you might enjoy this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly overated","review":"Not sure why this movie is so popular. I had to fight to stay awake during this terrible movie. A movie about a bunch of back woods meth heads. This movie is more of a character study than a suspense, drama, or thriller. The problem with the character study is that the characters are not really worth studying."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Art\\" in the worst sense","review":"I'm sure there's a great movie to be made about crank cookers -- but this sure isn't it. I have no idea how \\"authentic\\" or accurate it is, but in trying to make it feel oh-so authentic and (ugh) important, the filmmakers left out all the creativity. There's not a single charged or surprising moment in the entire movie, with the exception of the chainsaw scene, and that's only thanks to the yuk factor. This film is a great example of what happens when someone with little narrative talent or feel for character thinks they're making \\"art\\". Pointless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the book","review":"The book on which the movie is based is a true original with a strong heroine and some edgy villians who engage in over the top violence. The language is steeped in metaphor and the sound of the Ozarks. The movie looks like it was made by a film school drop out. The lead character is way to soft for the part, the violence is expurgated and we never even see who makes crank and how they do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Winter's Bone","review":"This a heart-breaking and heart-warming story of a young girl's fight to save her mother, brother and sister from the elements of poverty. Very well done. As everything I ordered this on line from Amazon.com."},{"rating":"1","title":"I personally did not enjoy it","review":"It was not clear to me that this movie's purpose is to educate us about the effect of methamphetamines in rural communities, as other reviewers have said, or I wouldn't have watched it. It turned out to be about how a girl survives with a sick mother, two little siblings and no father, in an area where, other than her neighbor and one friend, everyone is evil and horrible to her. Very depressing. The girl's acting was ok, but the story was terrible. It makes Missouri look like an awful place with terrible people. I've been to Missouri, and I thought people were all nice and happy, not ugly, fat and depressed like the people in this movie. The homes are a lot prettier and happier, and yes, they do have running water! Missouri people ought to complain. Perhaps the book is a lot a better. I'm sorry I wasted my time with this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing but realistic","review":"Rhee is almost the same character as she is in the Hunger Games -- Katniss. I can imagine the setting as District 12, after her father dies. Her mother is in a catatonic, useless state. Rhee, unlike Katniss also has a little brother. Rhee teaches her younger siblings how to survive by teaching them how to hunt squirrels and how to make deer stew. I know this isn't the same story, but it's uncanny how this setting can almost be a surrogate for Katniss' history. Otherwise, it's full of depressing meth-addicted toothless characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting film but...","review":"Although I enjoyed the nature and subject matter I did not enjoy watching this film. It was long and painful to watch at certain periods. Although I admired the main character, her determination and her grit, there were somethings that were hard to follow. I wish some characters were explained more thoroughly. And family ties... another confusing aspect of this move."},{"rating":"1","title":"Winters bone","review":"If there was a way, I would give it a half of a star or a quarter of a star.

It's a plodding, poorly-paced movie that did nothing for me.It earns a star for the performances, which seemed natural throughout, but the actors are portraying undefined characters. Few of them have known, clear motives and practically none have any back story, and it turns out to be the movie's main weakness. That mystery of the character's intentions, rather than intriguing me, made scenes confusing and disjointed. You learn very little about the other players, and by the end (well, probably 25 minutes from the end), I had stopped caring entirely.It's not a thrilling thriller or a dramatic drama. There are moments in the movie that work, and I did end up feeling for Ree and her struggling family, but when it was over, this movie was wholly forgettable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lionsgate Blu-Ray movie","review":"This Blu-Ray did not play on my blu-ray player.

After listening to these speakers for a few months, trying different sources, from my laptop to a CD player, they just do not live up to all the positive reviews. They just don't sound natural at all. The primary problem is BOOMY BASS which muddies the entire sound stage. My old cheap $50 BIC speakers sound better. And my Boston Acoustics home stereo speakers make the A5's sound like a cheap boom box. I DO like deep bass, but this is more like low-frequency feedback (around the range of 100 to 300 Hz?). The boom from bass guitar and the lower notes of acoustic guitar sound like almost constant feedback.UPDATE: I recently moved to a much larger space and now have the speakers positioned far from any wall, floor or ceiling and while it reduced some of the muddy, boomy bass, they still sound bad. Hence, I am reducing the rating from 2 stars to 1 star -- speaker placement is no longer a possible excuse for such bad sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds Good to Me","review":"I've had these speakers set up with my TV for about a year now. The speakers sound great and seem to be very well made. About the only drawback is sometimes I get a loud pop when shutting off the TV. That was the only thing holding me back from giving 5 stars. Overall, I'm very pleased with these speakers."},{"rating":"2","title":"great sound","review":"The sound is very precise with good bass (though really strong base would require a much larger product). After three years, the amp failed. But AudioEngine replaced both speakers, so how could I complain?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great speakers - Need Subwoofer for loud music","review":"I've had these a year. They sound best at mid to high level volumes. They sound pretty good at low volumes.THEY NEED A SUB FOR EXTREME VOLUME! If you're a young adult like myself and want to bang some long music, invest in a sub. The high volume bass cracks and sounds like .... at very high volumes. If anyone has a good sub that they used or suggest let me know! I need to buy one.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken after 2 years of light use","review":"I really wanted to like them. Lots of volume but a very shapeless, boomy bass and weak midrange. Adjusting the EQ made them listenable but never enjoyable. In the last few months, they started turning themselves off after a half hour of low volume listening. Now they just crackle. Waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOP QUALITY","review":"A well made speaker system that delivers. If I were the designer though, I would have incorporated lightweight grills to protect the woofer and tweeter. Just a preference on my part. Having these exposed distracts from the sound and encourages mishaps. The packaging was out of this world. Each speaker was wrapped in a soft linen that had a draw cord. I have never seen a manufacturer ever go to these lengths. This company clearly understands perception and quality. Thumbs up all day!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok, these are pretty remarkable after all","review":"They need a decent break-in ... about 30 hours low-level volume, but then it seems to come together. Also, I used Herbie's Audio Dots to elevate off the desktop -- HUGE help. Whatever you do, don't just plunk them on your desktop -- way to much mechanical energy transmitted from these mini-beasts to whatever they happen to be sitting on, and the resulting odd resonances are not pretty!Bottom line, with the right material, situated in the right way, these suckers are remarkable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing compares in this price range.","review":"I bought these along with an airport express and stream music from my macbook pro to the speakers via itunes. My first impression was that they sounded really good. I broke them in as instructed, and that did make a difference. Wow, they sound incredible and are comparable to pro monitors. They are very accurate and have a nice soundstage and separation. Bass isnt huge, but reasonable for their size. I own a Klipsch Hi Fi as well, and was never satisfied with the sound. Granted, these were twice as expensive, but they are infinitely better in sound quality. I cannot recommend thim higher if you are looking for small speakers with good sound to run your digital music or stream radio. I would buy them again and feel like they are a bargain at the price I paid ($300) at a local store."},{"rating":"1","title":"My $200 Boom Box Sounds Better","review":"Like many buyers of the Audioengine A5, I was swayed by the large number of positive reviews. My conclusion is that those who love these speakers are comparing them to the free speakers that came with their PC. To be fair, the build quality and packaging are excellent. The design and ease of use, very well thought out. Unfortunately they are the sonic equivalent of mayonnaise on white bread. No depth, no personality. Just sound coming out of a box. They are good enough for background noise, but if you have a good ear and want a speaker for serious listening, pass on the Audioengine A5."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't understand all the positive reviews!?","review":"These speakers are a great idea, unfortunately they dont follow through on expectations. Muddy, Dull, they distort, and the soundstage is among the worst ive ever heard! I took a loss and sold mine within a week of buying them. They are unique and cool but sound terrible!."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed.","review":"Disappointed. The best way to describe the sound is what you would expect if you turned up the bass all the way on some bookshelf speakers. It's not pretty. Boomy. Muddy. Whatever you want to call it. These are not good for music or television audio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible speakers","review":"The only people giving these speakers a good review are non-audiophiles. For $325, a pair of B&W; MM1's sound better (and they cost less too). AudioEngine A5 has terrible soundstage, overpowering bass and lousy, muddy mid and trebles. These speakers are so bad they should be illegal. I'm not kidding. In fact, if I were the FCC, I'd fine AudioEngine out of business, their products are luxury fraud.When I submitted the speakers back to AudioEngine, it took them over THREE WHOLE WEEKS to give me back my refund (at the start of the third week, I had to repeatedly call them for them to post the refund to my account directly).So even if the speakers were good, I wouldn't do business with AudioEngine again. Customer service was lousy too, they DO NOT know their products (a sound technician who doesn't know what audiophonics are? ARE YOU SERIOUS? You better be making minimum wage, Steve)."},{"rating":"1","title":"beware; these do not work with the DAC 1","review":"I wrote Audioengine and told them I would be using this with a DAC 1; well the A5's have 2 RCA outputs, not inputs; Audioengine didn't even pay attention to what I was saying. I needed the ability to use headphones plus the 24 bit DAC that comes from DAC 1. No way for this model A5. They sound good, but what do you do if you want to use headphones. I returned them. Also, these are huge for computer destop speakers. You better have a big desk!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sounding Poor Connections","review":"I've had these speakers for several years and have found that the USB and mini at top loosen with age. I've had to return one set due to this and they replaced with no questions asked, which is great. I tend to stream my music via. the express in the back so my connections are not used as nearly as much as they were in the past... that's one solution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Speakers","review":"Great Speakers, they are amazing. Just read all the previous reviews they are all pretty accurate.The only negative things I can say about these is that they dont have enough input options and they are prone to cell phone interference. Every now and then they make a popping sound when my cell phone is in the room and my roomates iphone makes them go crazy if he gets too close to the speakers. Other than that they are fantastic speakers and well worth the price, I love mine.Update: After about 2 years my original speakers went bad and started to pop and crackle. I contacted Audio Engine, shipped my old speakers to them and they sent me a brand new set of speakers which are working great now. The newer speakers seem to block some of the interference from cell devices better than the older speakers. I am very happy with Audio Engine and the way they replaced my warranty claim so quickly and smoothly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not the soundtrack","review":"This is one of the most disappointing cd's I have purchased!

If you don't fall asleep while Harry the Hype Connick Jr. mumbles his way through a very lame Sinatra impression, you're drinking too much coffee.I'm pretty sure there's a moment or two during \\"Love Is Here To Stay\\" where Connick and his band actually dozed off. Good editing to splice that \\"performance\\" back together.For Sinatra-like performances it's always a better idea to get albums recorded by one Albert Francis Sinatra."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware! It's not really the movie soundtrack!","review":"I was very disappointed to receive this CD only to find out that the movie's original artists were replaced with Harry Connick Jr.'s interpretations of their music.

Be a better shopper than I was, and be sure you're getting what you want."},{"rating":"1","title":"False advertising","review":"For anybody who thinks they're buying the soundtrack of \\"When Harry Met Sally,\\" this CD is a disappointment. This is NOT the soundtrack of the movie, but rather a collection of remakes of the movie songs. Don't get me wrong, I love Harry Connick Jr, and this is a nice CD.

He sings his renditions of the songs instead of the artists you heard in the movie. Personally, I don't like him."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not the original soundtrack","review":"This collection of music by Harry Connick, whom I normally like very much, is NOT the music we heard in the motion picture. (...) I was very disappointed by this product and would not recommend this CD to anyone. Note that I'm not a Harry basher. I saw him live this summer at the Hollywood Bowl and he was fabulous. It's just a shame that this CD is borderline (...) presenting itself as the movie music (just look at the jacket). I cannot recommend this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Sound Track","review":"I bought this album for Harry Connick's version of the jazz standard, Don't Get Around Much Anymore, which is wonderful.The music of this soundtrack is all beautiful, Connick's creativity makes this realy special. Not that the mastery of the instruments and arrangements are not first class, but the x-factor is the coolness in which Harry sings, swings, thumps and carresses that piano and those vocal chords.My only issue with this album is that because of the level of musical craft required for a sound track, the album has a huge dynamic range. This means it is difficult to have the album playing unless you are actively listening to it. If you are not listening to it, some sections will be virtually inaudible. On the other hand, if the soft parts are audible, the loud sections will be ear-splitting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film!","review":"One of my all time favorite comedies. When two college grads, Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan drive together to NY to start their new jobs, they can't stand each other. Crystal acts like a jerk, while Meg is persnickity and can't wait until he's out of her car and her life. Every now and then they run into each other. Meg has a boyfriend, and Billy is married. Neither relationships work out. So they finally stop arguing, and in time become good friends. But when romance enters the scene, neither knows how to handle it. Not woth missing. And the music background is wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the original?","review":"Harry Connick, Jr. did a fair job representing the musical legends that were found in the movie, but nonetheless, this soundtrack should contain the artists who created the songs and/or who were featured in the motion picture. If you are purchasing this CD because you enjoy the classics performed by musical legends, as I do, then I do not recommend this CD; instead I would buy the originals."},{"rating":"1","title":"You're right... I know you're right.","review":"I understand that this is a \\"music from\\" disc, and not really a \\"soundtrack\\". But Harry Connick Jr. takes too many liberties on this production, IMNSHO. I was quite anxious to get this CD home and get it into the CD player. A purchase like this should stir memories from the film. I personally had a difficult time getting past the arrangements, which were - as noted in other reviews - so different from the film.If you're looking for the \\"sound stylings of Harry Connick Jr\\" this may well be a great album. As for me, don't mess with Mr Zero - and PLEASE don't mess with the music from my favorite film."},{"rating":"1","title":"When Harry Met Sally movie soundtrack","review":"This CD is NOT the music soundtrack from the movie.

Connick not quite in tune and definitely not Sinatra like in phrasing or presentation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Duke Does It Again","review":"This album (CD) is an eclectic mixture from Ole School Funk, like Ain't It Funky Now and Creepin' to acid-funk jazz with songs like Another Way To Look At It to straight acid-jazz with Ten Miles Jog.Duke begins with a hip live performance of The Black Messiah (Part II). My personal favorites are the mesmerizing sounds of Chillin' and Let's Roll (Dukes tribute to 9/11). These transcendental songs remind me of \\"Look What We Started\\" from Illusions and \\"Sunrise\\" from the Snapshot CD's - spellbinding.The accompaniment of Christian McBride on acoustic bass and John Roberts and Lenny Castro on percussions add an incredibly hypnotic dimension to Dukes non-accoustic raptures.There's a little bit of something on this album (CD) for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"George goes back to his roots","review":"I have followed the career of George Duke over the years and have not always been pleased with his albums - but this one is the bomb! George goes back to his roots with a tight band and some \\"live\\" playing, keyboards, horns etc. He doesn't shy away from tracks which lasts over 10 minutes with lots of adventurous soloing (Ten Mile Jog). Like back in the days when the term \\"radio friendly\\" was unknown. Groovy baby!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Black Messiah","review":"The album is fabulous, especially the first four tracks.

These pieces all come from Capote's personal childhood life and are all interconnected. They detail his southern childhood and the unique friendship he had as a child with an elderly cousin with whom he lived. The prose is gorgeous and the imagery palpable. I have recommended this collection to many friends and fellow readers and I have not heard one complaint yet. In fact, \\"A Christmas Memory\\" is my all time favorite holiday story. There is joy, sadness and an old fashioned charm that I have simply not found anywhere else. Each story can be read in about 20 minutes, but each is exquisite in that it will stick with you, maybe even haunt you. They are human and unique. I cannot recommend these stories enough.

It's ashamed that Pokemon USA has to do that. This season had the potential of becoming the best season of the series.Do not buy this and I would not recommend anyone to buy it. The shows quality went downhill because of Pokemon USA's action. Bring back the original quality back by rehiring the original voice actors.Thank You"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Qrality","review":"For a used VHS tape from 1972 the play back is amazing. I have only seen bootleg copies of this in the past. If you are looking for DVD quality, you will not find it here, but for a very old VHS tape it is Great. The documetary is very intresting, there was not as much known about Karate in 1972 as now. Looking back at the interviews, the people, the clothing and hair styles is a trip to the past. I highly recomend this video to any Martial Arts student. It is most intresting to see from where many current styles got thier requirements for promotion and training."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate amazon.com","review":"I watched this movie on tv, thought it was awesome, and ordered the vhs from amazon for $9.95.

Just about every species of animal life (fish, insects, and birds) from the rivers' origin to its mouth are disgussed. The Storm King plant and ConEd struggle surfaces. A chapter is devoted to a local fisherman who knows more about the river than anyone else. It is too bad that this classic is out of print, for I suggest that any ecologist at heart should own a copy. (My copy was \\"borrowed\\" from my teacher, and shall return home come the end of school.) Even if you do not live in New York State, or have no plans to ever go there, this book is an ecologist's dream. Not to put any other rivers down, but the Hudson River has the most incredible history around.

They don't sound really great. The sound is somewhat mushy because the rubber is soft and doesn't form a very tight seal. The soft rubber means that they are comfortable to wear, but the trade off is that the sound isn't as good as ear buds that make a tighter seal in your ear. Tighter ear buds sound better but they are less comfortable. Also, these do not block out external sound very well. Overall if I could do it over, I would not have bought them.

For those of you that know what bit rate is, these $20 jbuds (j for junk) make your beautiful radio quality 192 KB MP3 sound like a 64KB MP3. No exageration here.

With other ear buds, I have used a various number of other ear buds, I have found them to be too short, so I end up crouching awkwardly at times, or hiking my shorts up super high just so I don't have \\"length\\" issues with the cord trying to pop out of my ear.

Volume would cut in half with low treble and no bass, then if moved a certain way the sound would come back for one to two seconds. Now they are essentially unusable. I kept them in their case and took care of them but now they are useless to me. I wouldn't recommend these headphones, as I was only able to get one good use out of them until they became faulty.

The sound of the buds is extremely small and treble based. There is absolutely no bottom end present. It felt like I was listening to my car radio in my 1983 Chevette again.Finally, I want to let anyone out there know, that this is not just an angry review. Yes, I lost 20 bucks, but much worse is that these are not even worth using if you are interested in listening to music.

While the sound quality is pretty good (better than the apple), they are extremely uncomfortable! You have to push them all the way inside your ear for them to hold on, which hurts after awhile. And the right earbud doesn't fit very well in my ear and keeps popping out, so I have to push it harder and harder, which hurts even more. It is very frustrating.

Alas, my ears are doomed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, I got what I paid for.","review":"I bought two pairs of these ear buds just over a year ago for less than $10 each, one to leave at work and one to carry around with my Zune. They were excellent as far as comfort and sound goes, no complaints there at all. However, the right bud on one set died about a month after I got them, and then the right bud on the second set also died a few months later. That second set completely died last week so now I am down to the first pair with only one bud working. I thought about getting some more since the price is even lower now, but why would I want to buy something I know I am just going to replace again in another year or so?

The guys at Jlabs have a great product and I highly recommend it.

While they are marginally more comfortable than the hard, round earbuds which came packaged with my Sansa MP3 player, the sound quality is certainly no better. I actually think the OEM Sansa earbuds sound a bit better. I purchased the JBuds after reading an article bemoaning the poor quality of earbuds that came packaged with new MP3 players. After reading the many stellar reviews here on Amazon, the JBuds sounded like the obvious choice. Not so, in my opinion. I suppose either the Sansa OEM earbuds are of above-average quality, or the $20 price point of the JBuds just isn't a sufficient upgrade."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOES NOT WORK WITH IPHONE","review":"I ordered these because the product text said specifically: WILL WORK WITH ANY IPHONE. Jbuds will not work with any iphone, they will only work with newer models, otherwise you have to buy an adapter. I actually knew about the adapter and the incompatibility issues before I ordered the jbuds, but because the ad copy stated: WILL WORK WITH ANY IPHONE, I assumed I would not also have to buy an adapter.I think that's false advertising. you could have said anything you wanted in the space provided for your ad copy. You could have said \\"fits only new iphone models\\"; you could have said \\"fits these models of iphone:\\" or you could have said NOTHING at all about the iphone, in which case I would not have purchased your earbuds. However: ANY IPHONE means ANY IPHONE -- if it's not ANY IPHONE then publish the specs and state the truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Customer service!","review":"I bought these earphones when they were highly recommended by a friend. However, 4 months in, the right earphone stopped working. I contacted the company since it was still under warranty. They were extremely easy to deal with- just sent them an email and they sent me a replacement pair within a week.I was initially disappointed that the earphones stopped working because they worked so well- but the customer service is so easy to deal with that I'm going to stick with Jlabs in the future as well.I highly recommend this product (and even the company!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money","review":"one ear broke after about 40 days with light use. noise canceling not that good either"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice sound, but still cheap earbuds","review":"My first impression of these earbuds was great. OK, they were indeed very light and looked kinda cheap, but I was quite impressed with the sound quality for its price. In my opinion, the JBuds sound quality is much better than the standard iPod earphones, for example.However, the honeymoon did not last long. 3 weeks after I got them, the JBuds stopped working. It seems part of the cable is broken, so now only the left side works. This probably has to do with the fact that, because the cable is too long, I often had to squeeze part of it into my pocket. So, since it's a little tight, the cable might have broken somewhere. But, again, this only happened because the cable is: 1) too long, and 2) too weak. This never happened to any of the other earphones I had (including iPod earbuds and other cheap Philips and Aiwa models), so I find it to be unacceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short Life","review":"Bought 4 pair. WHen they work they sound pretty good. But they each started losing sound out of one ear after about 4 weeks of use. Then eventually out of the other ear. Could jiggle the cord and get sporatic sound. Wires must shear easily causing a short.****** Update*****Company responded to my posting and did a great job providing an acceptable resolution to the issue. I will still purchase products from them. Key for me is a company that stands behind what they sell."},{"rating":"1","title":"jbuds not as good as expected","review":"Disappointed, the one that came free with my Sansa 240 sound better. poor Sensitivity also"},{"rating":"1","title":"Received for Christmas present and Broken already","review":"They are already making a scratching noise... wish it was a better product.I am not one to listen to music really loud either."},{"rating":"1","title":"One bud failure","review":"The sound quality was good while it lasted -- all of 2 months! Then the right bud went mute. They were never put under any duress. I don't go running, I just use them on the metro. No visible damage either (no frayed cord, etc), so it may be a defect in the manufacturing. Don't take your chances!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent earphones for the audio book listener","review":"I use my Mp3 player only to listen to audio books, and purchased these earphones to replace the ones that originally came with the player. The attributes I look for in earphones for audio books are obviously different than those who listen only to music with their players. Most importantly, I want clarity of sound and these headphones deliver. I found the buds to be a bit large for my ears and not as comfortable as I'd like, but I have yet to put on the optional sized plugs that comes with the ear buds, which may improve the size problem. Otherwise, these ear buds are an excellent accompaniment to my belovedSanDisk Sansa Fuse Mp3 Player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would be awesome if it didn't keep breaking","review":"It's a shame, the sound quality is great when it works especially for the price. I had bought two pairs of these and sent two of them back because the left side broke, now I am on my fourth pair and after this one breaks (which it obviously will) i am done with J-bud and all of their products forever. If you use these with an i-pod, try to never keep it in your pants pocket, i fear that this might be a factor leading to the left ear problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice. Comfortable.

A Definite waste of money for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"They've changed?","review":"I've been buying these for three years, because I seem to break headphones often, so I needed something cheap, but still reasonably good in terms of sound.

I won't be buying these anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is all the fuss about?","review":"Sorry but I just don't get it. Although these are indeed comfortable to wear the sound is by no means amazing or anything to get excited about. To me the sound is very muffled, I don't get the deep base or even the mid level sounds. I compared them side by side with the Sansa buds that came with my MP3 player and there is just no comparison. If comfort is all you care about then these are for you, otherwise I would look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Price drop and quality drop","review":"I got a pair of these JBuds for my wife a few years ago for about $15. They sound quite good and she still uses them. I was looking for a new pair of earphones for myself, and I first thought of these. I looked them up and wow, only $6 now? I was surprised and skeptical, but figured I'd take the risk. Well, my skepticism was justified. These don't sound nearly as good as my wife's despite being identical in appearance. Considering the very low price, I probably wouldn't mind if I hadn't already had a good experience with the same model from years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Work","review":"I thought the price was good however, when I received it in the mail I was disappointed to find that the right side was broken.

I can still get it to work by jiggling the wire at the plug but have to remain completely still once fixed. It is a huge pain in the ass and makes jogging with them impossible.

Also think that the cord is crazy long making it a bit of a nuisance at times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective","review":"I had to return my pair of ear buds because one was significantly louder than the other.

I wanted something that would actually stay in my ears. These do the trick! I had a hard time at first figuring out how to situate them in my ear so they didn't get sweaty and fall out, but once you do that, no problems. They stay put and drown out other gym noise while I'm on the treadmill. I'd definitely recommend them if you want some good, basic earbuds that stay put while working out."},{"rating":"2","title":"JBuds noise reducing ear buds","review":"By noise reducing they mean they have 3 sizes of plugs that make it likely that the buds will fit in tight. None of the plugs work that well with me, unusual ear canals, but they do sound better than most. They are not active noise canceling - this should be clearer in the product description. Good product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product.","review":"I bought these for a motorcycle run I was taking.

Hahaha!I'm not enough of an audiophile to really get technical here, and honestly I didn't care that they had the best available sound quality. I just wanted them to be clear with great sound to a casual listener, and comfortable. So far, these have fit the bill perfectly.The cabling is a decent length (a bit over 4' total), and the buds themselves feel comfortable. I didn't notice any noise-reduction per se, but it did a good job of muffling outside noises.I haven't had them long enough to see durability yet, but I'm not really expecting anything unreasonable at this price point. I feel this is an excellent value for the money I paid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell apart","review":"I bought these because they were inexpensive and seemed like a good deal, but obviously you get what you pay for.

I've never paid more than $12 for earbuds so can't compare them to expensive models, but I use these while gardening, on trains, planes, driving, etc. I think the quality of sound coming out of the MP3 player is quite good. Also use them with laptop when not wanting to disturb others. Comfortable fit for my small ears. They don't fall out easily either. Aside from the bother of losing the soft cover of one of the buds, they have worked well. Another separate deal on earbuds happened to come with a small pouch of those soft covers (about 12 of them) so I used one of those to replace the cover off the JBud."},{"rating":"2","title":"L.E.from Port Orford","review":"I liked this product and would recommend it to everyone who is looking to buy a set of ear buds."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate it.

Bass level is too low. To hear bass, you have to insert it all the way into your ear. It's very uncomfortable to do that. I feel my ears swollen. There is no way I can do that when jogging. I have to return it back to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"These ear buds suck. Worse than skull candy from target","review":"I hate how these last such a short time. My Skull Candy usually last longer than this, this ear buds lasted like for a month. No wonder they are so cheap. If you are financially broke, don't go for this. Instead just save up, and get better pairs that won't break, because if this continues to break it will add up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gread buds","review":"I have been trying to find a pair of earbuds for my ipod that were inexpensive, good quality and comfortable.

The insulation 'tube' covering the wires has separated from the jack - leaving the tiny threadlike wires as the only remaining structural support!Didn't think these would last forever for the price, but I typically can get a few months from very cheap 'dollar store' earbuds.

After receiving my ear buds, I plugged them in and noticed the left ear was noticeably louder than the right. A slip of paper in the package suggested a break-in period before the sound would be at optimal quality. After a few days, the difference in volume between ears became less noticeable. However, after only 3 weeks, the left ear went out completely followed by the right a week later. The price is great, but not if they only last a month. I'll stick with my 7 year old Bose headphones...That work in both ears evenly."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE SHUFFLE","review":"FYI.

I thought they might be better because of the noise reduction. I would say they are probably about as good as my old ear bud. (I lost one of my old ear buds so I only have one).So basically I could have just kept using the old one. I did try them on youtube and they work ok. For the price they are fine. I was happy with how fast they got to me. Once it shipped it only took one day USPS.

There was NO bass at all! I am certainly not a person to be picky about sound quality. I'm not the type of person to spend tons of money on headphones and speakers; I will usually just pick out the least expensive ones and that will suit me fine. However, these were just plain horrible!I do not understand why there are so many good reviews for these headphones on here.

I highly recommended them.I wished that the cord lenght were a little longer, because I usually listen to music from my laptop, and it is a bit short.

I just had to register on their web site. A few days later, a new pair came by U. S. First Class Mail.As for the first pair shorting out after just eight months, it's about as long as any pair of earphones in this price range has lasted me, and I used these more than any others. Every day I took them in my bag to work and plugged them into my computer. At the end of each day, I quickly unplugged them, wound them up around my hand, and tossed them back in my bag.

Moral of the story: Pay more and go with SOny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect, but they've got one flaw","review":"These headphones are insanely durable and have held up great. I've owned them for a year and I've gotten more then my moneys worth. The sound quality is great and sometimes I prefer them over my speakers.The only problem is that the rubber padding starts to wear if you use them a lot over the period of a year. Mine started as a small break in the rubber and has turned into a big chunk dissapearing. But I have really used these a lot and beaten them up quite a bit. So I'm only taking a star off, you can't beat the price and quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Again a problem with one side going out","review":"I was basically satisfied with these, although they are cheap-looking and don't fit very well.

I wore them on a daily basis on my work commute. However, I am very careful about how I treat my earbuds and I don't think I was overly rough on them. I am not an audiophile so I can't speak to the actual quality compared to other headphones; they sounded fine, and I was pretty happy with them. Then... the day came that the sound in the left ear started intermittently going out--an internal wire came loose, I'm not sure--which pretty much rendered them unusable. Very disappointing. I went back to my standard Apple-issued earbuds, which do nothing to reduce noise, but at least they keep on truckin'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comfortable, but defective right out of the box.","review":"These seem like such an amazing value on paper, but straight out of the box, only one side of the earphones works. I was afraid it was my ipod, but testing these with other devices (and my ipod with different earphones) revealed that the earphones were defective.I purchased these to have an inexpensive set of earphones to use while sleeping, as I don't want to risk damage to my favorite Bose earphones. The price was right, and they were very comfortable (even for a side-sleeper like me), where the Bose feel like little rocks in my ears while trying to sleep.If you want them for noise-cancelling, however, do not waste your time with these. Both with the original pads on the earbuds, AND changed to the tiered ones by the same brand, the noise cancelling of these is virtually nonexistent.If you want cheap and comfortable, I say go for it. Just plan on possibly having to return them if you get a pair that is defective."},{"rating":"1","title":"One bud died after 1 month.","review":"Bought two of these and in both cases one bud died after 1 month. don't waist your money, pay a little extra and buy something more durable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Earbuds","review":"I chose these earbuds for one reason: they have a soft tip which I liked for my MP3 player.

You THINK they're going to fall out, but they don't.Oh yea the sound is very very nice...and LOUD. In a quiet room, you don't need a stereo system...you could just use these! (pointless but cool)I'm not sure how they will hold up over time. As most of you know, the Ipod buds are good at first too, but begin to crackle and short out as time goes on. There's a possibility it may happen with the jbuds...or any set of ear buds under $120 for that matter. Overall good though"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sound, Tiny Package, Great Buds !","review":"I was given these buds as an office gift and I have to say that I'll be using them from now on. The fidelity of all my music(which ranges from drum & bass to jazz to classical) is crisp and clear. The buds have a an especially great response through the high and mid ranges.The seal that the rubber fittings of the buds creates a seal that both enhances the sound and is comfortable. These buds are light and after listening for about the first 15 minutes my ears didn't hurt from the pressure of the phones being in my ear.I like how the detent for that determines how much slack the split of the cord has slides. Now I can adjust how the cord hangs, this is something I liked about older headphones years ago. The only thing bad that I can think of is that the cord is a little shorter than the Phillips headphones that I was using prior.Get yourself a pair!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A+++++","review":"Great product.

Sound died in one ear","review":"I bought the JBuds in September to replace my second broken pair of the nice in-ear earbuds from Apple (not the standard pair that comes with an iPod, but the $40 pair). I apologize for digressing, but both Apple pairs absolutely fell apart within a year each time and were not fixable, plus I didn't like the way they fit.The JBuds initially felt alot better than the Apple earbuds ever did, and they had less intricate parts, meaning that they couldn't fall apart in the same way. The sound is comparable - I guess I'm not much of an expert on sound quality. But now, just a bit over 6 months after I started using them, the right ear bud has started having tons of static, cutting in and out, and most of the time not working at all. I know they were cheap, but this feels unacceptable. At least they're cheaper to replace than the Apple earbuds, but goodness - how hard is it to find a lasting, quality pair of headphones????"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent spund quality, fits in your ears, fits your wallet, what else do you want? :D","review":"Works well, pretty reliable, good sound quality and doesnt burn a hole in your wallet.

The sound quality is probably the best you are going to get for this price. I used skull candy for awhile but they kept breaking on me, my last pair only lasted a couple of weeks. I even had a bad experience, I thought that I had received broken headphones, but it was really my ipod that was messed up. The company was prompt in it's response and kind enough to offer to send me a new pair of headphones for free, however I found out that it was not the headphone's problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good !","review":"Had these about two wks , did what they said i burned them in about 24 hrs and so far they work great , they have the best sound of any ive ever owned , just hope they last awhile , but for 10.00 bucks i guess you get what you pay for , i would recommed them for the money !"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE these!","review":"Bought these for a trip to Ukraine. (a total of 24 hour travel time) wore them the entire time! Most comfortable ear phones ever! I also love that you can change out the rubber earpiece so that it fits your ear better. I can sleep in these and they are comfortable and best of all, they STAY IN! I was worried about the durability of the earphones because i had seen other reviews that commented on such. I bought the carrying case and they seemed to wear just fine. I would suggest the case to everyone as well. Even if you do not buy the earphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Itchy with Poor Quality Sound","review":"Didn't like these at all. The fabric irritated the ear channel & the quality of the sound wasn't high.

'You get what you pay for' & these were a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"100% JUNK","review":"What junk. The first pair I received, only 1 earbud worked. I returned it for an exchange. The second pair I received worked for about a month and now the same problem happened. Only this time I can't return them because return time ran out about a weak ago. So in conclusion, if you like earbuds that one side goes in and out with static noise, then this is for you, otherwise stay away unless you like throwing $$$ away.Update:I'm giving 50% apologies to the vendor. Although the first pair did not work 100% (even when moving the chord), the second pair (replacement)may work. I bought more headphones (earbuds) and same problem. It has to be my sansa clip 4+ mp3 player.

I ran into good reviews of JBuds and decided to give it a try. It was very disappointed to find out that JBuds didn't have bass at all, it was like listening to the phone. High frequency were fine, the buds fit into ears OK. I tried to lie on the pillow with ear buds in, but it was not comfortable. If you like to listen to music, stick to Sony, for about the same money their buds are much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would be perfect...if they lasted","review":"These earphones are a perfect price and are the most comfortable earphones I have found. I have small ears and most earphones fall out, but the small interchangeable pair of ear buds are perfect for me. When I first got them the sound and noise reduction were very good. However, after about 3 months the right earbud stopped working and I have to hold the wire just the right way to hear anything from the left earbud. I was extremely disappointed that I finally found a pair of earbuds that fit me, but then they stopped working after a few months.I thought maybe if I invested some more money, I would get a longer-lasting pair -- so I bought the J2 earbuds which are about $5 more than the first edition. Same thing happened, I've had them for about 3 months now and I have to wiggle the wire and hold it the right way to keep any kind of sound.Sadly, my hunt for a pair of earphones that both fit and plays music continues."},{"rating":"1","title":"J Buds","review":"Sound quality is good, but they keep falling out of ear.

They kept popping out due to sweating, so I kept putting them back in, pushing sweat deeper into my ears. I'm convinced that these things gave me an ear infection, which ultimately led to a plugged ear, ear drops, and a trip to the ENT.The sound quality is ok but not as good as the iPod headphones, IMO. They are too heavy on the bass. The noise reduction works ok, but your own breathing, coughing, humming, etc., reverberates loudly, also making them not good for wearing while exercising.So, if you're only using these at work or on the plane or while sitting quietly, maybe they're ok. Do not use them while exercising, as you may end up with an ear infection."},{"rating":"1","title":"ouch.","review":"The sound it produces hurts my ears...I couldn't take just using them for 10 minutes.

The different size rubber earpieces offer an excellent choice of giving you comfort over a long period. I have slept with these earbuds and have not noticed them. The sound is very pleasant and for the average person will be very acceptable. Let us face it, most of us cannot hear the entire extreme high and low frequencies any way, so why pay more for something that cannot be used. These earbuds are the way to go for comfortable, cost effective, pleasurable listening to your device.

My big complaint is that when you take advantage of the free shipping offered by Amazon they don't ship it for at least 5 days but you won't know that unless you read the fine print. I guess it's a punishment for using their free shipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful - best $20 headphones you can buy","review":"Awesome headphones. I love these guys and have been using them for about 6 months now.

I wouldn't say that these are actually noise cancelling via electrical interference, its more via sound muffling than anything, but don't misinterpret, with the sound at a medium volume you will kill all but the loudest ambient noise.

(Thanks, J.R.!)Although my initial impression of the product was unfavorable, the bulk of my frustration was with the seller's return policy which left me with no recourse after a 15-day exchange period.JBuds has gone out of their way to make me happy as a customer, and it's a customer service policy that more companies should follow.

Other ear buds I have tried sounded a bit muffled and had very little sound quality to them. One of the ear bud wires on the initial pair finally wore out and I could only get sound out of one ear. I then purchased three additional pairs--one for each of my MP3's and one for the wife, who also loves the sound.

I have these for 2 months now and I would think it is pretty run in.Like most said, it works well with dialog.. when I play my FIFA games.Otherwise, my previous china brand buds works better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great deal for the price!","review":"I use these while I work out. They work great and are very comfortable! For the price you cannot beat these. They also keep sweat from interfering with the sound of your earphone (unlike normal ipod earbuds)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds great (When working)","review":"They shorted out after 2 months. I used them everyday, so they are not good for everyday use. Maybe something a little more casual. Tried finding their website, to see about replacing, with no luck. They sound good when they were working."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, versatile, and long lasting high quality ear buds","review":"I'll be honest, these things should have died on me a long, long time ago. I purchased these almost a year and a half ago, and use them, without exaggeration, daily. I wear them running with my shuffle, in the library plugged into my laptop, on the treadmill with the neat built-in TV, on the bus with my iPhone. And in between, the cord is wrapped around all of these things or just stuffed into pockets - I am admittedly quite careless with my things and don't take very good care of things that don't cost more than a certain threshold.But these babies have made it through it all, and while the earbuds have started cracking a bit from wear and tear, I really don't notice an appreciable decrease in quality or noise reduction. The bass is great, the sound quality good, and I really can't recommend these enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"good, if you don't move","review":"This design isn't good for movement. They don't stay put very well and are always \\"just on the verge\\" of falling out of my ear. I used them for 2 months anyway, until the left ear bud lost it's sound (I think from a break in the internal wire). Now they are trash. My advice, pay the extra money and buy a better pair."},{"rating":"1","title":"They stop working in 6 months","review":"HiI ususally don't review items on Amazon, but thought I would since I am always buying these headphones. They are GREAT headphones the sound is great and I like the black color but after 6 months the right headphone always loses sound I guess the wires get tangled from when I wrap it around my ipod. I am very shocked with the high reviews maybe this just happens to me. This is my second pair that has broke on me I purchased the extended warrenty from Amazon I figure it's worth it since most headphone are only good for about a year. I am currently contacting the manafacturer Jlab to get a replacement hopefully they wont give me a hassle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Right earbud failed","review":"Good sound, but despite being really careful with the cord, the right earbud died prematurely. oh well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product at this price point","review":"For the cost of these ear buds, they are a great buy! MUCH better than the ear buds you get on the plane and of a quality you would find on ear buds 2-3 times as much in price."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great bargain","review":"This will be short. These are the second purchase of earbuds that I made, the first being some discount type in Thailand which self destructed quickly. These buds though were on sale for about $10 each and are wonderful. They do shut out noise, not all of it, but enough to be useful and the sound is excelent. The only reason for four stars is that I haven't got enough experiencwe with other earbuds to compare these to. I bought three of them.Harold"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad while they last","review":"These earbuds worked normally for about 6 months, then just randomly crapped out on me. I guess for $10 I wasn't expecting a lifetime guarantee, but a little disappointing nonetheless. Hope I can find something better to replace them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wore them 3 days ago. My ear still hurts.","review":"I usually wear the \\"Medium\\" size covers for other earbuds but medium felt big for these so I switched to the small ones. I wore them on a flight I took 3 days ago and can still feel like they stretched something in my ear. It even hurts to sleep on my side at night because they did something to my ear.The sound quality is ok but nothing special and definitely not worth the discomfort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Customer Service","review":"I've gotten two pairs of these earphones, one white and one black. Both pairs started losing sound in one of the sides after a few months, and from reading other reviews, this seems to be a common issue. At $10 my expectations wouldn't be too high, but I paid $15-20 for my pairs so I feel a bit ripped off in retrospect.Update: JLabs was pretty good about honoring the warranty on both pairs. I'm currently using another pair of earphones so I haven't tried the new earphones yet, but their customer service was fantastic and prompt with responses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound quality; awful durability","review":"I've been using these for a month. Sound quality is great. However, one of the channels started losing sound after week 2. No sound coming out of that channel after 4 weeks. Not worth the money even at the discounted rate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good for the money","review":"I use these to listen to my IPOD while I ride the train to work in DC. I really like them because they do not hurt my ears like the ones that came with the IPOD. In addition, they do a good job of blocking out noise. I would recommend especially if others hurt your ears."},{"rating":"1","title":"I got what I paid for...","review":"After using these headphones for a few days, I'm not very satisfied. They have poor bass response, they don't fit well and overall, they sound distant or muted. While these earbuds have a crisp tone, they don't produce any warmth or brilliance. I'd read a lot of good reviews on these buds, and it really makes me wonder if any of those people really cared about sound quality at all?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get what you pay for","review":"Halfway decent sound quality, very cheap housing and cableing. Plastic housing doesn't last, even if careful. The wires seperated at the joint and at base of bud, causing static sounds after only 1 month. I am careful with my stuff, but a minor tug will destroy these lame buds. They do plug ears (noise-cancel) relatively well. Cheap, Cheap, Cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent sound, but terrible product quality - Avoid","review":"I bought 2 pairs of these thinking they wouldn't last forever but that I would at leaast get a couple of months were of use. Boy was I wrong. I used these to listen to podcasts when walking to and from work, about half an hour each day. After about a month, the sound from the left earbud on my first pair stopped working. Fine. I broke out the second pair. After about a month worth of use, same story, the sound from the left earbud stopped working. Now I'm looking for new earphones. Bottom line, it's not worth getting these $10 earbuds when you'll be looking for new ones before you know it. They sound fine, but they just don't hold up to any normal wear and tear. Just invest in a $20-$30 pair from the start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Earbuds just what I needed","review":"My ipod earbuds always fell out of my ears, so needed something that would fit well and stay without needing constant adjustment. These earbuds fit the bill. I also wanted the sound reduction feature because I use them primarily when mowing the grass. Once again, they do surprisingly well. I'd buy them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked Fine... But Broke After 6 Months","review":"I had no complaints about the quality of these in the first 6 months I had them. I'm no audiophile, but the sound seemed fine to me. However, after 6 months, 1 of the buds stopped working completely. I do use them every day and they get jostled around in my bag during the day; however, I think they should have lasted longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the trouble","review":"I bought a pair of these in Sept. 0f '07 because Apple headphones suck and hurt my ears. I enjoyed these for the first few months, the sound quality was much better than my old ones and they were comfortable to wear for long periods of time. Then after about four months, the left ear stopped working unless I turned the cord a specific way and didn't move it at all, which was a pain. A few weeks later, the left ear stopped working altogether so I e-mailed the company for a replacement (they come with a 1 yr. warranty). Two months after I got the replacement, the left ear also died completely on that one. My FOURTH pair in under a year also just died and, despite the warranty being valid for a few more months, the company refuses to replace them anymore. These aren't worth the $20 they charge and there are others that are half the price with similar sound that last much longer. Don't waste your money or your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only 3 months...","review":"That's the time i used these earbuds, only 3 months until the left side earbud didn't work no more. I have a pair of Sony MDR-EX51LP Fontopia which are great but the only two problems of the Sony Fontopia are the design(left earbud shorter than right earbud) and the silicone earbud gets loose alot. So I read some reviews from buyers about the JBuds, the majority were good reviews so i gave these earbuds a try. Here are the pros & cons from my experience...Pros:Reasonable priceNoise-reducing not badDesign & exterior material were perfect compare to the Sony FontopiaCons:Sound quality was BADSound volume TOO LOWDidn't last longIf these earbuds didn't have those cons than these earbuds would've been perfect.

I would encourage people not to buy these..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great and Comfortable","review":"These headphones are great. The clarity of the music is amazing compared to my old headphones that fit over the ears. They fit snugly inside my ear minimizing exterinal noise and allow me to hear things I didn't use to hear.The biggest compliment I can give to these headphones, besides the clarity of the sound, is how they fit. I hated the headphones that came with my original iPod. They scratched the insdies of my ears and consistently fell out. These headphones, however, are extremely comfortable. I could sit comfortably with these headphones for hours. They have three sets of ear buds so that youc an find the fit that works for you. I was lucky where I didn't have to change the buds. However, if you are the type of person that can't stand the ear piece inide your ear, I'm sure at least one of the sizes will work for you.I also use these to work out and they have not fell out once. Even when I'm on runs.Especially for the price, these are a great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"JBuds Hi-Fi \\"NOT\\" noise reducing","review":"I just recently bought the JBuds and I have to say that the only thing that stands out about these earbuds is the fact that you can change the buds to fit your ear size, and that is why I bought them. If you have small ear canals these are great. However, as for noise reducing...I don't think so. I can still hear the kids, the lawn mower, dogs barking, etc., and I have my nano cranked up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short Life Makes for a Frustrating Purchase","review":"I purchased these headphones after reading glowing reviews from many customers. An in-ear and inexpensive headphone: What's not to love?!I was extremely satisfied with the headphones until yesterday. After one month of perfect quality, the left earbud suddenly died.

Maybe this works better than I think it would but I'm looking for true noise cancellation and thus won't try these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall great headphones","review":"I bought these after going through quite a few pairs of cheap headphones (2-10$) This is a really good deal right now I got my for under 10$ when the list is 50$ They have good base and so far I like the sound quality. I listen to music all day long and they make it more enjoyable. Take advantage of the deal they're comfortable and seem to be higher end then what you'd get for the same amount of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the value","review":"These are very good, inexpensive pair of noise cancelling headphones... they are not the best, but they do their work pretty good, I used them in flights and they work pretty good isolating the plane sound... just do not expect to be perfect like having a noise cancelling BOSE...

You get what you pay for. The earbuds, made from hard plastic, don't fit comfortably in my ears. After about an hour, my ears start hurting. These are usable, and the sound quality is fine, but I wouldn't use it for an extended period of time. The only earbuds I've found worse are Skull Candy brand which was a ginormous metal gob of an earbud which hurt my ears to because of the physical hardness as well as the undesired shape. These earbuds are quite similar in that they're not thin long enough to protrude from your ear without pushing against some part of your ear. I wouldn't recommend these to anyone except a 12 year old on a skimpy allowance."},{"rating":"1","title":"I liked these to start with","review":"These were great when I first got them, they would fit in my ear well and the sound was good. After a month or two though they gave me an electric shock inside my ear, which was very painful and made me slightly deaf in that ear for a few days. I contacted JLab and told them what happened and the happily replaced them. The second pair worked fine like the others, but then after only a few weeks they gave me an electric shock inside my ear too. I know I never wore these in rain or pulled on the cords, and I was always careful about storing them. These have been the only kind of headphones, out of 10 I have owned in my life, that have given me an electric shock.I give one star to the headphones, and another for JLab for responding promptly and replacing them."},{"rating":"1","title":"decent for price","review":"I really like in ear head phones and have had many pairs but for some reason these just did not fit in my ears.

The sound quality was good, but not the longevity. I used the earbuds a couple of times a week for several months before the cord failed causing the music to cut in and out, thus rendering them useless. When I say the cord failed, I mean the cord base near where the headphones plug into your device. There is no visual signs of fraying, but if I move the cord in that area the music becomes audible again.

I've had them for maybe 2 years now, and every time I pick them up I put them back a few minutes later. The sound quality just sucks.I also have some V-Moda Bass Freq which are good. Only problem with the V-Moda is sometimes they can have too much bass, and the sound isolation can be too good at times.

They were so cheap, I thought I would just purchase again as I had got a lot of use out of them and liked the sound quality.They definitely changed something in the new models, though. The sound quality is completely different. It is a lot more fuzzy and muffled, and worse than the earphones you get stock with an ipod or CD player. Huge disappointment, and I will never buy these ones again. Even the cord is thinner and they even cut serious costs with the packaging.

They do NOT produce any noise reduction, which my skullcandy ones block out wonderfully. I know they do not claim to do this, but when sticking something in my ear, i would expect at least SOME noise cancellation.

After a week of this, the ear buds have become extremely touchy and only work when I hold the cord in a specific position or twist the cord or they just stop working all together.

The sound quality was clean and the bass was superb. However, about a week ago, one of the ears stopped working which I wasn't too upset about because 6 months is quite a long time for earphones to fully function. Having such a great experience with my first purchase of these earphones I decided to buy another pair. Much to my dismay, the second pair of earphones is not of the same excellent quality. The sound is fuzzy and the bass is almost nonexistent. Not only is the sound quality different, but the earphone jack and cord are different which leads me to believe that I either received a knock-off version of this product or perhaps they changed the model slightly.

The sound and comfort is great but I have an issue with the connector. Ipods are designed to pause when you pull the headphones out and sometimes my ipod will pause suddenly even though these Jbuds are plugged in. I think it's an issue of compatibility of the mini jack with the input on the ipod. They are just fine if you plan to use them at your desk but if you want to walk/jogg with them, I would not recommend them."},{"rating":"1","title":"great at first, then broke","review":"I really loved these ear buds at first.

They fit ok, very comfortable, come with three size adjustments. Cord is adequately long (roughly 4 feet). Noise reduction depends on how well they fit in your ear - they fit/seal very well in mine. Durability: they're cheap; I don't expect them to last more than a year or two. Sound quality is good, for a ten dollar unit. Surprisingly decent bass; but don't expect to find the same quality of a twenty, thirty, or fifty dollar pair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommend","review":"good long lasting product.

I've purchased two pairs of J2s, and one J3 pair. The J2s have better sound balance than the J3s, in my opinion. But none of the JLAB earbuds hold up. The J2s I bought two weeks ago are already kaput; the PC jack simply fell off. The other pairs I purchased had a common problem: within a month, one side went dead.I took care of these J2s. I used them only at home; they weren't getting slammed about in a purse or pocket. I have earbuds, from other manufacturers, which have lasted more than a year.Update: I caved and returned the broken pair for a replacement. The replacement stopped working after one week. The headphone jack is flimsy and falls to pieces almost immediately. It's too bad, because for the price the sound is excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"My ear canal is too small!","review":"I know I have a really small ear canal.

She likes to listen to music, but I get really tired of hearing Massenet all day. Honestly, after a while you'd think she would branch out.Anyway, I purchases these thinking, since they're noise canceling, she can listen to this as loud as she wants and it still won't bother me. Plus they're cheap, perfect for a dog, right? WRONG! These are not good at all. They won't even stay in my dog's ears. None of the sizes works right. Even when I can eventually get them to stay in, they seem to bother her because she tries to pull them out. Plus the cord drags all through the mud, and is way to long. No matter where I attach my dog's ipod, the cord still drags. None of the other reviews mention this! We are both very upset with the quality of this product. I don't know what I shall do. I guess I can still try them on my cat..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't complain much for the price..","review":"These headphones sound way better than my regular ipod headphones. Most noticeable is the difference in bass quality. These don't distort at all, even at high volume. There is definitely a break in period so for the first few days I had these I set my iphone on \\"treble booster\\" EQ. How these sold for $50 at msrp price is beyond me. The cord material is cheap and thin, and the buds are made of plastic. Overall very happy with my purchase, I just hope these will last me awhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comfortable, but poor quality","review":"I bought these as a replacement after I lost one of the silicone tips for my Philips Surround Sound earbuds. I'm not all that picky about sound quality, but the JBuds sound downright awful. I've tried them with my Chocolate and my iPod, I've tried all the different sizes of tips, I've tried tweaking equalizer settings in every way I can think of, and the quality is always very poor. I daresay the buds that came with my iPod sounded better. Also, the amount of cord noise is ridiculous. I really wish I'd just bought another pair of Philips buds. They were cheaper, and the sound quality was ten times better.If comfort is all that concerns you, sure, go for the JBuds. I tend to forget I'm even wearing them. But for $20, I expected more than just comfort and a little bit of noise reduction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than the apple earbuds","review":"Great sound, very comfortable to wear.

Won't make that mistake again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality for classical music poor","review":"I am a musician and listen to my ipod to learn new pieces.

From the beginning, I was disappointed with the sound quality (very murky and dull, like you've got water in your ears). After 3 months, they are already broken (no sound out of one side/earbud). I was pretty gentle with them, too, only using them around the house and at the gym. Luckily I only paid $20 for them, but I still feel sort of ripped off. Don't waste your money on these if you can afford to pay a little more for better earbuds. I'm giving them two stars only because of the cheap price, which accurately reflects their low quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nintendo DS headphones?","review":"These earbud headphones are the same(?), but lack features the Nintendo version has. They are the same earbud, but appear to be sold under a different brand:- The Nintendo version has chrome trim, whereas the JBuds are entirely white. Not essential, but visually superior.- The Nintendo version has a volume control, the JBuds does not.The Nintendo brand costs $5 dollars less, and has more features. Why buy JBuds?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Earbuds","review":"These earbuds are comfortable, stylish, and efficient, I have no complaints and would buy them again!

They were exactly what I needed for the office, and the sound quality is pretty good :)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Earphones!","review":"It's very comfortable to the ears. I also like the noise canceling feature. At one point, I thought my roommate started playing a song very similar to my tastes, which is weird because he never plays those kind of songs. The earbuds felt so natural that sometimes I forget that I have it on.Anyway, for $10.00, this is a great product! Some people claim that one of the ear bud stops operating. This only happens if you don't take care of it properly. Any ear buds subject to sudden tension (impulse pulling) will cause some of the internal wires to disconnect. It's your responsibility to not let that happen. If you take care of the ear buds, this product will give you the same treatment back."},{"rating":"1","title":"annoying","review":"Worse earphone i ever bought.1. Never stays in my ear -.-2. rubber replacements attracts too much dirt.3. simply annoying"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disposable & Disappointing","review":"I enjoyed this product, until I had to throw the headphones away when the plastic ear piece fell off and was lost into some crevase at the gym. The cord on the headphones is alot longer than many headphones, so I also had to wrap the cord around my ipod so it wouldn't get tangled while I exercise. The sound quality is good, the headphones are generally comfortable. The problem with this product is the rubber/plastic ring that holds them in your ear comes off, as mine did after a couple of months. Once that piece is lost, you CANNOT use the headphones any longer because the remaining piece is actually painful to put in your ear without coverage. Most headphone buds I have owned from Sony & Apple have a foam piece for comfort, and once that is lost you can still use the earbuds without. That's not true of these, and as soon as I lost the one piece I had to throw out the entire set of headphones yesterday. I'm not buying these again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent enough","review":"Sounds good, but the ear buds do not stay in the ear well.

Save your money folks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother buying it.","review":"My major problem with these ear plugs was that they died within 6 months.

Also, they don't reduce noise at all.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry I bought 'em...","review":"I bought two pairs of JBud3M earphones. For the short while that each set worked, they were tolerable. Why I had to \\"train\\" my earphones (by connecting and playing through them for 24 hours?!?!?!? OUCH!), I don't know. But, neither pair lasted long (both pairs were purchased in Dec 2010).

They're junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"Pay no attention to the overinflated 49 dollar price these buds are worth the 10 dollars you are going to pay for them.

I have a pair of Skullcandy ear buds that I think are great. I lost one of the bud covers so I was looking around on Amazon for a replacement. I came across this deal and I bought the JBuds. To me, the JBuds are not nearly as clear sounding as my Skullcandy buds. I like that crisp, clear sound to music and the JBuds have a muffled sound to them. Needless to say, I was disappointed but it wasn't worth it to me to send them back. They sit in my bedside table drawer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but don't last.","review":"I have ordered three sets of these headphones and they have all failed because the wire near the jack breaks. The first ones I had I would wrap the cord around my iPhone and therefor thought it was my fault. I ordered a new pair and took extra good care of them but the same thing happened. Other than only lasting about 3 or 4 months with DAILY use they are nice headphones at a great price so I ordered a third pair. The same thing happened again so that's three strikes and I will not order again. I just ordered a pair of the J3's, they cost more but I hope that means they are better made.If you want inexpensive good sounding headphones then order, just remember they will not last long.

I was way wrong.Pros-very comfortable( after a few minutes you will hardly even notice them)-incredible sound for the price-$20-three different bud sizesCons-little too much bass, but was easily fixed by adjusting the equalizer settingsalthough these are NOT noise cancelling headphones, they block out a singificant amount of noise just when you are wearing them. with this music on you can't hear anything else. Best 20 bucks you will ever spend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial Product, Avoid if Possible","review":"Mine broke after four months of ordinary usage. The right headphone no longer works and there's no reason why it should be this way. They're a little more comfortable than regular Ipod headphones, but the sound isn't necessarily much better, and they broke after a few months! The wiring isn't very well designed because my right headphone gets no more sound (unless I align and twist the wires in just the right angle). Not worth the hassle."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing sound, and mediocre comfort level","review":"This is my fourth set of inner ear headphones. I've previously owned the standard Apple (good sound, but let in too much environmental noise), Sony (good sound & very comfortable, but the cord turned to mush w/in 2 months), and a cheap brand whose buds felt like they were made from a old tire. The JBuds' rubber tips are made of a soft and flexible rubber material, but I find the shape and depth unpleasant. They don't block environmental sound as well as the Sony, and, unlike any headphones I've previously owned, the sound is muffled and flat. It's remarkably uncrisp, even for mp3's encoded at 312kbps. Electronica is tinny, classical loses it's richness, and lyrical music and audiobooks sound like they've been encoded at a low bit rate."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Complaints","review":"I was looking for something that fit my ears and wouldn't fall out when I moved around. These fit the bill. I have a small ear canal so the junk that comes with mp3 players just doesn't work. These have good quality sound and are not irritating to your ears like the foam buds. They are NOT noise cancelling, they are noise reducing so you can still hear if someone tries to talk to you or the phone rings.

These headphones only cost be $20.00 with shipping, and they are nice and small, discrete if you will. I could sit in class and listen to my music without a teacher hassling me. They come with 3 different size jells to fit any ear size. The bass is good, and I do think there is enough treble. In a song where there is a lot of bass, it seems to get a little overwhelming. But all in all, I think this is a good, well put together product. I just hope they can last me long enough. I would recommend these ear buds, or the skullcandy ear buds.

I was happy with them for two months when they stopped working. The sound in the left ear came and went for day, then stopped completely. Then a week later the same thing happened to the right ear. I never dropped them or anything like that. I also could not find any external wear that would explain the loss of sound, and yes it was definitely the earbuds and not the ipod.

They sit very comfortably inside my ears when I sit, lay down and walk. However, they tend to fall out in a middle of light jogging. I have tried them on the airplane and had to crank up my iPod's volume to the max in order to hear the movie that I was watching. So, the noise reduction doesn't work. The bass on these is very weak. I mostly listen to the jazz music and prefer a nice reach sound but JBuds don't provide that. They begin to rattle when you add some extra volume with bass. But I guess you get what you pay for.

The sound quality is beautiful, and they fit in my ears perfectly (not to mention you can easily remove the default size, and replace them with one of two additional sizes that are included). I'm so happy I found these, and just before I was about to run out to Radio Shack to buy a more expensive pair of the same or worse quality headphones. And $41 off?!!? THAT's FREAKIN AWESOME.THANKS :D"},{"rating":"1","title":"Make me sick","review":"I read a lot of reviews concerning this product and bought one. It's good in reducing noise, but made me sick to my left ear and stopped using it. If anyone has this kind of experience please let others know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 3 days","review":"I ordered these, not wanting much, just earbuds that stayed in my ears and an provided acceptable quality sound. Well, at first they were fine, not the most comfortable, but okay. Not the best sound, but passable. However, after 3 days of occasional use with my laptop, the left earbud stopped working unless I wiggled the cord and held it just right. Then it just stopped working completely. I am sending them back."},{"rating":"2","title":"JBuds Hi-Fi Ear Buds","review":"Good earbuds. Pretty comfortable and fit well. Music quality is good especially for the price (used with IPOD). Only comment is that there is no stopper for where the cord usually splits. Cord length is good. Much better than Ipod earbuds. Hopefully these last a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, until it broke.","review":"For the price of these headphones, I was expecting more than a month of use before they shorted out on me. Now, the sound ebbs in and out, stuttering as the cord moves. Obviously, I can't use them anymore since the sound quality is so horrible.Before they broke, they were fine. The noise cancellation was OK, but not phenomenal. For the price, if they were still working, I'd say they were fine, but since mine are now kaput, I would not recommend these to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Headphones for Jogging!!!","review":"First off for the price the sound from these headphones is quite good. There are plenty of reviews raving about the sound quality of these buds. If you're going to be wearing headphones for stationary activities you'll have no problem enjoying these things. However if you're looking for headphones to wear while your exercising I would stay far away from these guys. I've tried both running and lifting in these buds, and about every 3-5 minutes they pop right outta my ear. I switched up the ear attachments to no avail. The free headphones you get on planes will stay in your ear longer then these guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW!! a $2 item for only $6","review":"Too cheap for me.Sound quality is very poor.Probably going to leave these laying around so my kinds can steal them as decoys!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ordered pink, but received white!","review":"For such a small item, it really makes no sense to send these back. The packaging was blank and pink, but the buds were white, NOT pink.

Terrible fit.","review":"These earbuds have excellent sound for their price. A definite upgrade for those people looking to just upgrade their standard earbud. However, these are not noise blocking earbuds because even with three different size buds, one cannot obtain a good enough fit to block out outside noise.Thus, I don't think it is justified for this company to call these buds \\"Noise-Reducing\\". That is false advertising. These are just an upgrade sound-wise from ordinary earbuds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy Headphones","review":"Dont buy these, they dont fit in your ear well, they stick way too far in your ear, gives you a headache just after a couple minutes. theres no Bass in the sound at all. Worst headphones I ever bought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with the sound quality and bass response and they only lasted two weeks","review":"sound quality and the bass response are terrible. I just picked up a pair of RADIUS ATOMIC BASS earbuds and couldn't be any happier.Radius Atomic Bass - Headphones ( ear-bud ) - blackRadius Atomic Bass - Headphones ( ear-bud ) - silverRadius Atomic Bass - Headphones ( ear-bud ) - blueRadius Atomic Bass - Headphones ( ear-bud ) - maroonThey cost alittle more at $39.99, but are definitley worth all the money. The sound quality is AMAZING and the BASS RESPONSE will blow you away specially if you listen to hip-hop or dance. I have small ears and this is a first time that I have found earbuds that actually fit. Also the construction of these buds is outstanding. They are made out of aluminum and are extremely durable."},{"rating":"1","title":"product is okay","review":"this product is ok.i dont like the fact that the ear plugs keep coming out of my ears. it's hard to run on the treadmill while they're coming off. the shipping was a hassal. it tooked about a month to get it. it was so hard to contact the shipper especially without an response back for weeks =( it's too bad because i dont usually give out bad reviews. such a big disappointment"},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep looking","review":"I bought these as an upgrade over the ear buds that came with my mp3 player. I wish I would have saved my money. The only difference is that my old ones are better. There is no high range at all. The music sounds muddy or muffled. They are comfortable, maybe I'll use them to mow the yard. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate these things","review":"Aside from them being very uncomfortable, one ear phone is much louder than the other side. I don't recommend them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for less than six months","review":"These were a good value until they quit working. The failure seems to be in the plug - if you pull in out slightly and jiggle it, both earbuds still produce sound. We purchased two different Jlab earbud products in the last year, and neither work anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average earphones, NOT noise cancelling, barely reduces noice","review":"I have to admit this product is at an unbeatable price for earphones but for not much more you can get much better earphones at Target or Walmart. They have Phillips earphones for maybe $15 that work SO much better than these. These claim to cancel or reduce noise but they don't really do that great of a job at it unless you turn the volume way up. Wouldn't recommend this product, buy something else for a few more dollars."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!!!","review":"After switching from the regular Apple headphones, these are amazing! There is no comparison!! I would recommend these to everyone!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT WORK WITH IPAD.","review":"These \\"jbuds\\" do not work with an IPAD at least with IPAD 1. Disappointed as this is why i bought them. They do work with my MAC."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was OK for a while","review":"When I first got the headphones it wasn't what i expected. They had good quality but they weren't loud enough for me. They did reduce noise around me but, i wanted to be enveloped in my music and the JBuds could not do that for me. They were Ok until they broke on me. Not durable enough for me, i use to wrap the cord around my phone and then wires started to show so i stopped that, but then when i would put the headphones in my jacket pocket as i listened to music it got worse to where now I cannot hear anything out of the ear buds. Good for a month or so then trashed, tried to use warranty, but have yet received the email that they say has been sent to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"These are great work out head phones especially for the price. They are very comfortable and the sound quality is very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I did not notice any sound cancellation.I thought the sound quality was sub-par compared to the standard iPod ear buds.None of the three ear bud sizes would stay in my ears."},{"rating":"2","title":"They work","review":"I got them primarily for use under noise-control ear muffs while operating loud equiment. They sound great, but they tend to come out of the ears after a while and require frequent re-inserting.Good value for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"These tend to get a loose connection and the company does not honor warrenty","review":"Overall I like these headphones. I've had three sets of them and here is exactly the problem. They keep getting a loose connection. My latest pair failed after only three months so I called the company for warranty service. The guy on the phone said, yea, that's a problem, send us an email with your Amazon order number. I did that and got no response at all. After two weeks I wrote a follow up. Still no response.Time to find another brand of earbuds!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The price tells it all","review":"If you are looking for something good (or even average), it's not this product. My old KOSS's ([...])died after 4 year of use and those were so much better than these. JBuds's are cheap and that's about it. If you are looking for Sound quality, comfort etc. don't buy these!I would not recommend these to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Customer Service","review":"I ordered these in September and in March I lost sound in one ear. The product comes with a one year warranty and so I emailed their customer service (available from their website). They responded the same day and offered to send me brand new replacement earbuds at no charge. They didn't require me to send my defected ones back. The new ones arrived in a few days and also include a full year warranty. I've never dealt with such an easy and timely warranty process. Their communications were prompt and effortless. Definitely a great company to work with.As far as the ear buds themselves, besides the problem I had which was resolved easily, they were great. Worked well, good sound, and no echoes from the cord rubbing up against my clothes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks easily","review":"I've been through two pairs of these over the past 4-6 months. Eventually I lost hearing in one of the ear pieces both times. Each set lasted about 2-3 of months before breaking down. I would recommend paying up for a decent pair. It's just not worth it to relace every couple months."},{"rating":"1","title":"shocking - literally","review":"JBuds Hi-Fi Noise-Reducing Ear Buds (Black)Rather than simply dying, the right ear bud has been shocking my ear while I am listening to music. After the third use it started doing this repetitively, usually about 10 minutes after turning turning on my music.Although this seems to be rather rare (most complain that the right ear bud dies after 3 months), I imagine that a common design-flaw is responsible.I will be seeking a refund.(Added after initial entry): The sound quality, however, was totally acceptable for a $20 pair of ear buds.After contacting JLabs about the problem, I was promptly sent a replacement at no charge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quaility for price","review":"I use this with my laptop when I don't want to disturb others. It is not truly noise reducing, at least, not in the same way that more expensive headphones are (i.e., using an electronic signal to mask ambient sound). Having said that, it is more than adequate for what I use it for. The quality of the sound is fair (if you don't mind lack of bass). For the low price, you're not likely to find a better pair of earbuds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sound & Comfort on a too long string","review":"I like the ear buds that come with the ipod, except, after a short period of time they one of them no longer works. The JBuds are more comfortable than the ipod buds. The sound is significantly better. But the cord arrangement could use some improvement. I like to be able to wear the cord like a necklace in case a bud slips out, it won't fall to the ground. These don't give me that option and the cord is about 6-8 inches longer than I like it. Overall, though, sound is the most important feature to me and ear comfort next, and these are a great value."},{"rating":"1","title":"So good for a little while...","review":"I bought mine in late July, LOVED them, used them all the time, and then yesterday the right earbud began to crackle and then stopped producing sound altogether. I'm not incredibly surprised, as these were only $20, but I am annoyed. If you want durable headphones, invest in some that cost a little more."},{"rating":"1","title":"IF YOU WANT GOOD SOUND DO NOT BUY THIS","review":"I bought mine due to some of the 4 and 5 stars reviews. I got mine and i thought, what were these people listening to? This is one of the worst heaphones i've ever owned. Comparing it to my Sony MDR EX71SLA is like comparing a Kia to a Ferrarri. I listen to music a lot, from classical, to classic rock, to oldies, to alternative, to chuck mangione..etc.... I listen to frank sinatra and I listen to Greenday...If you want to waste your money on something...this is it...nothing can beat this earphone for the LEAST you can get for your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"JBuds","review":"Very good headphones, especially for the price.The sound is clear and the ear buds stay in the ears. If they only had volume control they would be even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great ear buds...","review":"These provide great sound and reduce background noise quite a bit. I use them at the gym alot and they stay in place and are not nearly as uncomfortable as my original Nano buds. I don't even realize they are in most of the time, other than the great music. Good purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall a good pair of headphones","review":"I have gotten these headphones a few times. Very comfortable, and unlike other headphones, the little buds are comfy and don't fall off easily even when shoved in your pocket. Sound quality is surprisingly not bad for how cheap they are, and in my opinion, these are the best headphones to be bought for in the less than $10 range.I will note that durability is not their strength, but their warranty is great and I received new ones always a few days after I submitted my claim."},{"rating":"1","title":"One bud works, other does not.","review":"What a huge disappointment. I'm not sure how people give this product a 3,4, or 5 star rating. The second day I got these, the left side did not work.This is the third pair I have bought and the other two worked for much longer, but the SAME EXACT thing happened.I thought it was me being rough with them, but now I KNOW with a certainty that it's not me.no thank you, I'll just buy Apple's iPod headphones from now on. They last forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after a month of use","review":"I was listening to some music, and I had been pretty happy with the headphones for the low price. Then the left ear bud just pops in my ear and completely stops working. Don't buy these unless you just want a short term pair of headphones."},{"rating":"2","title":"as described...great value","review":"Item arrived quickl which was great because they were a Christmas gift.

JJ. I am actually worried that this may be the case with all headsets. It has be a little fearful of buying a more expensive set and have the same problem. I have purchased 6 different types of these all under 25 and they all have the same problems as I have stated above."},{"rating":"1","title":"THEY SUCK!","review":"They don't cancel out any noise at all. I'm just glad that this was bought with a gift card and not my own money. I would not recommend this to anyone.

Bummer..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain bad sound.","review":"I'm giving these a \\"two\\" because of one feature: they fit in my ears better than most buds, and stay in during exercise better than most.I bought a pair of these a while back; they performed well enough. Not great, but I'd have given them a three, maybe even a four.I lost 'em.Now, I've bought three new pairs, as part of package deal with MP3 players (Sansas ... which we like a lot) and they're awful.The sound is simply muddy. Not exactly \\"bassy;\\" that would entail some degree of defined bass sound. No, these are simply muffled sounding. It's like listening to music (or even audio books) through a pillow.Not worth the twenty bucks and at the list price - well, that's outright theft."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like these.","review":"I like these ear buds...better sounds than Apple's. The only problem is when I use these for jogging, I completely cannot hear anything around me. The bike riders get upset trying to warn you they need to pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heed the low ratings!","review":"I really wish I had listened to the minority of reviewers who gave these earbuds bad reviews. But I took a chance, and I got burned.I owned these for less than a month. The sound quality was more than adequate for what I was looking for (and for what I paid), as well as a notable improvement over my ipod buds. However, today the right earphone suddenly stopped working. I can get the sound back if I wiggle the cord just right, but the sweet spot for that is getting more and more difficult to hit.In the few weeks I've owned them, I've been quite careful with them. They're wrapped up nicely and kept in a case when I'm not using them, and I don't even wear them when exercising. This short lifespan is a major disappointment. Don't make the same mistake I did. Pick a different pair of earbuds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke before we cold use them","review":"Bought these for my 7 yr old. The rubber things don't stay on the ear pods.

Sadly another land fill item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price","review":"For cheap earbuds these are fantastic. Good sound, fit well and are pretty durable.

I use these to run in. One thing that I really liked was the cord length! I can take the cord underneath my shirt and into my running shorts and there is still slack to wrap them around my ears. They are comfortable didn't really notice them, while running/exercising. The sound quality is decent.The packaging was kind of odd. I know they wanted to save on the packaging, just was expecting better packaging. Also would of been nice if the ear pieces were a bit more stiffer.

The bass level is too high and the highs are not rendered at all.The stupid design causes it to fall out of ears every two step you walk. It is a fundamental design flaw with the soft silicone earbuds. It says \\"the soft silicone earbuds fit perfectly inside your ears.\\" Yes they do but then they slide out in by the slightest movement because they have no grip.Just don't buy it.

It's like 6 dollars so it's not like I was expecting much.If there's one thing I really like about these, it's that they're extremely comfortable. I can wear them and not really notice them, so that's really great. It comes with 3 different sizes of rubber ear tips, so you're should be able find one that fits you.However, these aren't very durable-the wiring next to the connector already broke after ~2 weeks of usage. JLab used to have great customer service with a hassle free warranty, but now they make you return it after it breaks, and the shipping to return this back will cost almost as much as buying a new pair, so why bother.I really wanted to like these headphones, but breaking after only 2 weeks of regular use is a true disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the long cord","review":"I purposely searched for a pair of earbuds with a longer cord so that they could be plugged in to my computer and still give my head a long enough tether to move around a bit.

I recomend these headphones to any normal music listener, nobody hardcore, because they don't deliver perfect and astounding sound quality. They are also very comfortable. I got them to replace my iPod headphones (early 2008 edition) and they making it feal like you don't have anything in your ear, because the iPod headphones are so uncomfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice sound, very lightweight","review":"My ipod's ear buds finally fell apart recently, and I wanted a decent replacement that didn't cost a fortune. The JBuds are quite satisfactory. I had no idea how crappy the sound from the ipod's standard earphones were, until I heard my music with these. In fact, the sound range is so different that I had to readjust the equalizer to compensate.The rubber seal is very soft and fits snugly (there are several sizes available in the package). This really cuts down the ambient noise; I can finally keep the volume down to non-ear-damaging levels and still hear the music clearly, which just wasn't possible with my old earphones.The headphones and cord are very light, almost too light. I jog with these, and the cord is light enough to bounce around, and the noise of the jostling cord travels up to the buds. However, the cord is long enough to wrap around my wrist, which mostly eliminates the slack. Overall, I'm happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great until....","review":"These ear buds were pretty good.

Although I read a few reviews about the connections going out, I assumed the users were excessively rough on them. Since the connections had gone out on my last pair (different brand, $20 range), I was very careful with these. I got them on 10/14/08 and I lost the right sound yesterday (11/19/08). I'm going to try and get them fixed under warranty but even cheap earbuds should last longer than a month. Hopefully the J2's will hold up better.Update: The manufacturer has replaced these under warranty with no cost to me.

Everyday i would unwrap the wires from around my ipod, place the ipod in my back pocket, and go to work (never sat on it).

I returned them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just What I need","review":"These ear buds are very comfortable (they come with 3 different sizes of ear pieces, so no matter what the size of your ears they should work). They are also very sturdy, I used mine for months and never had a problem, unlike a couple other more expensive ones I tried out before finding these. I liked them so much, when my kitten chewed through them I brought another pair. : ) I also enjoy how well they cancel out the surrounding noises, and the sound quality has been great for me.

Even though they come with 3 different size covers, none of these options will make these stay in my ears for any more time than it takes to move my hands from my ears back to my side. It is extremely frustrating, and I have given up. Walking with these earbuds in -- forget it! They will not stay in. Sound quality does not matter at all if the earbuds will not even stay in your ears and you have to keep fumbling with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst. Earbuds.

The fit was great, but what good is it if there's no sound? My point, exactly. I bought two pair originally - now we'll see how long the second pair last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why so many people like this thing ?","review":"Bought this ear buds because of so many good reviews, just got it today and I did a comparison with a headphone then I realized right away the big difference: for the ear buds, the music base is nearly gone. Good part is wearing is more comfortable than many other ear plugs. Would not have bought this had I known all this. Amazon delivery, like always, is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not durable","review":"I got the Jbuds to listen to mp3 while walking my dag at the park. After a few weeks the left side went out, if i jiggled the cord it would sometimes phase back in, then the right side went out. I thought it might be my mp3 player, but after testing i found it was the jbuds. I thought I might have just gotten a defective on and was going to get another pair but read several reviews of the exact same problem happening.Frustrating and disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounded great while they lasted.","review":"The sound quality for these earphones is solid given the price. They do block out a decent amount of ambient noise and they have a rich sound quality.Unfortunately, after 3 months one of the earphones stopped working. Days later, the other stopped. The company did not respond to requests for replacement earphones. It's too bad because they are definitely a decent product but it's more like renting them then buying them if they're not going to last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the price","review":"Sound quality is a little better than I expected for a $20 pair of headphones, noise reduction isn't that great, but its there. Comes with 2 additional sizes of ear pieces, small and large. Music seems to lose some of its treble as well, but overall sound quality makes up for it. Bottom line, if you are looking for a decent cheap pair of ear buds, this is it."},{"rating":"1","title":"They don't last long.","review":"This is my second pair of these.

It worked well for 4 weeks and now its giving me problem with the wiring near the adapter/connector, because of which it doesn't give any sound on one speaker. I have to keep adjusting at the point where there is a loose wiring/connection in order to hear something. I guess I can safely say that the durability is not good at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good enough!","review":"These are solid, in-ear headphones. The cord is longer than I usually expect on headphones, which is always a plus.My only real complaint is that the left and right earphones are only marked as such. There's no way to know which is which just by feeling them. However, this only really matters for watching movies and playing video games where directionality of sound matters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Right bud sucks and still waiting for reply!!","review":"Since my last review didn't get posted AND I haven't gotten a response from JLabAudio, I'm going to write another bad review. So, the earphone came with one side noticeably \\"poorer quality\\" than the other side. As in, when you turn the volume all the way up, one side crackles. And, there is a very noticeable volume difference between the two earphones (at all volumes). I hoped the earphones would improve after the \\"burn-in\\" period. It didn't. I emailed info@jLabaudio and service@jLabaudio, but they haven't responded yet. I believe it is more than a week now (or maybe even more). That goes against what they posted on their website: \\"A customer service representative will respond within one business day or sooner\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding value","review":"A great set of ear buds for a great price.

When I got it however, I guess i got what i paid for. At 10 dollars these earbuds are not very good at all... I did a comparison between these and my regular ipod earphones and i have to say that the sound quality was equivalent if not worse than that of the apple earphones. Yes i did push them all the way into my ear canal and still the sound wasn't very good. They did not fit in my ear that well even with the different sizes. These didn't seem very well made either imho... kinda cheap materials but then again i guess i got what i paid for."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like them...","review":"I received these earbuds yesterday, and immediately began the recommended 24-hour burn-in process. I snuck a quick listen a couple of times, and was concerned that the right earbud sounded great, but the left sounded distant and tinny. I hoped that after burning in it would improve.24 hours have now passed, and although they have improved somewhat, there is still a noticeable difference between the two sides. I feel like I am listening to the left side through cotton.I wanted to like them, but unfortunately they will be going back."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Bud Failure Not a Fluke!","review":"You'd think after reading the many complaints about one of the earbuds giving out after a while of use, I'd have went for another product. But the price was so low that I figured I'd buy two, in case one malfunctioned. Both malfuctioned. The first after 4 weeks, the second just 3 weeks.

Mine lasted three weeks before an earpiece went dead. I would say it lasted for about thirty hours of use at the most.The sound quality was average.

These headphones have one of the best sound qualities ever and is extremely great at noise reduction because it blocks out all other sounds. HOWEVER, if you are a jogger like me these pieces of c***p will break on you in 3 months or less. I bought 2 pairs in a span of 3 months and I stopped using this brand because of this problem. I called the company and they told me that due to my jogging the excess stress on the cords (bumping up and down)and the excess moisture (the sweat in my ears) were user made damages and thus cannot be covered and apologize for such a short lifespan. Really great huh? So use this if you only listen to music on the road or walking places but if you want to listen to music at the gym or jogging I suggest SONY headphones. They might have less sound quality but at least they last you well over an entire year."},{"rating":"1","title":"The customer service never gets back to you...","review":"These earbuds lasted only about 7 months before the wires started separating and one earbud lost sound. Jlab says they have a one-year warranty on their products, but what good does a one-year warranty do if they never get back to you? I left about 3 voicemails and emailed 3 times explaining that their product had failed within one year of purchase, and they never got back to me.

Don't buy from Jlab."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not hardly a year","review":"I am shopping for a new pair of earphones as the one that I bought like these went out and I now can only listen to one side, the right side.

I have less!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Comfy, but lousy sound.","review":"Its a nice price but the sound quality is lousy. It feels like a lot of the sound gets lost in the rubber cushioning of the headphones. The shape of the earbuds even creates more air flow rushing through your ears if you're running or riding a bike, which means more noise. I'd return them if they weren't just $10. As it is I'll keep them as an emergency pair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an Upgrade to me...","review":"I bought these to upgrade from what came stock with the Zune player.

Wow, I wasn't expecting much for $10 but was I ever disappointed. These earphones are garbage. The sound quality is embarrassingly bad. The little plastic pieces to help them stay in your ear are paper-thin and feel as though they will fall off at any second. I thought it would be nice to try them out since they had so many good reviews, but clearly the people giving these earphones any rating above 2 stars must have incredibly low standards when it comes to how they listen to their music. Spend a little bit extra and get some higher quality earphones. It's totally worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't go wrong here","review":"I have come back after owning a pair of these now for about 6 months to say, I am incredibly pleased with this product. (and I don't review alot of products) I can't claim to have seriously compared these to lots of other brands although I have tried at least 5 other earbuds before these and none compare, and some of those, like the JBL pair were over $50. Love the sound, the comfort, the long cord and angled plug... the price makes it a no-brainer. You cannot go wrong here. The only complaint was in the title is included the words \\"Noise-Reducing\\" which is very very minimal, but to me a functional part of the comfort and bass response, (the make up of the cushions). So I'm not going to complain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had two pairs, both broke.","review":"I ordered these earbuds and received a defective pair.

I have really small ears, and the three size choices allowed me to find one that fit, plus, they never fall out!

So I tried the JBuds and ran into the following issues.(1) I could not find an earpad which fit comfortably in my ear.

So these ear buds were very comfortable for the five months that they worked. Do I spend another $20 and hope the next ones last as long or longer? Or get used to headphones I currently have?

I use them in the car when I'm not driving and use them around the pool."},{"rating":"1","title":"My free airplane buds sound much better!","review":"First of all a feel scammed. Buds with frequency range 20 Hz - 20 kHz usually cost no more than $5 at your local grocery store. My free airplane buds actually have more range (20Hz-22kHz). Also the description of these buds and \\"Noise Canceling\\" is dishonest. Only the electronic noise cancellation devices can claim that. The soft silicone which supposed to block out the noise does no such thing. It is way too thin. I can hear equally well with them in or out. I would only recommend these buds to people who have a problem with regular buds falling out of their ears and have some hearing problems on top of that. Anyway don't pay more than $5 for these, they are not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"Very tinny sound, bass is almost non-existant (and I'm not a lover of bass, I just expect the requisite levels.) The buds are comfortable enough and do block out a nominal amount of noise. But what is the benefit of that if the sound is so lousy? I would not recommend these phones to anyone at the price listed here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as reviewed.","review":"Don't believe the hype.

When those gave out after two-plus years of use, I purchased the JBuds hoping for nothing more than the durability of the previous pair - I was not searching for anything extraordinary in regards to audio. They were more than useful - good fit, good sound - until about three months of use when, first, the right bud began to give out, and then about a week later, the left also died. It would be a nice product if it lasted, but just three months is ridiculous. I've noticed that others have voiced similar problems, so please consider this when making a purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"snug","review":"These ear buds really reduce the background noise!

I didn't expect much, but these are terrible. The bass is overwhelming not in a good way. Highs are almost non-existent. They were supposed to replace a $20 pair of philips I bought at Walmart. These were a huge downgrade. I doubt I will ever listen to them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"My thoughts - horrible product","review":"Its only after purchasing these headphones that makes me wonder the legitimacy of the reviews done on amazon...because I don't think I have come across worse headphones in my life.

I have blackberry bold earphones that offer more noise resilience and don't have that affect."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont buy","review":"so, like others, i was contemplating what buds to buy and reading all the reviews. I would say now that i am the person who you read the review and think, \\"maybe he just has high standards for such a cheap product?\\" I didnt have high standards for the head phones bc i buy cheap headphones all the time. the sound was about 1/2 rate of my orig. sansa disc headphones. comfort great, but the cord was too long, and it did not have a good solid cord. i would buy another brand, or higher quality for the extra bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Fit","review":"I do not like the product, it won't stay in my ears!

I think it's ridiculous, such a horrible product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tinny","review":"I got better sound quality from a pair or earbuds that came with my Gilette razor blade refil a few years ago.

Back to the drawing board."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good headphones that didn't last long","review":"I really liked these headphones - they gave me much better sound quality and felt more comfortable in my ears than the ones that came with my iPod. Unfortunately, I just bought them two months ago and they're already broken. If the cord gets twisted or nudged at all, I lose sound in one or both ears. The product itself was pretty good but it's not worth the money since they're not going to last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Sound, terrible durability","review":"Give these a 6 month lifespan at best. I've already burnt through two pairs and each time, after maybe 5 or 6 months, one of the buds suddenly starts cutting out, and then stops working altogether. I'm not rough on them, I sit at a desk in an office; I don't pull on them, don't tug on them, I store them in a hard case along with my mp3 player. There's no reason for these to break as soon as they do - unless you chalk it up to poor craftsmanship, poor quality materials, etc. If these were $3 a pair, sure, I'd just buy a new one. But at around $10 a pair, you might as well buy something you don't mind throwing away. And before you think my experience is atypical, just consider that I read all these reviews BEFORE buying these. I bought my first pair and 4 months later they were dead. Bought a second pair, 6 months later, they were dead. I'm going on right now to buy ANOTHER BRAND that hopefully won't break."},{"rating":"1","title":"Refurbished?","review":"The ear buds came in an open plastic bag.

They worked fine until one bud went dead after only 4 months of use. I thought to myself, maybe my buds were from a bad batch so I optimistically purchased a second pair in May 2010. This time I got about 5 months use out of them before one bud went dead. These buds are bad and I would not recommend them. I gave them 1 star because the fit was comfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless in just under two months.","review":"I bought these and they were way more comfortable than the standard iPod buds, and they did a really good job at reducing outside noice. My issue is that I DID NOT abuse these, and by all visual inspections they appear fine, but the right ear bud cuts out unless I hold the wire at a very specific angle, right at the jack. I carried these around in my pocket, sometimes wrapped around my iPod when I wasn't using them, 90% of my usage was with my iPod on my desk, and the other 10% was on the bus with the iPod in my pocket. I guess wrapping it around the iPod was too much, and it's a shame that these are such poor quality that they have such a low abuse tolerance. Less than two months after getting them, they're worthless. At least they were cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor value for the money.","review":"I was very disappointed with these earbuds. The cord was stiff and heavy so the earbuds did not stay in my ears at all. Also I started have trouble with the sound cutting out after about a month of use compared to my last pair from a different company which lasted over a year of heavy use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great while they lasted","review":"I have had two pairs of these earbuds. Both broke within a few months. Each time, one of the earbuds stopped working. Wouldn't buy them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plug does not work. No sound, some crackling when jiggling it.","review":"It didn't work in either my laptop computer or in my iphone. If I pressed in the connector/plug I could hear some crackling like it was making contacts and even short blips of sound but that was it. In my opinion it seems like a product flaw that could be in common to many of them so I would not buy another one or even a product from Jlabs again. Thankfully, I bought it through a wonderful company such as Amazon so it will be easy to return and get refund for."},{"rating":"1","title":"A WARNING FOR ALL...","review":"Where sound is concerned, the headphones are mediocre. They do a good job of blocking outside noise, though. My biggest concern with this product is that...they break easily. I've bought two so far, each one broke within 30 days, despite my extra care when handling them - they broke for what seems like no reason. By \\"broke\\" I am referring to whenever I tough the headphone jack, even if it is the slightest touch (sometimes I don't need to touch it at all), the left or right speaker goes out. So I have to constantly fiddle with it to get the sound back, which is quite difficult to do; almost impossible. Basically DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"I couldn't use the headsets that came with my shuffle, they hurt my ears.This set works great, fits better in my ear, sound is awesome and blocks noise. I highly recommend them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Sound Quality","review":"These earbuds have very poor bass and poor sensitivity. Overall tone is flat and tinny, and these earbuds have to be played at high volume levels. If you want cheap, go to Big Lots and pay $2.

Don't bother buying these."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for...","review":"These ear buds only lasted 4 months before the one of the ear buds stop working.

I'd be happy paying even a little more for them. They come with three sizes of ear pieces and are fairly comfortable to wear. The only negative I've noticed is that they don't get as loud as previous headphones I have had, but that is probably a good thing in the end :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"left headphone stopped working","review":"Had it for slightly under 4 months as replacement headphones for my iPod. Would have given it 4 stars: decent sound, did a decent job of keeping external noise out for the price. But now the left earbud no longer transmits any sound. I don't subject them to any strenuous use or abuse. I only use them when I walk to and from work. Right earbud is still working fine, though that's not much of a consolation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound while they last","review":"Fantastic sound out of these little things. But only while they last, which is unlikely to be more than a couple months."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"I ordered these headphones on May 30, 2009. Delivery came a few days later; very reasonable. As I write this shortly after the fourth of July, 6 weeks, later, I've already ordered and received a new pair of headphones. It would be nice if both ears worked, instead of just one. Reading another review here, someone had the same problem.

They feel like a hard q-tip in the ear without enough cotton, and they sound like an AM radio. They may sound better after a break-in period, but I just want them out of my ears- that's how yucky they are.Better is theJVC HAFX67B Air Cushion Headphone (Black), though they get tiresome after wearing them as they have a large piece that sits in the ear. Best so far are theSennheiser CX300-B In-Ear Stereo Headphones for me in terms of comfort and musicality, though read up on these and all the iterations of them, and buy from Amazon, not through them for another store."},{"rating":"2","title":"R.I.P.

I'm ordering a second set now. I've used plenty of cheap (and expensive) headphones in the past and these certainly don't seem like cheap headphones.More detail:They are VERY comfortable. Much more comfortable than my original iPod headphones. They sound very clear and crisp at low and high volumes.Here's my impression while listening to several types of music on an iPod Touch:Hard Rock / Metal: Lacking just a bit of bass, but overall very good.Acoustic / Classical: VERY crisp and clean soundsClassic Rock: Perfect!Pop: Excellent. Oddly enough, the bass is better in some of these songs that in Rock / Metal. It could just be the songs that I was listening too.TV Shows / Movies: ExcellentThe noise reduction is surprisingly good. Even at low volumes I can't hear fairly loud background noise unless I really listen for it closely.Just buy them. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"IF THEY LASTED MORE THAN A MONTH","review":"I bought this product because it was one of the top sellers in its category.

I contacted the company and they sent me out 2 replacements and within a week I had new headphones then my pair went out and so did the replacements that they sent I wrote again and was promptly ignored.

The bass is poor, the midrange mushy, and the treble tinny. If you want a good set of earbuds, go SONY. They're cheaper, and sound INFINITELY better. A side-by-side comparison is all you need.

The Sony's are clear, comfortable and inexpensive for $9. The JBuds sound muddy and and drone in the midbass. They do, however, block out peripheral noise better than the Sonys.They're not worth the hassle of sending back so I'll likely just use them as a spare pair.Try a set of the Sonys from a local discount store before you get these and you may find yourself with a good set of $9 earbuds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good while it lasted","review":"I bought the pair towards January end and it's good as dead today (15th April).

There's very little bass or depth. I'm no audiophile, but I know a thin and hissy sound from a rich, deep one. I bought these as a backup to the earbuds that came with my Sansa Clip a year ago. I was thinking they will eventually break, or wear out. I give them hard use, wearing them as I exercise. The Sansa earbuds have pretty good sound, and these were a huge step down. So, I'll keep them as emergency back-up earbuds--but they sound very thin and cheap. Not worth the money, IMO.

The sound quality is very good. I can hear my music clearly - much better than with the last buds I had, and they really do reduce outside noise.

They come with a few extra ear pieces so I guess that helps customize the fit. I of course didn't know which ones would work best with my ears so I'm just using the default ones and they seem to work fine. They're more comfortable than iPod earphones and I can definitely tell they do have some noise cancellation to them. I've had them for about a month and they've worked well. The chord is a bit long and I don't like that if I drop them and they're completely unwrapped, they'll hit the ground. But the long length can come in handy, like when I'm on the elliptical, it's plenty long with out getting tangled in the machine.All in all I'm very happy with these, although in all fairness I'm no expert and have only tried iPod earphones and over-the-ear noise cancellation earphones in recent years."},{"rating":"1","title":"JBuds Hi-Fi Noise Reducing Ear Bud","review":"JBuds Hi-Fi Noise Reducing Ear Bud was purchased to replace Sony MP3 player ear bud that came with the MP3 purchase but broken one side after 8 months use.

I wore these during a 1-hour cardio session on a treadmill and bike and had no comfort issues at all. Also, the noise cancellation was excellent - I was amazed at how low I could turn down the volume on my iPod.Cons: The sound that comes out of these headphones is unfortunately very muddy since the treble response is very poor (I compared them to standard Apple headphones). I tried adjusting the EQ to Treble Boost, which did help, but they still didn't sound as good as the Apple headphones. I also tried \\"breaking in\\" the headphones by turning up the volume really loud for an extended period of time, but that did not help either. It was as if I was listening to a cassette tape instead of my iPod. I ended up returning these due to the poor sound quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very impressed with the sound quality.","review":"Once i put them in my ear and turned the music on, I was surprised to hear the sound quality.

I've had Shure EC2s and a $100 pair of Creative noise cancelling buds and these, by far, sound better than both models. The lows are punchy, the mids are not over-powering, and the highs are not piercing.

They were great at blocking out noise and fit comfortably in my ears, but without warning, one ear stopped working. I've owned other brands of ear buds for years and years (I have an old Sony pair that I bought in the late '90s) that still are in working order, so I'm bummed that these didn't go the distance.

I was going out of the country and would be on a long flight where I knew I would need to listen to my pod. So I ordered them pronto. They came. I put them on and the rest is history.

If Coby can sell \\"Super Bass\\" models on Amazon at around $5 or $6 which perform quite well, I don't see why this earbud should have been such a weak performer. These earbuds are some of the most poorly performing I have seen (at the price). Bass output is way down from that of the actual recorded music I am listening to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be sure to clean out earbuds if you use a lot -","review":"This item is a great value - no doubt.After using my earbuds for a few weeks, the sound started to go down progressively, and I thought I had blown yet another set of earbuds. BUT actually when I sat down and did some cleaning with a tack (carefully), I realized that my earwax had stopped up the insides and was the reason for the sound decreasing. A little careful cleaning and the earbuds were back to their original clear and loud sound.PROS: great value, great sound, pretty resilient, block out noise well because they fit in earCONS: if you wear a lot you definitely need to clean the gunk out every once in a while, I find that running I can hear the cord bouncing (it is annoying, but I can block it out), with them in and turned up you can definitely not hear much from the outside but I guess that is either a con or a pro depending on the situation (perfect for DC metro commute!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"good, but then one stopped working","review":"I was going to write a glowing review for these because I was so satisfied with both the sound quality and comfort that I received with them, but then one of the ear bud's ouput went out. I can only hear out of it if I move the jack around a lot and find a good spot, so it's become extremely annoying to walk around with these on because when I move, the jack moves and the sound in the one ear is sporadic. I took good care of them, there was no reason for them to stop working, especially since I had only had them for six months. Now I have to buy another pair or walk around without one ear bud. They were great while they lasted but you have to ask yourself if it's worth spending money on them when you're just going to have to replace them shortly rather than buying a better, albeit it more expensive pair that will last longer - or if you should buy a different pair at a similar price and hope that they don't break so quickly"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic company! Too bad the product doesn't quite live up to them.","review":"These were such an enormous improvement over the standard earbuds that came with my ipod, but the sound on them died within a few months of purchase - something with the wiring near the plug. I wrote to JLabs to see how I could get replacements since they were under warranty, and they responded promptly and offered to send my the J2 to try out in addition to replacements for the JBuds. I never got the JBud replacements, but I didn't really care, since the J2s were fantastic.In short: JBuds are an amazing buy, especially for what they charge on Amazon. They're absolutely the best quality you're going to get for $10-20, but don't expect durability out of anything that inexpensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Working out & Bowling","review":"I bought these mainly to cancel out noises while I'm working out and use them also to zone out alot of noise at the bowling alley.

I would recommend this for recreational music listening use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great ear buds... until they broke!","review":"I really liked these. My ears are on the small side, so it's hard to find ear buds that fit my ears. These came with 3 different sized rubber pieces to \\"custom fit\\" for your ears, and they worked great... until they stopped reliably transmitting sounds from my ipod/computer. I'm guessing the wires became bent/separated at the part where they connect to the hard metal piece that plugs into the ipod/computer.I am very, very bummed as now I'll have to buy new ones. Especially since I only owned these for ~2 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"I suggest you buy something else.","review":"I've had these earbuds for just three months, and already, the sound is dropping out on one side. I don't expect inexpensive earbuds to last forever, but come on: THREE MONTHS? Another annoying feature about these buds: if you lose the detachable rubber earpiece, the phones are rendered useless, and the wee rubber geegaws are very easy to lose. Thumbs down on JBuds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great at noise reduction, no bass","review":"Purchased these JBuds as a replacement for my son's Sansa Clip 2gb headphones. The Sansa's headphones had a great sound but one side died after a couple of weeks so I bought these as a replacement. The Jbuds fit comfortably in his small ears (he's 13) and the sound is clear enough but it doesn't block external noise and there is almost no bass at all. There are adapters for larger or smaller ears (it comes with 3 sets of soft plastic adapters.) The mini jack is at a right angle which makes it a nice fit on the Sansa Clip. The wire is 5' long and splits to about 2' before you hit the stopper.I purchased a set of inexpensive Skull Candy ear buds and they are much better at blocking noise with outstanding bass performance and clarity. I would not buy these JBuds again and do not recommend them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that Great","review":"I bought this product to replace my broken Zune ear buds. When I received the product, I found that there are small easily losable rubber ends that change the size. None of these fit well, and with light movement they always fall out. The benefit of this product is that it does a rather decent job of reducing outside noise (In is not designed to block out noise completely). Another issue that I have had with this product is that after about a week of use, I noticed that one of the buds was playing significantly louder than the other one. This was not a very good purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"They sound crappy, but what do you expect for $10?","review":"I use my iPod mostly to listen to podcasts and audiobooks, so it doesn't much matter... but the sound from these earbuds is very muffled, a bit like listening under-water.

I've been using these for a few weeks and I like them a lot! They fit snugly into my ears, to the point where I have to set the volume on my iPod down lower than I had to with my old headphones because the 'seal' is so snug. Theses come with different earbud pads (in different sizes) but I found that the standard set that came on them works great for me. Don't expect Bose quality, but for about $10 I think they sound better than most similar quality headphones I've used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love them","review":"I use these all the time to work out with. They're great. I think they came with different sized ear contacts, which is wonderful because I have small ears and the normal sized ones always fall out. These will fall out when I'm sweaty and in my more convoluted ear canal, so if you're working out with them (and you sweat a lot like me) then I would perhaps think about another set. The audio quality is great, especially for the money. And how can you beat the color? They go great with the pink silicone case for my iPod :o) Oh yes - also, compared to a few other earphones I've had with the changeable ear contacts, these contacts don't seem to fall off.

Jbuds includes a frequency response chart on the package which boasts fairly even response down to 20Hz. This is just a straight out lie. These earbuds could barely reproduce low-mids.

I thought, well, these are in-ear headphones, they surely give similar quality sound, right? Wrong. After trying them out for a day, I got curious and plugged in my old Sonys (ragged but still functioning) and the difference was dramatic. The Sonys gave crisp highs and booming bass, and clear sound. The Jlabs, by comparison, was like listening to music underwater.

You get 3 pairs of the silicone ear buds so that you get a quality fit to your ears. This was helpful for me because I needed the smallest pair, and the larger size really hurt my ears.Good sound quality. I think I spent around 10 dollars on these?

Doing back-to-back tests of the Clip+'s stock buds against the JBuds, JBuds fell short by a mile in terms of sound quality. There's no bass, not even fiddling with the Sansa's EQ functions to bring out the bass. Sansa's buds are by no means mind-blowing, but they at least have some low end.I'm simply looking for a reasonably flat or neutral frequency curve, as much as an inexpensive set of headphones can provide. Not seeking out massive bass. I listen at low to moderate volume. The Sansas sound better, so the JBuds will be an emergency backup.

Then less than a week later the sound in the other ear stopped working as well.In short, great headphones, if they actually worked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not durable at all (college student)","review":"I bought this set in early march and starting a week ago...I lost sound in the right piece and I have to fiddle with the wire to get broken sound in the left. I am feeling rather disappointed with its durability. Of course, being a college student, sometimes I put the earphones in a pile of stuff in my book bag..but my previous headphone (SONY over the ear) lasted a lot longer time (until I lost it lol).But yeah, overall...gives pretty decent sound with excellent comfort..but didn't last me more than two months...."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty crappy sound","review":"i guess you get what you pay for. for $10 its probably worth it but wouldn't pay a cent more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"I've been using these earbuds for three weeks. Even though they didn't fit my ear as well as other earbuds, I was pretty happy with them. The sound was decent. Then this morning the right one stopped working. Looking at other one star reviews shows that this is a common problem. I will probably buy another set of Etymotic ER4 which lasted me four years before they konked out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good - while they lasted","review":"I was happy with these. I mainly use them for listening to audio books and podcasts on the bus so they were great for blocking out excessive noise. (They weren't sufficient to help when mowing the lawn.) I can't comment so much on the sound quality for music. However, the internal wiring must be cheap because after two months of use, the sound to one of the buds cuts in and out. I would suggest spending more money to get something of higher quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"good for few months then breaks","review":"This is the second pair of jbuds that I have purchased from amazon. The first pair were awesome for a few months, then suddenly the left earbud went dead. I thought it was just a fluke, and the sound quality is really good at this price, so I ordered a second pair. Same story. Worked beautifully for several months, then the left earbud went dead again. I will never buy this brand again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really impressive customer service","review":"While the sound is not too great, it's good at this price. What makes me really satisfied is the excellent customer service given by Jbuds. Even though I myself was the major culprit of destroying my Jbuds earphone, they were quick and willing to replace a new one for me; as they said, they want 100% satisfaction from their buyers. Well, while it might really have a short life span, considering its price and the great customer service (they will still replace you a new one), i would say buying this makes no regret."},{"rating":"2","title":"good sound, price was right","review":"I did read quite a few reviews before purchasing these earbuds. One review about too much treble gave me pause, but it seemed to be in the minority and the company seemed to really care that the customer was satisfied, so I took the plunge. I'm glad I did. Though I've only been using them for a few days, the jlab jbuds are of good quality and the sound is extremely good as well. I appreciate the case they come in, having damaged most of my previous earbuds because I didn't have a case. The earbuds come with a set of earpieces in different sizes, I needed a smaller size and am glad they were included. Overall I'm very happy with the purchase. For the price, they are nice and will hopefully last longer than all my previous pairs, provided I can remember to put them away in their case before traveling."},{"rating":"1","title":"sound quality is not good","review":"simply put, sound quality is not as nice as my $6 panasonic headphones i bought on amazon. hi range frequencies clash at medium/loud volumes and isn't very clear. not worth 10 bucks"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"These ear buds not only wouldn't stay in my ears, but also gave noise feedback within a few weeks! Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor sound quality, better headphones for comparable prices out there","review":"When I first got these, I thought that the reason why they sounded so muffled was because I didn't have the right sized plug on them and therefore they weren't fitting in my ears properly, resulting in poor sound quality. However, after playing around with all the different sized plugs that come with these earbuds in a quiet space, I found that the sound quality produced by these are actually pretty poor. I'd been using the JVC Gummy headphones and was really shocked by the step down in sound quality. I'll be using these as back-up and going back to the JVCs."},{"rating":"1","title":"broke easily","review":"I had to buy new earplugs only a couple months after I got these, seems the wire came loose on one ear and I lost all sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound bad construction.","review":"These ear buds do fit nicely and do produce a great listening experience, however their construction is less than great.

So I thought I would try them.The Sound is good... not great, but for the price... can't beat it.The earbuds are extremely comfortable.....much better than most.However, to prove the maxim you get what you pay for... these earbuds are poorly manufactured and not reliable. After a month of very gentle use... the right side earbud just dies. After checking the reviews, it is clear this is a common problem.

In fact, the earbuds that came free with my cell phone have a far better quality sound, as are my standard ipod headphones, and frankly, many other earbuds that don't have nearly the high reviews these have. It all comes down to price; people like me have bought these thinking they'd get good quality for a low price, but in fact I'd have paid a little more to get better-sounding headphones. Beware of a $10 price tag!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good for the price.","review":"For under $12, I find these Buds to be very good for the price. I find them to sound as good as my iPod Buds, but more comfortable. They are not quite as good as my Sony Buds. It is a matter of preference, but I prefer these type of buds that go inside the ear. They include 3 different sized silicone tips for a comfortable fit. For the price, I'm very happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"good for a few months","review":"I got these 4-5 months ago. At first I was in love with them. It fit well and the sound was great. It also reduces a lot of outside noise. I used them pretty frequently - during my commute to and from work as well as the gym. A few weeks ago the sound started to fade and the right ear piece started to crackle. Now the right piece is completely shot and I can only hear out of one side. I just trashed them. I'm going to try the v-moda's next. I hope I get more luck with these."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"I was a little weary about purchasing these ear buds, but they have been a lifesaver. I travel quite a bit and my first test was on a flight from Atlanta to Seattle.

They were much more comfortable than the standard iPod buds and the sound quality was decent (though I listen to mostly audiobooks so the range of sound I require is less than those that listen to music). However, after a few months one of the earbuds stopped working. Then both buds stopped and sound could only be coaxed out of the pair by adjusting the jack around the iPod in a specific position, but would fade in and out.

Maybe all ear buds suck like this except sony.I guess I had no idea how great sony was until I had to buy some replacements. Some complain about sony's ergonomic design and comfort. These people are mostly uncivilized fools who don't understand how anything works and with no functioning nerve endings. If you like ear buds for music rather than the constant annoying distraction of their existence I'd recommend those, not that I have any but the old ones I broke and are no longer made.Otherwise, silence or background noise is far preferable than these phone's tendency to constantly remind you that you are wearing them and you wasted your money on them.I think J stands for junior, so this is fine for kids who don't know any better and have no money and hear too well as it is, but not really good for you. You deserve better than that.The fit is fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, except do not reduce noise!","review":"I bought these because I wanted a way to block out outside noise while studying. However, these headphones fail to do that and leave me constantly needing to boost the volume to unsafe levels to drown out even casual nearby conversation.

They are also very comfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"More comfortable than standard ear buds","review":"These are a lot more comfortable than standard ear buds but my ear still gets a little tired after a long trip with them (3-4 hours). They seem to be made well; I have knocked them around a little in the month I had them and they are still working well. They didn't work well when I tried running while using them; they pick up the bumps from my feet (this is probably the case with all ear buds).I noticed the bass does get better after a few days but I mainly listen to talk so I have no sound complaints."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst earbuds in the history of earbuds","review":"This earbuds are SUPER CHEAP and I am not talking about the price.

If you listen to audio for a long period of time using earbuds, then you know how uncomfortable regular ones feel after just 30 mins, or even less sometimes. That's not an issue with these though.They fit well into the ear, sometimes you have to push it in a bit to fit, but even so, They're still very comfortable.They sound good, not the same as some of the more expensive, or well-known brands, but still, they're better than the stock earbuds you get with MP3 players for sure.The cord length is good enough for MP3 player use, but not for computer use.They come with replacements for the soft parts on them.Finally, they're very cheap for the comfort they provide. Considering the regular earbuds hurt my ear so much, and so quickly, i'm loving these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I purchased these, fortunately on sale, and was greatly disappointed. They are not actually noise reducing--technologically speaking. They have silicone ear covers that are supposed to seal out noise when fit in your ear properly.

It does a pretty good job of blocking out outside noise. Sound is good too.

The noise canceling, while being nice for someone else, was also just not for me. I found it a disorienting experience since it seemed to just muffle everything around you, rather than muting it.

It has been over a week and I have not gotten a response from either Amazon or J Lab. So I would say avoid this product if you can not because of the product itself but because overall they're for the consumer who likes to throw money away repeatedly.Addendum: I contacted JLAB and they sent me a new pair because I was within the warranty.

To be honest I purchased another pair of these last year, and they lasted almost a year to the week before the right ear bud just stopped working. I was happy with the amount of use that I got out of them, but would obviously have liked them to last longer than a year. That aside, I decided to purchase these again once my original pair died. It's an economical choice, or so it would seem. So after two months the left ear bud in the my new JBuds is already starting to fade. It is about 1/3 as loud as the other side which is supremely annoying to use (and said use is limited to 4-5 times a week max for 20 minutes to and hour).

The sound quality was okay, reasonably balanced in terms of highs and lows. But I didn't like the scraping sound the cords made when I walked. I suppose that's a trade-off you get when you wear earbuds no matter what kind they are, though I can't verify this because I have only owned one other pair of earbuds and the other pair happened to do the same thing...perhaps others do not...????Another consideration--earbuds vs headphones--is that earbuds tangle ALL the time. This is extremely annoying. I would recommend a headset for this reason.Anyway, a wire on one of these earbuds frayed and broke after maybe six months. The wires are kind of stiff, and I suppose that's why.Though I don't think this is very important, I don't care for the pink color."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Durable at all","review":"These headphones were cheap and working great but after only a month and a half of consistent use the left ear bud wont produce any sound.

Overall sound, eh.Just to use while working out, no big deal.Cord is pretty long, more than long enough to be honest.If you want new earbuds to actually listen to music, I guess you can get these.

They are the same price, but are well built, comfortable, include multiple sizes of the silicone inserts, are noise cancelling, and have great bass response, which is nice when you are looking to get pumped up by your music at the gym. I recommend you check them out, and avoid this JBuds garbage at all costs!!

Miller, I found these \\"ear buds\\" to be a major disappointment over my iPod-standard headset and others I have tried. The base seems okay, but the high-end is almost non-existent and the overall affect is very muddy and dissatisfying... I spent twenty minutes swaping back and forth between these and my girlfriends nano headphones, and couldn't believe how poorly they performed in comparison. And the \\"noise reducing\\" feature is hardly so - the iPod headset did as much when properly installed. $20.00 is no bargain for these mediocre earphones...Only positive thing - the fit was much more secure and comfortabel than the iPod standard headset. At least I learned which style of headset I prefer."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre sound quality, ineffective noise reduction","review":"These inexpensive earbuds definitely won't win any awards for sound quality, as they lack the clarity and brilliance of (say) the Sennheiser CX300-B. Also note that these are not \\"noise canceling\\" earbuds, but \\"sound isolating\\"; like the Sennheisers (and the Shure series) they use a soft rubber earpiece to block out (but not eliminate) ambient noise. For whatever reason, however, the JBuds' earpieces do not seem to be as effective as those of the Sennheisers or the Shures. For this product, at least, \\"you get what you pay for.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor sound quality","review":"Bought these to replace my original iPod earbuds. After 30 minutes I switched back to the earbuds -- these earbuds have no bass whatsoever and require me to turn the volume all the way up just to get a normal volume.

This is why Auto Manufacturers worry so much about \\"initial quality\\" and not long term quality. They are training people to love something initially and then think it is ok when it falls apart down the road and they just go buy a new one. Well if you read through the reviews you will see this in action here. Once you do a Star Rating it can't be changed. You can change the wording, but not the Stars and honestly how many people do anything more than look at the Stars. Good for JBuds, but bad for you. Like many other people I had one ear bud start buzzing after 8 or so months of gentle play. Not acceptable for such a simple product.

Having said that, they are somewhat 'disposable.' The wiring in mine lasted for eight months before working loose. It is more expensive to send them back for warranty replacement, so I didn't bother. If you are thinking of buying, buy a couple (at $11, why not?)I did fix mine, it's not too hard if you have a scalpel, a soldering iron, some heat-shrink, and some patience.Update: I received an email from JLabs, and they are sending me a free replacement - you can't beat that customer support."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Sound, bad wiring","review":"I bought these for myself in June. I found them to be great, noise cancelling, decent range of bass and treble. BUT, after 5 weeks, I lost one channel when the wiring went bad at the jack end. The stiff piece meant to protect the wiring was so inflexible that it ended up pulling the connection loose at the jack. The cost to return and service was ridiculous, when you can just replace them for less. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cord breaks at plug end","review":"These headphones worked well for me for a few months of occasional use - comfortable, lightweight, decent sound performance. I thought I had done well in the hours of research that went into choosing this inexpensive model.However, yesterday the sound became crackly, and I realized they were broken. There is a weak point in the design: the place where the cable meets the audio plug can take a lot of abuse simply by being in your pocket. The cable is very fragile, and with all the twisting and bending it eventually [rather quickly] wears out and breaks. They're now unusable.The headphones would be wonderful if they were engineered with a right-angle 3.5mm plug, so the cable itself wouldn't be absorbing all the shock against the plug.For most users, I'd avoid this model. Advice: always buy headphones with a right-angle plug. See here for example (though I've never used these):[...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Inexpensive, you get what you pay for","review":"I guess I should have realized that when it said \\"noise reducing\\" and not \\"noise canceling\\" it really means they do neither. The \\"noise reducing\\" part of these head phones is the rubber shield, although I have a hunch it works better to keep the ear buds in your ear than it does to actually reduce any noise. You cannot compare these on the same day as any actual noise canceling head phones. They work, adequately, but if you want top notch sound and noise cancellation, look for something with active noise cancellation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad product","review":"My headphones always break at the junction.

After a full wash, rinse and spin, they were rescued from certain doom in that space between the washer and dryer. Tested them immediately, and found that they work as well as or better than before. Your mileage may vary, but in the event that these squeaky-clean Jbuds die of natural causes, are lost or stolen, I will be replacing them with an identical pair without a second thought. Curious to hear from anybody who may have run theirs through the dryer. The sound quality warrants a mention here as well - it's far better than one might expect from anything in this price or size class. These miniature marvels of modern engineering have confirmed my suspicions - this is truly an exciting time to be alive... 5 Stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Long Cord","review":"I got this because of its long cord (aprox. 4 feet as opposed to regular headphones with a 3 foot cord).

Yes the quality of sound is fine, even good, but they suck overall because they don't stay in AT ALL.

If you plan to remain perfectly still while wearing these then go for it, but otherwise I seriously recommend you look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"They are fine as long as they lasted","review":"The buds were good enough acoustically and comfortable enough, but unfortunately, the right channel went out. The wire at the plug end must have broke internally because it would come back on depending on how you moved and held the cable, but now, nothing.

I'm using a Zen mp3 player, and tried to adjust the sound with the custom equalizer, but it could not overcome the short-comings of these ear buds. The comfort and fit was OK, but I could hear much of the outside noise getting into my ear canal. The bottom line is, nothing was positive or redeeming about these ear buds.

Sure enough, when I got them, I had to use the smallest size. It was a perfect fit, not only comfort-wise, but sound-wise too. They block out sound REALLY well. I take a very noisy bus to school and with my old headphones, I had to turn my iPod up all the way and I still couldn't hear the music that well.

The J3's are still a little hollow - these have a crisper sound and deeper bass, now noise reduction was pretty darn good as they drowned out the sound of my BARKING dogs.For the price I will pick up a couple pairs for my sister (in the Pink and Purple) and I will snag a couple more for myself (black of course) I'm impressed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for travelling and for the money","review":"These headphones were a replacement for my apple headphones.

I searched long and hard for some good earbuds and my search has ended now that I have the Jbuds. Not only are they extremely comfortable, but they sound fantastic!!! Excellent bass response that doesn't drown out the highs and mids. They are crystal clear and great for all types of music. Excellent customer service as well, which is more that I can say for some companies. Don't waste your money on anything else in their price range! As a suggestion, I highly recommend that you allow your earbuds to \\"break in\\" for a couple of hours. This is completely normal for headphones and speakers alike. Once broken in, you will notice an improvement in the bass response and overall sound - ENJOY!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Work well with my iPod nano","review":"Like many others, I bought these because the iPod ear buds wouldn't stay put in my \\"small\\" ears (though looking at the frequency of this complaint, I think Apple ought to offer more options for the range of *actual* human ear sizes). These were inexpensive, sound very good (after adjusting my bass levels a bit) and stay put while I'm on my exercise bike and walking.

I use them with my Android tablet (and they were free with Sony rewards points). The jbuds are very comfortable in my hard-to-please ears, and they stay put. The sound is better than average.

Mann leads the reader into the crevices of Indian life whether the drug scene, Bollywood, or in this one the corporate world and reveals aspects of the culture from the noble to the sinful. Characters from central to tertiary are finely wrought and memorable. I would recommend that the books be read in the sequence of their publication since the main characters grow and deepen in a very satisfying way that adds considerably to the stories being told. I recommend all three books without reservation (Ganja Coast and Season of the Monsoon).

The concept is novel (no pun intended), but the execution leaves a lot to be desired. For one, the parallels to real life are so thinly disguised, one wonders if this should be called a novel at all. For another -- and this may seem minor to many -- the author doesn't even seem to know the difference between names and surnames, female and male names, Hindu and Muslim names. It can be really irritating for an Indian reader. Besides, there are plenty of loose ends -- how does Rafee manage to get his revenge anyway? While apparently focusing on the 'modern' India, Mann falls back on the stereotype popular in the west: the land of the Kama Sutra, of incredible poverty, of irredeemable corruption. On the other hand, the author's style is racy -- as long as you aren't asking too many questions.

They're still just as wide and deep as other satellites, only twice as tall.I started out with all four speakers on the stands provided and felt that they looked ridiculous in my average size living room.

Unforunatelly, \\"Heaven's Gate\\" had no point to get across in the first place! The scenery? Beautiful! The cinematography? Beautiful! The characters? Hollow! The Plot? What plot? Cimino fell off the bandwagon. The ending was terrible too, that is for anyone who knew anything about the actual incident. In history: around two people were killed. In hollywood: It was a hell of a lot more than 2 people. The Deer Hunter is one of my favorite films, Cimino had talent when it came to that, but I don't know what he was thinking when he did this. I just have to speak for any Cimino fans that think this film will be a great, step back and keep that great appreciation you have for Cimino because this could destroy it! (I myself had to go back and watch \\"The Deer Hunter\\" quite a few times to get the appreciation back)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately, not anamorphic","review":"I've been on a western kick recently, buying and watching mostly classics of the genre from the 1950s. I finally decided to purchase Heaven's Gate, the controversial, budget-busting Michael Cimino film credited for nearly killing off the western. Unfortunately, this 2000 DVD release is not anamorphic, and it looks pathetic and puny on my large widescreen TV. It is widescreen, but since it's not anamorphic, you get black bars all around the frame. Occasionally there's also a bright blue line on either side of the frame, probably a kink in the original mastering process. It's all very annoying and distracting, and it has kept me from watching the entire 3-1/2 film. Whatever the merits of the film, it definitely deserves a new anamorphic release, or even better, Bluray."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Heaven's Sake not Heaven's Gate","review":"To write a review, you have to give it a star and this doesn't deserve any. I have just read a few of the most recent reviews for Heaven's Gate have to give a rebuttal. I am made to wonder if the positive reviews are from the grandchildren of original investors hoping to recoup the family fortune through new video sales. I would rather watch \\"Ernest Goes To Camp\\" every day for a month than see Heaven's Gate again. I rented this when it was first out on video. Watching this movie was excruciating. I could not view it in one sitting. The only reason I watched the whole thing was to look for one redeeming feature and I never found it. The sound was trash and the filming technique was unbelievably poor. I can't believe it was ever shown to the public."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lives up to its infamously (BAD) reputation","review":"After 25 years, I finally decided to commit myself to watching the entire 4-hour epic that nearly brought United Artists down back in 1980.For those who don't know the backstory, this film from Michael Cimino, who'd already scored Oscar success with THE DEER HUNTER in 1978, not only forced UA to merge with MGM to save their assess, but it also ended the independent, creative run that many new and young directors had enjoyed for the past decade. The decade \\"under the influence\\" which had began with films like EASY RIDER and BONNIE AND CLYDE, officially ended with HEAVEN'S GATE.For it's few good points, the film has beautiful cinematography, good camera work and good performances from the cast. The story, however, is very weak and very, very slow (makes 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY look like an action film).Other than a minor hit with YEAR OF THE DRAGON in 1985, poor Cimino's career never recovered from this bomb, and it looks like it never will."},{"rating":"2","title":"Johnson Country Wars","review":"This was an excellent accounting of what happened in that infamous time in history.

While, the source print is better than many used for other Alpha releases, it is soft, dark in some scenes, has missing frames, and many hits and glitches. The source print was fair at best, neither bad or good.If you like Bela then I recommend the VCI Entertainment version for Return Of Chandu.

I know that sounds like a strange mixture, but the music is not easy to describe because it is quite distinctive. If you are familiar with \\"Sacred Spirit 1\\" and/or Soulfood, then this will give you an indication of what this music is like. If not, then the best way to describe it would be to say that it is a combination of Native American singing, talking and chanting combined with tradtional acoustic instrumentation enhanced with subtle electronic samplings. The feel of some of the tunes is fairly traditional (track 1), while others are more groove oriented (track 7). Listen to track one to give you a feel for the rich mix on this music.

Recently, while surfing on eBay, I came across an import CD release which has 9 of the 11 songs from 'Nancy & Lee\\" plus another 11 that Nancy did solo, and even one with Frank \\"Something Stupid\\". This CD ran about $6.95 and is digitally remastered and plays great. It's listed simply as Nancy Sinatra Greatest Hits or something close to that. I agree that paying over $100 for a CD is crazy when you can get an import for 6.95 or download the songs off itunes for a buck apiece. So why doesn't whoever owns Reprise Records realize they are losing some serious money by not re-releasing this great record. In the meantime, eBay's cheaper import, though not quite the same (check the song list), or itunes, are great backups."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needs to be reissued!","review":"This is one of the coolest albums I have ever listened to.It's one of these few albums where every song is beautiful.Lee & Nancy's voices contrast in a perfect way.

When I got around to wiping them, a little water had pooled in the bowls, but the water had left a dark wet mark that permeated under the glaze, through the bowl, and the water mark was present underneath and on the outside. Maybe I received a bad batch but I have never seen a glazed bowl do that before. Very strange. I was also disappointed in the quality. They appear as tho they will chip easy. Did I mention they are made in China? Aren't companies supposed to state when a product is imported?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected of Mikasa","review":"When I received these bowls, I inspected them before washing them, and found them to be uncommonly lightweight and \\"cheap\\" feeling. On most dinnerware pieces that are glazed and fired, there is typically an unglazed ring on the underside where the dish sits in the kiln during firing. When I ran my fingers across this ring, a powdery residue was left on my fingers, which shouldn't happen if the piece is of good quality. When they were hand-washed, the water went straight through this unglazed portion and left a ring of moisture (temporary discoloration) that was visible through the glaze on the bottom of the bowl when the bowl was turned upright. I immediately repackaged and returned them. This is quality that has no place in my kitchen. See also \\"A Busy Mom\\"'s review. I believe this is the problem to which she referred."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rachel Lake","review":"I am disappointed to report that after 4 months of pretty consistent use, these bowls have not stood the test of time. While I think they are beautiful, I agree with the may other reviewers: water leaks in and eventually stains the bowl. The first three months I owned these I did not have a dishwasher, so would wash by hand and see water stains in the bottom of the bowl if I let them air dry. Now that I have moved to a new apartment and have a dishwasher, I have noticed two of my four bowls have turned almost a grayish color from the water stains and have actually started to warp into a more oval shape.It is disappointing that such a reputable company would create a product that lessens my faith in all their other products. I will say, none of my other pieces have done this, but it was a complete waste of money to buy these. I should have returned them when I still had the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bowls are defective","review":"We purchased 8 of these pasta bowls from Mikasa.

His voice is the highlight of the album, but there are some really good cuts on here that compliment his singing. Ready, Willing & Able, Looking For Love, Anything, Forever, Happiness and Could It Be are all favorites of mine, but the track that stood out for me was Remarkable, the duet with Terry Dexter. If you think that Jaheim is just some new jack with an album full of cliched and mediocore songs, you are in for a surprise because on this album, Jaheim has some material that holds up among the competition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Straight Debut","review":"Could it be , is a slammin hit by this new artist produced by Kay-Gee from Naughty. It is a great Cd with good soulful cuts similar to a Teddy Pendagrass or Johnny Gill But I would have like to see more variety.

He has very beautiful, soulful voice which he showcases on the song Just In Case (my favorite). On Ghetto Love Jaheim sounds a lot like Teddy Pendergrass and Luther Vandross. The best songs on this cd are Could It Be, Just In Case, Remarkable featuring Terri Dexter, Forever and Heaven In Your Eyes. Kaygee, formerly of the hip hop group Naughty by Nature now producer, did a good job on producing Jaheim's debut. This is a good cd and I recommend anyone to buy it if they want to hear good R & B."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never Judge a book by its cover.","review":"I must say at a first glance I looked at Jaheim and thought \\"try-hard Hardcore rapper\\" without even listening to his album.One day I asked my friend to grab me a few tracks off the net and after hearing his music, my immediate thought was that Jaheim sounded so much like Luther Vandross! Being someone who actually LIKES to spend money on CDs (instead of rip artists off by just downloading the music) I went to the store and picked up a copy of the album. What I heard was some great music from a talented artist.Looking For Love, Just In Case, Heaven In My Eyes and Forever are amongst my favourite tracks.

I fell in love with it the first day I bought it and so did my wife. The sultry sounds of Remarkable, Heaven in my Eye's, You make me Whole remind me of Old school joints from the Stylistic's, Blue Magic and the Dramatics. Lookin for Love is really a classic as far as I'm concerned with it's smooth rythmn and hypnotic flow and Just in Case has a very deep message to never take anything for granted and live to the fullest each day. At times he sounds like Luther Vandross (Big Luther not Lil' Luther). The joint with Next \\"Anything\\" is great for the ladies. For all music purest this is a must have CD.

They are, in no particular order: It's about too many people and not one of them gets a thorough development--it's just snipets of lots of people's lives. It's only about women--how boring! The men in the book are in the background and hardly even named. This means only mother-daughter relationships are discussed, and it makes for pretty monotonous fare by the end of the book. Finally, the theme of rebellion against old world culture has potential, but the author gives it a very one-dimensional treatment. Simply move away from home and drink too much and you're saying something new and different about living in the American melting pot? In short, I though this book was shallow. I wouldn't have finished it if not for the book group I read it for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible writing","review":"If you have had any exposure to good literature, you will find this novel nearly insufferable. The symbolism is cliche, narrative style predictable and unoriginal, and the book as a whole is this woman's self-indulgent notion that the story of her family makes a good read. If she had any creative ability, she could use her family history as a starting point, but she does very little to distinguish her writing as exciting and fresh. Dull, dry, predicatable, callow, and unfortuantly a requirement from a lit professor who has insulted my eight semesters as an English student."},{"rating":"2","title":"A family story.","review":"I recommend this book for women who have struggled with their relationship with their mothers & their \\"feminine\\" heritage. That pretty much covers all women doesn't it? The story is scattered at times, as voices from differents times and eras appear and reappear. Once you detect the rhythym, it's a lovely book. Not all the characters are likeable. The men are 2 dimensional or invisible. The sadness can be overwhelming. But, Ms.Pietrzky gripped the core of my connection with my family (a fairly non-ethnic group) and forced me to examine feelings I like to ignore. I hope other readers have the same response.

I wasted hard earned $16 on something that even does not taste like a regular cheap washed out tea bags one can buy at any no-frills grocery store. If you never had a real Oolong Tea (like Pete's Phoenix Mountain Oolong) you may be fooled into believing that Oolong Tea tastes like this product. I think it sucks big time and I think potential victims should know the truth about it.

I did not enjoy the flavor of this tea and maybe it's due to my like of simple/common oolong teas versus the fancy-grades which seem too complex for me. The description on the box labels it as a \\"sweet and delicate tea with reddish colour\\"... but personally, I have to disagree with that description. It was more of a perfumed sweetness with a hint of bitter aftertaste, not delicate at all. Everyone has different tastes and most likely I'm the odd one in the bunch.

For oolong in a tea bag, my current choices are Bigelow Chinese Oolong and Foojoy Wuyi Oolong Tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Oolong","review":"I have previously had inexpensive Oolongs served at Chinese resturants and the Bigelow brand tea. This tee is much different, and in my opinion, much worse. The teas I've had previously carried a much stronger and longer flavor. The Twinings tea has a very weak taste with a short, lackluster aftertaste, regardless of the steeping time. It should also be noted that the contents of the tea bag may only be described as \\"dust\\", even more so than the average inexpensive, grocery-store teas. In fact, it tastes almost exactly as Bigelow brand teas do upon their second steeping. I wouldn't dare attempt to twice steep this Twinings tea. This latter point and the \\"weak\\" taste give me the suspicion that this tea contains primarily green elements, rather than black elements -- those new to Oolong with a taste for black teas or whom already enjoy a strong Oolong should avoid this tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twinngs China Oolong Tea","review":"I was dissapointed in the tea.

Still, there are treasures on this album, like \\"Only One Winner\\" & \\"How Can You Call That Beautiful.\\" Their loose, snotty cover of \\"Kicks\\" has a punk edge. Nazz fans mourn the band not least of all because they were a band, Todd's control not withstanding. & Todd, without a band like this, stumbled through a solo career that never got over big time (despite the loud noises made by his devotees) & wavered between genius & genuine atrocity.

It doesn't come with one of those snap on covers which never stay on anyway. Instead, you just disconnect the power cord and throw the whole thing in the wash which is pretty handy. The two-hr shut off is awesome and the heating pad comes with 4 warmth levels instead of the usual three which comes with most other brands. However, I must give it only 4 stars for two reasons: 1. the claim King Size is quite a far cry from the truth. This heating pad is smaller than most regular sized heating pads so I am not sure why it is labeled \\"King Size\\". 2. They do tend to die much faster than other brands. In my past experiences this brand never lasts very long. Despite the above 2 negatives, I still purchase this brand for the comfort level =D.

I followed McDougall's plan for almost a year. If it had been just me, I would have found it much easier to do. But as a busy mom with a dedicated carnivore for a husband, it became too hard to keep up with. I also question the concept of keeping one's fat intake to 10 grams a day or less. I found my body needed more to keep my hair and skin healthy. As well, my system needs the amino acids found in animal proteins to keep functioning properly. But all in all, for what it is, this book (and plan) is the gold standard, and can be of real benefit to many people. The recipies are easy and delicious, and easy to follow. I still use some of them to this day."},{"rating":"1","title":"While I might be interested in this book...","review":"I find it absurd that the Kindle version costs almost six dollars more than a NEW paperback version.

The McDougalls' Quick and Easy has been indispensable in that endeavor; of all the vegan cookbooks I have acquired, this one is the most used (and most stained!). The recipes are simple and, as the title promises, fast, without many hard-to-find or exotic ingredients. This cuisine is not fancy, which is part of its appeal; it's good, hearty \\"home food,\\" designed for maximum flavor, satisfaction and health.The book features a lot of Tex-Mex dishes, a cuisine that is not a favorite in our house, but many of Mary McDougall's delicious chilis, pasta-and-bean entrees and soups have become staples. The Spicy Lentil Soup (with red lentils and frozen hash brown potatoes) is outstanding. The health and nutrition tips sprinkled throughout the book are helpful, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great HOW-TO cookbook for vastly improved health","review":"After reading a compelling book of scientific research (\\"The China Study\\" by Colin Campbell PhD), my husband and I were thoroughly convinced that minimizing dairy and meat intake could significantly reduce our chances of getting Western Diseases (cancer, heart disease, diabetes, autoimmune diseases, etc). Though we didn't have any of these problems (yet), we still saw health benefits within 6 weeks of minimizing dairy & meat so are hooked. But \\"The China Study\\" is not a HOW TO book. Thank goodness for \\"The McDougall Quick & Easy Cookbook.\\" It is a superb HOW TO book that put the ideas, methods and recipes into our hands for a much easier transition to this healthy and tasty style of eating. The DVD \\"McDougall Made Easy\\" is even better for getting up to speed (though much fewer recipes than this cookbook).

As I try each recipe, I make notes on the pages about ingredients I've altered, what I served with the meals, and how much we liked the recipe - that way I can quickly flip through the book when I make my grocery list and I don't have to rack my brain to remember which ones we liked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Racing Tactics","review":"This is the best of the Dr. Walker books.

But I've also heard many of the same people rave about awful films like Silent Hill.If you're into horror movies and the zombie genre, you don't want to miss this movie.It has everything it needs and more. Very cool graphics, and the film is shot very well.I'm a big horror buff, and I love zombie movies.

Lame nude scenes to make up for the bad plot, I could go on and on but a word of advice, DO NOT RENT THIS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Bad as Street Fighter...Is that a good thing?","review":"Wow, the director really did a hack job on this one. The story was simple enough, but it was packed with cliches. Action scenes are interrupted by clips from the video game so many times that I was screaming \\"OK, I GET IT, THIS MOVIE IS BASED ON THE GAME! NOW STOP!\\"Every opportunity to mess up a scene was taken by the director and its not gory enough to be decent zombie film. If you like zombie films, skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lamest Movie Ever","review":"If you want to see lame acting, pointless nudity, poorly done action scenes, and horrible direction, this is the movie for you. These kinds of movies give \\"Video Game to Movie\\" movies a bad name. What was the point of flashing footage from the game in the movie?? The opening credits where kinda cool but it should have stopped there. The soundtrack is good...but it is the only good thing about this movie. If you want a good zombie horror flick check out Resident Evil and 28 Days Laters (not really zombie but close enough). This movie was so bad I didn't even finish watching it. Just say no to \\"House of the Dead\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely worth even one star","review":"It's hard to find appropriate language to describe what is a truly awful movie. I hired this out (so glad now that I didn't waste my money buying it) with the hope that it would be in the same vein as House of 1000 Corpses. No such luck. Though the cover showed promise - a creepy house, hideous zombies, etc, there is absolutely nothing in this film worth watching.The frequent flashes of video game clips are damned irritating, and the shoot-out scene in the middle of the film is over-extended and over-done.The most involved that the story gets is when the young male model sacrifices himself in an explosive mini-climax - but not necessarily because it was the noble and right thing to do, but rather because his face had been horribly scarred by mutated blood (or something similar), and he could no longer see a reason for going on living. Because, of course, we all know that physical beauty is the be all and end all of life."},{"rating":"1","title":"REALLY, REALLY, REALLY BAD","review":"Shows how not to make a movie. Bad filmmaking, editing, acting, you name it, this movie lacked it. It just shows how our society will milk anything for a buck. Should have went directly to video. The video game this was based on is great, this certainly can't be compared to that video game, or even a really, really, really, bad horror movie. This just plain sucked...even more so than House Of A 1,000 Corpes."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would rather have my dog vommit on my face","review":"(...)No plot, bad acting and effects, it should of been called Shack of the dead. It had nothing to do with the video game exept for the repetative snipets of the game every five minutes.

I like how the common ravers were able to do matrix style moves and control their weapons (from out of no where) with perfect accuracy.(...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"one star is being generous","review":"This movie is total trash. Some kids are so desperate to get to a party that they shell out 1,000 dollars to some stranger to take them to the island. A Cost Guard boat is trying to stop the stranger from leaving dock but the kids are still more than willing to let him take them to an island just to go to a rave. This is only the beginning of the stupidity. They get to the island and find out that all the kids have either been killed or turned to zombies. Without spoiling the rest they get a lot of firearms and become martial arts experts in a matter of seconds and the fight with the zombies ensues. The cuts to the video game scenes through out the movie was both stupid and annoying. While they were fighting the zombies I wasn't sure if they were trying to create a zombie movie or a rip off of the matrix. Horrible acting and holes in the plot doom this movie. This is by far one of the worst movies of all time. Avoid at all cost or suffer the consequences."},{"rating":"1","title":"A COLONOSCOPY IS MORE FUN TO WATCH","review":"It's not a good zombie flick.They are selling an X-Box Game.It's odd how marketing somehow shapes movies.

Not a good place to start in making a film about anything.They have filmed Colonoscopy procedures. WAIT A MINUTE...that's brilliant.

I have literally seen dozens of zombie movies with no budget that were better than this. The most annoying aspect is the splashes of footage from the Sega game mixed into the story. The movie borrows heavily from Romero (boarded up survivors in an old house), but there is no substance. You will definitely pull for the zombies in this movie since all the humans are bad actors that deserve to be a zombie feast. I do have to give credit for a few gory zombie deaths, with one star given for gratuitous zombie head explosions and a second star given for gratuitous nudity. One last point - the techo music during the fight scenes(ala The Matrix) sounds like it was composed on a Casio keyboard. This movie is bad but not funny bad. Watch only if every other horror movie is missing from the video store."},{"rating":"1","title":"SIMPLY AWFUL.........","review":"Thank Goodness again for the opportunity to buy previously viewed movies!!!!!!!

Also because usually my friends and I go to the dollar stores at the mall to buy $1 movies that are really bad so we can quote them and laugh at them.

However, where were they in the game this movie is based on. I'm not an expert on the House of the Dead game series but I have threw enough quarters at the game in the arcade to know that this movie only shares the name with it. I believe Uwe Boll looked at the box for the game and decided to come up with his own ideas after that.

Maybe it'll help us.\\" When the kids have the chance to get of the island on a boat they are to scared because their might be a couple of zombies on the boat.

No, it's even worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Disappointment Here","review":"Not that I was expecting much from a movie based on a video game with horrible acting, 'House of the Dead' didn't really disappoint me since I wasn't really expecting much. That being said, it was still a bad movie. The acting is just as good as in the games, bad. The thing that really got under my skin was that they used scenes from the blocky game in this movie. The fight scenes were also bad, the constant spinning camera around the actors had me convince that the camera must have been trapped in a small tornado. The zombies were also lacking in the make up department. Overall, a bad movie that is only good for laugh value. The movie just so cheesy, it's funny.

This is quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you buy this, you've got no one to blame but yourself.","review":"DANGER, DANGER! I think it would physically pain me to know that anyone willingly bought this DVD, so hopfully, if you were even subconsciously considering buying this, you will read this and there will be no doubt that there exists no worse way to spend money than buying this DVD. The money I spent seeing this was money I would have done better to put into a paper shredder. Actually, I could have recycled money put into the shredder so that could have at least helped the environment. This, on the other hand, actually probably killed some of my brain cells, and that's even with me walking out after a half hour.

My friends and I turned it off after only about the first thirty minutes. Everything about it was awful.The snippets that replaced the action in the movie was a lame mistake. What's the point in making a horror film if the audience doesn't even get to see the action? I thought that was what made a horror movie scary.I've seen Halloween costumes that looked far better than the costumes and makeup in this movie. The actors could not act. Besides that, there were about three scenes with topless girls just in the first 15 minutes. It was plain ridiculous.Spend your money on something better. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.

This is an abomination to the zombie genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never base a movie off a videogame again","review":"I can picture the directors when they finished this movie. \\"Hey since this movies sucks so bad, lets just show alot of scenes with topless chicks.\\" The story sucked, the acting sucked, the logic of it sucked, even the nudity sucked. Basically there wasn't one good thing about this movie except to please junior high kids with the nudity. The actions scenes were fake and the zombies looked stupid. The worst part was that flashes from the game kept appearing on screen. Was this some kind of subliminal message, or were the directors stupid enough to think that we couldn't remeber what movie we were watching. Pure crap. Instead rent Cabin Fever or Wrong Turn for a good horror movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is everyone scared of?","review":"I'm not going to mention how bad the acting was, everyone else did that for me, but geesh!

Also, the fight scene to get into the house lasted forever, of course everything takes longer in bullet time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is everyone scared of?","review":"I'm not going to mention how bad the acting was, everyone else did that for me, but geesh!

Complete with techno-rave music our heroes bounce from quest to quest level to level trying to escape Zombies. Each time they succeed in making it to one safe house the number of zombies increase. They have to cross waters and forest. Hide in houses all as their numbers dwindle at each level. The video game feel is actually refreshing but like all Boll adaptations it really is substandard. Unfortunately I still like this one. One note to Smallville fans....Erica Durance (Lois Lane) has a topless swim before being killed early in the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uhhh...what?","review":"So bad...so bad. I checked this out recently because I love horror films, and as dumb as it sounds, I remember playing the game version of this at a local arcade and loving it. I'm pretty familiar with the awfulness of Uwe Boll's work, but this really takes the proverbial cake.

I say this as a fan of good horror flicks as well as those that are so bad that they're good! Sometimes it's fun to watch a really low budget, bad horror movie. However, I found no redeeming quality to this movie whatsoever. I'll never get those 90 minutes back. Don't make the same mistake I did. If you want a good zombie movie, watch Zombi 2 or Dawn of the Dead again. If you want a horror movie that is so bad that it's good, watch Bad Taste or heheheh...The Dead Hate the Living.

The result is the worst editing I've seen since \\"the Banana Splits\\". O.K., so this type of movie must be seen as tongue-in-cheek anyway, but even when you don't take it seriously this is still all quite lame. The characters are papers thin, and the action is pretty incoherent. Only Prochnow adds a touch of class to an otherwise struggling movie, perfectly cast in his role as a veteran smuggler.

Picture and sound are good on the DVD and if you just want to try out 6.1 DTS on a new system (and don't mind horrible techno music) then rent this DVD.

The random transitions using clips from the arcade game were just ridiculous...the whole film was truly idiotic and just really, REALLY bad. Filmmaking at its WORST! I can't believe I'm typing this, but this movie made Freddie vs. Jason seem Oscar-worthy. This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen.

All that said, I have seen this movie four times. This is one of the most hilarious movies I have ever seen. The trick to enjoying this movie is you get a bunch of your friends together and pull an \\"MST3K\\", I promise you will not run out of material.

He also just made Alone in the Dark, which looks to be another movie that is based on a video game that will be absolutely dreadful. The game is good, but from the commercials for Alone in the Dark it seems that yet again a movie steals a video games name for name recognizition only.Ignore House of the Dead.

There is nothing funny about those speech bubble/info facts popping up every 10 seconds saying something not even remotely humorous.And then there is the fart gags, a fart joke can be hilarious, but not when it's a fart sound effect thrown in for the hell of putting one in there. Even 3 year olds wouldn't be laughing at it, maybe a 2 year old might find it funny, but this is not a movie for a 2 year old.Take my word on it, you will never kick yourself for avoiding this movie, I wouldn't even watch this again if it was on TV or someone paid me 100 bucks to view it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm the most generous...","review":"I'll start by saying that I do agree with most of the reviewers here, the movie was really bad. One of the stars I gave is for the good looking cast, unfortunately they can't act at all. Only at the beginning of the movie there are a few moments that makes you jump reason why I gave another star (2 in total), but after that, the movie gets ridiculous, no action, no good video effects (they ran out of $$ I bet) bad acting gets even more stupid, the fighting is horrendous, and the scenes of the game included in the movie don't help at all, instead they make it worst. At the end I was laughing so much, not because it's a good funny movie, but because I could not believe I was watching such an idiotic movie that I spent $8.00 to own. That been said, the only reason to watch it, is to laugh while you discover all the fails and lacks in directing, acting, editing, etc"},{"rating":"1","title":"HOUSE OF CRAP","review":"This was one of the worst movie ever made to cinema.

Filled with terrible acting, plot holes galore, a poor script, poor direction, and incoherent action; House of the Dead isn't even one of those movies that's so bad it's good, it's just plain bad. The flashes of shots from the Sega video game that inspired it are completely unnecessary to say the least, and the look of the film as a whole is just plain dumb. Poor Jürgen Prochnow (Das Boot, In the Mouth of Madness) is stuck in the film as the captain of the boat (his last name is Kirk, hardy har) and Clint \\"brother of Ron\\" Howard is his perfectly weird mate, while Jonathan Cherry (Final Destination 2) is the only other recognizeable actor in this whole mess.

They also do this because they probably ran out of money after filming the lengthy shoot-em-up sequence. The big fight to the house was about 5 minutes too long and used the bullet time poorly.The costumes were ok, but the acting was absolutely terrible.

To begin, the director uses quick cuts to actual video game footage to save on the special effects when killing zombies ( which look like people in burlap sacks ). Also, there is extensive use of a 360 degree camera shot - which makes the movie seem stupid and dizzying. The acting is HORRIBLE - lines that don't make any sense and you never feel bad for them because they are so STUPID. The writing is even worse - there is no continuity in the movie at all.

Aside from over endulgence in gore let's talk acting here. Now I know that in these types of movie acting shouldn't matter, but here it is plain bad. Stilted actors and lame dialog.I usually like a Dead movie, been a fan ever since as a boy it took me 7 tries before I finally made it all the way through the origianl 'Night of the LIving Dead' (which in my opinion is the best of any). But this one was bad.No sense of logic, the heroes extracate themselves from a 'hopeless' situation near the end oh so easily, and don't get me started on the ending fight sequence.

You actually start wanting these dumbasses to be killed off in a manner just as slow and as horrible as having to sit through this movie. Then leave a tease like there will be a sequel.

I'm very dissapointed and would NOT recommend this to anyone with a brain, except the jokers that approved, produced and made it. They should be forced to watch it over and over for at least a week straight. Perhaps, after really watching their own poison, they'll stop releasing these horrible movies?

He did, however, write a report from the land of the terminally ill that is unsentimental and painful, with occasional flashes of illumination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Difficult to find but important text","review":"It is unfortunate that this work is no longer in print. It is still available through the library and well worth searching to find through inter-library loan. Wilson relies heavily on the research of Adolf Harnack (seeMarcion: The Gospel of the Alien God) and adds little more to those findings. However, where Harnack's work is sometimes difficult to follow and, at times even tediously detailed, Wilson provides a more readable text. Like Harnack, Wilson seems also to spend a great deal of time defending Marcion's views rather than attempting to be objective. And, since Wilson relies so heavily on Harnack, the topics ignored by one are ignored by both leaving some gaps of understanding we could have filled. Both are good works. Harnack is more detailed and would be best for the serious student while Wilson's style will be favored by most."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aww - It's not really sooo bad!","review":"Another review of this disc found it lacking in content and vocal quality, but I personally found it light and fluffy! This collection includes Debbie's smash 50's hit \\"Tammy\\", a breathy teeny-bopper concoction with a cheesy string arrangement that serves as an exemplary period piece (if you're looking for throw-away pop). If a listener were looking for something more adult or with more depth, perhaps Sarah Vaughn or Julie London or Ella would be more your speed. I'd advise would-be buyers to listen to the song samples on the amazon site before purchasing, just in case this type of pop/kitsch isn't your \`cup of tea'.Finally, I thought the recording quality was quite good. Her production team seems to have put a good deal of time into these arrangements, thought they are a little syrupy for my taste. Good luck!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This ani't your singing in the rain Debbie","review":"Well, this is absolutly the worst cd I have ever bought - poor song selections, thin vocals, poor recording, washed out quality.

Now, he wasn't too fond of the smell (not sure why) and that is why I had prolonged the purchase.... but I didn't care...I just bought it and strategically placed it in the washroom.

It is the hinges.

I really wanted the 55mm which is what I believe I had and went with the \\"small\\" 52mm as an available alternative. These were indeed too small, because the earholders have to stretch on my face and I have a small to average face. So, while they do work for driving, beach etc. They really are too small.

The last track is an instrumental featuring Jandek banging away at a piano for 15 minutes. An out-of-tune piano, for that matter.

For my money, the best sounding set out there NOT on Mosaic is the 2-cd 'Jazz Tribune Vol 48' on RCA (a US release).There is a WORSE sounding Beiderbecke cd out there, with Orrin Keepnews' name on it yet.

It's shameful that Sony/BMG, which now owns nearly EVERYTHING Bix recorded, including the Columbia and Victor Whiteman sides, has not done justice to Bix by releasing the beautiful boxed set that collectors worldwide would welcome.

In the latter, you may be dissappointed but there is no way I can call this a bad release and I listen to it occasionally while I work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected!","review":"I have several Bob James albums and all of the fourplays so I just knew I would enjoy this new CD. I was way off the mark here. Most of the music made me feel I needed to be in a tuxedo at Carngie Hall complaining to my wife about how the servants don't appreciate refined music. This whole album was not the Bob James I am used too. I guess that I like my jazz upbeat and something that I can tap my foot too while driving to work. Most of this was quite boring to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"arrived in bolivia - a great product","review":"Dear sirs,Yesterday I received the above mentioned Planetary Design french press in Bolivia, where I am living. The press is great and I had a wonderful cup of coffee this morning at breakfast - thank you for the great product. However, I must say that the lack of a shipping service to Bolivia, where I live is a concern. I had to ship via the UK, where my parents live, to our house in La Paz, Bolivia.Bolivia is a well organized and safe country - there is no reason why you should not ship here. I have lived here for 28 years and I believe that I can truthfully say that I have never lost anything in the post - and I do get a lot of parcels in the post. You should change your shipping policy.Best regards,Martin Ede"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Press","review":"Overall, this is an excellent French Press in that it does very well what it is supposed to do -- make good coffee and keep it warm.Contrary to other reviewers, from course grind through medium grind, I have never had the first ground bypass the screen. I have yet to experiment with finer grinds, so make no statement in that regard. The press works fine and makes having good coffee on camping trips quick and easy. Moreover, the cup keeps the coffee drinkably warm for as long as anyone would want to carry it around.In agreement with other reviewers, the handle attachment is flimsy and quickly became loose on mine, but that seems to be a pattern with all single-attach point handles of this nature. Designer suggestion: moulding the handle as part of a threaded top would solve all the physical complaints associated with this cup."},{"rating":"1","title":"great design, one major flaw","review":"I am a huge fan of personal travel presses and use one every day. The mug works great and is very pretty, however the lack of a snap down lid prevents me from using it any where but at home. I purchased this one because I loved the idea of having the extra screen in the lid and the groovy colors available. I just didn't notice it when I ordered and trying to use it with out in the car led to a hot coffee stain."},{"rating":"2","title":"French Press Fantastic","review":"This is a high quality portable french press that completely fits my needs. Good volume and thermal retention. Easy to clean. Love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A darker roast than the previous book","review":"It may not be possible to read this book without a cup of coffee at hand. But make it a dark roast, as this book is slightly darker -- or at least deeper -- than the previous book. It still has moments of laughter, and this is inherently a fun mystery story; don't imagine that you need to be in a \\"serious\\" mood to enjoy it. For enjoy it you will: fun and believable characters, compelling recipes, and my guessing for \\"whodunnit\\" was wrong at least twice."},{"rating":"2","title":"More intense","review":"Clare begins to settle into her new home above the coffeehouse and even meets a great new guy.... but is he?This book begins to push the envelope in terms of being a \\"cozy\\" mystery. More intense than the first with more deaths and sadness. But still not overly graphic.I actually enjoyed the book being more intense, I'm a fan of both cozies and thrillers. The reason why I decided to knock this book down a star was because the editing seemed to be worse. If I had to see the word dessert be spelled desert one more time I was going to go crazy.I'm loving this new series and all the great coffee tips. I already downloaded and started to read the third book in the seriesLatte Trouble (Coffeehouse Mysteries, No. 3)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Second Novel In The Coffee House Mystery Series","review":"\\"Through The Grinder\\" is another fun and fast read by Cleo Coyle! This book has likable main characters, a good storyline, lots of red herrings & even some humor thrown in for sheer fun, which makes \\"Through The Grinder\\" a great novel for a fun, casual escape from everyday reality.Thought some of the information provided in \\"Through The Grinder\\" was repeated from the 1st novel in the series, \\"On What Grounds\\", which was probably done to fill in those readers who hadn't read the 1st novel about the main characters lives. Plus some of the scenarios/scenes seemed a little over the top, but otherwise a great novel all around.I am finding the Coffee House Mystery Series to be addicting and am looking forward to reading the next installment in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"sad and pointless","review":"I grabbed up this book - in the mood for a cozy - and was a bit shocked by the tragic ending. I had the murderer down right away - I think I saw a movie with a similar plot, but why the tragic ending? In reading a cozy I don't expect such things and I have to say I was disappointed. The book reads quickly - and has the cozy atmostphere throughout. I don't like this woman's relationship with her ex - Move on, have some respect for yourself! She seems bound to be with someone with baggage or someone who can't fully invest in a commitment. Anyway - I don't think I'll bother reading the next one. Too bad - because the scene - a NYC Greenwich Village coffee house is the perfect set up for the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"A good read and an interesting turn of events. I. recommend this book and the series. Also the books by Alice Kimberly."},{"rating":"2","title":"An easy, comfortable read","review":"I learned so much about coffee and coffee making that I intend to start grinding my own and paying attention to how I brew.This author obviously pulls the reader into the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coffee my way","review":"While this was hardly an intellectually stimulating book, it did have a good mystery line and I did learn a lot about coffee! In fact, the additional information about coffee brewing and the included recipes led me to purchase the next two Coffee House Mystery books! The characters are described in nice detail and are easily visualized. Some of the escapades are a bit \\"far out\\", though.This series is a good summer or winter read."},{"rating":"1","title":"even more cheesy than the first one","review":"If I had not made the mistake of buying most of this series before actually starting to read them I would definitely not continue. What a waste of money. Mystery line is okay as in the first title, but some of Claire's actions were immature and spur-of-the moment. Her casual affair was a definite disappointment to me. What sort of example is this to her college-age daughter? Certainly she needs to get on with her personal life after a long-ago divorce, but cheesiness won't bring her happiness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely dark and a bit dull","review":"It is darker and drearier than the others in the series. The characters were all fairly flat in this one. The \\"Death Row\\" art gallery was absolutely vile. I prefer the lighter mysteries without the gory bits. I will keep reading the series hoping this was a one off thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn!","review":"This book is so boring, I need the coffee from \\"Through the Grinder\\" just to stay awake to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book and service!","review":"Great service!Great book!I will order more of these, from the same person if they have them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes you Crave a Cup","review":"I actually liked this one better than the first. Except for her over use of \\"as\\" and \\"like\\".In book #2 of this ongoing series, Claire joins a dating service that uses the Village Blend as a meeting spot. Good choice since she does meet the very desirable Bruce Bowman, but you know that Claire's life isn't that lucky, especially when her customers, and other dating service regulars, end up dead. With the help of the ever present Detective Mike Quinn and her never gone for long ex-husband, the trio set off to find the truth behind the murders. Quinn knows who the killer is, he just can't convince Claire who decides to prove him wrong.I highly recommend this series. Not too bitter, not too bold, a little nutty and leaves a good after taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the TIME to Read...","review":"This was the worst mystery series I've ever read to this point. The only positive and enjoyable tidbit to savor of this series were the trivia and tips on coffee. The plot is predictable, characters are a bit typecast and stereotyped, and the author tends to be over the top in describing TOO MUCH information with the setting. Do I really need to know so much? Let the reader put the picture in their minds while reading a decent mystery plot. (By the way, the first 2 books have a very disappointing ending -- typical of a poorly written story.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable reading.","review":"I enjoyed reading this book very much. Lots of suspense interesting characters and many surprising twists and turns. Look forward to reading other books by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast moving, well-written if a little implausible","review":"I read this book very quickly--it has a sort of motor in it. In many ways it is well-written. My main problem with it is that it is a little over the top in terms of plausibility, especially the final part of the book. But I would still recommend this book.Note that the movie version (screenplay also written by Iles) came out this past weekend. I did not think the movie was as good as the book, and the movie has not been getting particularly good reviews...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Certainly not his best work, but still an excellent read!","review":"Iles has a natural talent for pulling the reader into the story, keeping you turning the pages, even when the plot is less than he is capable of. Such was the case with this novel.My hope is that Greg Iles is not going the way of other writers such as Grisham and often times Crichton who seem to be writing for that \\"big screenplay deal\\" and not for the reader. Although largely predictable and sometimes maddingly unrealistic, this work was still an excellent read with some interesting takes and a truly unique plot.If you haven't read Greg Iles before, don't make this your first one. I would strongly advise Mortal Fear, or The Quiet Game before this..... in fact I would place Spandau Phoenix ahead of this as well even though it is in a slightly different genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, I found a new favorite author","review":"This was my first Greg Iles book and I am going to be getting more. From page 1, intrigue and suspense, until the very end. I was up all night reading, fortunately it was the weekend..that's how hard it was to put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"24 hours","review":"I bought this book simply because Greg Iles wrote it. Wrong move! It lacks the complexity, and rich settings of his previous books, especially A Quiet Game. It seems like he has jumped on the bandwagon of so many financially successful authors - churn 'em out - never mind content. I'll give his next one a read - and then likely find a new author, Completely disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ultimate plan for revenge","review":"Dr. Will Jennings leaves his wife Karen and six year old daughter Abby to fly to a medical conference. He wants them to come with him but Karen declines. There is underlying tension between them because Karen was the one to give up her dreams of becoming a doctor once Abby was born. Will makes a successful presentation but is ignorant of events at home. His daughter is kidnapped by Joe Hickey and his cousin Huey. They have done it before, nobody gets hurt, and the child always goes home. However, Joe does not see the harm in having a little fun during the planned 24 hours of work. Karen fights Joe and inadertently finds out why he has targeted them. Will is held his hotel room by another kidnapper. The characters are well-written and living on the edge of drama. A first-rate psychological thriller that is easy to recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is perhaps the weakest book that iles ever written","review":"this one simply is too mediocre not even qualified being good. i've read all iles' complicated yet fasinating novels, most of them carried the weight as any great book should be except some of the endings felt lame and rushed. but this 24 hours didn't hang on in my hands and lock up my eyes' over 24 minutes, i just returned it to the library the next day and would not think about re-reading it again. the other books such as the quiet game, sleep no more, blood memory, dead sleep are all great reading experiences, his first and second ones were just too jewish focused. concentrating on the south is a trade mark of iles, although after hurricane katrina, the nopd police force seemed to be a totally ridiculous lame duck and incapable of doing anything right, not as good as what iles described in his novels. all said, this time no cigar for you, poncho."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read THE QUIET GAME by this author but NOT this one","review":"My greatest fear is that reading 24 Hours might turn people off to other books by Greg Iles- and that would be too bad because the author's best works are so much better than this rather bland little book - as quickly forgettable as it is a quick read. I nearly put it down several times but felt compelled to finish it, if only to give a fair review of the book. On the other hand, please, please pick up and read The Quiet Game by the same author. It has the heart and soul that 24 Hours lacks and you may well be amazed, as I was, that this book was written by the same author. Skillfully blending southern politics and scandal, a bit or romance and riveting action and suspense into one seamless tales, this is a book you'll truly enjoy. Plus, you can get it in paperback and save money compared to buying 24 Hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skillfully Crafted, yet flawed.","review":"24 Hours is the type of book that you feel driven to finish reading in 24 hours. It is written with a fast paced driving energy that keeps you turning the pages. Those with children will find themselves identifying with the characters of this novel as they make decisions that may have devastating impact on those they love. 24 hours plays out like a well crafted movie. The reader can't help but wonder if this could be a handbook for those wishing to commit similar crimes. The kidnapping seems to only have risk should the criminal make a mistake. This is chilling to those that have children.As exciting and as thrilling as the book was, it is difficult to suggest. Some parts were described in too disturbing of detail. These unnecessarily detailed parts revolved around the attempted rape of the mother of the kidnapped child. Were it not for these sections, I would be more willing to suggest it to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"LIKE WATCHING A TV MOVIE","review":"This book is one long commercial from beginning to end. It plugs more than 65 products, many of them several times. People in this book don't drive a car or watch TV; they drive \\"the Expedition\\" and watch \\"the Hitachi.\\" Even advertising executives don't talk like this. So pervasive is this advertising that the reader is actually shocked when someone prepares iced tea rather than iced Lipton. With all the books available here, there's no point in wasting money on this slap in the face to the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hi on suspense, low on everything else","review":"I swore I wouldn't read cheap thrillers, but I'm running out of books (on tape) at my local library. Of course, the plot grabbed my attention right away, but writing is sparse, characterizations are weak, and the plot slightly formulaic. The graphic nature of some of the narrative was a definite turn off. I'd leave this one on the shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspenseful and different","review":"This book was excellent. Lots of suspense and drama. A ransom kidnipping, that has different twists and turns. Lots of action. Just when you think you have figured out how it is all going to end, you will be surprised.I picked this book up thinking it would be a run of the mill read, but I was pleasantly surprised...it was fast paced and the plot premise was very originalA great read, and a real good page turner."},{"rating":"1","title":"24 Hours","review":"Obviously, I am in the minority as to the \\"raves\\" about this book. I have read three previous Iles novels and enjoyed them thoroughly.........they were suspenseful, well written and most enjoyable. Sorry to say, I cannot give a \\"thumbs up\\" to 24 Hours. While the general plot of the kidnapping is good, the characterizations are unbelievable and the dialogue goes from trite to mediocre. I was most relieved to at least finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"24 Hours a real page turner...","review":"This is my first Greg Iles book but it certainly won't be my last. From the first page to the last he keeps the tension at high pitch. As a parent I felt the plot was plausable. It's easy to comprehend a parent doing and promising anything to keep their child from harm. The ending was my only quibble point, it was just a hair over the top. But, still, all in all a reccommended read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, but...","review":"This book sounded interesting from reading plot descriptions and reader reviews. I found the plot of the story to be interesting and the story was a good read, but there was a lot of gratuitous sex in the book that just didn't need to be there. I skimmed these parts and was disappointed that the author felt that these parts were really important to the plot. If you are offended by material such as this I would stay away from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't wait to finish it!","review":"This is my second book by Iles and I am now convinced I will have to go get all the books he's ever written so I don't miss anything. Possibly a little unrealistic, but very entertaining! Fast-paced from beginning to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Greg Iles book I've ever read!","review":"This book was horrible from start to finish. I never once believed the characters. Their actions and words did not speak of truth at all. I read the entire book and the entire thing felt like wading through sludge.I normally like Greg Iles (The Quiet Game is one of my all-time favorite books) and it is hard for me to believe this was even written by the same guy.I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who has a shred of understanding of the human psyche."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"This is Iles' worst book. I'm giving it two stars. If it were another author, I'd probably rate three stars.24 Hours reads like a simple chronology of events. There's a little character development, but not much. They are like cardboard cutouts compared to Iles' other works. On top of that, the dialogue isn't very interesting.Iles may have had an interesting idea with 24 Hours. Unfortunately I don't think it translated into a good novel. Instead, I'd recommend Deep Sleep or Iron Cross."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"This book started with so much promise, but really let me down. I found it to be completely absurd in places, totally predictable in others. Some of the things that the head \\"bad guy\\" did were ridiculous. The ending was so ludicrous that it was all I could do to complete it.I haven't read any of his other works and, based on this one, I wouldn't read them."},{"rating":"1","title":"I cheered for the ''Bad Guy''","review":"This book was atrocious. It hurt to finish it. I found myself completely unable to relate to Will, Karen or Abby. Did not like any of them as characters, found them unbelieviable and hence gravitated towards Joe Hickey. Again, skip this one. read something else, anything else. I will not read any more f Greg Iles. I like to learn while I read and this did nothing for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"better title is 24 minutes","review":"My review won't be helpful other than a personal opinion. Did not like this book. Can't tell you how it ends. Got bored and tossed it aside - in about 24 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"First Iles book and Last for me","review":"A new friend recommended this author. I tried this one because it was available from my library for Kindle. I definitely turned the pages quickly as I have to agree with another reviewer who compared it to watching TV as well as being exposed to brand promotion. I do prefer historical fiction where I get to learn something, so I guess I won't try another book from this genre. I hesitate to classify it in the thriller genre, because the entire thing was predictable. Oh, maybe I was surprised that there was a portable scalpel available with the toothbrushes! I did enjoy that, I must admit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ANOTHER TOP-NOTCH THRILLER FROM ILES!","review":"This book has all the thrill and suspense of James Patterson's \\"Along Came A Spider.\\" For those who are devoted Greg Iles fans, this one rates close behind his successful, \\"Mortal Fear.\\"In this novel we have a kidnapping plot, a distraught Mom and Dad whose ho-hum marriage is not exactly a garden of passion, a sweet little girl, a fiendish villain who is the mastermind of the plot, and the villain's somewhat challenged cousin who is also his partner in crime. The characters are well developed, true-to-life people, and while the plot is not original in nature (kidnappings novels are easy to come by these days and the reason for a four-star rating as opposed to a five) the book is filled from start to finish with action and suspense. It is definitely an all night thriller and I highly expect this one will be a future movie. You won't believe how much action can actually be packed into 24 hours. Great book, fabulous author; that says it all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"24 Suspense Filled Hours","review":"The audio version of Greg Iles's 24 Hours is well read by Dick Hill. It is a suspense filled tale about the perfect kidnapping plan gone wrong. With three very different villians and three very different victims of the kidnapping plot, this book is filled with many twists and turns. The reader is never sure how the book might end or who might survive the night. I agree with other reviewers that the past section of the book is pretty amazing as the writer takes a great deal of liberty with reality in order to resolve the situation in which the characters find themselves. Still, a well written read with well-defined, interesting characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true page-turner","review":"This book was so suspenseful that I literally got the chills from reading it! It's a true page-turner. The characters are multidimensional, and the author does a wonderful job of avoiding suspense cliches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast pace page turner.","review":"**** Greg Iles has become one of our favorite mystery writters. This book lives up to The Devil's Punchbowl in every way. He can take a typical plot and twist it like a pretzel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun thrill ride","review":"This book is very entertaining. The details are great and enjoyable to read. The action scenes fly by with tension. The only problems is some of it is way overboard. This makes the conflict resolution a little hard to accept."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another excellent read from Iles","review":"I've just finished this book, and came onto Amazon to find more by Iles. Although it was a bit more predictable than other Iles books I've read, it was just as hard to put down as the rest. Crystal clear images, developed characters, and a plot which will make it hard for any parent to go to sleep without checking on their kids one more time..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the movie","review":"I bought this after seeing the preview for the movie version entitled \\"Trapped\\". I should have waited. An interesting premise degenerates into a beyond-belief soft-core-porn attempted rape and the story never recovers. Holes in the plot are big enough to land a plane in."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointing experiment","review":"I have always enjoyed the books of Iles. They always combined adventuresome, yet believable stories with complex, human characters. Though 24 Hours is adventuresome, it lacks any of the complex characters to which I was accustomed in Mr. Iles' previous books. Instead the characters are stereotypical and general. The valiant mother fighting for her daughter's life. The mentally and physically abused young woman wanting to start a new life chapter. The dim-witted, oafish, yet good-hearted captor. The heinous bad guy who's just stupid enough to let his captive get the upper hand while his pants are around his ankles. These are all characters we've seen before. This book looks great in theory, but when I actually read it, I really felt as though I was cheated. This would probably make a great movie, but the book sure is lacking. Give us another Quiet Game or Black Cross!"},{"rating":"2","title":"INCREDIBLE WRITER!!","review":"This book and this writer Greg Iles is just incredible!

The CD has a decidely classical flavor but Reynold's unique style combined with some very sly and understated guitar playing makes this one of his best.Impressive and worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addition to my drum kit!","review":"This think is pretty cool.

Good product, highly recommend this seller!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"Easy, quick on / off the snare for transportation.

Again, really good ideas, but really bad approach to solutions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love discontinued Orbit Citrusmint gum","review":"I love this flavor. Unlike one of the other reviewers, I think it has only a hint of mint. The orange flavor comes bursting through and last a long time. The first piece is always the best. I have been chewing this flavor for five years, almost since it was introduced in 2005. I am upset that it has been discontinued. I have dry mouth and need to have something to chew. I hope Wrigley comes out with some flavor as good as Citrusmint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the others","review":"Generally, I like Orbit gum. I think a number of their flavors are fantastic. But I'm not as fond of the Citrus Mint. When citrus and mint get together it tastes a bit too much like a dentist's office for my taste. This gum tastes like the paste they use to polish teeth at the dentist's office, and that's just not what I'm looking for in a chewing gum. I'll be sticking with sangria and melon mint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"I read the book a couple of times. Rafe Esquith is not an average teacher. He is a hero. He can inspire, challenge and motivate us. It's hard to follow his footsteps, precisely because of his extraordinary commitment to the students, and his self-sacrifice. Great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Agree, Slightly Inspiring, Very Intimidating.","review":"I'm a new teacher, about 3 months on the job, and after reading this book I would not recommend it to any beginning teacher. I bought the book thinking it might be a how-to guide coming from a teacher who has successfully taught shakespeare to fifth graders. Unfortunately what I got was a book with some practical advice but mostly criticism of teachers and the education establishment. It was very discouraging. Reading this book is like having someone tell you \\"you're not good enough to be a teacher\\" over and over again. The man is a fanatic. If you're a new teacher looking for inspiration, don't read this. Read \\"Tools for Teaching\\" by Fred Jones or \\"The First Days of School\\" by Harry Wong. These books will actually give you practical advice on how to be a successful teacher, instead of intimidating you into thinking you should have never got that teaching degree in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vindictive, Petty Gossip","review":"Although one must admire Rafe Esquith's creativity, energy and dedication to his classroom, unfortunately after reading his book it his pettiness and vindictiveness that stick in one's mind. I have to ask why his editors allowed him to include so many vengeful stories of not only fellow teachers and administrators but also even of former students who apparently didn't give Mr. Esquith the thanks he felt his due. Some of these stories may have been appropriate to include in his book, but many were not. One has the impression he must have worn down his editors into letting him include so many such anecdotes. Too bad no one asked Mr. Esquith to consider if his hero Atticus would have written such a book or why someone should pay money to read this kind of gossip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite what I expected . . .","review":"I really wanted to like this book. I picked it up on the book store after scanning some of the passages and finding them inspiring. And I did find some of the story inspiring. But, the more I read, the more I got a negative sense about this guy. He doesn't seem to understand boundaries. It's subtle at first, with his students calling him \\"Rafe.\\" Then it becomes so obvious with all the examples about the student confusion. Students at this age need to know where the boundaries of parents, teachers, coaches, etc. are, so they can feel comfortable where they are and safe pushing those boundaries and developing into healthy adults whether it be academically, personally or both. \\"Rafe\\" never seemed to learn this, even after his experience with the \\"Musketeers.\\" I found myself wanting to tell him to go to therapy instead of looking to Atticus to help him solve his problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"After reading this book I was very disappointed on its focus. Most of the pages are spent recreating verbal battles(that the author always wins) with fellow teachers. The authors resorting to name-calling of just about every peer he ever worked with made it diffcult for me to finish the book..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful work, but...","review":"I admire the author. He has an intense dedication to his students. However, having read the book during my second year of teaching, I can tell you that a teacher should not have to sacrifice his/her life to be successful. I hope other teachers of low income children do not feel guilty that their eleven hour days do not stack up to the insane number of hours this teacher spends on his children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good read but...","review":"I read Rafe's book Teach Like Your Hair's on Fire first and thought this book would be different, being how it was his first...basically he talked about the same things/situations in both books. I loved Teach Like Your Hair's on Fire and was looking for something different but found that it was pretty much identical to the other. Still good information though..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book is about Rafe, Not about Studetns","review":"As I new educator, I was looking for a book that gave me some insights into Rafe's success. Instead I found a book about the man, not about children. I found this book to be a self-serving commercial with little or no help for beginning educators."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought it would be...","review":"I received a good report on this book from some educator friends of mine, but upon reading this book, I found that the author was incredibly full of himself. He was all about the great job he had done, and not so concerned about his students. I just really didn't end up caring about the book by the end, I just had to finish it for a class instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed and kinda irritated","review":"As an educator, I was really looking forward to reading this book. I looked forward to reading about ways to open the minds of students. Sadly, that's not what this book offers.What I got from it was \\"if you're not willing to sacrifice ALL of your spare time and money and put your family behind your career, then you are not going to succeed as a teacher.\\" The author preached on and on about how he was so willing to make these sacrifices... It really seemed like he was stroking his own ego with this book.Do yourselves a favor and don't read this. LouAnne Johnson's books did way more for me than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"An outstanding book!","review":"As a mother of young children, I found this book to be extremely helpful in terms of understanding the condition of education today, and where I might best extend my efforts at supplementing at home. I think it is a bit of a stretch to expect the average teacher to employ all of his tactics, as they would have little time left for their own families, but certainly there are many good ideas to work with.I completely agree that the reading programs we find in public schools today are grossly inadequate, and that they take much of the joy out of reading. Unfortunately, for most teachers, if they want to keep their jobs they must follow the scripted lessons. I am not certain what the best answer would be for their situation, but I am happy to work at home to provide the books and instruction necessary to instill a love of reading and literature in my children."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic book","review":"I read this for enjoyment and then I've given copies of this book to teacher education students as presents. It is definitely a good read for any educator's library..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost threw it out!","review":"As a teacher, I was so angry and insulted reading the beginning of the book that I almost put it in the garbage. Recycle or book donation might mean someone else would be subjected to it, so garbage or burning seemed the only option. I was on jury duty and had nothing else to read, so I read it. It was an interesting and quick read and I did find some inspiration in it, but I found the insult to so many of the teaching profession and public education appalling. There are some bad teachers and bad things about public education, but Rafe would have you believe that he is one of the only good ones out there. It's too bad that I almost threw the book away to miss out on the inspiration that was buried within."},{"rating":"1","title":"buyer beware","review":"If you are a new teacher looking for a how-to book, this is not it. The only how-to chapter is \\"When Numbers Get Serious,\\" which explains his token economy system, but you can get that kind of information from a basic search of the internet. This book is about a man looking for accolades that he feels has been denied by the district he works in.Don't be fooled by the number of 5-star reviews. After reading the book, my opinion is that those 5-star reviews were written by Esquith's friends and don't accurately reflect the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-Serving and Not Practical","review":"Esquith is a little too much like Harry Wong. He assumes everything will fall into place when you get your assignment. He also disparages mandatory curriculums which are assigned to teachers. But he doesn't take into account the following:1. The students schedules can be changed constantly, so they're never in the same class for more than two weeks.2. The kids may come to class too angry to learn.3. Politics may be more important than the kids' education.There are many other factors that keep teachers from providing the very best. Luckily for Mr. Esquith, everything fell into place for him. But we can't all rely on luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is a fine line between genius and insanity...","review":"... and I'm quite positive that Rafe Esquith stands firmly on the \\"insanity\\" side. This was an interesting read, though I would never use it as a guideline for how to teach, which is how it was presented to me. More of a how not to, or a jumping off point for thinking about the demands of education today."},{"rating":"1","title":"The distortion issue","review":"I still like the book, but new teachers should be careful when reading it. Several people have written that Esquith has left out some important details. For instance, what kind of population is this really? There are no African-Americans on the cover, or I don't know if they are even directly mentioned in the book. I don't believe race has any direct bearing on how well a student will do, but a white male compared to a black female teaching African-Americans in a \\"jungle\\" will have quite a different experience than a white male like Rafe teaching immigrants or Americans of immigrant families. Also, are most of these students from single-parent households? And when immigrants come to the U.S., don't many of them already have somewhat of a work ethic instilled in them due to their history and culture?Otherwise, I think it is a good book and I enjoyed it very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"An oral history of hope...","review":"I met the author by chance. I received a copy of the book as a friendly gesture...I wasn't even sure I'd get around to reading itanytime soon. That was before I read the first page, and never stopped until I was finished...right there at the kitchen table, totally mesmerized by the messages of hope and courage.This isn't an easy world for any of us, but adolescence is a rollercoaster ride of emotions and trials...punctuated by some fine moments if we're lucky. When the balance of life is upset by family dysfunction, illness or personal loss, life can seem almost unbearable. This book is brilliantly constructed to show the reader how hope emerges in each teenagers voice,despite their problems..how a single event, a risk taken...can change ones outlook on life forever.Do not miss this unforgettable book. It is a touching and true treasure in an age of tedious and superficial self-help volumes. Take this spare book and open up a huge world of possibility. Outstanding!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Horton crossbow string","review":"good item but a little tight, exactly what i wanted, and will buy again. darn is not two wenty words"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Gone to be an Orb\\"","review":"\\"Gone to be an Angel\\" is a popular epitaph, but if the IGHS (International Ghost Hunters Society) has its way, it won't be long before we walk through a cemetery and see a marker bearing the inscription, \\"Gone to be an Orb\\"! I would have liked Ms. Ramsland's book a lot more had she not devoted so much of it to the IGHS and its ridiculous theory that \\"orbs\\" (reflections of light off minute particles directly in front of the lens and flash of cheap digital cameras) are spirits of the dead. (Quite frankly, I cannot think of anything less appealing than dying and becoming an orb!) The book contains 300 pages and on page 296, the author finally gets around to interviewing a reputable ghost hunter who cast some doubt on the \\"orb\\" theory, but she devoted only a single paragraph--and a short one at that--to his opinions. I expected something more objective from Ms. Ramsland. This book was a great disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only scary thing was that I finished it.","review":"Personal experiences received some validation in this story. There were plausible explanations of paranormal activity, although she spent way too much time incessently droning on about how she would remain unbiased. Ramsland never seemed to concretely investigate an allegedly dead murderer, and was content to \\"play\\" in an insidious world. (Unbelievably stoic and cavalier.) Expecting the conclusion to wrap uploose ends, she instead wimped out and left it to the reader to decide, discrediting many of her \\"findings.\\" I looked for missing pages...the ending was that lame."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much rambling....","review":"When I started the book, I was really interested. I wanted to know what was up with the ring and the story behind it. But the author kept running off in different directions. Which became tedious and I found myself skipping pages to get to the meat of the story. Unfortunately it never was resolved. Why didn't the author inform the police??? And what happened to the missing reporter???? The whole book builds you up to one very anti-climactic end."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put this book down!","review":"This is the first book I read by Katherine Ramsland and I must say I couldn't put it down. I was fascinated by the story of the haunted ring and I stayed up all night reading this book. I'm not easily frightened but this book gave me a good scare and for a few nights I was afraid to turn the lights off to go to sleep! I really enjoyed following along as Katherine learned to be a certified ghost hunter and I very much enjoyed hearing about her travels to haunted places around the U.S. If you love a good ghost story and all things paranormal then you'll love this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it","review":"The author leaves the reader hanging with no resolution. She retold some old ghost stories and blah blah blahed about equipment. Kept building interest in a story she never follows through with. Traveled all around the country with money she got from a sucker like me.I think she took a page from the lame author Anne Rice - come up with a teaser idea, then try and write idiotic sequel after sequel to enrich yourself personally.As an author, if you don't have a fully fleshed out story that resolves itself at the end, then please don't waste a readers time. There are too many good books in the world. Buy a Stephen King novel instead. Far more original and satisfying scary stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, far-fetched and dissapointing","review":"I will admit that this book was hard to put down, but this was only due to the fact that i wanted some answers that i unfortunately never got. The book keeps you on your toes with far-fetched ghost tales and interviews with the dead, but then drags you along with numerous history lessons that are used for page fillers. Although there are some very interesting happenings during her story, its like the author is very repetitive in what she is saying, feeding the reader the same stories, only telling them using different words. If i would have known how the book ended i would have never read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"time is precious","review":"I bought the book, a used copy, on amazon for a few dollars, sure wished I had those dollars back. For a woman who is a qualified psychotherapist (really, with whom?) she seems either pathologically naive, or plain silly. I wonder how she would respond to a client who told her that she/he was going to meet a stranger in the woods, who clearly had a personality disorder, or worse. Did she check out this \\"Wraith\\" character's story, was there a suicide where Wraith told her \\"Christian\\" had killed himself, did she do any research into this supposed lunatic's supposed victims?

Travis Meeks is an amazing songwriter and innovative musician. The 2nd album showed a diverse plate of influences, and broke him completely free of all the \\"AIC Ripoff\\" characteristics.So, the three former members of DOTN, formed Tantric, and strangely wanted to be characterized as an \\"AIC Ripoff\\". They strive to sound like them in hopes of success. They even used the same producer. So far, their plan is working, but it won't be long until they slip back through the cracks to obscurity.As for the new singer, Hugo lacks the raw essence of what a singer should be. The singing sounds forced and mechanical. The guitar parts are nothing more than rehashed solos that Todd stole from Travis.Besides, why settle for second-rate bland rock, when a new DOTN cd is coming out in a month or two?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"Ugh I hate these guys! Breakdown was pretty cool when I first heard it, but then they had to play it over and over and over and over and over again and by the time Astounded came out I didnt want to hear anymore.

I had to listen to the CD twice to really get a feel for it. The lead(Hugo) wants to sound like Travis Meeks in the worst way, and he doesn't quite get there, but his voice is still rather interesting and compliments the music quite well. I am a retail music store manager and pretty much guarantee at least three radio hits from the album. The fact that they debuted at #4 on the rock charts certainly speaks highly for them as well.

The reason Travis fired the band was because they weren't taking the music seriously. The new singer is very good, I love his voice but the only thing they are doing is trying to copy the old sound, not too original. With Travis as the lead the soud was pure emotion just listen to dotn2 and you can hear that.

They owe their existence to Travis Meeks (leader of Days of the New... the only band that's doing anything truly musical besides Dave Matthews Band) no matter what anyone else says.

They even tried to get a singer whose voice sounds like Travis.Every song sounds exactly the same.Sorry ex-members of Days of the New... your band Tantric just doesnt cut it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost DOTN","review":"As a true DOTN fan I have to say that this CD is great. It has 3 of the original 4 DOTN members so it's amazingly good. But there's still something missing from the true DOTN music we love. I'm talking about Travis Meeks, in my opinion, the backbone of the group. He's done well without these 3 and they've done well without him. So if you're a DOTN fan looking for about 95% DOTN-type music from the ex band members this is the CD for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"They're back...","review":"It's good to see the three former members of Days of the New putting their musical talents to good use once again. This is just a good rock CD from front to back. The guitar playing is great, far above and beyond anything Travis Meeks (DOtN) did on his last album. Makes me wonder why these guys were kicked out of the band. The basic sound is that of a much more agressive Days of the New (back int the days of the first album.) The singer does sound very reminiscent of Travis Meeks, but I never caught the Layne Staley comparisons some people have been making. There are two songs with some AIC like wailing in a couple of parts, but that's the backup singing, not Hugo.But anyway, this CD rocks the whole way through, and the musicianship is excellent.

($5 cover) I have to admit the rest of the songs (off air) grow on you quick. It would be great to see these guys break away. I definately recommend to buy it.

On one occasion I saw her at a restaurant in San Bernardino and went up to her to congratulate her on her CD. She was so arrogant and totally blew me off! Now when she is onstage all she does is sing. She never really has any contact with the audience. I'm not saying she is a bad singer, but she is definitely NOT the best. I wouldn't even DARE compare her to Nydia Rojas... come on, Nydia sang with Juan Gabriel!!! That should tell you where they both stand!! I wish I could get my money back!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So So","review":"I think the songwriters of these songs are spectacular... but I think her voice sounds too much as if she is crying all the time.. it gets annoying after two or three songs. I have seen Casandra perform in Fiesta Broadway about 2 or 3 years ago and let me tell you that her voice does not sound like it did on this CD.. she was constantly going off key... I guess she's just another singer that gets her voice fixed by the engineers...

This collection is very uneven stylistically, and is therefore somewhat difficult to listen to. The two new songs, particularly \\"We're Not Makin' Love Anymore,\\" were only so-so and not among her best. Then we get the rehashed recordings of \\"Memory\\" and \\"Comin' In And Out of Your Life,\\" which are fine songs on their own, but were already included on \\"Memories,\\" a previous \\"greatest hits and a few other songs\\" set! The song \\"By The Way\\" stinks, in my opinion. Why not \\"Kiss Me In The Rain\\" instead? Even \\"Left In The Dark\\" would have been better. Only 4 genuine Top 10 hits on the whole album, and three of them are from ONE album (\\"Guilty\\"). I enjoy Barbra's artistry, but not so much her marketing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put Your Shirt On Barbra","review":"A weird collection of things that are on other hits albums. No value for the money, not even at a tenth of the price of one of her concerts."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Nice CD\\"","review":"In 1989 feeling pressure from Columbia to come out with a new album as per her contract Barbra Streisand released this \\"greatest hits\\" package which only contained two new songs. Despite this the CD did go 2X Platinum and go as far as #26 on Billboard.The two new tracks recorded exclusively for this set are \\"We're Not Making Love Anymore\\" and the haunting \\"Somewhere\\" that shows all Barbra needs to do is record a few new songs for an album and her ardent fan base will rush out to buy it. The rest of the album features some of her biggest hits including \\"The Main Event\\", \\"The Way He Makes Me Feel\\", \\"Memory\\" from \\"Cats\\" (my favorite on this CD) and her two Barry Gibb duets, \\"Guilty\\" and \\"What Kind of Fool\\".A nice collection to add to your Barbra library."},{"rating":"2","title":"An extremely useful Barbra CD","review":"This CD is so good because it has a lot of songs on it that in order to own youd have to buy a couple of different CD's. to get the main event youd have to buy the main event soundtrack which has no other barbra songs on it, comin in and out of your life was only a single, and \\"memory\\" only exists on the \\"memories\\" CD, which otherwise is just another greatest hits package. In other words, for the barbra completist this album will help you round out your catalog of barbra recordings quicker. However, since most casual barbra fans have both The broadway album and Guilty already, its probably not a good investment unless you want every song barbra has ever recorded, like me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good overall collection, but.....","review":"If there ever was a diverse (or maybe weird is the word?) collection of Mrs. Streisand's hits, this is it. As a above review said, this was a big (if not the biggest) period in her musical career.There are numerous good songs here. Woman in Love still is as powerful as it was in 1980. Somewhere is still the showstopper of this set (once again, if not for her career). Guilty, Coming in & out of your life, and What kind of Fool are still excellent. I always liked the Main Event & the Way He Makes Me Feel.However everything seems somewhat out of place with each other. The disco with the Broadway tunes? I know this covers this period, however the Broadway songs could have been placed on a separate set. This is a good start for the casual fan, but Guilty and the Broadway Album go along very well with this set. It's worth it just for two songs: Promises & Not While I'm Around. Let me know what you think :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"ERROR IN YOUR SAMPLE RECORDING","review":"NOT SURE HOW IT HAPPENED BUT YOU HAVE BILLY JOEL SINGING IN BARB'S SPOTLLIGHT.

I have never had any urge to search for my \\"original\\" mother and I have several adopted friends who feel the same way.

Unless you are very comfortable with calculus and have more than a nodding acquaintance with differential equations this book isn't for you. The author does a good job of providing solutions to interesting problems through applied mathematics. However, he does something that mathematics professors always did that used to drive me crazy and it still does. He sets up a model, develops some defining equations and then makes a leap with something like \\"using these relationships, it can be established that ...\\" or \\"With this information, we easily determine that ...\\" Some intermediate steps would have been helpful.The book is interesting and entertaining but without a background in calculus and an understanding of ordinary differential equations, you won't like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Readable applied math.","review":"This is a fine compendium of math applied to a variety of real world problems.

The author provides scanty few problems to solve, but geez, even for those he doesn't provide the solutions?! - to me this is a cardinal sin when it comes to expository math books -sorry.

Just have to say though, in the above product description, it says no animal fats, but one of the ingredients listed is beef fat. I am not purchasing this through Amazon though as I am getting it quite a bit cheaper elsewhere online. I have done quite a bit of research on the foods and decided that this one is as good as any of the top of the line foods. At any rate, it will be much better for them than Purina for sure. It is all made in the USA and nothing comes from China.

Our tree wobbled. We couldn't get the stand to lock into place - each time we locked it, the tree moved a bit and was no longer how we wanted it. We touched the tree oh-so-lightly, it moved. I was worried about putting the lights on and having the tree crash down. Worried about the kids playing too close to the tree.

They take a show that was only moderately popular in the late 80s and almost obscure right now and try to rip off the few loyal fans of the show by splitting up the seasons while charging almost full price. Why in the world they split up the first season when it only aired 22 episodes!!! This is absurd. It is nothing but greed by CBS/Paramount. They realize that this the only chance for fans of the show to see it again and really want to make them pay for it. I mean, if the consumer bought both volumes, it amounts to over $70 for 22 episodes of a mediocre-at-best show. I'm also guessing that music has been altered and there are no special features. This is just another pathetic attempt by CBS/Paramount to squeeze every last penny out of the consumer in a brutal economy. Shame on you, CBS/Paramount!

Can't recommend it any higher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake Me When The Story Starts","review":"The book was slow and ponderous. I was intrigued by the plot, because really, I don't think I've read a romance where the hero shoots the heroine. I wanted to see how Blake intended to write herself out of that corner.Slowly. Very Slowly.I tried to see the sparkage between Roan and Donna/Tory, but it didn't work for me. There was so little danger after the opening gambit, and Donna/Tory spent so much of the story bored out of her skull, that I was bored as a result. There was also the implausibility that a woman of logic and above average intelligence didn't know how to hire her own attorney and establish herself as both mentally competent and in charge of her personal affairs.Alas, I couldn't get past such obvious things, and with Blake creating a story that's slow, languorous and syrupy, I kept reaching for the cattle prod--just to move things along."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roan","review":"Jennifer Blake has always written wonderful romance stories, and her Benedict series is some of her best contemporary romance. The entire Benedict family is delightful to read about, especially the ever sexy, but mannerly men, Kane, Luke and now Roan. The stories and plot lines never let you down. Even when the reader feels the match will never make, Blake pulls the hero and heroine together with steamy romance and love. Please keep going on this wonderful family....can't get enough of the Benedicts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read.","review":"This book can be divided into 3 sections. The first and last sections of the book moved well and had a good story. The middle really slowed down. I have read the other two books in this series and will look forward to the next one. However, there were times that I was tempted to lay it down. I got frustrated with the heroine Tory. How many different ways did she need proof that Roan was really a stand-up dependable guy. The evidence was right there in her face. I kept wanting to get on with the plot. The character of Roan was well written and I really liked him. The twist of him shooting the heroine was a nice shift in an otherwise sometimes predictable plot. I still enjoyed the book and will look forward to returning to this quaint southern town."},{"rating":"1","title":"Romantic suspense","review":"I enjoyed this book for the most part. I felt as though you really didn't get to know the main characters that well partially because the did not know themselves. They did some odd things in the story such as the sheriff of this small town suddenly getting a sophisticated electronic ankle monitor for someone who has not even been charged with a crime. No one calls him out on his moral obligation to this woman he has shot and then convicted without any reasonable explanation. I did not find either of the main characters very likable and it was only the suspense of the story line that kept me reading it to the end.As a dog lover I was also bothered by him keeping his prized hounds out in the Louisiana heat of summer."},{"rating":"2","title":"the Church as the Body of Christ","review":"This was not an easy book for me to read.

I minored in history and so reading about the history of the world from a Jewish perspective was both interesting and enlightening.It was also heart-wrenching.

It was like meeting a lot of people that would become inseparable companions for the time of the reading and have remained fond memories though I finished the book a month ago.

Don't miss it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An epic of one family's story","review":"I thought that this book was interesting. I wondered how much of it at the beginning was true. I suppose that if Mr. Halter did have the \\"Book of Abraham\\" available, he would be able to work off that.This is a story of one family's trials through the ages, all documented in a scroll started in 70 AD when the patriarch was expelled from Jerusalem.

Needless to say, we have reverted to the old tried and true carafes even though they are stained. The literature claims a twelve hour temperature retention for hot liquids but that claim is is a stretch beyond credulity. Our old thermos was made in Germany; these are made in China.

The movie had the worse plot with cheesey graphics and fight scenes that had no chance of looking half way realistic. We could not figure the point to this movie even after the end credits were rolling but we laughed all the way thru this to keep from destroying the tv. The only good thing about this movie was the title and the names of the characters supposze to be in the movie. If not for the semi rape scenes we would have completely hated this movie.

A funny, charming, poignant film about a self-involved writer's journey to becoming his better self, a MENSCH.Kenneth Branagh has the role of a lifetime, if only the world knew about it. It's one comic utterance after another. Follow the zingers going back and forth between him and the TV interviewer who clearly is annoyed that he is getting the upper hand. FUNNY.There's a sweet relationship that develops between Branagh's character and the little girl next door, sweet but not mawkish, no heavy-handed direction here. Gradual and realistic evolution of the hero is on display here. Apparently this film did not get good distribution, otherwise it would be better known. Robin Wright and Lynn Redgrave give fine performances as well. I like this film so much, I am STILL trying to get my sister and niece on the West Coast to view it.

Gil, as always, weaves a glorious mix of samba, bossa nova, and traditional regional musics that are so infectious that it is impossible not to feel great upon listening to them. His skills as a songwriter, and the expert craftsmanship he puts into every song he does, continues to evolve, making him (with Caetano Veloso) the most diverse songwriter Brazil has to offer today.Fans of traditional Brazilian folk music, as well as hard core Gil fans, will find much to savor in this cd. If you are curious about Brazilian music or are looking for something new to listen to, this will also be the cd for you. A glorious effort by one of Brazil's elder statesmen."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"must\\" view","review":"This is one of the funniest films you will ever see...but it also very endearing because of the children whom you just can't help but love.

She acts as if she is paying the mother. The father of these children is an old crab. Ms newman is pretty much a single mother. There is one statement in these book that was stupid. She states that a woman who could get rid of her dog, can just as easily get rid of her child. What the heck? Yet, as another poster stated she at one point wishes her children dead.

At this stage of life, if we can't be truthful and also have a sense of humor - we're in trouble. Judith, thank you for writing such an honest and totally enjoyably book - I can't wait for the sequel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An honest take on parenthood","review":"I really enjoyed this book. As other reviewers have written, it is laugh-out-loud funny. And, the humor is that we can recognize ourselves. I'm an older mother who adopted. Another reviewer found Newman's passage on adoption offensive - but it's her opinion and she's entitled. Not only that, later in the book she completely changed her tune, acknowledging she was wrong - that you have to learn to love your kids no matter how they arrive in your home and heart. She lives a lifestyle completely different from my own, and yet there are many things we have in common. She is unflinchingly honest, something most of us are not, especially if it is not politically correct. Motherhood is the toughest job out there, and some days you wish you could quit, no matter how much you begged for the job in the first place. But there's no turning back, which is why this book was so fun to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Henry and Gus claim soul in the lost and found!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I loved reading this book, finally a woman who has the strength and courage to be so brutally honest about her struggle to become a mother later in life. Ms. Newman displays her amazing character and humor page after page. She reminds all of us no matter how many obstacles we encounter in our lives we must never give up if it is important to us. I find the book inspiring and impressive that Ms. Newman can re-visit her emotional journey to motherhood with her incredible wit."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tale to Treasure","review":"I'm a longtime fan of Judith Newman's magazine writing and fell in love with her twin sons, Henry and Gus, through her columns in Ladies Home Journal, so I knew I'd enjoy this book. What surprised me was how intensely I loved it. I knew it would be funny--very funny--but I didn't expect parts of it to make me teary.This isn't a good book, it's a superb one. Buy it now so when people are talking about it--and they will be--you'll be able to nod your head and say: \\"I know JUST what you mean-- and didn't you also love the part where Henry...\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Time On Her Hands","review":"Clearly, Judith has too much time on her hands. I cannot imagine any other reason she would write this book. She writes about how exhausting it is to care for two infants, yet she has time to run out and start an affair? Really? I have toddler twins, and I also work. I hardly have time to spend with my family, yet alone go out and start an affair. Her descriptions of life with twins do not ring true to this Mom. The book was a big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great title but for the wrong book ...","review":"Why would someone with such a low opinion of motherhood and babies have an obsessive need to bear offspring with a husband she doesn't live with and who, by the way, is the age of some great grandfathers? From the eye-catching title, I was expecting a humorous story about an older mom juggling career, marriage and motherhood. Instead, I found a disturbing glimpse into the life of a woman so unable to connect with her husband and children she lets readers in on her fantasies of killing them. Someone please alert social services!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like this book, I truly wanted to like this book","review":"but I was very disappointed with it. As I was reading it, I kept closing it and looking at the spine label to see if it was really non fiction because I couldn't believe the nasty things Judith Newman said about the people in her life. Aspiring to be an over-40 mom myself, I saw how little Newman's life related to my own experiences. More than that though, the tone of the book left me cold. I guess if you are a well-to-do Manhattanite in an unconventional marriage who believes acerbity is charming, this is a book you would like.

Quite the contrary. Although I was always told I would be a 'great mother' - I never wanted kids either - until I was 'almost too old'. I am now pregnant at 41 and LOVING IT. Judith's and my roads are fairly similiar (except I live with my husband who is my age and I had a brother). I am glad that I waited until my third trimester of a FINALLY successful pregnancy to read this.

So I bought my PGTips caffeinated and Twinings decaf since I've heard many people claim they are the best as well. Well, I am no tea expert, but in my opinion the Twinings has a better taste than the PGTips. It's bolder and strangely seems creamier after milk is added.

I still think \\"Laugh, Laugh\\", \\"Still In Love With You Baby\\" and \\"Don't Talk To Strangers\\" are some of the best songs to come out of the sixties. Put on your bell bottoms,Beatle boots, and Neru jackets then goove with the Beau Brummels."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Beau\\" follows \\"Beat\\"","review":"The Best of the Beau Brummels is a fairly interesting period piece. I never heard the group perform live but enjoyed some of their hits in the sixties. The songs don't sound all that good today, but they're okay. Perhaps the liner notes turned me off. The liner notes state that the group took its name because \\"Beau\\" follows \\"Beat\\" (as in Beatles), alphabetically speaking. People browsing the Beatles' bin would stumble onto the Beau Brummels records. That's not too kool, and it seems the group lacked the musical originality that made other groups lasting icons. This is not a terrible CD. It's okay. But why any group would tamper with Bob Dylan's words, as the Beau Brummels do in \\"One Too Many Mornings,\\" is beyond my wildest imagination.

Despite ample evidence many Turkish sources have been trying to \\"explain\\" or \\"justify\\" unjustifiable - extermination of the Armenian population of Turkey.

Even as a work of genocide denial it is vitriolic and paranoid. \\"Secrets of a Christian Terrorist State\\" is not a good source to see the so-called \\"other side\\" of the genocide debate; it is only useful to those who want to see an inflammatory racist diatribe masquerading as a work about history. Should any \\"historian\\" be believed when he tells immigrants to go home and claims that an entire race has a \\"Master Plan\\" of hatred?Make no mistake, this is racist propaganda, and Samuel Weems is not the sort of person that any country should be proud of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate and Ignorance","review":"This book is based on racism and hatred, written by a convicted felon and a disbared lawer who makes no secret of his hatred of the Armenians, and stamps the Armenians with such racial labels as \\"terrorists,\\" \\"liars,\\" \\"tellers of untruth.\\" He singles out individual cases of Armenian collaborationism in Nazi ranks (totally ignoring thefact that around 300 000 Armenians dies among Soviet ranks fighting the Nazis, and that a number of famous Soviet generals -- such as Isakov, Babajanian, Baghramian, Mikoyan -- were all of Armenian origin) to somehow \\"prove\\" that the Armenian genocide never took place. Overall, an incompetent and miserable effort of racial propaganda.p.s. at some point he goes as far as telling the American-Armenians \\"to go back to Armenia.\\" Do you immagine the author of a book your purchaised telling the African-Americans \\"go back to Africa\\"?? Where does this man stop?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Second side of the story?","review":"It is funny how genocide denialists hold on to this book as a sacred text. After all, the writer is not even a historian, does not pretend to be one either. I was appalled at reading the racist remarks by Mr. Weems, a disbarred Arkansas lawyer. Would he be telling Jews to leave America too? After all, Jews have \\"colonized\\" this country as well,using the authors logic. He is obviously on the payroll from Turkish groups.The truth is, \\"a second side about the Armenian Genocide\\" does not exist. Creating an alternative view would be analogous to saying, \\"Germans did not really gas the Jews\\" and claiming this is a valid argument despite mountains of evidence to the contrary.

He discounts the records from Turkish archives which admit the genocide, and comes up with rather convoluted theories.All and all a good example of perverse and amoral denial of historic facts.Motive is pretty clear, Weems family is Turkish, a fact not acknowledge in the book.Our professor felt that although his book has had no impact outside of turkey what it does is pollute the discourse in Turkey when the Genoicide is being discussed.

The arranger(s) obviously don't know anything about writing for a brass quintet or about arranging music.The performance of this music by the quintet is just terrible. The playing by individual members shows all the weaknesses in their playing. I would not rate this as a professional brass quintet.

There are false starts, with Dion shouting \\"let me start this one\\" at one point, with all the performers coming in at wrong times. All this adds to the atmosphere. Finally, of course, there's Dion and the Belmonts who gave everything.

It was working at first but the detent for the off position wouldn't work immediately after it was installed. Now that works but the dimmer is dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away - there are better alternatives","review":"The dimmer/switch is made of cheap plastic. Description of the item, on Amazon, does not mention that the switch fits only 3/8\\" mounting holes. This is revealed only after you open the sealed package. I had to shave the threaded portion of the plastic switch to match the 1/4\\" inch hole in the pole of the lamp. Regardless, the switch is too short to accommodate the inside and outside locking nuts snd the knob. I had to prop the entire switch inside the pole with a piece of wood and made it work, eventually.

The threaded stem which passes through the metal stem of the lamp was to short.

Next I used a band saw to shorten the plastic control knob so that the spline engaged when it was pressed on the control shaft.

Unfortunately, it did nothing of the sort. Many of the quotes seemed to have no other purpose than to fill up space on the page. One page, for example, says only \\"In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society\\" (Mr. Darcy, Pride and Prejudice). At least in that particular example the quote was attributed to the correct person. There are some where this is not the case, for example \\"A lady's imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony, in a moment.\\" This quote is incorrectly attributed to Miss Elizabeth Bennet instead of to Mr. Darcy. Another example is Henry Tilney's discussion with Catherine Morland on the relationship between dancing and marriage; that quote is incorrectly attributed to John Thorpe.

Ski Wolf being Uncle Billy's nephew who was bitten by a wolf.This is strictly an amateur production that I watched free online out of curiosity.(After seeing it consistently being listed on Amazon for $20.00)It's definitely not worth $20.00 or even .20 centsThere is one brief scene in the middle of the movie where a girl appears topless.

It represents how people could be so cold to someone else just because they are different and shows two sides to the story during the second World War, and most probably the most famous.

So it makes a nice padded carry-case for the \\"CPU\\" of my minidisc system...but it isn't a carrier to go jogging with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Walking with God Day by Day: 365 Daily Devotional Selections","review":"For someone seeking an early morning devotion this little book is perfect.

The voice is so quirky that it would be easy for it to go over the top, or become cloying, but it never does. Lehner delights not just in chasing absurdities to comic lengths, but in playing with the language -- and while it can be irritating when writers toss in fancy words, it doesn't here. She's not showing off; she's rejoicing in the richness of the language. My favorite is a tale about a knife that seems to have a malicious mind of its own, but the story of a phantom limb runs a close second. And, throughout, these odd saints keep appearing, to delightful effect."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"The book is so good I'll lend it out, get impatient about its return and simply buy a new one!

Not true. Calphalon Commercial Bakeware is aluminized steel. Mine are starting to RUST. They put a really really thin coat of aluminum over the steel to help it heat more evenly. But this is alot to pay for a conventional rust-prone steel pan. And their customer service sucks. They haven't answered my complaints about the rust problem (in one of my pans, it is on the non-stick inside surface where there is a seam, and affects flavor of baked goods)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Calphalon Commercial Bakeware 9-Inch Round Cake Pan","review":"The Calphalon Commercial Nonstick Bakeware collection is excellent. I recommend them without reservation. This 9 inch pan is a great size for cakes, I actually have 2 of them so I can make a double layer cake with filling. This pan is very high quality and the nonstick coating is superb! You can count on perfect cakes with this pan. One note: you may want to check on your cake a couple of minutes early. I have noticed that cakes are done a little quicker in pans with a dark finish. Many newer recipes will indicate the timing for dark finish bakeware. This pan is also a breeze to clean, just a little soap and water and you are done. Wonderful Pan! Highly recommended!Also, read the Calphalon brochure in the box, if you plan to nest this pan with others make sure to put a paper towel between them to prevent any damage to the nonstick coating."},{"rating":"1","title":"lacking description details","review":"Which specific model?The photos shows all models and no details on the type of thread (male/female)?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"This miter gauge looked good out of the box. However, as soon as I put it in the slot and tightened the knob, it bound hard in the miter slot. Looking at it closely, it appears that the machined hole for the tightening handle may have been slightly off of vertical, because the slide tilts in the groove when you tighten the handle. That causes the slide to bind. I bought this miter gauge based on its price.

Not a total waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"How not to conduct a manned mission....","review":"This is suppose to be fiction based on science fact. The CGI and visuals are stunning and mostly realistic. This is about a manned mission to tour the planets on board the Pegasus. The story has them first going to Venus and conducting a manned landing there and running into problems. Going to Mars, to Jupiter and it's moons, Saturn and finally to a comet. With each visit, there was a near fatal, and foreseeable catastrophe. This is a clever campaign against manned missions and leans more favorable to robot missions. The robots that were sent had no problems. I had issues with the astronauts in that they didn't do what they were told and making a solo landing on Io alone was totally unthinkable. I love the visuals but the story was invalid from the get go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing and inaccurate","review":"I was looking forward to this DVD, after seeing the fascinating BBC website and the very nice book (which by the way gave me a credit, for helping them with some photos of Venus).I was dissapointed in the show itself, which was depressing and riddled with technical mistakes and inaccuracies. I expect some fact checking from the BBC, but you cannot trust any statement or figure in this program. For example, the Russians landed on Venus 10 times, with the two Vega landers being the last. How could they get basic facts like that wrong? Going from Mars past the Sun to pick up speed -- energetically impossible and it wouldn't provide any speed boost.The show presents failure after failure, with almost every mission ending in near death. Just not very fun or educational or factual. Written by labor-party leftists I suppose, with weak science backgrounds, we get two hours of their anti-science sentiment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing special","review":"This mask is very lightweight and flexable, but is made to fit somebody with a jawstructure like an Easter Island statue. if you know anything about molding and modifying rubber/latex costume parts, then this would make a great base for a project, but dont buy this mask if you are just looking for a Batman mask to finish your costume.Still, it does look just like the picture, so they dont advertise it as being anything magnificent.

Don't be fooled by the September 1997 date--this book is a reprint of a slim volume originally published years ago, and seems old-fashioned to today's children. It looks like a cheap imitation of Alison Mack's delightful and effective TOILET LEARNING: THE PICTURE BOOK TECHNIQUE FOR CHILDREN AND PARENTS, using tacky photos instead of Mack's cute drawings, and leaving out the all-important section that gives guidance to parents. Mr. Rogers' book is just the thing for parents who want to save a few dollars at their children's expense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated & Boring","review":"I bought this book based on the great reviews from other customers.

Sean Hayes shows his true acting ability as a male struggling with his day to day life trying to survive financially, and also feels disconnected without a true relationship. He meets up with a young blonde who resembles Brad Pitt so much it is scary. A matter of fact the actors first name is Brad. However throughout the picture the Hayes character shows his true vulnerability, yet takes a chance with this man, knowing he may get hurt in the process, but takes a chance...on life. An excellent little picture that deserved more attention than it received. Don't get confused with Sean Hayes - he plays a deeper, more emotional gay male in this picture than he plays as the catty scratching Jack on NBCs \\"Will and Grace\\".....a definite one to rent."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Queer Cinema?

Why was Brad's father interviewed for only 3 minutes at the beginning of the video? Why not get some stories about their obviously strained relationship? There was a story about how Brad literally gave the shirt off his back to a friend, but that story lasted 10 seconds. Bud and Eric could not have looked less interested in being involved in this project. All concert footage IS CUT OFF half way through a song!

He is brilliant, but unfortunately he airs his psychological dirty laundry with this book. Anyone who reads even a portion of this book and doesn't feel disturbed should seek therapy, especially the author.

Real sex is about a subtle play of submission and dominance, but never violence, and never ill will. When he realizes this, both he and his lovers will have a much better sex life.P.S. Any girl who 'wants to get raped,' or 'be used and abused,' has obviously had sexual trauma (ie. real rape) in her past, and probably when she was a child. Not as erotic anymore is it?P.S.S.

The author obviously has a social agenda and although many of the reviews mention the wonderfully liberating 'realistic' parents, I know no parents who even slightly resemble Kate's folks. Also, some of the copy used is questionable. \\"Good Intentions?\\" and some dogs being \\"Nightmares?\\" There is a lit match on the mom's t-shirt that resembles a cigarette or joint. This compliments the tattoo and nose piercing nicely. My 3 year old won't be reading this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Let's Get a Pup!\\" said Kate.","review":"The little girl Kate's story begins when she notices an empty place in her home that was once filled by a beloved pet. She jumps out of bed, races into her parent's room announcing, \\"Let's get a pup!\\" Her parents begin listing those puppy qualities they seek in a new family member. It must be small, cute, get all excited and run around in circles. They go to the pound and find just the pup in Dave, but they also notice Rosy who is big, old, and slow but cozy. They leave without Rosy but that's not the end of the story. Clearly Bob Graham has great affection for dogs because he renders their ability to fill empty places in our homes and hearts both in his watercolor and ink illustrations and in the characters of Kate and her parents.For children from three to six."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Blatant Illustration Ruins This Book","review":"This otherwise nice story on the ever-popular theme of a family finding a pet is marred by one blatant, jarring element of the illustrations. Throughout most of the action in the book, the father is wearing a t-shirt that clearly shows a large, lit cigarette, which could be tobacco or marijuana, I'm not sure. The illustration is vivid and visible on several pages. WHY? I am all for depicting realistic people and settings, but when there are so many excellent children's books, why choose this irresponsibly illustrated book?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rediscovering Howard","review":"Howard Roberts was my uncle and although I only met him a few times, I knew his music as a young child in the late 1960s because my family had two of his albums: Goodies & All-Time Great Instrumental Hits. I hadn't heard the latter in many years until I got this CD, which I listen to all the time now. My favorites have to be \\"It Was a Very Good Year,\\" \\"Work Song,\\" and \\"The \\"In\\" Crowd.\\" Howard takes these songs and really makes them his own with his stylish interpretations. Both albums really swing and show that not only is Howard Roberts a great technical jazz guitarist, but he's also got alot of soul!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No battery life, volume needs to be higher.","review":"Although there is no interference at all, I would not buy this product again. It is not worth the price as the battery life is about 2 hours and it needs to stay on the stand charging to use it at all. The volume on this is way too low and there isn't anything you can do about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works MOSTLY great...","review":"At first blush, I thought this product didn't work that great because it would sound like the audio would \\"cut out.\\" But upon listening to it closer, it actually filters out standard background noise (like a window air-conditioner cycling on and off) so that you don't hear that type of noise, and then actually turns on when the baby makes a noise!I didn't give it 5 stars though, because the thermometer doesn't seem to work very well - it typically shows the temperature at 5-8 degrees above actual room temperature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the high price","review":"I bought this monitor to replace theFisher-Price Sounds 'n Lights Monitor with Dual Receiver. Loved the features, especially the room temperature thermometer and the two-way radio. The biggest issue with this monitor is that the volume is extremely low. I can't hear my baby at all! The main feature I look for in a baby monitor is the ability to hear what's going on in my baby's room. With the Fisher Price monitor I can even hear my baby's breath.Additionally, the battery life of the Phillips SCD 589 Digital baby Monitor is very poor. Even though the instructions say that you should fully charge the receiver and let the battery wear down during the first three uses, the battery still doesn't last long enough.I wouldn't recommend paying the high price for this product, especially if you live in an area with a lot of noise coming from the street or the environment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best monitor we've had","review":"We've had 3 children and about 5 monitors. We first bought a horrible monitor that isn't worth mentioning. For the past several years, we found Sony to make the best, but their monitors keep getting more static-y as they grow older. When we needed to replace yet another Sony, I went for this one. On the plus side, no interference, 3x range of other higher-end monitors I've had, uses rechargeable batteries that are standard (size AA), actually small and light enough to wear like a pager, kind of like having the ability to see temperature in nursery (we live in large house and are far from nursery at night). On the minus side, batteries don't seem to last as long on a charge as other monitors I've had. Overall, it is expensive, but if it lasts it should be worth it (only had it a few months so far)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor battery performance","review":"I followed exactly what the manual told on Battery charging but like most of us, got a very poor performance for battery even when unit just turns on less than 25% of time.Other than the fact I have to carry the power cord around, it is really a good monitor on features, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS PRODUCT IS AWESOME!!!!!!!!

Well, we had gone through 5 wireless monitors and NONE of them worked. So we spent over $10K hard wiring our nursery to watch our baby through our televisions. Yet, we had to be in front of a TV to listen or see her -- this left us immobilized. This product produced ZERO interference and picks up no background noise. You WILL NOT be sorry! One of the best products we own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this monitor","review":"At first we loved this baby monitor. The sensitivitly was great, the parental monitor size small and easy to carry around, and there was no interference. Then we started having problems with the charger bases. They didn't charge on contact. We'd have to wiggle it to get the red charger light to go on. It was hit or miss. Then one of the parental units died. We opened the unit and found the batteries had melted. I read on these reviews that you're only supposed to use rechargeable batteries. Either we're idiots or it it wasn't clear that the units could'nt sustain regular batteries. But even when they had the rechargeable batteries in them one unit had no off the charger life. And even if we had used reusable batteries both base connections stopped working. For $200 we should all expect more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good product, be aware of radiation.","review":"This product works great, but that comes at a price of potential health risks. The level of EMF/EMR radiation coming from this phone on DECT sinal levels is substantial.Potential health effects can occur. I wouldn't recommend it for this reason alone. This is like putting a high powered mobile phone mast next to your babies body."},{"rating":"1","title":"can't hear it -- bad product","review":"We bought this because of the interference in our neighborhood and our neighbors sometimes heard our baby instead of theirs, but we returned it because if you are 8 feet away from the monitor you will lucky to hear your baby cry. Also, you don't even hear that until your baby is in full cry mode, so why even have the monitor!The other features -- temperature monitoring, auto-off from the receiver, and 2 way speaking are great, but what's the point if the main function is defective?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed","review":"The product is expensive, however it is not reliable.

The parent unit, no matter what you change, is so quiet that you can BARELY hear your child. That made this baby monitor not worth the money, fix that one problem, and it would be worth every penny!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"Let me start by saying I have never owned another monitor so the interferance issue that people have with other brands I have never experienced. And this monitor works GREAT for that. I have none at all, however, the monitor would not stay charged in my first one. I changed batteries and that did not fix the problem. I might have gotten 2 hours out of it, maybe. It rarely came off the charger with a full charge. So Phillips replaced the whole thing, I do have to say I had no problems with them just sending me a new one. However this one will not tell the right temp. at all. it was broken from the day we got it. now for two hundred dollars I do have to say I would think everything would work and that is not the case. I guess if you want to spend two hundred for no interferance than this is worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Baby Monitor","review":"This product is very good.

We have had this monitor for 17 months and of course everything began to fail after warranties expire. It works great until then. My guess is very poor manufacturing processes of the electronics. That is why you see so many good reports and a smaller amount of these bad ones. Basically you take a risk of falling into the 30% of folks getting defective units with failures occurring after a years time. All said it would be a great unit if the charger would still charge the unit and the LCD display didn't have multiple segments gone, a real guessing game to what the temperature is : )"},{"rating":"1","title":"Work on the cradle please!","review":"I am just one of those lucky ones like other users, the cradle just own charge up... when we got the monitor.. it has 1 bar of the battery.. but after 16 hrs of charging..(which was instructed) it went from 1 bar to 0 bar.. man..

Good luck to others new born parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely silence","review":"Pros:- No cracking noises, no interference. It's only our baby or lovely silence. Great unit.- Nice to be able to talk from the parent unit to the base.- Good to know our conversation is kept private.- We got the one with the temperature monitor, thought it might come in handy.Cons:- The volume is a bit low to wake up very sleep deprived parents. If you're awake or have light sleep it's just fine. Maybe get the model with two parent units instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"best monitor","review":"We've been through a few monitors in the 20-$60 range and I wish we just had this one to start! My daughter is now 2 and I especially love the walkie-talkie feature. The last review said they had trouble with the sound but I actually have to turn ours down some nights so I'm not hearing every little noise. I do think you have to have the monitor near the crib though. We have WiFi and a 900 mghz phone and haven't had any interference from our electronics or our neighbors phone. We haven't used the lullaby feature since our daughter can turn her own music on if she wants (2 years old). I'm not always sure the temperature reading is 100% accurate, but I'd say it is within a few degrees. It's given me a clue to why our daughter is restless some nights when I see her room has gotten to warm. It is pricy, but so far it's been the most hassle free monitor we've had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective Product","review":"Ordered the first one. Cradle did not charge. Returned.

Cut a hole in the top of the case and installed both of these fans for Pulling and drop the temp down to 25C idle, and 45C load.You can hear the fans but that is okay with me, I like the idea of hearing them spin: if I did not hear anything I would be worried. Do have to say that if it was over 32dB/s I would not be happy.

The book has lots of fast, gritty action--no singing cowboys or psychological complications here.

The author said he wrote in the style of Walt Witman which was a major shift from traditional Khmer poetry with it's oral and melodic style.This book is heavily based in myth, spirituality and hardship of a man who's life has seen the most extreme in hills and valleys.I recommend this book to anyone.

I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT yoga dvd for all levels!","review":"I love Bethany, and I love Kristin McGee so I REALLY loved this dvd! I've been doing yoga for years and found this to be a great dvd to do at home."},{"rating":"2","title":"BethennyFan430","review":"Get this DVD now! I'm no yogi and I was able to do most of the poses and follow the workout. As I get stronger, I'm pretty sure I will be able to do it all. Her arm and butt workouts included at the end are great too. Even if I can't do the whole yoga workout, I can fit in the booty blast and arm workouts. Plus, if you like her show you'll love this. Her personality comes out just as it does in her shows. She's encouraging without being forceful. This is yoga after all, so I wanted to be relaxed. It's a great DVD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"kinda boring","review":"i did the excersize once and that was enough it felt very looong but yet all the moves were rushed it didnt give you enough time to even get one position right yoga is supposed to be for relaxation this felt overly rushed and did nothing for me at all. it was also confusing both bethenny and the trainer were doing different moves sat the same time i didnt know who to follow. yeah it was disapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginners","review":"I bought this because in her hype and promos Bethenny said that it was for \\"all levels of fitness\\". I am not in stellar shape but I do work out and I got frustrated after the first 3 minutes! If you look like the women in the video and are very flexible, you may like it but it was not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT for beginners!","review":"I was very excited to get this video but disappointed half way through. Not only is this video clearly not for beginners but the quality wasn't very good and the background music was horrible.The moves were much too fast with very little instruction. Very disappointed with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Real Housewives of NYC... Love Bethenny.... LOVE her YOGA DVD!","review":"So I was already two out of two things you need to be when you buy this DVD...a Bethenny fan, and a yoga fan! I do yoga at least once a week for the last 2 or so years, and I think it's the best way to unwind after a long workday. With this DVD, you get a way to focus on your breathing, relax, and you still break a sweat and get a workout in. Kristin and Bethenny go thru a series of sun salutations, then work in warriors 1, 2, and 3. You do tree pose for balance work, and pigeon pose to really open up your hips. I typically have been doing the 40 minute yoga practice, followed by the 10 minute arm workout, and I feel like I got a nice workout for the day. Would definitely recommend this to Bethenny's fans, or if you are new to yoga. The instruction is such that even if you are a beginner, you can understand what they are saying about form and breath work.... Give it a try. You'll be hooked!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Body By Bethenny","review":"I received this DVD for Mother's Day (it was on my wish list). It is great. I have taken yoga classes before and wanted to again. However, I wanted to make sure that I still remembered the positions. This is my third day of doing the yoga moves with Bethenny and it is great. My daughter came over this morning and we both exercised to the DVD. She is now going to buy one. Guess I won't be paying $10. for each yoga class, I will just continue to work out with Bethenny's DVD. People it is well worth the money and I would recommend it to all of you.Congrats Bethenny and Jason are your beautiful baby girl."},{"rating":"2","title":"REAL","review":"What I love about Body by Bethenny is how Bethenny interjects & modifies the movements as necessary - giving full-permission to rest or take a break. I often get discouraged with my other workout DVDs when the instructor moves swiftly & smoothly from one pose to another (while I'm falling over or losing my balance) -- it was nice to see that Bethenny was using breaks during Kristen's instructions & she let you know if the move was challenging!A real workout from a real person - refreshing change from the norm out there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good workout","review":"I am relatively new to yoga, so reading some of the previous reviews made me a bit skeptical. However, after doing this video, I discovered there was no reason to be affraid.The succession is nice and the pace keeps your heart rate up. I also like the short segments at the end for a quick workout if that's all you have time for.I think its a great addition to your current yoga practice or as an addition to other workouts you may do."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this video!","review":"It's the perfect combination of yoga, weights, and squats - one hour gets in a full body workout, I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a Stress Relieving DVD","review":"I am a huge fan of Bethenny Frankel and find her quite funny and entertaining in this video, the yoga is really good and I like the practice here, but it's not a quiet, relaxing yoga practice. When I'm in the need of something fun, light and I am not in the really need to relax mood, this is not the dvd. I have others that relieve the stress and relax me. If I just want a yoga workout, Bethenny's is great and funny to boot."},{"rating":"2","title":"never do reviews but felt compelled...","review":"...because this was so good. I really, really like Bethenny so my review may be slightly biased. This experience was like going to a private yoga session with a good friend. There's no cheese or bs; just a refreshingly straightforward, funny, effective, efficient workout. I do bikram yoga sporadically, and this workout made me sweat in my non heated tv room. I felt a very satisfying soreness in my arms/core/lower back (even after doing 2 successive days of bikram sessions the day before I did this workout).I wish she would do more, just to have some variety and new comedic material."},{"rating":"1","title":"not impressed","review":"If people kept asking Bethenny what she did to keep in shape, all she needed to do was say \\"yoga\\", she didn't need to release her own very mediocre yoga dvd. The yoga routine is nothing special, and probably too challenging for a beginner, her commentary is at best distracting, and at worst annoying. There are better, more engaging yoga dvd's out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"I really enjoy this DVD. It is a very easy to follow yoga dvd, with a 5 minute \\"Booty Blast\\" and a 10 minute strength training segment. You certainly will sweat during this workout and you will be sore the next day. My only complaint is that is might be too easy, and a after a few times doing it is becomes a little boring. I still love it for those days when I don't feel like challenging myself to much, plus I love Bethenny and the humor she adds to the workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for those who don't like all the zen","review":"I found this video challenging yet fun. I like how Bethenny says the things you are thinking during your typical yoga session. Not too serious and not too zen. Just a good workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"good workout","review":"I'm a huge fan of Bethenny. Love her show, love her white peach skinny girl margarita and now love this yoga video. I've done it 3 times and it's a great workout, easy to follow and feel the burn the next day. Not to mention I'm standing straighter!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really not what I expected.","review":"Having read so much about the RMAX products I thought I was in for a challenging workout when I ordered this product. Wow was I wrong. If you have a wrestling background where you are used to doing movement type drills you will find this DVD not very challenging to say the least. If you are new to movement drills then perhaps this DVD might teach you something and even perhaps challenge you. For my part I was very disappointed as I expected something akin to Ginastica Natural. What I received was a very basic mobility workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Baking pan But...............","review":"I have to agree with the other review about those corners. I just made a cake and am having fits trying to clean the corners. I thought a q-tip might help and it did a little bit but its too big for the corner. I will soak it a little longer and think of something else. If I could unfold the thing there wouldnt be a problem. As it is, I am going to look into the Hoffritz brand instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Folded Corners","review":"This is a very nice pan, but it is extemely difficult to clean. The corners are folded over and water gets trapped in them and then will rust if you cannot get it out. I have become very frustrated with baking sheets/pans that rust due to trapped water. I am hand washing these items as well, so I would reccomend looking for something without folded corners."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice pan till you have to clean it","review":"The pan is terrific - heavy duty, nice non-stick surface, but SO difficult to clean. And what's worse, I was having trouble cleaning the corners and assumed it was dishwasher-safe. Big mistake: the non-stick coating is gone and it's no longer usable unless I line the whole thing with foil. Ugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Production","review":"Voyage to the Planets and Beyond is a DVD well worth watching if you think about human travel to other planets and what the challenges would be to walk about Venus, Mars, or the moons of Jupiter or Saturn. The production demonstrates the stress of such long duration space flight would most certainly result. In fact, the human factor is quite light as compared to what will confront humans on such voyages in this century. The video is quite educational for high school and college level to understand the solar system and human spaceflight generally. I purchased it and would do so again."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD FOR NEW COMERS!","review":"They were surprisingly good. I used them to explain concepts to a 60 year old with no \\"new world\\" skills and we both enjoyed the set very much.

Over all there great moves, buy them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy This Switch","review":"Like all the others this switch does not work. Just dead after installation. Worthless.

The switch was dead on arrival and the customer service of Sylvania advised me to return it to amazon.Don't buy this product, something major is wrong with this device!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mostly entertaining","review":"Overall, this was a pretty good book, but it doesn't match Knights of the Kitchen Table and Sam Samurie for Time Warp Trio fun. While it was entertaining to watch them run from the girls, hide from the sabertooth, etc., it was hard to believe that they were in any danger. The dialogue was often witty, but the plot a little thin which took away from the adventure. If you've read the other Time Warp Trio books, then you should read this one, but if you've never enjoyed the adventures of Fred, Sam and Joe you should try one of the better ones first.Also recommended - King Fortis the Brave - probably the best young adult fantasy book to come out since the Chronicles of Narnia were published."},{"rating":"2","title":"Your Mother was a Neanderthal","review":"The book that I'm reading is Your Mother Was a Neanderthal by Jon Scieszka. This book is very interesting and mysterious. It's all about going through time and seeing what life was like in the past. The part I like best is when they find the Neanderthal, but you'll have to find that out yourself. Anyone who likes to read fantasy should get this book. It makes you feel like your really there and this is no joke. I'm sure you will agree with me but that's your decision to make.This is a very good book for all ages even for adults and theirs a series too! Try the books that are The Time Warp Trio. Some other books you might want to try are Summer Reading Is Killing Me, 2095, and It's All Greek To Me! I have read mostly all of the series of the Time Warp Trio books and I'm still trying to finish it up. Try the best you can a getting these books and I hope you enjoy them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh out loud fun!","review":"The Time Warp Trio (Fred, Sam and Joe) find heart-stoppingadventure when they end up in the days of the caveman. Cleverword-play keeps the reader laughing and the non-stop adventure keeps the pages turning. Another fun and highly entertaining book in the Time Warp Trio series. Jon Scieszka combines adventure, history, fantasy and humor in a compelling format that even reluctant readers will find hard to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Infectious, Need to read more about the Time Warp Trio","review":"This is the second of Time Warp Trio adventures which my daughter (8 years old) and I have read. Again, we laughed and were intrigued to follow the adventure. Again, the illustrations were humorous and imaginative! Best of all the end of the story was a creative twist which had us look at each other and question what was said and what did it mean."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is nothing good about these headphones.","review":"Aiwa is usually a good brand but for some reason this pair of headphones is really terrible.1.I tried to listen to music on the train with these and the noise cancelation didn't do anything to quiet the surroundings.2.It is probably the most uncomfortable pair of headphones I have owned.3.My hair kept on getting caught in folding joint at the top.4.The amplifier that it comes with makes the music sound terrible.5.There is a battery case that sticks into the side of your head.6.They look ugly. Trust me.7.They keep sliding off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't beat the price","review":"I'm on planes a LOT and bought these specifically to use to watch DVDs when flying. I love 'em. They are snug but not in the least uncomfortable and easily wipe out 50% of engine noise and amplify the sound well. They do create a hiss when the noise reduction switch is on, but I think that's the point- it cancels out some of the planes ambient noise and after a couple of minutes I'm used to it and don't notice it at all. I also thought they were fine regular headphones with the noise reduction feature off. Keep in mind that I'm not a big audio buff, but I shopped around and thought that these were a good deal and still do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Low cost noise cancelling headset - but not for bald people!","review":"I recently picked up the Aiwa CN5 headset from radio shack (~$$$) and was pleasantly surprised at how a low-cost NC headset could perform. I also use higher-end ones when flying my plane, but they are WAY too bulky for portable electronics (CD/DVD) on commercial flights. Anyway, Aiwa headset sounds fine, but has no padding on the plastic band which scrapes my hairless head top! Bring along a felt pad or something or it will get annoying very quickly! All-in-all, I'd recommend picking up a set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Refurbished -- but still defective","review":"I bought a refurbished pair for $ from an Amazon partner, \\"...\\". They came in some generic packaging with photocopied instructions and a 30 day non-manufacturer warrantee. Evidently there's now a mini-industry of businesses that handle returns and refurbishes them.At home they seemed to work. With noise reduction on they had a soft background hiss, and if I moved around in some noise settings they produced an annoying buzz. On an airplane, however, the right earphone produced an earsplitting whine. The headphones are defective, the noise canceling mechanism is malfunctioning.I have a nasty suspicion that the headphones were rather minimally \\"refurbished\\", and that this defect was the reason they were returned in the first place. It wouldn't show up in simple testing without an airplane volume noise source nearby.Don't buy these refurbished headphones unless you have money to waste...."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a joke","review":"I rarely am so displeased with a product that I'll go out of my way to write a negative review of it. In this case I'm that displeased. The noise canceling technology of these headphones consist of \\"white noise\\" generated in the headphone speakers, intended to drown out other sounds. Great idea, but if I want to listed to the hiss of white noise I'll hold a seashell up to my ear and tell myself I can hear the ocean. Replacing one type of noise with another is not helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money at all.","review":"not only did these headphones not block any sound, and broke after 1 month of use.

More importantly, they tended to buzz (electronically) when I used them with my laptops -- totally defeating any noise canceling benefit they might've provided.I was looking for a less expensive alternative to my Sennheiser HDC 451's, which are excellent.I guess I should've known better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad out of box","review":"This set of headphones were bad right out of the box..I have co-worker/friends that have purchased the same product ( refurbished by the same company ) and most have failed to work properly within 2 to 5 days..problems like ( canceling feature doesn't work at all..Humming noise..or bad sound quality ) I wouldn't waste my time or money sending product back to this company..as they can't fix them right the first time..(...).."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid these headphones","review":"I've had these headphones for about a year. And they are truly awful.They sound terrible. They buzz when noice canceling is turned on. They are very uncomfortable. And they don't work very well at cancelling the equipment noise in my cubicle.A coworker who tried them jokingly suggested that the buzz was the \\"noise canceling\\" feature, because he couldn't here the equipment fan noise in his office/lab because the buzz masked it. My experience is the buzz just adds to the noise.I've tried to give the headphones away twice. Both times my coworkers have returned them. I'd recommend that you seriously look at other noise canceling headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"Yuck! Way too uncomfortable - I couldn't last 30 minutes wearing this, let alone a 12 hour flight to Narita."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hissing Head Squisher","review":"These headphones are uncomfortable to me, they are sprung too tightly, with no adjustment. The noise cancelling does appear to work, but I wanted to use them to attenuate the noise from adjoining cubicle dwellers. It does this effectively if you turn up the volume, but so do regular ear-bud headphones. The hiss with the noise cancelling turned on is not something that you could stand without some high volume music to go along with it. I haven't taken a plane ride with them, so I'm not sure how they would fare in that application. Also, it uses 1 AA battery, not 2 AAA."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful bargain for air travel","review":"These headphones are wonderful. They are compact and a good bargain, and they cancel a great deal of the airplane noise that prevents hearing music or a movie. They are comfortable, with the only downside that they don't have a volume control on the cord."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got what I paid for.","review":"I bought these and thought it would be great, however when I got them I found out otherwise.I have used these for about a week now, and also let others try them.

Major design flaw, and makes using these otherwise decent headphones unacceptable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Close But Not Quite","review":"The sound quality is good but not fabulous.The biggest problem is the hissing sound.But they do reduce noise. It's not just covering up the noise with the hiss. If you wear them with the power turned on, and no music playing, you can definitely hear outside noises get much quieter. They completely block out sounds of things like cars and buses and air conditioners. And I would estimate that they cancel half of the noise on a jetliner.But for listening to music in a quiet environment they are not so great, because of the hiss.Despite the flaws, they are the lowest priced noise canceling phones I could find, and they do cancel noise very well, so I gave them a 4."},{"rating":"1","title":"Astonishingly uncomfortable.","review":"The headband looks like it should sit flat on your head, but it doesn't. You have to move the headphones around a little to get the noise cancelling to kick in, and the sharp plastic edge of the band digs into your scalp like a slow medieval torture (yes, I have hair, it doesn't help). I have been seen sitting on planes with part of an airplane pillow on my head, just trying to make these livable for an hour. The low price and somewhat-functional noise cancelling are useless if you can't wear them. Order something else, I am."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea with mediocre execution","review":"I bought these headphones after briefly trying a friend's pair. The price was low, but so is the comfort level. They sit a little too tight on my ears, so I don't keep them on for more than 30-60 minutes at a time. Also, the fabric covering the speakers wears out and rips off over time. My friend's pair eventually snapped in half (though he is a heavy headphone user).Also, the headphones block out low frequency noises pretty well (especially on an airplane), but I can still perfectly understand what people are saying. Part of my intention with these headphones was to block out people-noise so I can better concentrate at work."},{"rating":"1","title":"think twice","review":"Think more than twice before you decide to buy this product, unless the shape of your head is square.I wonder if the design engineer of this product knew the word \\"ergonoimcs\\".

The quality of the blu ray is definitely an upgrade. I thought the CGI and art work was very well done for the budget, does it look as good as Evangelion 2.22, no but nothing does. The music and voice work was spot on. The only real complaints here are that once this movie ends, your totally ready for the next...with no official release dates...it could be awhile. So if your a Berserk fan and like watching your anime in high def blu ray then pick this one up. At 18 bucks its a little expensive but im sure the price will drop eventually or you can wait on a used copy. I am not giving 5 stars because i want to finish watching the series now and there are no extras on this disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!","review":"This is a portion of the golden age of berserk.

It is remarkable the ground that is covered in this feature film adaptation. I did find that the first half of the movie swooped over quit a bit of materiel, making the transitions between events in the story a bit sudden. But in the second half of the movie it slows down a bit and fallows a more steady flow of narrative.The ending left me eager for the next installment. It is a treat to see the action and highlights of the story displayed in such beauty for the first time on screen. Any fan of the existing series will be reworded by watching this movie.

I'm a huge fan of berserk and have been since I discovered it years ago in fact I would even say its my favorite anime of all time. The animation was good until the cgi would kick in mainly around battle scenes where I kept getting reminded of the lego video game graphics and people. The movie was hard to follow even for someone who had seen the original anime series many times and if you had never heard or watched berserks anime then forget about understanding this movie. Instead ofcomming out with these disappointing movies why couldn't they have just picked up the anime where it left off and keep it the original animation? This movie was an embarrassment to the berserk franchise and an insult to its fans don't buy it.

That being said, this is a great version of the story.Technically however, there are parts of this that are near unwatchable.While the traditional animation is amazing, the use of 3D models is awful. Holy crap they are bad. There are whole sections that look and feel like a PS2 videogame cutscene.I am very glad I did not purchase this, and only rented the HD version.From the title and intro, it looks like they are going to make more of these. Please god no more 3D. Just animate the thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Berserk done wrong","review":"I am going to start by saying Berserk the series is my second favorite anime of all time, but this Golden Arc story has reduced it to Naruto mindless action that should not even carry the same name. All the character development is gone our of Guts, Caska, and especially Corkus who has none of the personality from the original anime. The story is rushed, and the battles have no build up of suspense to make it feel any different than any other anime on the market. If you like action then you will initially like the animated battles, but even those get tiresome as the movie dramatized flare takes away from the struggle it is supposed to represent. The worst part of this anime is the dialogue, once one of the best written animes I am watch, has been reduced to a childish dribble that makes it feel like an episode of Pokemon. I am glad my friend bought this instead of myself, because it is money wasted, get the original series and watch this movie series free on the internet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it.","review":"I am a big fan of the Berserk animes.

I thought it would be a rush job but with really good action scenes.The action scenes kind of sucked even worse than the cell animation from the first anime.It condenses everything up to Griffiths imprisonment into one hour. And the rational thing to do would be say okay we can't really tell any kind of plot someone would understand, but at least we could get one really well done action scene.every single somewhat decent action bit was actually in the preview. I literally liked the preview better than the movie itself.No extras except some stupid concept art. no outtakes, no commentary, no behind the scenes.berserk is one of my favorite manga and I was expecting way more.

In order for folic acid to be effective in lowering homocysteine levels, it needs to be taken in conjunction with Vitamin 6 & 12, This product allows you to get the benefit of a maximum dose of folic acid (800mcg) and the necessary Vitamin B's ALL in ONE caplet. Much easier than having to buy folic acid and Vitamin B complex *separately* in order to properly augment. Although recent studies have questioned the relevance of homocysteine levels regarding cardiac health, I believe there's a great deal of merit in continuing to take folic acid. My homocysteine levels decreased substantially (from a 14 to an 8) after taking this folic acid/Vitamin B complex combination for six months. I would strongly recommend it.

Overall, the train is cute because it does play music, but my 4 year old would rather draw on it then try and make this train follow the track. Too much work, for it to properly work only a fraction of the time.All in all, he would have been just as satisfied with the $16 'on sale at Walmart' regular aqua-doodle mat.This item is too expensive for it to not work as promised."},{"rating":"1","title":"train only worked once!","review":"this was purchased for my 2 yr old son who loved to draw and scribble. He was so excited to see thomas riding the track - well it worked the day we opened it and never again! I would recommend not spending the money on this one and get the regular aquadoodle for 1/2 the price! You are not able to wash the mat so if you get anything on it (eg. crayon or dirt) you can't get it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"We purchased this for our 2 yr old son for Christmas. If you create a perfect track (amost never happens) and don't have too many turns, Thomas will follow it most of the time.This was a complete waste of money.

Unfortunately the top of the train track pen after a couple of uses wouldn't come off. I tried everything. eventually the pen part cracked, and the whole think=g is useless.

It was a complete waste of money. The mat must be completely flat with absolutely no bumps, and your toddler must draw the track applying his total body weight to the roller with no flaws in the track print and no sharp turns! The train will not follow the track unless your track is perfect! What toddler is going to be able to do this or even want to do this? Mine ended up more entertained by popping the bubble wrap!Spend your money on something that is better quality and offers your child at least 5 minutes of enjoyment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste money on this","review":"After several attempts, my children and I were unable to even get the train to move on the tracks we made. Very disappointed in this product and would recommend you spend you money on something else! My children had a great time with the mat itself without the train.

All pieces were wrapped and secure.Assembly- Easy, once I got past my mistake of putting one piece on backwards. Directions not great, but if you have ever put anything together, they are good enough. All pieces were there. Everything lined up as it should have, I didn't have to drill or move anything.Quality- Excellent, for the price! Very sturdy, no blemishes, uniform color.

There were scratches on noticable areas and poorly drilled holes which made assembly impossible.

We had to remove the magnet and glue it in its proper place to ensure the doors would remain closed. &#60;br /&#62;<br />&#60;br /&#62;<br />I honestly expected more from Target. The price is reasonable, but it's a gamble on if the box you choose will be defective. Then you are left with a headache to return such a cumbersome item. Our luck was not good- 3 out of 5 to be returned is not good odds. Buyer beware or at least forewarned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I've had good experiences with most furniture pieces from this collection, but this was not one of them. It arrived with one piece damaged; other pieces were warped or not cut straight. It was very difficult to assemble -- DO NOT attempt this by yourself, at least if it is as difficult to fit together as mine. Also, don't buy it if you think someone who weighs more than 200 pounds might sit on it (as per a warning in the package, and judging by the quality of the materials). Also, be careful when screwing in the metal pegs.

The primary difference is that the Calphalon has a rounded interior while the Anolon has straight edges (if that's a concern, I'd recommend looking at Cuisinart or even higher-quality Calphalon). Cleanup of this pan is anything but easy and the non-stick started wearing off almost immediately. And as for the dimples on the bottom of the pan... they make for an interesting pattern on your food but I see no other value to them (other than to trap food)."},{"rating":"2","title":"FABULOUS","review":"This was my first piece of Calphalon.

The story of the extended Hill family who all, for various reasons return to their vast family home, where Aunt Lily lives alone, was simply a delight to read. Nothing heavy hear, just a wonderful set of stories about the flaws and follies of these various family members. The story is well-told and often very amusing. I found myself laughing out loud in public places--it takes a great book to make me do that. I know others have problems with the sentences in the novel, but I have to disagree. Reading, the actual act of reading this novel was a bit like talking with a rather educated chatterbox with a sharp eye and a terrific sense of humor. The sentences and paragraphs may meander, but they get you where you need to be by a scenic and thoroughly amusing route. The novel does not have (and frankly does not need) a plot that keeps moving forward. You are not really going to wonder what will happen next, but I assure you, you won't want to miss what happens.

Similarly, \\"ladder\\" (something on which to climb) was spelled correctly twice and \\"latter\\" once. I can only guess what the rest of the book was like. That's shoddy editing, and it ruined my reading. If you are not bothered by such a thing, do finish the book. The plot sounds interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I hate to be the dissenting voice here, but I was really disappointed with this book. Where was Nancy Clark's editor when he/she was needed. Her sentences are far too long and overburdened with too many adjectives. Less really can be more!

I like to get my money's worth and rarely give up on a book without finishing it... but I just couldn't hang in there for this one. Although each character has some type of quirk, they are exagerated and over the top. This is really the only thing you get to know about each person. I felt I didn't know the characters and therefore could have cared less about them. I almost feel guilty giving only one star for a book because I love to read. But, in the end, I couldn't even read TO the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Hills at Home","review":"This is a tedious, implausible book with a huge cast of characters, none of which you can actually like and many of which you'll actually dislike. There are spots of bad grammar and weird non sequiturs. One thing I cannot understand is how 12 people, more or less, could share one bathroom so conveniently.

POINT FOUR: One minute is also the length of most commercials, and therefore, their corresponding jingles. POINT FIVE: Jingles are the music of America.

The difference between this album and the pop songs they are supposedly (but aren't really)parodying is that most of these songs BEG to be longer, whereas if they really were pop songs they wouldn't.However, it is not the best Residents CD. This album came out at the tail end of their creative peak, and after a dozen or so songs, the album starts to sound like channel flipping. \\"Here's a sound, here's a chord, here's a weird instrument\\".That said, it's a lot of fun.

However, this particular translation isn't even a translation of the book Muhammad wrote. It is a commentary. The traslators injected so many of their views into the text that it is impossible to seperate the translation from their comments. If you want to read the Qur'an,read Pickthall or Ali. This one is not true to the original Arabic. No doubt the translators meant well. Instead, they muddied the water."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's the Quran","review":"Reading the Quran is quite a shocker sometimes. Especially if you come to it with basic assumptions of peace and the equality of mankind. There are, non the less, some great stories and lessons in the Quran, I will not deny it, although most of them are also in the Torah and the Bible first (which are themselves shockers to first time readers sometimes! though, I'd say less so) And as the Muslims claim, there are some amazing things in there that are seemingly 'before their time' though the educated person knows that much of the sciences and maths like Algebra an Chemistry have their origins with the Arabs who were quite scientific in older days around the time of the compiling of the Quran from its various sources. I do encourage curious people to read it, for we should not be totally ingnorant. Though just alittle bit more reading and you'll find it (the Quran) is not so Holy as the Muslims would have you believe."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fair and Good Interperatation","review":"I deem that this translation is indeed a good interpretation of the Qur'an, which does not contradict the original arabic Qur'an, be it in wordings or literary devices.

The author seems to employ all primary meanings of several terminologies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Answers, or more questions?","review":"I read this in order to clarify some of the more controversial principles of Islam: slavery, treatment of women and captives, use of warfare, meaning of \\"paradise,\\" and, yes, beheading and punishment in general. This translation was done before the modern wahabists who, I assumed, interpreted Jihad to be a licence for aggressive war. The Nooruddins translation has, to me, the \\"ring\\" of truth. I would like to think that violent interpretations were constructed to justify conquest and disregard of other faiths. This translation affirms the value of all sincere faiths (albeit somewhat hard on the Jews) and forbids opportunistic killing and destruction in the name of Islam. Most important, to me, was the concept, set forth in the beginning chapters, that the Qu'ran is meant to be CLEAR and UNDERSTANDABLE, implying, to me, that the multitude of interpretations and revisions are as likely as not to lead to error. \\"Allah knows what is in your hearts.\\" Well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS INTERPRETATION CLEARLY REPRESENTS THE TRUTH OF GOD","review":"Each verse in this translation carefully dictates the scripture God intended for us to understand.

The Holy Quran serves as a guiding light for all who want to learn more about God and be better Muslims while doing it.

I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate translation","review":"This translation of the Quran, though aesthestically pleasing as far as print goes, is inaccurate in its translation of the original arabic text.

And I got the impression they didn't know what to do with characters (relationship-wise).Personally, I haven't found really memorable stories in there like the one about the plane in the 1st season. On the whole, CSI LV became similar to CSI Miami - colder, techier, with wrong emphasis here and there.Characters seem to be somehow disjointed, and they no longer have that nice chemistry of former seasons.

Production did a good job including many of Bill's early and late footage of his shows. Fan or not, I think no one will be disappointed watching this film.

I bought it for my 2 girls for Christmas and they both HATED it. The first time the toddler got on it, she fell off immediately and got hurt. She tried again later while I guarded her, and again, off she went. My older daughter (3) couldn't make it bounce, roll or do anything exciting and got off it immediately never to get back on. As well as boring, I think it is incredibly unsafe ... the \\"handle\\" is not really a handle and therefore there is nothing substantial to hold onto. Don't be lured in by sweet childhood memories of yesteryear. They took a good product and totally DESTROYED it. Buyer beware ... don't put your child's safety in jeoperdy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"bad choice---waste of money","review":"This was a useless toy and not worth donating because it is too hard for child to use!

Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Great!","review":"This little worm didn't work well for my special needs son. He freaked out when I put him on it. The saddle-style seat with built in hand grip is ackward to say the least. It is so low and the plastic is not smooth, so my child didn't want to hold on. He basically threw himself backwards when I put him on this. I am glad I was holding onto him the entire time. I sold it on craigslist. It just didn't seem safe. Also, my child's feet barely touched the ground with this and he is 32\\" tall. No good! There isn't even a way to make it bounce. You have to have 100lbs pushing down on it to get it to move!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definately not what it used to be.","review":"I got this toy a over a year ago (maybe even two???? they had just came back out). I have three boys 18 months,3 years, and 4 years and NONE of them will play with this. I have shown them many times how it bounces and have put them on it but.... Houston... we have a problem. The toy has changed and does not go forward as it did in the days that I played with it (not THAT long ago). I still keep hoping that one of my boys may start to use it. I couldn't rate the durability on this toy accurately as it has seen no use. It just sits there.Don't bother with this one.

My son flipped over the top of it when it hit a rise in the sidewalk and needed 17 stitches in his tongue.

Don't be fooled like most of us were. This is not the original inchworm toy. If you are expecting the classicRadio Flyer The Inchwormversion, you will be just as disseminated as the rest of us. I did not realize there was more than one version.That being said the main reason this toy is not very fun for my toddler is that it is too tall. He is two and still has to use his tip toes. If this was dropped down a couple inches it might be more fun. Also, unlike the Radio Flyer version, this toy does not move forward when bounced on.In short, I recommend any buyer to go try both out at a store before buying here (to get the best price). The Radio Flyer is better, and is priced accordingly, however if you have a tall toddler then maybe this one's for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"So so... but not as good as the original","review":"Ditto to most of the comments from the other users. My daughter got this last spring. She is very physical, rambunctious, and rough with her toys. The first time she tried making it \\"bounce\\" the noise scared her and she wouldnt get on it again for a long time. It doesn't roll very easy especially since that is what this toy is designed for. Most of the time she gives up riding it and I end up carrying it the rest of the way home. I hope her legs wont be too long to use it next spring, but I'm not counting on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not like they used to be but still ok","review":"My kids don't know how cool this toy used to be but they don't care, they like to ride the worm anyway. I love that it doesn't need any batteries, doesn't really make any noise (the kids make that up as they go) and that it's small enough to stay an inside toy and still useful at the park too.

But, it was cheesy and lame. The only good thing about the book is the exotic pictures of iconic historical figurines doing ritualistic things. The author, it appears, knows nothing of pagan or other culture rituals and if anything, seems to be making fun of them intentionally or not. The book is short so it lacks content and substance. It is clearly not a scholarly piece of literature. In the end, it appears to be another book trying to make money off of Jerry Garcia and the Grateful Dead. How disappointing.

Watching this film I can't help but remind myself of my own friedship with my best friend. No we didn't end up in jail but the things that they'll do for each other is in itself beautiful and heartfelt.I look at this film as a lesson for anyone travelling to an unfamiliar country. How many times that we have to remind ourselves never to trust stangers, let alone spend a night with them. Yet at times, strange things do happen and Darlene and Alice are left to face the consequences of it.Forget the critics. Watch it and judge it by yourself.

Great acting from Bill Pullmam too. It also has one of the best song soundtracks I've ever heard to compliment a movie, and compliment the movie it does - extremely well.The DVD has cast profiles and a very good trailer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reason I didn't give it a one star","review":"Warning -semi-spoilersOkay, there is one reason I did not give this film a one star. If a young teeny bopper adolescent girl crazed over Claire Danes can learn a lesson about flying off to an unknown place without understanding that country's laws, and stop thinking it's so cool to go away with her best gilfriend and live it up in another exotic locale...then all is not wasted.Otherwise...this movie was really sad. Not as entertaining as the commericals lead me to believe. The girls were too incredibly naive and arrogant while in another country. Depressing stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely movie.","review":"This story is one of the most poignant ever released. It is not the usual predictable fodder that comes from film. Amazing performances are given by all the actors, particularly Claire Danes. Her work honestly deserves an oscar...esp. if Julia Roberts can get one. This movie is about the torturous possibility of betrayal by a friend...and the fearful possibility of having your young and innocent life taken with no cause. It is quite the experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"rip-off of better film","review":"This film is a rip-off of \\"Return To Paradise\\" which is a much better film with a better ending.

There were a lot of logistic and factual errors. Many details were simply not explained or fully developed so the viewer is left wondering how, what, where, why . . . Maybe too much film ended up on the cutting room floor? The film lacks emotion and drama, the two characters are more upset that they are both attracted to the same boy than at the prospect of spending the rest of their lives in a Thai jail (which is more like summer camp than a prison for hardened criminals). Danes is believable but Beckinsale's performance is lackluster."},{"rating":"2","title":"I absolutely love this movie","review":"You must buy this movie. The acting is great as well as the plot too. Also, watching it, you realize it is possible that it could actually happen. And Claire Danes is beautiful as usual. She is so hot. Also buy the soundtrack. This movie is a very great movie and destined to be popular for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Claire Danes' finest performance...","review":"...I've seen this movie many, many times now and I enjoy watching the movie every single time, even knowing how the movie will end. The reason why, in my opinion, is because of the great performance of Claire Danes. She plays the role so convincingly well that at the end of the movie you actually buy into the choice her character makes, and that makes it believable, understandable and plausible. In the absence of such a performance, I don't think the ending would have worked so well. I've seen other movies she's done, and I don't think she's ever been better. If she doesn't do another movie or reprise another role, she should be proud of the work she does here. The movie would not have worked without her.

If I had to sit down and analyze this movie I would probably end up disliking it too, but for my Abe Lincoln and the trip to Blockbuster, this was a damn good two hours. You can't go wrong with Claire Danes, and having Bill Pullman in it was an added bonus. Yes, it did remind me of Return to Paradise, but I would have Claire Danes in my movie before Ann Heche any day of the week. In fact, scrub out Return to Paradise all together and make Vince Vaughn the Australian and you've got an even better movie! I'm rambling, but you get my point. I thought the ending, although sad, was unexpected, well done, and yes, believable. I don't know if I would be big enough to do that, but I believe there are people who are.

Having left ten years prior, everyone is in a tizzy over this, no one knew what happened to him. Especially Elle.

I have read a million romance novels where the characters spend a bunch of time denying their true feelings, but Noah did and said so many unlikeable things that I really hoped Elle would find someone else to appreciate her.

In comparison, Mils and Boon even has better context than this book.This book failed to capture realistic romance. Noah, a character in this novel adamantly denied his feelings for Elle who kept showing him she wanted to be a part of him. About 90% of the story was on how Elle tried to win Noah and the remaining 10%, Noah suddenly started acknowledging his feelings for Elle.

Now, after he's dead, I stumbled across this short book, describing some of his work in economics and economic history. The book follows the evolution of the Bretton Woods arrangements, aka. the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. It goes into some of the negotiations that led to the 44 national signatories agreeing in 1945.We see the original intent for the IMF and World Bank to serve different roles. Something that would change by the 1970s, as both converged to a commonality of duties.More interestingly, the book points out that Bretton Woods did not deliberately exclude the Soviets and their allies. It was an explicit internationalist outlook that sought to correct the flaws after World War 1. It was later, during the early Cold War, that the Soviets opted out of the arrangements.The book does not go into economic theory. No equations. Rather, it is very descriptive, like a traditional history text."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite the same, but still great.","review":"I purchased this watch to replace one given to me by my wife several years ago.

To put it simply, Its gorgeous. It doesn't look that sexy in the pictures but when you open it up from its nice yellow box with suede pillow and cleaning cloth, it just knocks your socks off. The only complaint I have about it is this: as mentioned in other reviews, the second hand does not stop directly over the dots on the side, but it consistently goes over by about its width, so not really a big deal.

After all, I'd been wanting to get Scott to write his knowledge in a book for years but he was always too busy.This is the book that gets you on the path to digital moviemaking, from the technical low-end to the high def high end and everything in between.It's not only loaded with technical advice but very practical information that dispels a lot of the hype about digital--what it can and cannot do.Scott has done all this and more and we are very grateful that we can provide this books to beginning and seasoned digital moviemakers.Go get 'em!Michael Wiese"},{"rating":"1","title":"dr.","review":"Although the book features the similar content to the large hardcover books, this book is difficult to read and poorly bound, falling apart within several days."},{"rating":"2","title":"They work, but tasty they are not.","review":"These really work, but they also make you feel like you're eating vicks vapor rub.

It's not a specialist's book, and is mostly free of evengalical cant. For better or worse, I wonder how much updating the good Winifred would need to reprise her text with were that a possibility. The commentary, from my experiences, might well have been penned during the recent decade, not the mid 1960s. Ted Strehlow provides the foreword commendation and he would have been among the very few, of that era, with the requisite articulation and insight to do Hilliard justice. He notes her well-chosen selections from the diaries of the early Auistralian explorers, and if, for no other reason, this book is a valuable read, as it sets the enduring context with rebounding, enduring resonance, for any text on indigenous Australians."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesnt Fit","review":"Product does not fit the new body style.

Michael KernI love this book. It is my all time favorite cranial text book. It is a strait forward introduction to Cranio-sacral work. It reads well, the concepts are in a logical way laid out and discussed. Kern is extremely knowledgeable about the subject. He has a unique gift in translating complex subject matters into easily understandable and digestible language. The illustrations are very clear. You get a sense of the scientific benefits of this form of therapy AND the beauty of it. If there ever was a cranial book that you could read beneficially before bed time, this is it. I recommend this book to all professionals who want to know more about this modality. It will help you decide if you want to study cranial work. It will also give you clear guidance to which of your clients would benefit from this form of therapy.

This album was recorded with them back in the 60s. It still sounds good today. The A side or first half of the CD has medleys that are terrific! The rest of the songs stand out on their own merit. Frankie's falsetto stands out on Sants Claus is Coming To Town and I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus. These songs are usually heard on the radio at Christmas time. Other songs featured include What Child is This, Carol of the Bells, The Christmas Song, Jungle Bells (a humorous take on Jingle Bells) and an original song, Christmas Tears.

Perhaps they work well for sweets and meatloaf, but they do not release yeast breads easily--in fact, my loaves are marred by the holes left from chunks of bread that stuck to the pan.And they are tedious to clean: They are harder to clean than any cast-iron or stainless steel pan. Baking seems actually to forge a new composite material from the metal and the dough. The folds and the corners are natural traps for debris and the worst parts to scrub, but even the flat parts cling to bread.These are expensive pans and require babying. They have not worked for me, despite my taking extraordinary care to protect their \\"non-stick\\" surface and making numerous trials of using different lubricants and oven settings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept but doesn't hold like it should","review":"I was looking forward to the ability to leave these on my lights and just attach to my either my light stand or truss. When they arrived quickly and in tact, I took one out right away and put it on the AMDJ light stand that was already up. I found that it would not clamp tight enough to hold the clamp on it's own and would spin. I broke out a section of my truss and the same thing (both 1.5\\") very dissappointed and then went back to read the poor reviews to find others have the same problem. I will be using the fixes suggested by another review with the washer for the wing nut and the duct tape for spacing but really? I believe that if it states 1.5\\", it should fit correclty and work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the real deal anymore","review":"I own a 14 of these clamps and the ones produced by \\"Leestar\\" are the real deal. If the clamp doesn't have the \\"Leestar\\" raised stamp with the nut symbol on the flat side where the T-fastener tightens your clamp will not tighten enough on your 1.5 truss. Your fixture will sag instantly. The new 1.5 clamps sold by Amazon no longer have this stamp and now they sag. I recently ordered four more and now have to return them as they are crap. Did American DJ go with a different manufacturer to cheap out? Not sure, but, these are worthless now and I'm not lining them with black duck tape to fix this issue. I'm going to call American DJ to see what's up with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baffled by good reviews...","review":"Guitar center was out of c clamps so I got two of these in a pinch. They are plastic. The clamping screw easily cuts it's way through it's own seat when trying to tighten these up enough to get your lights to hold position. On 1.5 inch DJ light stands they seem nice, they look nice, but they do not hold position. With the insert out, on 2 inch global truss, they do not hold position. If you just dangle your toys off the pole and let them point where ever they fall, these work great. If you like to arrange your lights, have control of where they point, and want them to stay there, skip these and get something made out of metal with real clamping force. If scratching up your truss pole bugs you, you may seriously want to consider another hobby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for V-Drum Racks","review":"I got this as an add on to my my newRoland TD-4KX2-S - Ultra Compact Pro V-Drum Kit Electronic Drum Kitso I could hang either my headphones or stick bag or 40 holder on it.

It has 2 plastic inserts that come out to adjust to 2\\" size. I don't think I have anything that these clamp to perfectly. Might be my fault, I don't know. They are decent enough after padding with a little bit of tape or paper. They are also small, which looks nice.I'm using these to attach par 64s to a light truss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy...","review":"I have owned 30 or so of these clamps. 2 to 3 years ago they worked just fine on an 1 1/2\\" pipe.

In the past I've used J hooks, L hooks and other similar hanging bracket devices all of which had the same problem, the unyeilding screw that eventually marred your black T bar or truss. Then I found the O Clamp! Yes, they've been on the market for a long time but it took me to actually see one in use to understand these were as good as sliced bread. So I ordered 6 to try. Then 10 more. Then 24 more. Now I have o rings out the kazoo, but I'm through with all those other clamps. Beware though: if you are using a T bar or hanging on a standard tubular 1.5 inch to 2 inch truss bar, you want the 1.5 O Clamp. The 1.0 clamps are made for the small skinny tubes you find supporting ceilings and such. And for around 5 bucks a piece, these are great buys. And a lot more secure than loose brackets."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the only books you will need","review":"This book must be on your shelf if you are interested x ray diffraction. got this book for a class but i kept it because it was so helpful"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great text","review":"Even if a little old, covers all the basics in an excellent manner.

In my opinion traditional Japanese music is much more impressive and intense when played on original Japanese instruments. The best example is \\"Sakura, sakura\\", one of the most famous Japanese songs. When it is played on Koto and Shakuhachi (Japanese flute) instead of transverse flute it has a different feel and much better quality of expression.The whole CD is like a softener for an audience which might not be used to a non western sound. At the same time it will get a wrong idea about what Japanese music is and will miss its real quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Japanese Music Album's I've found","review":"Beautiful selection of Japanese music.

When I finished it, I was so glad I didn't pay money to see it in a theatre. It is completely predictable(not nearly as good as Family Man). Now, I think a lot of Christian movies are cheesy but still enjoyable. Not this one, sorry. And also what constitutes a Christian movie? clean? moral? or a gospel message that is Biblical? This one passes on the first two but the Gospel message is lacking if not completely missing. Definitely a social gospel if anything. In my opinion, if the message of Christ is not present then don't call it Christian. Call it family-friendly. I'm still hopeful that someone will put out a decent Christian movie with a Gospel message that is quality and entertaining. Still waiting.
