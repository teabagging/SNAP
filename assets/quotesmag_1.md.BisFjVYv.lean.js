Put together almost immediately after Peake's premature death from Parkinson's Disease in 1968, it is a fragmented, nostalgic, sentimental, largely incoherent moan of distress by a weak, overly-dependent woman unable to see her lost husband as anything other than a Romantic demi-god or the world as anything other than a violent, malicious site of evil. I cannot quite see what Gilmore hoped to achieve by writing this memoir. Peake's talent needs no apology or explanation: even in his own lifetime the peculiar genius of his Gormenghast books was well-recognised. Nor does this account make any attempt at being a factually full biography. All it tells us is how much Gilmore loved her husband, and how unfairly she felt he was treated by fate and the world. I think that is of extremely limited interest. It is only Mervyn Peake, after all."},{"rating":"2","title":"B-movie for sure.","review":"This is one of my favorite b-horror erotic films. A good female cast, not great but I really appreciate that they are not full of implants. The male cast is awful, but you dont' have to put up with them through much of the film. Don't overpay for this, but it's a good film to see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"For starters Misty Mundae could not have saved this movie! It was doomed from the start. The hype i encountered prior to the purchase of the dud was the only thing that prompted me to pursue the purchase. The music did well to sidetrack the viewer on the slow motion of the dialog. I know American producers take great pride in hiding and faking the sex in their sex flicks but they could learn a lot from the European counterparts."},{"rating":"1","title":"tacky at best","review":"My husband and I have never been into anything like this before and were interested in checking it out. We looked around and saw this. The cover was a little shady, and the description seemed a little interesting but once we watched it we were very disapointed. The acting was cheesy at best. It was like an adult Hocus Pocus with Bette Middler. They were trying to kill people to stay young like that movie where they suck the life out of children to stay young. Totally not worth the three bucks I spent on it. I'll keep looking for something of interest. Bad acting... just aweful.

Because it is a foreign film, some are probably turned off by the language difference, but if you can get beyond that (which isn't hard to do at all) you will be rewarded with a great film, made by a great storyteller. A fabulous combination of horror and melodrama, with incredible acting by everyone involved - it is a pleasure to watch such a fine story unfold, a rich and rewarding experience for any film buff, or lover of ghost tales. Guillermo Del Toro has crafted an incredibly original take on a ghost story, that is unique and original, told with a great visual style and with great visual confidence. Please, do yourself a favor and find a way to watch this movie......buy it, rent it, borrow it...you will be happy you did. This is great storytelling.....isn't that what it's all about?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A movie with backbone","review":"Moody, atmospheric, like reading a literary novel. Will reward those who watch it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Soul in Limbo","review":"\\"What is a ghost?\\" This powerful but frightening film challenges the audience to figure out who we should be more afraid of- the dead or the living? Using strong imagery and complex characters, Guillermo del Toro, explores the state of limbo- neither hell nor heaven- of Spanish orphans during the Spanish Civil War. The orphanage also has its own soul in limbo- a ghost-\\"the one who sighs\\"- looking for peace. The film's ending is both disturbing and an inevitable resolution."},{"rating":"2","title":"My kind of ghost story movie","review":"So much has already been written about the plot, etc. that I just want to give my thoughts on this movie.My Amazon friend Brian Nallick recommended this movie to me maybe six months ago (hey Amazon, what happened to the \\"Friends\\" section?). I finally got around to seeing it recently. This is a ghost story that sort of crawls along slowly, but gets better as it goes along. I would put this movie into the same mold as such movies as The Others (2001), The Sixth Sense (1999), and The Innocents (1961). My favorite type of horror movies are ghost stories and haunted house movies, so this one hit the spot. The movie is somewhat sad, but then again a lot of ghost stories are.Overall, a very good movie that I definitely recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"It will haunt you for a while","review":"What you are about to see is one of the best movies ever made!It was one of the first foreign movies(few years ago) I completely loved start to finish.Amazing story,very good acting and heartbreaking moments.Please watch it,you will never regret doing it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BAD BOY","review":"This movie is a mystery and kind of slow suspence to watch, Guillermo del toro has done much better after this one, thanks goodness for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"A mixture of horror , fantasy , war and melodrama ( you should taste it )","review":"Plays like a Roman Polanski / Dario Argento film. It contains a great story that was translated to the screen with a stunning visual style and a blessed -special- cast and crew. The editing is the star in this fresh and witty film. There are plenty of good scares that will satisfy horror fans.See it if you loved DUMBO(just kiddin,) or THE 6TH SENSE and THE OTHERS(and that is for sure)or whatever .The best Del Toro film yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, great movie..........","review":"\\"The Devil's Backbone\\" is excellent!I was alot like you at first, skeptical of this movie. It's often listed on different lists as superb, amazing, scary as hell!Well, I finally watched it and yes, for a matter of fact, it's all those things. Guillermo Del Toro is right up their with M. Night Shyamalan. Every movie he makes is a classic.This movie has amazing characters, a great storyline and a good ending. The best part about Del Toro's movies is that he lures you in with the spooky stuff and mild horror and then unleashes a super story and makes it all tie in beautifully!Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Common Themes","review":"For those of you waiting to see Pan's Labyrinth, this film serves as an excellent introduction to Mexican director Guillermo del Toro. There are a number of common themes including horror, youth, civil war, the supernatural, etc. Not particularly horrific, but suspenseful and entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bonus Features","review":"The movie is thoroughly engrossing, unpredictable, and worthwhile, as most of the reviews here attest. But the bonus features on this edition are worth the price of admission as well. Like Kevin Smith and a handful of other active directors, Guillermo del Toro makes an admirable effort to add value to his DVD releases with thoughtful extras for fans and film buffs. Excerpts from the director's notebook, storyboards, even the ubiquitous Making Of documentary all add more substance than the usual PR filler material. Of particular interest here is del Toro's commentary, which goes beyond the usual behind-the-scenes anecdotes to delve into the artistic and historical roots of the creative decisions he made in the film. From the history and conventions of the gothic romance to fine art and architectural influences, del Toro is like an unusually entertaining and articulate college professor with near-encyclopedic knowledge. The extras enhance an already excellent film viewing experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"how to hunt a mammoth","review":"The devil's backbone is a horror movie like you've never seen before - a good and intelligent one.. It really is not a horror movie, however, but a story which involves ghosts (or the past) and how they fuel our present actions and decisions.. It is a strange and memorable film from spain which will make you think as much as it scares you.. worth seeing.."},{"rating":"2","title":"A ghost story that doesn't skimp on the human drama","review":"During the Spanish Civil War, young Carlos (Fernando Tielve) is sent to a remote orphanage where a kindly but self-absorbed doctor (Federico Luppi) and a stern headmistress (Marisa Paredes) care for the orphaned sons of Communist partisans. There he encounters a complicated web of secrets, betrayals and ghosts. This is a very fine film by director Guillermo del Toro, who has since made some big Hollywood productions. The drama in \\"Devil's Backbone\\" is compelling and often pushes the more ghostly elements into the background. The setting is inspired. This film is never predictable and ultimately quite moving."},{"rating":"1","title":"a boring ''horror'' movie","review":"but nice to look at. if i went in expecting a well done period piece drama, i might not have went to see this. i wasnt scared, grossed out, intrigued or interested. i am in the minority as many like their ''horror'' movies dripping with low/non existant body counts and fabulous photography. this ''horror'' movie dragged on and on. while mindless gore is just as bad, there is such a thing as a happy middle.anyway, in case you need one, heres the synopsis as i remember it; back in 1900's theres a boys school or orphanage thats haunted. theres also bad guy/s in search of buried treasure and a ghost. not much action or frights. but if youre a dp in training......!"},{"rating":"1","title":"one cool looking ghost, but the rest was subpar","review":"Strangers wind up at a run down orphanage with a dark haunted past.The film is in Spanish with subtitles. It is extremely slow moving, but the ghost scenes made up for it, especially the first showing of the little boy. I like the name, but it seemed to have very little to do with the movie. That is, they do explain what the \\"devil's backbone\\" is (a malformation) but it just didn't seem to fit."},{"rating":"1","title":"missed opportunity","review":"A film set around a few spooky moments, but in the end unchallenging in its script or situation. The opening monologue that questions the nature of ghosts seems more of a trick to sound philiosphical than to really delve into the nature of ghosts--the Dedvil's Backbone holds a lot of promise in its preview, but carries very little of it out in its execution.

(Arthur's sister) says \\"Babies are Boring!\\" and also enjoys the nursery rhyme section where she can put her fingers through the holes to make the spiders' legs. The book aided in recognizing the letters of the alphabet by sight and as with most children - the flaps are a great way to keep them involved in the story.

Yet, Nasaw does not adequately weave his discussion of African-Americans into his narrative. Similarly, he does not discuss other ethnic groups such as Asian-Americans and Hispanics, among others to investigate their accessibility to public amusements. Nasaw also limits his account primarily to Chicago and New York, while trying to draw broad implications for the entire country.

Unfortunately the story was nearly impossible for me to focus on through all of the mis-punctuation, misuse of words, and failed attempts at lace. I think, that Josh Suchon, must have received, a royalty, from every, comma, used.Yes, the story was a good one. But that has little to do with the author, being as this was a biography. I like that he threw in personal tidbits, but they were drowning in a sea of Josh Suchon's attempts at using a thesaurus, and showing off his ability to look up sports stats. One of my favorite movie lines (paraphrased) is applicable here: Sometimes more isn't better; it's just more.Barry, I love you. Josh, stick to the papers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying to glorify and ego","review":"I felt the book was pretty laughable and contrived, making much more out of the issue that it warrented. There was no substantive discussion of the very dark side of Bonds at all. It's as if the author just plain ignored all of Barry's detrimental realities and tried to make the reader beleive that it's always someone else's fault when there is a problem. The book would almost be funny if the author didn't actually seem to beleive the drivel he wrote.

I learned a lot about Bonds, his respect for family and privacy and his feelings towards his teammates and fellow MLB players as well as his much-publicized, love-hate relationship with the media.If you're a fan of the game or a student of the baseball industry, this book should be a must-read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds okay...but it's design needs work","review":"While the sound quality coming out of the devise is okay...the devise its self (...).First, The battery cover on the back, is only held shut by a little plastic tab, easily broken with moderate use.Second, There is no USB support for this product.

It covers many important topics related to the mechanical engineering field. As such it is a pretty handy source of reference, and can be used to quicky refresh one's memory in a particular subject.The writing style of this book however, is very poor. It is boring, hard to follow and the examples provided are repetitive and do not explain a lot of things. I once voiced my complaint about the book to our professor, to which i got the following response. \\"Well, this book was written for the university level\\".

He loves getting on and off it. He really gets excited on it, banging away at all the buttons.

He played with the steering wheel part on the floor. IT kept him occupied for at least a half an hour or more. When he started to pull up, he then used the scooter part as a prop to start walking. He just reversed the wheels and used it as a push cart. Though not its intended use, he learned to walk with this toy. He would walk up and down the hall all day long! Now that he is an experienced walker, the steering wheel is attached to the scooter and he can sit on it and play with the dash. However, the wheels do not turn smoothly, and he does not use it as a ride on. He still pushes it around as a cart. When he has friends over, he will give them rides.

She enjoys climbing onto the seat and pushing buttons/turning the steering wheel. But we have to leave the noises OFF because there is no volume control and it is very loud.

On one hand, they are written from the point of view that you'll be playing competitively with anyone else willing to play. However, they are also arranged so that you have to play cooperatively to \\"defeat\\" Top Dollar and end the game. No where in the rules does it create a need to compete, though. After two hours of playing we finally called it a day and the game has gone back in the box.

Compared to my experience with the quick release mechanism of my Manfrotto 141RC tripod head, I found the QRA-635 very unobstrusive. The very slim QR plate when attached to the camera never gets in the way when I stuff my camera in my bag, so the plate remains on my camera 24/7. I like using it so much that I bought extra plates for my other cameras. The likewise slim design and light weight of the adapter itself makes it seem to be an integral part of my ballhead, that I usually forget it's just an adapter.

Then each module ends with a rubric for assessing your understanding, and pages of space to allow you to reflect on your enjoyment of classifying.

His radio show is excellent and these brief commentaries are a great synopsis of his daily teachings on the air. Dr. McGee died in 1989 but his insight into the scriptures live on.This particular commentary on the great book of 1 Peter is very well written. Dr. McGee's teachings on suffering that go with chapter 3 of 1 Peter are very well said. Dr. McGee helps enlighten us to the fact that all men will suffer, and knowing Christ does not necessarily end suffering. But knowing Christ surely does help us to put our troubles and suffering in perspective. When we know Christ we have hope and joy in the midst of whatever comes our way.Dr. McGee knew this and his teachings from this wonderful commentary are deep and meaningful for all of us. I highly reccommend his book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book ever! Trust me!","review":"Here is an intense mind blowing look at our times. Marc travels the world in search of the past glories of red light districts of famous cities. Some are intact and thriving, most are sanitized with Gulliani precision.

I'm definitely headed for Hunter's bar in West Hollywood,7511 Santa Monica Blvd. Leslie Jordan mentions Hunter's in his Pink Carpet book. Must be the coolest place on the planet. Lookin' forward to 20 inches of hot dogs to coat my throat. Also contained, a marvelously loving insight into modern day Russia(worthy of a film).

The songs are well-polished adult dance music, easily amenable to fans of the 'smooth jazz' format.What separates this piece from the 'muzak jazz' pack are the clean production of Paul Hardcastle (who also shines on keys), the lilting, almost Lisa Lisa-like voice of Helen Rogers, and the soulful sax playing of Gary Barnacle (Level 42, Phil Collins etc).Highlights on this collection are 'Northern Lights' and 'Really Miss Your Love.'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Seagal Movie","review":"Oh Yes , The Keeper is another great Steven Seagal action movie . Steven is gettin meaner and meaner . He rocks !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Enough Action","review":"The Keeper, starring Steven Seagal, plays an ex-cop named Rolland, who goes to Texas to protect his friend's daughter. I have been a huge fan of Seagal and like his movies, but I was looking for more action. Obviously a retread of Man on Fire, I found the movie boring at times. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a horrible movie, like Mercenary for Justice, but it definitely isn't my cup of tea. If one thing is good about this movie, it's that he does his own fight scenes, but these entertaining fight scenes are so far and between I can't recommend this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its a Keeper","review":"Seagal was visibly leaner and more his old self in this movie. The movie had multible layers to the plot and the characters where mulit-demensional. After filming Driven to Kill (which turned out great) and the media hype for his new TV series Lawman, it seems he is refreshed. He probably will never regain his fame from the '90s but his latest efforts have redeemed his clunkers (ie Against the Dark and a few others in the past ten years). I'm a loyal Seagal fan but I'm careful to buy his crap sometimes because thats usually what it is. I'm happy to see he's making better efforts to please his fans. Good job Mr Seagal and we want more of this kind of material!"},{"rating":"2","title":"He's not only getting older, he's getting better","review":"Lots of his direct-to-DVD flicks are hit and miss (I like 'em all), but this movie was better than most. Maybe he's working out, or losing some weight from his TV show, whatever the reason: Seagal is getting into better shape, and the quality of the D2D movies are better as well (I do not miss the crappy voiceover dubbing of some of his movies)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guilty Pleasures","review":"Really good Steven Seagal movie. I like them all. Maybe It's because I did some research into what the man has been about. His accomplishments as a human being 'blew me away' (ha ha). I like 'good' movies too. But sometimes it's nice to sit back and watch some good old fasioned macho alpha-male kick-ass fake violence. God knows, there's enough real violence in the world to run away from once in a while. And I pretty much know exactly what I'm getting and how it's going to end and who's gonna win! Bottom line - I don't know why I like him and I don't question it. I don't like all action stars or action movies, or action genres - zombie flicks and tons of blood don't do much for me. I don't review those movies 'cause I don't watch them. I don't understand why anyone would take the time to dis a Steven Seagal flick because they don't like him. If you don't like his stuff, why are you watching it? Duh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seagal's best yet","review":"This is, in my opinion, definitely Seagal's best direct to video movie ever, watching it I was unsure why it wasn't released in theaters. However, this movie has high quality everything, high quality acting, high quality production, high quality fight scenes, high quality Steven Seagal zingers. I was an angry young man when I first saw \\"Hard to Kill\\" when Seagal said \\"That's for my wife f*** you and die!\\" to the bad guy and then killed him. And he also faced off against the evil politician in that movie whose campaign slogan was \\"No new taxes, and you can take that to the bank!\\" to which Seagal replied \\"I'm gonna take you to the bank senator....to the blood bank!\\" This movie is up to par with such zingers, with my personal favorite being \\"Tell your b****s to drop their guns, or I'ma kill every mother ****ing one of you\\". Keep it up Seagal, we all can tell you've still got it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of a kind.","review":"I have been using these pumps for many years and on more than one occasion when the main power generator has broken down this battery operated pump has made the difference between coming back to the dock or finishing my fishing trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Overall Night Cream","review":"Being 50, I want to take extra good care of my skin and face. I'm a fan of Olay products and have been for many years. Unfortunately, the highly-rated Regenerist line gave me a headache due to whatever fragrance or chemicals used. (I'm not saying Regenerist isn't a great product, just that I couldn't use it.) Based on other reviews, I tried this one. Happily, it does not cause any sensitivity or irritation and I've been using it for over a month. A little goes a long way. This size will probably last you almost two months. It has a great consistency and leaves my skin feeling really soft and well-moisturized.

I have combination skin, my neck isn't usually oily but this product made me break out. I gave it two stars instead of one because it works great on my hands! Obviously it's expensive for a hand cream but I didn't have to throw it in the trash because it didn't work the way I was hoping.

Another thing that bothers me is all of the cliche lyrics (or variations of cliche lyrics). Finally, there are too many metaphors and similes in the lyrics...

John Cena actually made this album to make a good hip hop album, not for the money or as a publicity stunt. There isn't anything that stands out in this album aside from Freddie Foxx's producing but he's known for that. The lyrics are all right, Cena needs to work on his delivery, but he shows promise in some of his verses should he decide to make another album.

He listened to this cd once, said \\"BLEGH!! This blows, then he gave it to me. I listend to it as well. After the first four songs, I got up, I opened my cd player, took the disk, opened my window, and tossed it in my back yard where it remains as a chew toy for my dog.

The level of detail is astounding, as Suvorov recounts who was who in Soviet embassies, illegal operations, and KGB versus GRU warfare. A fascintaing read by anyone researching Cold War spying or trying to gain insight into today's undercover operations by friend and foe alike. As usual, Suvorov's sense of humor and irony shows through, relieving some of the tedium associated with big, thick books about fairly dry subjects. This book is neither thrilling nor action-packed, but is still deserving of a place on many shelves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting reading","review":"This book does a great job exploring the inside world of the GRU (Soviet Military Intelligence).

Plain and simple. Now, I'm a die-hard Marion Zimmer Bradley fan, so this is not an easy thing to say. Take my word for it -- this is a BAD BOOK.Why? The plot is inane. Basically, some evil scum developers come to the invented planet of Darkover with the intention of exploiting its people and antural resources. The aristocracy of the planet jumps into action, and the author seems to forget their previous indifference to the well-being of the peons.Why else? The characters are better described as caricatures -- always seen by the reader as stereotypes and extremes. The writing itself is confusing, unstructured, and full of grammatical errors. The book lacks originality, and reads like every other science fiction pulp ever written. Even if you love the Darkover series, skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another nonsensical thing","review":"Ditto what the previous reviewer said, I've got another thing that was wrong - the fact that in this book it was stated that all Comyn with laran were red haired and grey eyed when she previously described Dyan Ardais (who no one would doubt his telepathic power) as dark haired. Also, she made Danilo (among other things) red haired in this book, and in Heritage, he was dark haired. =] Just some additions to the previous reviewer's list!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very very good read","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the book. Once I started reading it, I could not put it down,.

Its hardly noticeable.Its low noise.The only problem I have is that if a print job fails, then the printer (fan) remains on until the problem is fixed. The red LED remains on. If there are no problems, the printer stays in sleep mode until the next print job. But if the print fails, then the printer and fan remain on until the failure is fixed. This has been a problem few times, when I forgot the the print job failed and the printer remained on all day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"It was super easy to hook up and begin using immediately. It does use a lot of power, as to the flickering lights in my bedroom when it's working, but that may be something in the wiring of the room, not the printer itself. The \\"scroll\\" issue is hardly worth mentioning, considering it will flatten out if laid flat when still warm. No biggie. The printing is fast and pristine and loading paper is simple. I'll never go back to inkjet again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent laser printer for the price.","review":"So far this printer is pretty decent. We are running it off a central server on a network and it has become a pretty reliable printing source. It is really fast compared to your average inkjet.

I have not had the problem with paper curling like some other reviewers have reported.I installed one for a client who needed to print from Macs and PCs on his home network. It's working well for him there. I have another client who bought one themselves and use it a lot, who informed me that it's working well.I highly recommend the HL-2070N, especially if you need to print from non-Windows computers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Limited Use Home Printer","review":"I use my printer rarely so I am not experiencing the problems others have mentioned.

The printer gets the first page out fast and has been very reliable so far. I bought it mostly for its network feature and to avoid the typical hassles with inkjets (costly ink, deteriorating quality over time) and have not been disappointed. Linux, Windows, MacOS all work fine. The web interface that comes with the printer is also very informative - lets you know when it's time to replace the drum, how many pages you printed, etc. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"works fine","review":"easy to set up... prints well... the only drawback is that you have to buy a USB cable to connect the printer to the computer b/c it does not come with it when you buy this... other than that it works great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price","review":"I have had the printer for about 6 months and have had no problems so far.

Both are minior flaws that are easy to fix. For the price this can't be beat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for our law office","review":"This little printer is the sole printer in my law office. We use it for our normal printing and have a scanner that puts out to it in place of having a copier. We use it to print our envelopes, too. We have had good luck with it, we refill each toner cartridge one time, which is easy to do by the way, so it's quite economical. After refilling more than once sometimes the carts begin to leak the toner. It's fast enough for a small office. The print quality is very good and it is used it to print wills, court documents, and our business cards: we use only high quality papers (at least $12 a ream) by the way.I like the fact that there are no plastic flaps or doors that must be left open.On our unit when printing through the front tray, the paper or envelope must be pushed in there firmly, otherwise the unit won't grab it. I see no reason to spend a penny more on single sided printing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great printer for the money!","review":"I opted for a monochrome printer so that I could get something better quality for my money than I could have if I'd gone for color. I love this printer! It's very fast and neat. The curve issue is nonsense.

It fits into my setup very neatly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother. This printer is fragile.","review":"I made the unfortunate mistake of buying two of these printers. Each lasted about year, just long enough to be out of warranty. Then, one failed (with the paper light constantly on) after we replaced the toner cartridge. After following all the possible solutions from Brother for that problem, we bought a new drum unit, the part that holds the toner cartridge. That cost $85 and didn't fix the problem. Then the second printer failed in the same way. I've had other laser printers (HP and NEC) that lasted for years and years. I'll never buy another Brother."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOULDNT BUY AGAIN","review":"My printer is only 7 months old and gets moderate use.

Highly recommended, especially for the price. The paper curling mentioned is no big deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid printer, curly pages","review":"Compared to many inkjets I have used, this printer not only prints quickly, it starts printing the pages out within 10 seconds. The only beef I have with it is the pages come out with a healthy curl, almost as though each one gets rolled up first. This is a little annoying, but the printer is otherwise a great machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brother HL-2070N Network Monochrome Laser Printer","review":"This printer proved to be very easy to set up and install. It is compact, prints quickly, and generally performs very well. It's a bit louder than our higher capacity HL 5250DN. However, the Brother line of printers has been very dependable in our small office environment. For the price, the HL-2070N is a great deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great printer!!!","review":"I have a HP Photosmart 2710 wireless printer and it has been a world of problems -- especially the insane software that severly slows Windows systems. So, I was skeptical. But WOW! This printer was a breeze to set up and works very well. It slipped into my network without issue -- it almost seemed too easy. I would give it 5 stars, but it does cause your paper to curl. So, it is a good printer for most uses, but I wouldn't use it for business purposes where presentation is an issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great budget laser printer","review":"I purchased this laser printer because I needed something with a smaller footprint and light since I am using this in a portable fashion taking it from job site to job site. I also wanted something faster then an inkjet. The printer met my requirements and then some. For speed, it really is fast. Warm-up time is just a few seconds and it starts cranking out paper. The advertised pages-per-minute are true to their word. The by-pass feed is very easy to work with no extra steps required other then sticking the paper in the slot. It apparently can be used in a network setting, but I have not tried that but it looks easy enough to set-up with the included software that takes you through step-by-step. If you want an inexpensive laser printer that is still very fast by almost any standard and doesn't take up much space, this one will work for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent printer but Amazon is a deaf company","review":"Printer OK. Do NOT order the TN 460 cartridge STILL listed as an accessory above. It does NOT fit the machine and then you will hassle with Amazon and they will charge you a return fee AND return shipping.

My final e-mail to Amazon follows:I did not \\"accidentally order the wrong item.\\" Your site STILL lists TN460 cartridge as a recommended accessory for the Brother 2070N laseer printer but it does NOT work! All I did was follow your suggestion. This is idiotic to penalize me for your mistake that is STILL on the site. How many other good customers have you ticked off with this dumb mistake?StevePS I love Amazon. Look at how much money I have spent with you over the last year or two.

I've printed off more than 1,000 pages and I have had to problems at all. I'll be buying a new toner cartridge in about 1,500 pages so I'll have a backup. It is a bit noisy, for an office it would be fine, but for printing off homework in the middle of the night in your parent's room, you would get yelled at. Shut the door to your room, and no one will care about the noise (except you). Also, it looks cool for a printer. I use the network feature and it works superbly, very easy setup with XP/Vista."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent bang for buck!","review":"I got tired of my ink jet cartridges drying up and becoming unusable, so I decided to go the laser printer route.

The printer shows up as a \\"bonjour\\" device (formerly rendezvous).

Noisy, curls paper etc.","review":"I do not recommend this printer!Wasn't thrilled with it at first because it was a noisy. I can't use it for printing envelopes because it they come out sealed and if the envelope has a plastic window, the plastic is warped. I tried printing some invitations which was a heavier paper and they came out VERY curled. I've read elsewhere that the problem of sealed envelopes and curled paper is because the printer uses too much heat.The worst part is that after only 6 months I started having trouble with constant paper jams! I've heard other users with similar problems on other boards.I'm fed up with this printer and am going to buy a new one. This one was a waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This one has a serious flaw","review":"I've been using these inexpensive Brother laser printers for about 15 years, this being my third one. They are basically bullet proof - cranking out good quality black and white printouts year after year. Brother has been tweaking the design, making each permutation a bit more reliable and substantially faster. Why they had to screw this one up is beyond me. The prior models had an adequate if slightly cumbersome envelope feeder. The 2070N envelope feeder is inadequate, too often allowing the envelope to turn and print at an unsightly if not unusable angle. I've had to throw away half my envelope printouts. If you don't want to print envelopes, this is an okay printer, otherwise, forget it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Connects, prints and sleeps","review":"Hook this up the network and print. Just works.

For me, one of the gifts of the film was the opportunity to see this wonderful actor playing a character so entirely different that it took some effort to recognize him. His performance and preparation for the role of a down-and-out, small-time standup comic is revelatory.

I call the swing my baby sitter, it is fantastic. The seat is really cozy and my son loves the mirror. My main complaints are that the music and vibration turn off and it is too short. My son is not that tall and his little feet hit the bar at the bottom. The aquatic seat is longer and will run continuously. That said, I still use the seat I just won't be able to use it for as long as I would have liked."},{"rating":"1","title":"cozy, boring, BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU WASH THE COVER","review":"I agree with many of the reviews that the seat is cozy and plush for a newborn. We registered for it because it doesn't look garish in our small condo, and because it looks so comfy for a newborn. My daughter was never really soothed by the vibration/music feature, but it's a good place to put her when I need to take a shower or prepare her bath. However, when we washed the cover, the padding MELTED in the dryer. There is no warning about this anywhere--only a weak mention of drying on low heat--and Fisher Price should be a little more explicit about the potential for this problem. Given the price for it and the short term use of it, I was hoping to pass it onto one of my several friends who are expecting, but now it's not in any shape to share."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great chair if you don't mind turning it back on every 15 minutes for the vibration","review":"I love this chair. Not only is it comfy & cozy for a newborn but to finally have something pink for a girl is great.

It also EATS batteries, I have had it for 5 weeks and have replaced the 4-C batteries 3 times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Seat!","review":"I got this seat with a giftcard that I received for my baby shower. My daughter loves it! It is great if she is having a hard time sleeping...just turn the music and vibrations on and she is good to go.

Compact enough to take everywhere!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it.. Prefer the older one with the \\"toy\\"","review":"I love this bouncer. It really doesn't bounce though.

Now I put the baby papasan in his pack n play next to our bed and he sleeps for 3-4 hour streches at a time. I guess he likes the way it cradles him. And it gives great support to floppy newborns. We have a normal bouncy seat and he was constantly slouching down in it.It's also very light and portable. I carried my son downstairs in one arm and the seat in the other.The only drawback of it is that it seems like he's going to outgrow it to soon. I already have the straps that hold him in loosened almost all the way, so there's not much room for growth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great chair for newborns!","review":"My daughter is just over 2 weeks old and already we've gotten our money's worth out of this chair. We keep it in the living room so she can be with us during daytime naps--it is super soft and comfortable, she likes the music and vibration options and the little blanket it comes with is super warm. This is a great alternative to a big bulky bassinet since this item fits in small spaces and folds up easily for storage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Not Worth the Cost...","review":"This was not a very wise purchase on my part. I wish I'd done a little more research when looking for a bouncer (why this even comes up in a search for bouncers is beyond me...it doesn't bounce!). My son only used this a handful of times. The vibrating made him instantly upset, and while it's a nice feature that the music shuts off on it's own, there should be a setting to make it stay on for longer if you so choose. There was NO bouncing with this chair, so he just kind of sat there...bored. I used it more as a place to set him while I did a quick chore or two around the house. In the end I think this chair is WAY overpriced for what it is...basically a stationary seat with some very soft cushions and a little vibration and music. I say pass...you can find better for cheaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring for my child","review":"I must say that every child is different so I am jufdging this product according to what I could experience with my newborn daughter. I chose this item thinking it was a bouncer but IT IS NOT. It doesn't bounce it vibrates which is different. Some babies love the vibrating sensation but my daughter did not. I tried a friends bouncer and she slept beautifully there. Unfortunately, you have to try it before you get it, and I say unfortunatelly because how are you going to try something unless you buy it or borrow it from someone."},{"rating":"2","title":"very happy","review":"The only problem I have is that my 13 pound baby is pretty much outgown this already.

The biggest complaint I have is that it doesn't bounce at all. Which if I had read the description of the product better I would have noticed that. My child is two months now and I don't see him being able to fit in this two months from now. The leaf with the mirror hasn't been noticed by my baby. On the upside, he is pretty snug in the seat and it folds up nicely. I propbably wouldn't have bought this if I had it to do over again. I'd have looked for something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get a different one...","review":"My daughter never really liked this seat, the vibrations, music, etc. I'd recommend getting one that actually bounces! And/or comes with a toy bar for something to look at/play with. This seat is just a comfy place to put a newborn! You could create this with a few blankets--don't waste the money. Plus, our boxer thought it would be a good place to sleep once and I could NEVER get the dog hair out of the fleece...even after several washings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money for me!","review":"It is only my opinion, but this seat was to expensive and my baby does not like it at all. I bought this for a means of having a place to put my baby to get some moments of free time, I know no baby is alike but mine will NOT sit in this for more than a minute, it really does nothing you can barely feel it move and the music only got his attention the very first time he sat in it. the mirror and rabbitt dont do anything for him, I wish I had saved the money and bought the swing in this collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love, LOVE this!!","review":"I don't know what I would have done without this! My son wouldn't sleep anywhere else except for this chair the first few months of his life. He LOVES the vibrating. I also like that you can choose music and vibrating or just one or the other. It also shuts off automatically after a while, which is great.He's almost 4 months old and he still loves it. I dread parting with it once he outgrows it.The only downer... he has a chubby belly and the belt that holds him in is getting tight. I wish it were longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"I love our papasan. My daughter sometimes prefers to sleep in it rather than anything else. The vibration is a life saver because our daughter likes constant movement. It shuts off by itself every 15 minutes, which is great because I often forget to turn it off.I purchased our papasan from amazon (this page). I really liked the blanket that is shown in the customer photos, but the blanket does not come with this model. I was kind of disappointed to find that out, but we love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comfy and cozy but not for the fussy baby","review":"While this seat looks and feels incredibly comfortable, and plays a soothing little lullaby, my son doesn't like it. He's kind of a restless baby in general, and the vibration alone just doesn't cut it - he prefers a bouncy seat or swing with bigger motions."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have!","review":"I have three children and wish I would have had this with all of them. I had a very fussy new born this time and if it weren't for this amazing bouncer I would have never showered. They way it cradled her with it's soft materials enabled her to feel comfortable and secure enough to sleep which for me was incredible. It's a must have for sure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Short term use for the price","review":"I was fortunate enough to borrow this item from a friend. I rated it four stars because it is great for a tiny baby to rest in and goes good with any decor.

THE ONE I LIKE IS FISHER PRICE."},{"rating":"1","title":"$50 childs toy","review":"I wanted this papsan to match the cradle swing...I ended up getting both, my daughter liked the papsan until she was about 2 weeks old...never liked the vibrations or the music...but, once she got a taste of the swing, the papsan sat in the closet. I'm planning on letting her use it for her baby dolls when she is older. Not worth $50."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste Of Money","review":"My son hates this bouncer seat. I thought it looked like it would be comfortable for a newborn. It wasn't. My son is now 8 months old. He never enjoyed this chair at any age. I ended up borrowing a seat that actually bounces not just vibrates from my sister. He loved that chair. I also own the baby papasan swing. I highly reccomend the swing. But don't waste your money on this bouncer."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Swing does not Swing","review":"This swing does not swing, it hardly moves when turned on.

It's soft and the vibrations and music are wonderful. It would have been perfect if it was a bouncer too but still a wonderful seat to lay your baby in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice place for baby to sleep","review":"I registered for the baby papasan bouncer before they updated it and I was upset because they had discontinued it and I had to take it off of my registry. Then while shopping at babies r us I found the new seat and my son loves it. He can sleep in it for hours! The leaf that is above the seat has a mirror for him to look at and a removable rabbit that is cute. I am glad that we have this one and not the older style. We also have the fisher price aquarium bouncer and find that our son will fall asleep in the papasan but seems more entertained in the aquarium seat. He is only 6 weeks old and I think that we will end up getting more use out of the aquarium bouncer as he gets older. Overall I think this is a great seat and would recommend it to anyone with a newborn."},{"rating":"2","title":"More practical than a bouncy chair","review":"We bought this item for our son, who had acid reflux as an infant. We found the angle to be ideal in that it allowed him to look around and interact but also to fall asleep in a position that kept the reflux from disrupting his sleep (and he did often nap in it). Furthermore, we were able to actively use this seat until he was older than 1 year, which is a better lifespan than most bouncy seats will give you. Now that it's been retired from active service, we appreciate that it folds up and is a pretty small item in the back of his closet. So, all in all, a good investment.On the con side, I agree with the other reviewers in that it was mildly inconvenient at times to have the auto shut-off feature (though we used this so long that by the end, our son would turn it on again by himself). And like a lot of baby items, the music got a little old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Papasan Infant Seat (Original model)","review":"I fell in love with how comfy this seat looked, registered for it and got it at my shower. My daughter hated it. She had to be asleep before even being put in it. There is no motion other than the vibration so after about 1 month old she didn't want to be in it! We have the Papasan swing which is the best gift we received! It plays music that is beautiful and has a mirror with birds that spin around it, she will lay in the swing and stare and then fall asleep when tired. The papasan seat doesn't do enough! I would recommend getting a bouncer that actually bounces and has something to look at!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for all from the World War II generation.","review":"As one who lost my father in WWII, this was a difficult book to read because it triggered a flood of emotions that had been suppressed for many years.

Many of the tracks, especially the second half of the album, are little more than programmed synth' beat with overdone bass. I found many of the tracks too monotonous even for background music, though did enjoy the rework of Steve Nicks', Dreams.

A very intense, super-charged atmosphere!Recounts four months in the life of a married mother after her husband leaves her abruptly for the love of a 20-year-old girl. The severe depression ensuing from her husband's betrayal and abandonment hits rock bottom. She is left to fend by herself, to take care of two kids and a dog. As in similar cases of acute depression, she becomes, sleepy, lethargic, disoriented, clumsy and neglectful of her self and her kids. She is transformed into the nemesis of her true self: angry, vulgar, ugly, dirty and, in a failed attempt at getting back at her husband, almost prostitutes herself with a stranger.This is a roller-coaster of emotions, anger, childhood memories and soul searching episodes the reader feels suffocated and in desperate need of a breather. The characterization is superb and real, the protagonists are almost tangible.Take a deep breath and plunge in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Itatlian writer","review":"Saw a review in another Magazine, highly recommended. haven't had a chance to read it yet, but the small amount I did look at, I can't wait to begin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough going","review":"Ferrante's depiction of what it is like for a young Italian woman with young children to be abandoned is so unstintingly honest that it is hard to believe that there could not be an autobiographical element to the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling Read","review":"Very basic and honest description of what it's like to be deserted by husband.

Dibell's main contribution is his ideas on cause and effect, but they are neither plentiful nor profound but only merely pertinent to an idea of plot which is the central topic for discussion.Dibell's writing is pedestrian and the examples he provides are either too general or technically too broad to be of use for specific, technical problems concerning plot or plot structure.This is a book that promises much but which doesn't deliver on its promises except for the mere basic threads without which one could not write a book on plot at all.There is a very good reason why mine is the only review on this book since it first came out 24 years ago.

The Wiggles are usually up front dancing and singing to pre-recorded tracks, occasionally adding live guitar, keyboard, or drums. The only time the whole band plays live onstage is during Dorothy's ballet solo (with Sam on trumpet and Murray on bass guitar).I wondered if the lack of variety in settings or the interspersed distant shots would lose our toddler's interest, but she doesn't seem to mind at all.Overall, an engaging, well-produced recent live show."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very clear, very \\"reader friendly\\", step-by-step guide.","review":"There are numerous books on business plans on the market, but Linda Pinson and Jerry Jinnett's Anatomy Of A Business Plan is one of the clearest: it provides a step-by-step guide to writing the plan and building the business, and appears here in its 4th edition to provide all the details in building - and changing - a business plan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute [..]","review":"Undoubtedly, the worst cd of any kind (one positively cannot call it music) that I have ever purchased.

One song was played at the discotheque, one mediocre disco ditty. Unfortunately, some genius decided that the rest of the cd needed more of the same garbage. This recording takes redundancy to new levels of ad nauseam. All the audio on this cd is horrible, it is truly that bad.So, if you are interested in expanding your musical horizons and are looking for something unique, erotic, sensual, or sexual, search items such as; Erotic Rhythms From Earth--Govinda, Suck It and See--Various Artists, MCMXC A.

He develops the characters well and puts forth a decent plot. However, Rosen's personal oddities drag the book down. Rosen is absolutely obsessed with bodily functions and he repeatedly goes into way too much detail about farting, urination, defacation, etc. At times, the book reads like an immature third grader's delight.

The author includes a lot of good basic information about choosing and using the slow-cooker which I found very helpful. The recipes are of varying degress of difficulty so you can pick and choose based on how much prep time you have available. A wide variety of ingredients and combinations are used which avoids the old crock pot problem of everything tastng essentially the same. In fact, something magical happens to the flavors Carpender has combined: one recipe that I thought sounded terrible was the pork and rutabaga recipe. It is so amazing that I make it almost every week.

The taste just wasn't there in these recipes. The descriptions on how good they were was way off in my opinion.

It had a good level of suspense, and made it hard to tell who did it, because everyone seemed to hate the victim(except his parents)! Mark Twain wishes in vain that this trip will not leave him with a murder to solve. Told from the view of his traveling secretary, Wentworth Cabot, Twain's trip to England to see his family seems far from monotonous even before the murder.

As for the sound quality and subtitle issues some people are complaining about, I didn't think it was that big of a deal. If ya can't hear it, turn up the volume! There are only a few phrases of dialog subtitled. How hard is it to read for 5 seconds? Antiques? Too damn expensive! Ultra Man 3 disc set? PRICELESS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show, some minor technical glitches","review":"I'm not saying anything new, but the dubbed version will drop to the Japanese version on occasion, usually at the beginning or end of an episode. I prefer the Japanese version, but I enjoy the subtitled version as well, the voice-over actors doing a superb job-it's like getting twice the content. There are inconsistancy problems with the printed titles and the on-screen titles, but they don't cause any real confusion. I found the quality to be very good over all. Another point is that there were no collectable cards included, no big deal for me, but if you're a card freak and that is why you are buying this-be forewarned. If you have any interest in Ultraman you need this set, technically it's not crafted perfectly, but to see these again after almost 40 years is a real treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"So much fun, but...","review":"...the audio tracks are inconsistent.

The shows were edited and then dubbed. Because of this, there are several minutes in each episode that were NEVER dubbed into English.When this DVD was put together the company took the only existing dub, and placed it over the video, however there are parts of the episode that dubs dont' exist for, so they decided to leave those parts in Japanese with subtitles. It's not a mistake on the DVD, it's really the only way it could have been done, without having a whole new dub created."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE BOTTOM LINE","review":"The Bottom Line is...This is worse than the Sandy Frank versions of the Gamera movies thatplayed on Mystery Science Theatre 3000.

The movement should be smooth.This is truly a first. Perhaps BCI should be given a special trophy for being the first at something.Incidently, I do not want to watch this in Japanese, because that is not the way I grew up with this show. Its the same reason I do not watch Lost In Space in french, or Speed Racer in Yiddish. I know Ultraman comes from Japan, but I do not speak Japanese.My god. THE END IS NEAR. It must be a sign.

They are well made with the exception of some of the shows going from being dubbed to Japanese and also Japanese to Japanese with sub-titles. It is a minor annoyance and something that is acceptable to me, but maybe not others.All-in-All I think its a great bargain for the price of reliving one's youth."},{"rating":"1","title":"i like Ultraman very much, but the quality of this set is just BAD!","review":"on a crappy TV, you might not be able to notice the horrible video quality of this set. but on a new world TV it looks really bad. i dont know why that is, but it's true. i've returned 5 copies to my local shop and each one had the same issues: tons of pixelation and squiggly lines when ever there is the least bit of motion on the screen. this has nothing to do with the original video given to the company by the license holder (well, that's another story) but this problem is only because of extremely poor encoding by the manufacturer. this BCI company has a track record of releasing really horrible quality releases, and this is no exception, unfortunately. i give Ultraman 5 stars, but BCI zero stars for such a poor quality effort. i'm hoping BCI doesn't make the same mistakes with the next sets. otherwise it will crush them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Bad DVD I'm really angry about this. Who do I blame?","review":"Couldn't wait to see this show again. Popped in the disc and discoverd its half in Japanese. Not the excelent dubbing I remember. (To those not familiar with the series{ Ultraman is a japanese program dubbed into english. The dubbing was, perhaps, the best dubbing ever done on an imported Japanese film.) When this DVD does have parts in english, the sound is very out of synch with the movie. Also, the sound IS very very bad. And I agree that I cannot hear a word that Peter Fernandes and company are saying. So even the extras are bad. The U.S. version opening credits were lifted from episode four of the Expresions In Animation VHS that came out in 1996. It also sounds awfulI, but on the original tape it sounded great. I have never purchased a video, imported or otherwise, as bad as this one. Never.Who do I blame?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank God!","review":"I own the bootleg DVDs of the original Ultraman series, and it's one heck of a show(and I'm only 14!). Sadly, the set does not have a menu, extras, or good audio. So, when I heard that the series is coming out on OFFICIAL DVD, I was so psyched. I saved up money so I will have enough for this set($39.99) and the other volume that comes out in October. This volume will have the first twenty episodes on three discs, which features some of the most famous aliens and monsters in TV history, such as Baltan Sejin, Red King, Pigmon, Zarab Sejin(the very first Fake Ultraman), and Antlar.I'm so ready for this DVD set!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bulls***","review":"This is only the first two disks of the show, and the packaging is garbage.

So I bought it.It's awesome. The dub isn't perfect, but when you're watching Ultraman fight the monsters, it doesn't matter. I feel like i'm 5 years old again and watching my son's reaction to each episodes was worth the money.IF you loved Ultraman as a kid and have a chance to watch it with your own kids, you'll love it even more, because it will remind you why you liked it all those years ago and will make you realize that monsters, never get out of style...A must have for the Ultraman fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game (why is this listed under books?)","review":"Basically a video game masquerading as a board game.

Maybe you'll find a better weapon like a shotgun or missile, maybe a med pack to heal those nasty wounds, or maybe a special card to turn a miss into a hit.Score 3 frags and win the game, good design, learnable in about 10 seconds, excellent compromise game when you can't decide on what to play, only weakness is why not make the counters punchable instead of making us cut them out?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lip Plumping pencil","review":"Was not very happy with this product.

The demise of coalesce was a loss, but the gain of Reggie and the Full Effect was well worth it. This is the side project of James Deweez, former coalesce drummer and current keyboardist for the Get Up Kids, and he proves his talent extends far beyond those bands.

Information on the majority of subjects covered, is readily available in either the phone book, dial-up directory, or by doing a simple internet search. It appears the author is trying to turn a subject worthy of a pamphlet into a novel. With each turn of the page I felt more the chump for having purchased this book. I am left to believe, the appendices must have been included for the benefit of the simple minded - so \\"elementary my dear, Watson\\" they are almost an insult.

Melitta pods are another fit, but they're very proud ($$$$) of their product.At this writing my husband has taken it apart, glued the plastic cover hinge that broke, and if it doesn't work - we don't have much hope - it will go in the trash.

However, what far too many people do not understand is that this book should only be read by those in advanced stages of spiritual development AND ONLY under the guidance of a spiritual father. Also, without sounding condescending or arrogant, this should only be read by Orthodox christians who are well versed in Orthodox theology. This book should be generally be reserved only for those in study to enter the Orthodox priesthood, and even many seminarians find this book difficult to fully grasp. Delving into this without being fully prepared and under spiritual guidance from a priest could be quite literally dangerous to one's spiritual well-being. It is very easy for one to become misguided by this book if he or she does not follow my advice.

The glossary at the back of this book helps a lot, and contains explanations of many very important Orthodox beliefs and terms. The only complaint I have is that I wish the translators and editors would have included St. Nikodimos' comments on the various writings he compiled within this English edition.

So far from her references utilized in this book she has made six hat/caps and is now working on her seventh; she has also started a pullover from the pattern and information in the book. And this is all since Christmas. So for those of you with a true artistic bent and a love of babies and knitting and an old-fashioned sentiment - this is the book for you.

Great plot idea, but it turned into a predictable tale in the last third. It seemed as if Higgins had lots of extra characters he wanted to include, so he dumped them in the last few chapters with no time to develop them. His portrayal of women as beautiful, strong willed, but totally helpless is stereotypical and disappointing. Don't spend the money on this one - borrow it from the library, and keep you expectations very low. You may be pleasantly surprised."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of $$","review":"This book was so weak - no character development, horrible dialogue, and poorly conceived plot development.

It doesn't seem like he spent much time writing the story. It is a quick read with plenty of action, if that's all you want. Thin on substance in several areas. Important ones. For instance, you want to savor the villain getting his just reward after all the build-up. Instead, it's, \\"Boom. Gone. Next?\\" As always, his yarn has good elements. A president with character and grit, who goes beyond the \\"politically correct\\". (Aren't we sick of what's \\"politically correct\\"?) Higgins has a lot of novels out there. So, you'll get the odd sub-standard one. If you're new to Jack Higgins stuff, read \\"The Eagle Has Landed\\" and go from there. It's a benchmark story and why we stick with him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppy, silly, juvenile. H. was just going thru the motions.","review":"Hard to believe Jack Higgins wrote this book. Plot thin, character development all but nil (and implausible where it does happen), story lines started and stopped. And the dialogue! So banal. Lots of cliches (Higgins was on a tight deadline?). And there was one character whose presence - and actions - made no sense whatsoever. More research wouldn't have hurt, either. Doesn't come close to what Higgins can do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fluffy & linear","review":"Not for anyone who likes a lot of \\"meat\\" to their thrillers.

I am surpirsed that I finished it at all. It had no depth, no realism, no character development, it was a total waste of time. Sean Dillon is a poor hero, a total imitation of James Bond to the point that he introduces himself as \\"Dillon-Sean Dillon\\"!!!!! Give me a break. And the action was so melodramitic that I was ready to laugh. At least it was only 278 pages. It was a quick death. This book could have been stretched out mercilessly over 600 pages, and that would have been a total disaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jack does it again with his fast paced increadible book!!","review":"Jack Higgins how can you say anymore then he is the man.

I usually finish them in a night.This one is 0 for 3 of the above. Not to reveal the plot, but I found the whole story quite implausible.

If you feel like reading one of his newer works, try Flight of Eagles, which is plotted better and has a more interesting premise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing - did Higgins really write this lightweight?","review":"From about chapter two, the style was so childish, that I almost put it down, but it's a good yarn. I finished it in two days, which is quick, since there was no challenge to the read, nothing technical to worry about (except what organisation is the 'KBG' found early on). It felt like a beginner had written it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I like Higgins, but...","review":"This book is one of the worst books I have read in some time. Dylan is always a delight, but the writing was trite, dull and, for the most part, lifeless.

I'll be hesitant about reading another by the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's the same old story","review":"Jack higgins seems to have fallen into a rut. Of the last four or five novels he has written, has there been anything that is surprising? With The President's Daughter, once again, after reading the first 100 pages you know the story and how it will end. Sean Dillon and Brigadier Ferguson are smarter and have more resources than the bad guys and the conclusion is predictable. It is a quick and exciting read to get to the point of the story, but after that there is nothing compelling. Every character that is introduced is the best at what they do and can supply any information or material that is needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dropping A Tired Formula Revitalized The Series","review":"Sean Dillon's 'ironic smile' has been wearing thin since he exploded on to the literary schene in On Dangerous Ground. The happy hitman, himself, seemed to be growing bored with the replay of a tiring formula.Jack Higgins took a detour in The President's Daughter which became his most enjoyable journey in years. There were more subplots than body counts, more character building than action scenes, and more suspense than the yawns of the last four Dillon-based novels.Higgins has developed quite a few new rogues to match Dillon in future stories. Hey Jack, return Sean Dillon to the dark side in the next chapter. He's a villain we could root for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick read","review":"A solid book, but ends up being the equivlent of a Harlequin romance. You read it quick and then forget about it.

The story is undescriptive to the point of being difficult to follow, and the characters themselves have about as much depth as a potato chip.

They kidnapped her to force the President to launch surgical nuclear strikes against Israel's primary adversaries in the Middle-East.Then, the plot just went on a completely wrong angle. They kidnapped Sean Dillon to act as their messenger to the President. Though what happened later were not bad for an action thriller, I keep wondering why did they want to get a man like Sean Dillon, and more importantly, Charles Ferguson, involved. They could have convinced the President they got the girl and they mean business without involving people who eventually caused their downfall."},{"rating":"1","title":"A 269-page ad for the cigarette companies","review":"As they are restricted from normal advertising and marketing channels, the cigarette companies have moved to \\"product placement\\". This is the payment to entertainment companies -- usually motion pictures -- to feature cigarettes.It appears with this novel that the practice has moved to books, too. Higgins book reads as a long commercial for Morlboro. People light up when they're angry, when they're happy and after a meal. They give Marlboros as gifts and smuggle them for profit.It's hard to see the plot through the haze of cigarette smoke."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"The Author wasted his time writing this \\"comic book\\" novel.

If you like, venture into the Bad Side of Town for some gritty slide guitar and a promise that you'll be back (when the sun goes down!) Just like a sweet mint left on your pillow, Vollmer gives you a taste of their live performances with a raw and raucous cover of AC/DC's spectacular tune, Overdose.

Isn't that what the title of this CD is leading you to believe? I have the shows on DVD and on every show the main title \\"Hawaiian Eye\\" song has complete words to them. That is the main reason I purchased it and was very disappointed. When I purchased this CD, the songs were not available to preview as they are now. So if you're looking for the TV soundtrack title song, \\"Hawaiian Eye\\"....this ISN'T it. The song is mostly instrumental with a few \\"Hawaiian Eye\\" vocal parts thrown in. It is very misleading."},{"rating":"1","title":"what you see is not what you get","review":"I bought this pulley for a class project.

The pulley was a 2\\" OD 3/4\\" ID pully, but it was made out of thin metal, not solid like the picture shows. What made it a complete waste of money was that the \\"V\\" groove where the belt goes was too wide and the belt would touch the bottom of the groove and so the belt would slip, making it worthless and I had to scramble last minute to find something else that would work.

I only paid $40 and even that is too much for the substandard quality of this knife. I own several Kershaw knifes (including their budget imported models) and the Trident can't hold a candle to their quality. The Trident felt cheap right out of the box. The handle feels like plastic on par with the junk sold on the late night infomercials (Frost). The blade deploys fast, but is undersized for the length of the handle. The blade was reasonably sharp, but failed several times on the paper test. There was also a considerable amount of side-to-side play in the blade and it was not centered when closed. I'm also not a fan of the closing mechanism.Basically, this knife fails in nearly every regard that I care about. I returned this knife and got a Kershaw Clash for half the price of the Trident. The Clash outperforms the Trident in every aspect.I won't be buying anymore SOG knives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trident tf-1","review":"First off, this knife is very sharp out of the box. There is a little side to side play in the blade but it isn't really noticeable. THE BEST thing about this knife is the opening action.

Mostly it's just for show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lock Broke first month, waste of money ...............","review":"I have two SOG Trident knives. Both were a disappointment. Quality parts yes, but poor function. Here I was carrying a Trident camo version in my pocket for emergencies. Well one day, I went to check the blade opening and the damm thing would not open the lock was broken and very loose. So goes for confidence and security. My other Trident openned hard and hardly closed. What a waste. I will be staying with Cold Steel, Gerber and my fav for quality - Kershaw. My Kershaw does not have all the fancy locks to screw up. It has worked fine from day one, quick openning via thumb stud and easy, secure closing. It is tough to become dissappointed in a brand name like SOG, BUT MY LIFE MAY DEPEND UPON MY CARRY KNIFE . (also it is GIBB'S rule #9)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big fat zero for out of the box reliability... but it can be broken in.","review":"I might have had a defect on my hands, but opening mechanism had extremely poor reliability- at least right out of the box. Blade was getting locked in the closed position where it was impossible to flip it open whatsoever regardless of safety settings. I am talking about a 30%+ failure rate. Not good.After a LOT of breaking in, it did become reliable and now opens as designed. For the money, I guess it is not a bad blade, but I think SOG is riding off of their reputation as the winner of the SEAL trials. I seriously doubt that this knife is in use with any real operators. Build quality just isn't there- rather thin blade which does wiggle a little bit in the fixed position, noted reliability issues, and it definitely feels a bit cheap. Probably best to try out a few others before buying this thing.

These compositions reveal the basic tenets of what support for Israel should entail and deal with many issues facing Israel, American Jewry and the United States. Anbar not only deals with topics such as terrorism, historical revisionism, and Arab aggression but also proposes the responses to these. The essays are cogent, insightful and prescient. Together they are a patriot's guide for the upholding and continuation of Jewish sovereignty in the Land of Israel. Though written some time ago, many of the points raised remain valid today.

I have heard most of these songs on past summers, but no one has combined these 18 '80s hits in one collection like this. Even Michael Sembello's fast paced Maniac had helped his career as he later produced hits for New Edition, which I loved. He's still out there today, but doing smooth jazz songs. I still like Mike and The Mechanics moving and emotional The Living Years. The album has a summer 1984 feel to it, as I remembered hearing Tina Turner and Lionel's hits during that season.

This would qualify as a deal killer if I needed to store more than 2 or 3 hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"olympus digital voicerecorder","review":"TERRIBLE product......I will probably throw it in the trash.....plastic constructionis very cheap and the sound is not audible.....total junk!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great digiatl recorder","review":"I carefully read the reviews of the different recorders and finally chose theOlympus WS-100 64 MB Digital Voice Recorder with USB Interfacefor its ease of use and quality. For what I need it is great. I need to record meetings in an open room (usually about 35 people). The recorder and the mic I got are perfect for this. The recorder picks up everything.

The recording quality and volume is fine for my purposes, which is recording therapy sessions. It picks up all voices well. The interface with the computer is straightforward and simple, allowing easy data transfer. The small size makes it easy to carry and store in a purse or pocket. The product doubles as a flash drive, so If I don't have my flash drive handy, I can just substitute this. The product really eliminates the need for an additional flash drive. When the machine is off, the computer sees it as a flash drive. The format can be converted when writing to a CD, so that recordings can be played on a regular CD player. However, the size of the file has to be small enough to fit on the CD. I am convinced that for my needs, this was a good purchase and the best value I could find."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"This digital recorder proved to be a complete waist of money. It has a constant background noise even when recording is in a completely silent environment.

A few tunes are okay, and the title track (the only song on here that had any chart action) sounds kind of like the funky country-soul that Charlie Rich was doing at the time, over on Smash Records.

Even then, this Brazilian Nut makes me wrinkle my nose. I wouldn't dare walk around smelling like this. It's like rotten vanilla, as someone mentioned.The reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because of not just the texture, but after about an hour of wearing it when the scent calms down, it smells great- but it's not something everyone will smell on you unless you're in close contact.

Her voice is very similar to Célyne Dion's with a mixture of Miriah Carey, both in their 30's, therefore I think Kelly needs a personal touch, in her songs as well as her looks.

She has a great voice and can make any song sound like a big hit.--------------------------My opinion on these two songs are.. is that they don't have that great of lyrics and are more plain than creative. These two songs - I'd rather not listen to. But, when I heard Kelly's studio versions, I've decided to listen to these two songs over and over again. They're sure keeps for my burned CDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kelly, Kelly, Kelly #1","review":"These are two great songs. She has an unbelieveable voice and is going to make it in this industry. The songs were the right choices for her and I reccommend the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"sad","review":"If you want an album where the music is written by marketing people who churned out songs for this album in morning, and went back to writing ad jingles in the afternoon - this is for you. ... I kinda feel sorry for Kelly getting all pumped up, letting her people tell her what a great idea it is to sing this ... and how she'll be a big a star if she does. Maybe she'll make enough $$ of this album so she'll have the guts to sing her own stuff on the next one, otherwise nothing good lies ahead for her. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kelly Good/Songs Bad","review":"Kelly Clarkson is a wonderful talent but what [person] picked these songs for her. They are boring! I look forward to hearing Kelly sing material that is good enough for her talent. These songs are not."},{"rating":"2","title":"These songs could not be sung any better","review":"Maybe Whitney or Mariah or Natalie or Celine could sing these songs as well as Kelly, but none could sing them better. Her pitch and her phrasing are flawless. She graces each song with heartfelt emotion. What more could you ask for?Someone wrote here that both songs are typical Dianne Warren power ballads. Ms. Warren may have written \\"Before Your Love\\", I don't know, but she did not write \\"A Moment Like This.\\"At any rate, the songs are a whole lot more memorable than just about anything on Celine's latest effort. I've listened to that CD a dozen times and the only thing I can sing from it is the first line of \\"A New Day Has Come.\\"I think we are seeing the birth of a major star."},{"rating":"2","title":"kelly's great","review":"kelly clarkson is great, cool, down-to-earth, cute and sing all out, beautiful voice and personality"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey, I bought into the hype","review":"I watched the show. I love the song. But I think that I like this CD because I like the journey that Kelly Clarkson took to get this single released. My girlfriend likes the song and we play it because it's a pop love song. Let's bring this whole American Idol thing back to reality. Kelly is a great person and I personally hope that she will endure in a very competitive music industry. Score one for the average young lady with a great singing voice. But I would wait until her full length CD comes out in time for Christmas, they will probably include these two songs on it. It also looks as if the American Idol greatest hits has these two songs on it, plus \\"Natural Woman\\" which Kelly just rocked during the show. Did I buy this CD? I sure did! Was it a waste of money? It sure was! Only because I'm also going to buy the Greatest Hits and Kelly's full length. Did FOX Network get me to buy into the hype? They sure did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Good","review":"I just bought this CD single at Wal-Mart yesterday and found myself immediately addicted.

I now realize I was just caught up in the hype. Now that American Idol is over and the craze has died down, I really see nothing special about Kelly's voice. Especially on this CD. Her voice sounds so flat and husky. I thought she sounded much better live. At least she did in my memory. The two songs on this single are terribly written. Even the most hard core Kelly fan MUST admit that the only reason why she is such a success right now is because of the TV show. Right now she's got a so-so power ballad playing on MTV while the queen of power ballads Celine Dion, or even LeAnn Rimes, wont even be considered. Does this make sense? No. Once American Idol 2 comes around absolutely nobody, not even the hard core fans, will care about Kelly. I can guarantee you that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mass produced pap","review":"The American Idol TV program, although amusing, produced no good music whatsoever.

Like the Canadian vocalist, this 20-year-old Texan has respectable pipes, but there's something curiously Vegas-like about her. Maybe it's this song, which has a predictable melody and Hallmark-trite lyrics. Devoid of any craft or surprises, it shot right to No. 1 on the charts due to incredible first-week sales, showing once again the power of the hype machine. To paraphrase an old saying, \\"the devil finds work for 'Idol' hands.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"You must be joking","review":"The over-enthusiastic use of pitch correction software and full-on compression makes her sound like a robot. Can she actually sing? You'll never know from listening to these songs. I suppose if you don't know anything about music or recording it might be passably pleasant. Look for Ms. Clarkson to make frequent excuses for poor live performances where an ATR-1 can't be slipped into her vocal signal chain."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best","review":"I think that this is the best CD out there and I think that any1that doesn't like it has no friends and likes country music"},{"rating":"2","title":"kelly's vocal ability can save any song","review":"with kelly's awesome voice, she can make any cheese lyric sound wonderful. i just hope she moves away from these style of ballads. if you've heard her demo, you know she can really rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is why she's the American Idol!","review":"Kelly is by far one of the best vocalists I have ever heard.

Her voice is incredible, what an awesome talent, thank God for her friend Jessica who signed her up.

Everyone needs to get past the fact that Kelly won American Idol and focus on her talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"ignore the songs -- it's all about the voice","review":"I gave this 4 stars solely for the voice -- big, soulful, and rich. One can only hope that Kelly Clarkson will have the opportunity to make some of her own choices in her career. Her voice is truly superlative, and American Idol has given her unprecedented exposure. She's really at her best singing live, but she did a great job with the singles ... despite the fact they are disappointingly mediocre songs. Here's hoping that she is able to create her own music and not be packaged into whatever might be MTV- or VH1-friendly at the time. There are too many beautiful voices singing the wrong material already."},{"rating":"2","title":"KOOL KELLY","review":"i love this cd i havent ordered it yet because i want the new american idol album. i think this is the best cd i ve ever heard!!!

But then again, how else do you explain Britney, N Sync, Nelly or any other one-hit wonders? People today simply let the marketers and record companies tell them what's good and what to listen to. Instead of finding truly talented artists and groups who write and produce real music on their own, they let hype and ... lead then like cattle to the record stores to waste their money time and time again. So Kelly has a great voice?? Wow, how amazing, huh? So do a million other people the world over. They just don't have Fox Television and the media pushing them down the throats of people who have no taste in real music but do have an ever-open wallet for them to stick their fingers into."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Weak","review":"Kelly has a great country grand ole oprey kind of voice, but these songs are just weak. I can't believe that these are the best songs that could be written for her. After having a breakout show, they've blown it by writing 2 really weak songs. Sure they are doing well on the charts, but that's only due to the show's momentum. The songs have no legs. A year from now, you'll never remember these songs. As for Kelly, her career will have no legs unless they hook her up with Nashville since country is really in her wheelhouse. She's not a pop singer. She's just to plain Jane and fat to compete with the made up popstars like Brittany etal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"She can sing. You can't take that away from her.

In a pop world of Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera and Nsync, Kelly should have started off with a dance song. We've all seen her showcase her vocal range all summer, give us something different. Also, does anybody else get the feeling that Kelly is strictly being used as a pawn to promote the American Idol franchise more than anything else? \\"I can't believe it's happening to me / Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this?\\" that ain't no love song! Its the unofficial theme for winning American Idol!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful singer forced to produce tripe","review":"Poor Kelly.

I loved the show, and was rooting for Kelly since the pack narrowed to 10. But these songs are tired, insipid, wholly unoriginal, and are of no artistic merit aside from Miss Clarkson's voice.If I am to retain any respect for this artist, I have to believe that she cringed all the way through these recording sessions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kelly Clarkson is just another Truthless Hero","review":"How surprising, newly crowned Pop Princess Kelly Clarkson sings songs writetn by no talent hacks who know what the public will buy into.

I immediately bought one for myself this time. Since then, I have given it as gifts to several of my own family members and I am teaching my own children to make delicious food from the book. Now, I can proudly say that my sweet potatoe pie is to \\"live for\\" and is much requested by family & friends.

I would say simply, that Simeon's story belongs in every household that has a child to be enwrapped by it and in any other household that appreciates good things. The book \\"Simeon's Gift\\" is definitely one of those 'good things'.

Alexander Greeneyes, a toolman, finds himself caught between a wish to live longer and political expediency, and at the last chooses honor above betrayal; later, his clone August must battle the legacy he wears on his face to make his own choices.My one complaint, perhaps, is that the ending of _Becoming Human_ feels rushed; too much happens at once, too many revelations, too many skeletons rising out of the closet.

And having heard the sound it is most definatly in mono not stereo. Secondly there are no subtitles. So if you are hard of hearing there is no help here. Apart from that the quality of the picture and sound are good. The episodes are magic examples of the british ITC produced stock of programmes.

What most people don't seem to get is that the book is actually Abbey's defense of his own hypocritical pseudo-environmentalism. Abbey lived almost his entire life in cities and enjoyed driving big gas-guzzling cars and indulging in all the wasteful conveniences of modern society. Notice that the \\"heroes\\" in this book don't give a second thought to spreading their OWN pollution and litter through the wilderness. They only get upset when other people do it. Just like Abbey. On top of this, the prose is wretched. I know that Abbey intended this book to be semi-comic, but was he really shooting for the tone of a third-rate romance/adventure novel? I suspect that he was trying to hide his own lack of writing talent behind a mask of \\"cheesy humor\\", the equivalent of tripping over a step and saying: \\"I meant to do that!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I miss something?","review":"i read this book on advice of a friend, so i finished it. but i didn't find this book gripping or inspirational. i didn't have sympathy for any of the characters and the writing was bloated. while i was reading i found my mind wandering and didn't feel a need to go back and read paragraphs or sentences i missed while wandering. the characters are somewhat true to life in that they are total environmental hypocrites, but the book didn't present this as something to work on avoiding. overall a long read that just made me realize why so many people hate tree huggers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure male fantasy","review":"This book is pure male fantasy, with ideas of absolute power. There is a fawning young beautiful woman who acts as admiring helpless geisha -- freely sexual and cooperative, hiplength hair of course, and she does not want a commitment. The hero rapes her at one point.In adolescence, boys mistake the power feelings of testosterone for the ability to paint a mustache on Smokey the Bear. Although Abbey has certain keen observations, he doesn't develop them in an interesting way. His characters are one dimensional. He disrupts the peacefulness of the desert much more than any billboard would.I'm not sure what is being rescued by this fictional batch of heroes -- however, if a woman is married to a man who has outsize ego and power needs, she can read this book to better understand his world view."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I had high hopes for this book. I'm a fan of the outdoors and adventure books; this one had been recommended to me by several people. I started and kept waiting for it to get better, but it was a constant chore to keep reading. The characters were static and their relationships forced as if they were puzzle pieces that didn't quite match. But never fear, the author was there to bang the hell out of them until they stuck. The ending (and for that matter, the circumstances leading up to it) wasn't even close to a surprise. The only positive I can give it is that it does point out some of the environmental destruction we wreak on the planet around us. But many other books point this out, and some actually have redeeming value beyond that one aspect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing book....","review":"After reading \\"Fool's Progress\\", I began to become interested in Edward Abbey's other books. So I read \\"Monkey Wrench Gang\\", probably one of his better known ones, and I came away from it quite disappointed. Yes, I know it was the 70's, when it was written, but did we really need a stereotypical J.A.P feminist and a flat ex-Green Beret, who loves violence and to litter. The sentiments that the dam at Glen Canyon ruined the Colorado seem right, but that was the book's only strength. By the time I got to the end, I didn't care what happened to the characters, although I give it credit for not being a \\"hollywood\\" ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"A damn good book.","review":"One of the funniest books I have read. Creative and a good look on how some things should be done. Too bad it's not a true story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Entertaining","review":"I laughed out loud several times while reading this book. Being appalled at the rate at which America is being paved over, I certainly sympathized with the message of the book, although not, I confess, with the methods employed by the protaganists. However, I would remind those who condemn this book as a guide for eco-terrorists that most of the terrorism being perpetrated in this country today in connection with the environment is being done by anti-environmental, right-wing, \\"wise-use\\" advocates."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best","review":"Edward Abbey is a genius when it comes to writing about monkey wrenching. This book is intelligent, although I must admit I didn't hold Hayduke in much regard because of most of his attitudes, but that's okay. Abbey shows how just four people can make a difference, and really start something (in Hayduke Lives! it becomes more of a movement). I did not find it hillarious, or even all that funny at times, and am confused when people describe it as such, but it was enlightening, and really made me think about how significant a few insignificant people can really be, when driven to that point of annoyance and anger."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hilarious environmental rampage","review":"Ever watch bulldozers mauling a forest to make way for a residential subdivision? Ever think of doing something less than civil to stop it? If so, The Monkey Wrench Gang is your kind of novel. I couldn't stop laughing the first time I read it - the antiestablishment mayhem is nonstop, and Abbey's lush imagery makes you feel like a fifth member of the gang. This is fun reading - it isn't great literature by any stretch. Abbey was adept at puns and clever wordplay, but his characters are somewhat superficial and riddled with stereotypes. But at the heart of this novel is Abbey's passion and sorrow for the Desert Southwest, a love that we can all begin to understand as we follow his motley band on their crusade to save the wilderness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abbey missfires","review":"Abbey's a better non-fiction writer than he is a fiction writer. Redundant events and emotions. Was hard to get past the middle of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Abbey Lives!","review":"I am reluctant to give this book five stars, because it is really not all that well-written, and certainly does not compare to Desert Solitaire. However, it is a timeless book, and is as relevant today as it was twenty years ago. The Canyonlands area (which is one of the most beautiful regions in the world) is still being threatened by morons who want to build condominiums all along the Colorado River and destroy what little remains of the wild places in America. Therefore, in spite of my belief that Edward Abbey is not a great fiction writer, I feel that this book will always be worth reading, so long as it continues to inspire people to fight against the senseless desecration and commercialization of our nation's wilderness."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Will Change Your Life","review":"My sister gave me her used copy of The Monkey Wrench Gang 5 years ago, stating, \\"This Book Will Change Your Life.\\" It is insightful, powerful, and beautifully written.

You may just learn something."},{"rating":"2","title":"YEEEEEEEE HA!","review":"Not only did this book start Earthfirst and raised our consciousness about the Environment but it all singlehandedly took Environmentalism out of the hands of the granola crunching, self-righteous, potsmoking, banner waving, Leninist hippies and gave it to the cowboys where it belonged. None of the characters are vegetarian or whiny like most Environmentalist Stereotypes but hark back to the real man macho bullshit that has been critiqued, criticised and deconstructed to death. Abbey melds these two strains of thought and made environmentalism cool again. Maybe you don't want to go out and break a bulldozer that is trying to do away with swampland, but after this book you will buy a spare set of wire cutters---just in case.."},{"rating":"2","title":"POWERFUL","review":"Environmentalist: before you get involved in any movement, you should read this book.

This book is a classic and it is one of my all-time favorites. Abbey is hilarious and the reading is always entertaining but lurking beneath (not too deeply) is a social statement we should all heed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seeing through Abbey","review":"I read this book in the early 80s when I had just moved to Moab, Utah, where Abbey lived for a while and where he worked for the Park Service. I was appalled by what others have already noted, the glib tacit approval of vandalism.Abbey was a talented and entertaining writer and could weave magic out of the landscape. I am one of the people who moved to Moab because of Desert Solitaire, a decision I never regretted, altho I left when the town became ruined for anyone but the very rich - See Brave New West by Jim Stiles. But in all Abbey's work, not just Monkey Wrench Gang, a nasty streak surfaces now and then, and at some point I quit reading him."},{"rating":"1","title":"a very slow starter","review":"My husband totally hyped this book up - he's a huge Abbey fan - and I was pretty let down. Nothing really happened for the first 100 pages, and seriously - who wants a two-three page detailed lesson on how to operate a huge piece of machinery? Not me. I consider myself an environmentalist, and was amused by the idea presented by the book...but the story itself was way too predictable, little character development, and not the best work Edward Abbey has done. A better fiction piece by Abbey is The Fool's Progress."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun...and a classic read","review":"Experience a new outlaw justice in this classic Abbey work.

Ed Abbey knew this and his book shows, albeit a tad too profanely, what such eco-terrorism on the part of governmental agenices can provoke. That the most beautiful canyon in the world is buried under beer-can and gasoline polluted water shows that it was Floyd Dominy, not George Hayduke, who was the true barbarian. The opening passage on blowing up the Glen Canyon bridge is priceless. I don't advocate such things, but they do become understandable when you read this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh Out Loud Funny and Thought Provoking","review":"Ed Abbey's gang of environmental rebels will make you laugh out loud as their adventures in saving the wilderness take them around the southwest looking for the machinery of \\"civilization\\" to destroy.

In Scat, one of Hiaasen's characters recommends The Monkey Wrench gang to a fourteen year old character. We decided to check it out after finishing Scat. It is extremely vulgar and not a book most tweens would enjoy. As an adult, I found humor in the book and the monkey wrench gangs tactics are mildly amusing. If you are a family looking for something to read after Scat, I wouldn't recommend The Monkey Wrench Gang."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I thought this story would be about the beauty and the enjoyment of the desert southwest. Instead its a book about the glorification of vandalism and the destruction of property. Desert Solitude is a much better book, its hard to believe they are by the same author. If Abbey had only wrote the Monkey Wrench Gang I doubt he would have been so famous."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Eco-Terrorist Manifesto...","review":"When I first read this as a teenager, I thought it was a wonderful tale of civil disobedience. However, in retrospect, I recognize that this work represents a clarion call for the eco-terrorism we have been witnessing for the past few decades.The plot follows a cadre of misfits and criminals as they seek to do harm to private developers who are ostensibly ruining the natural landscapes of the American west. The gang mechanistically destroys private property, and the author seems to have no compunction about glorifying this activity as some kind of vague, contradictory, directionless, and unnamed cause.In short, I would _not_ recommend this book to anyone--except, perhaps, as a means to gain insight into the liberal mindset that drives the eco-terrorist movement. I would much rather read (and recommend) books with a bona fide moral purpose--where the emphasis is on productive genius and its benefits, not destruction as an end in itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book but arrived damaged.","review":"This is a fine book, but unfortunately it arrived damaged.

Abbey fails to mention he too enjoyed the conveniences of driving a gas guzzler and other wasteful means of living in a big city. The obsurdity of libs claiming enviro groups like ALF and ELF are \\"right wing\\" is just a diversion to justify and soften the blow for their selfish actions. Though I enjoyed Abbeys other writings, I think this book is misguiding highly impressionable lost souls who still live with mommy and daddy.

Like all of Chris Rock's standup performances this one is totally brilliant. If everyone in society talked as freely about race, sex, and people as Chris Rock does then the United States would be a far better place. He is magnificently, wondrously, and electrically politically incorrect and we should appreciate him for it. Rock is far more valuable than five thousand rebellious commentators writing articles for 24 hours a day in the attempt to destroy PC. His essential theme is \\"people are people\\" even if you're Bill Clinton. That we pretend otherwise is our own pathology. Thank God for Chris Rock--at least someone has the guts to stand up and say what he wants."},{"rating":"1","title":"racist - sexist and boring","review":"Of course everyone has their own opinion and most of you appear to have liked this, but i find that Chris Rock doesn't relate to a wide audience he talks about people that aren't world wide famous and there are lots of 'insider' gags that some people just won't get unless they know America very well.

Most of his material on this dvd wasn't funny at all. I found myself somewhat speeding up the dvd to the next joke just so that I could get a laugh. In my opinion, if you're going to buy it, then buy it used so that you won't feel like you paid too much for it if you're disappointed. I'm hesitant to buy his \\"Bring the Pain\\" dvd due to I don't know what to expect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Swears every other word","review":"Not entertaining and not up to his potential. He is one of the funniest commedian to come along, but not in this video. Every other word is swearing & is very redundant.

Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very witty","review":"This DVD was not what I expected. I hadn't seen Chris Rock on standup before but he sure is alot different than he is on the silver screen. Every other word is the f-word.

I would look into some Dave Chappelle, he is animated like Rock and he has good material."},{"rating":"1","title":"rock job","review":"i love chris,but why should i laugh when the crowd isnt laughing the jokes are slow paced and just die out.better luck in the next album"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"Sorry, I usually appreciate your comedy, but not this time.

Poor quality graphics are to be expected of those marks from the '30s, '40s and '50s but even the latest marks were poorly rendered. Most of the figures looked as if they had been through a copy machine 5 or 6 times before publication or poorly traced with a black pen. Where is the style in the strokes? Where is the artistry?I think this book is a case of QUANTITY rather than QUALITY. This book could have used some serious editing to include only 200 of the best and most influential and successful character marks of the century with more about their history and evolution. I was impressed however at the painstaking dilligence in compiling such a large library of trademarks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for the purpose it was created for","review":"This is a valuable resource for anyone with an interest in character and trademark design.

The ear bud has a thick cord and it's impossible to orient it properly so it doesn't stay in the ear. The over the ear piece is too thick with my glasses and doesn't hold the ear.

The first time, a kink in the wire or a slight tug on the wire rendered the microphone unusable. We were able to exchange them, luckily. This time we've been extra careful with them, however just last night the microphone started to go on my headset again. I can hear others just fine but they can't hear me.

Therefore, when I'm in transit I almost always have the earpiece on and it is extremely comfortable.The earpiece has had no reliability problems as the other reviewers experienced. However, at under ten dollars, it seems like it is an extremely good buy if one amortizes the purchase price across each use. Indeed, one could use the additional ear hook to make other ear pieces more comfortable.I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Body Glove Headset","review":"I didn't like the head set. It DID fit well and didn't fall out of my ear but it distorted my voice for the listener, producing a loud echo. Also it wasn't possible to dial while the head phone was plugged in.

I have very small ear openings, so finding a headset with earbuds had been impossible until I lucked up on the BodyGlove Earglove pro. Not only do they fit well, but the sound is excellent! The only problem that I have had is lately is that I have been hearing static. There is a one year warranty on the headset which I will be taking advantage of. The static is the only reason that I can't give the item a 5 star rating. However, I may buy extras just because I like it so.UPDATE:I have to downgrade this rating to 2 stars. The sound quality is wonderful when the unit works. However, it is so poorly constructed that the unit lasts several months and then it is full of static. I have replaced the unit four times.

The range in the product description is 30 ft. I got about 5 feet, and that was with static. I only got a relatively clear signal at about 6 inches. I tried a number of stations.Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not work for me","review":"Purchaed this product at a store, not here; however, the reception at any freq was very poor.

Sorry, but it didn't work for me--I wish it had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works fairly well.","review":"We purchased this unit about 2 months ago. It is my second FM transmitter - my prior one was an off brand product. Initially, I was somewhat disappointed with the Belkin. Any level of external transmission on a station causes distortion - this is a problem when driving through a city as channels drop in and out. The saving grace of this product is 1) you can tune in almost any FM station and 2) the easy controls for changing stations. If one finds the right channel (keep trying!), the product works well, but it does take a lot of trying. If you are in a city, you may have to change the channel several times as you drive.I have always powered it off car power as opposed to using the batteries.I haven't had a problem with the unit automatically turning off. We use this only with our portable DVD player. When it is working well, the sound is good though it may not be stereo."},{"rating":"1","title":"could work better","review":"Not as clear a signal as I had hoped for.

Switched out batteries, with and without the DC adapter, nothing. And from what I read, I'm not the first person this has happened to. Very cheap, very unreliable. Buyer Beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak transmitter","review":"Just returned mine to amazon. The transmitter is so weak that you literally have to have the device touching your antenna if you want no static. Putting it within a couple feet will get you sound but it will be riddled with static. Anything further than 3 feet and your pretty much SOL. This is a far cry from the transmitters built into something like a Sirius or XM tuner. Using batteries or the 12v adapter makes no difference, it's still utterly useless. I would definitely not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good in cities with lots of radio stations","review":"I live in Atlanta, where there are radio stations on virtually every point on the dial. Unfortunately, I cannot get a good signal with this transmitter. At this point, I'm thinking about another stereo altogether."},{"rating":"2","title":"It worked for me","review":"I got this Item along with the portable DVD player 3 years ago and it still works. My kids were watching movies on the long trip to canada, the sound was so great, That I had to stop and watch some sceene with them. It works in my older car with outside antena, and it is even better in new Honda where antena is in the glass. If your device has line output use it, some of the headphone outputs distort the signalIt works best when on the power adapter. Sometimes I had to switch the channel while passing big city like NYC, and sometimes the quality depends on teh position of the transmitter in the car. But I always was abl to find a good one. I did recomend this thing to few people and they also were pleased with their results."},{"rating":"1","title":"This thing is GARBAGE","review":"I just received this transmitter and tried it out. I have never heard this much static in my life. Have you ever been in your car listening to the radio and one of your favorite songs is on but the reception starts getting weak? As you drive further and further out of town the reception gets worse and worse until you reach the point where you want to change the channel even though you are listening to one of your favorite songs. Well that is what using this product is like. The reception is so bad you won't even want to use your MP3 player. Do the smart thing, buy a cassette adapter. If your car does not have a cassette deck you would probably be better off buying external battery powered speakers than using this junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was nice while it lasted...","review":"I enjoyed being able to listen to my MP3 player until the transmitter died the 2nd month I had it.I'm not sure if I will invest in another one any time soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alien noises","review":"I am highly disappointed with the transmitter. I expected the sound to be of similar quality as the CD changer in my trunk that also uses a transmitter to play through a radio station. The TuneCast II, however, was of much worse quality. Distortion abounds. Alien noises are heard especially when music is fading in or out. Also, static is really a problem. I expect that the transmitter should give a clear signal to my car stereo when in the car; that's certainly within the 10' radius. Reception was even worse when using the batteries instead of the D/C adapter.On a positive note, the transmitter does allow a broad range of stations to be used."},{"rating":"1","title":"not satisfied","review":"I've had this item for a little over six months now. It started out where the transmitter would just turn off randomly every couple of times I used it. Now, it turns off on average 1-3 times during each song.

Consequently, there is a lot of noise and static and it is somewhat annoying. When travelling, it is necessary to re-tune to different frequencies sometimes every 5-10 miles due to bleed-over.

It worked fine but died after less than 80 hours of use. Something went wonky and it couldn't recognize that the iPod was sending a signal--it would shut off after 60 seconds--so frustrating and not fixable. Now, here's the confessional part: despite all the awful reviews, and my previous bad experience, I succumbed and bought another Belkin a couple months ago. My deranged thinking was, 'It's a great price and I really miss hearing my iPod in the car. After all this time, they're bound to have worked out the glitch, right?' WRONG. The new Belkin worked fine for about 40 hours of play this time and then fried out in the exact same way. Do yourself a favor, get a Monster Cable iCarPlay. It's twenty bucks more but it broadcasts a really nice sound and after 40 hours, it's still going strong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad purchase","review":"Terrible product. To play at a volume where you can still have a converstion requires you to turn your car volume up to 3/4 of the max. Most of the time it has static. Sounds like mono instead of stereo to me. If you spent more than $25 on your car stereo, you care about music too much to buy this thing. A cassette adapter may eventually wear out, but it provides amazing sound compared to this thing.

It would have been much better to get an FM transmitter that attached to the iPod (or MP3 player)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless near a city","review":"I live 20 miles from Boston, and it's impossible to get good, static-free reception from this transmitter, even when the transmitter is mere inches from the radio. There are only a few frequencies that don't have stations on them, and the interference is still too much. Plus, a frequency you thought was free can suddenly become occupied when the weather changes or your position changes slightly. Once, I had a station appear in an \\"empty\\" frequency just by moving my car three feet, backing out of a parking space. And when I drove through the heart of some cities, this FM transmitter was completely drowned out.I've switched to a cassette adapter. The fidelity is at least as good, and, unlike FM, there's no static at all (ironic smile)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pitiful range, bad sound quality","review":"I bought this wanting to play music from my laptop on the car stereo during my commute to school. Even in the car, the sound was fuzzy and the limited range was prohibitive (as in it wouldn't even work from the backseat haha).As far as I can tell, my problems weren't due to interference from other stations. There weren't any radio stations within several megahertz at least from the station I was using (90.3 in Waco, Texas).I also tried it out on my cousin's iPod in Austin and we got the same thing - lots of interference."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a good idea but...","review":"I started off with the Belkin Tunecast. Since I live in metropolitan New York, just about every station is used, including the four that are available on the tunecast. I therefore decided to upgrade to the Tunecast II. To my dismay, this was not much better. There is always a constant static behind my music. If you spend time sitting in the car and finding an unused station and adjusting the car and mp3 player volumes you will eventually get a good enough signal.

The MP3 player works just fine if I plug it directly to my headphones or stereo. So basically this is useless for me so I returned it.

However, I have come to the conclusion that it is not the best buy. Although, this transmitter gets decent range, the sound quality is terrible. The worst thing about it is that the batteries do not last long at all. It has a charger port that draws 12 volts, but it only hold two AAA batteries giving a maximum charge of 3 volts combined, making it vastly underpowered without a charger. Plus it is kind of awkward to handle because of the wire. I just recently purchased an iTrip transmitter and I love it.

The sound isn't CD quality, but that's to be expected, over all still better than nothing at all. The one problem I've had with this device is the poor wiring. Not shortly after a few weeks of use, the wire connecting to my mp3 player seems to have split or \\"frey\\" internally which causes the left and right speakers to occasionally fade in and out when the wire moves. Secondly, the AC adaper has basically stopped working all together forcing me to use batteries which last only a few hours worth of play.My advice, if you're planning on listening to your mp3 player everyday for the rest of it's life, either spend $100 bucks to have a jack put onto your existing sterio so you can plug the player into it directly, or buy a new system all together for $250+.I loved this device, but now it's just a pain in the ass."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would have given it NO stars if I could!","review":"It's not like me to complain, but this gadget is absolutely horrible!

It must have seemed innovative to the designers to remove the on/off button and have the device sense when it needs to turn on, but it makes for more confusion rather than a better experience. For example, if the car adapter is plugged in, but the car isn't running, the device won't turn on, even if your mp3 player is connected and playing. However, the biggest reason why this item is sitting on my shelf is sound quality. It is simply not good enough for me to enjoy my music. This issue is not specific to the Belkin model, but to FM transmitters in general. Be warned before you buy one of these that if you are at all picky about hearing an mp3 sound like it's coming out of a crappy radio, you should look elsewhere.

Put plainly, this product sucks, don't waste your money. There is not only a constant hiss, but the music comes in and out and the music from the radio mingles with it every once and awhile. Oh, and if the device wanders to far from the reciever when you round a curve or something, the reception might go completely out and you will be greeted by the loud shriek of static at whatever volume you had your radio set at.

The main problem is that it will NOT tune to a frequency below 88.0. Most cities only have 87.9 and lower free of broadcasts and bleed over.

It's equally pathetic with both. It also has an \\"Auto On\\" which is supposed to turn the unit on when it detects the audio from your player. Yeah, right. It never turns on, and the manual ON/OFF switch won't power it up either!I'm returning this to Amazon and switching back to headphones.

It constantly drains 1 mA even when off. That means a fresh set of alkalines will be 50% drained after a month even if the unit is not used. When on, the current drain increases to 80 mA. The result is generally 4-10 hours on NiMH rechargeables.Range is poor. It is almost impossible to get good reception in my car near a city. Although it claims to cover the entire FM band, my unit did not produce a signal at frequencies above 105.5 MHz. Probably a manufacturing defect.On the plus side, it remembers four frequencies even after batteries are removed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool idea, but the technology's not there yet","review":"I picked up one of these to give it a try in my car.

Especially driving around/under power lines.I used it in my car in the Los Angeles area. That said, this region is bathed in radio waves. Hardly channel on the dial doesn't have a radio broadcast on it, and you can hear the channels mixed with static on most of the in-between channels.

My wife and I used it to amplify audio from our laptop for watching DVDs on a trip. It works okay, but there is a considerable amount of static in most geographic locations. Most of the time you can switch the frequencies to avoid heavy static, but it does take time to do this and a small amount of static cannot be avoided. If your vehicle has a cassette player I STRONGLY urge you to get a cassette adapter instead of this FM transmitter. The cassette version is the same as it pugs into any standard headphone jack, but it eliminates most if not all of the static, because it's wired instead of transmitting through the air and competing with radio stations. Overall, this FM transmitter will do in a pinch if your vehicle doesn't have a cassette player.

It does struggle, but I have found a few freqencies that are passable. I planned on removing the built-in attenuation to get a better signal, but I'm not sure I'll bother anymore.The killer for this product for me is the audio quality. It is nowhere near as good as a decent FM station, better than a cell phone connection, and maybe better than AM. My car has a stock stereo in it with pretty average sound, but I wasn't willing to take the additional hit to sound quality so will find another way to listen.I guess it depends on expectations whether this is a great product or one for the back of the cupboard.

Sound is still full of static (with power cord) when transmitter is placed on center console. The power cord must also be used to prevent static. Without it, the battery dies quickly and reception is high in static. It is even slightly static when placed next to the antenna. This product is not worth the money. Also, beware if you have thick metal windshield wipers. The radio signal skips when the wipers block the signal of the transmitter. I would highly recomend the Iriver AFT 100. I just purchased one of these. It is about the same price and the sound quality is static free anf far superior."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible reception","review":"No matter what I did, or how many \\"help\\" reviews I went to online, I could not get any clear station.

The FM aspect of it is fine although it sometimes difficult to find an unused station, but the audio quality is really terrible. It distorts very badly and sounds pretty much like a clipping overload much of the time. Even at its best it is bass heavy and treble light and sounds as if it may have an impedence mismatch as well.

Very Frustrating!!!!! I'm off to buy a cassette adapter (iTrip sounds nice but also sounds like it eats alot of batteries).Oh and the Belkin drained my batteries quickly b/c the sound was always so low I had to turn my iPod up almost the whole way,a nd then my stereo up almost the whole way.Buy something else!

There were a handful with a minimal signal. Choosing one of them, the Belkin sounds like I'm listening to a really distant station -- closer to AM than FM. I don't demand audiophile quality from a device like this, but I can't get good reception on any station. Also, remember that, though many radios have automatic search for strong signals, none (that I know of) can automatically find a signal-free channel, so every time you change cars or drive out of town, you have to manually find a new station -- if your car stereo works at all with this piece of junk. Save yourself the cost of return postage to Amazon and buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor performance and then died","review":"I purchased one of these in the middle of April. The first problem I noticed was the volume level from the transmitter. I needed to increase the volume on my fm radio to twice the volume level I normally used to play other broadcasts. This caused other interference to also amplify. The second problem I noticed was with the battery life. The batteries died after less than 4 hours of use. It uses 2 AAA batteries which needed to be replaced a couple times a day. The third problem with the unit was when it died three weeks later. I can't say I'm sorry to see it go. My experience with this unit is that it has very poor performance and it will not last. Do not purchase this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor sound quality, lots of static","review":"I tried this out for a day and am going to return it. When you can balance it in the exact right position on your dashboard so that it is as close as possible to your car's antenna, you can get poor quality music... for a few seconds. Then you go around a corner, hit a bump, or even just roll forward a few inches, and all you get is static.I tried this in my car and on my home stereo. I tried it sitting in my driveway, moving the TuneCast all over the place, and also driving around. I tried lots of different frequencies, different volumes, holding the TuneCast or setting it down... the only thing I didn't try was a tin foil hat for it, but somehow I don't think it would have helped. The sound is at best inconsistent, never good.I can't believe people pay anything for sound this bad. I'd honestly rather have silence in my car than try to listen to the noises my radio produces when I turn this thing on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works great if I hold my MP3 player straight up in the air while I'm driving!","review":"After setting up the Tunecast II Mobile FM Transmitter to my MP3 player, static and a low frequency hum was very apparent on any station I tried to sync to. I thought it was my player so I switched to a CD player with the same results. I found I could increase or decrease the static and low frequency hum by moving the MP3 or CD player so that the cords from the player to the Transmitter were at specific angles. The Tunecast II works great if I hold the player around the area of the rear view mirror. Of course the blood runs out of my arm after awhile and I may eventually need rotor cuff surgery but I saved money by going 'cheap'. It's great to read all the 'tech' reviews but I'm simple, either it works or it doesn't and in my opinion, it doesn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely useless","review":"I bought this to use in the car with my Creative Zen Vision M. I already have a portable Sirius Satellite Radio that slots in a holster in my car and broadcasts through my car radio using an FM signal. The Sirius works really well with sound quality that matches that of most FM broadcast radio stations and I expected the Belkin to be similar.It is not. The sound quality ranges from pathetic, through absolutely unlistenable to no signal at all. Anyone who has rated this higher than one star is deaf. I tried it on my home stereo system and the quality was only marginally better.Don't waste your time on this - better to spend the money on portable speakers. Mine is going back tomorrow."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works pretty good.","review":"Just got one of these.I have to say. This one is very good compared to my old $20 analog model. This one just lock the channel in place. My old one just jump around. The sound quality of this Belkin is pretty good. It ain't no CD but it ain't bad either. It is loud and pretty clean with my RIO S35 Sport. Sometimes it has static noise but it is not that bad. I find that it is best to tune to a frequency with a weak station rather than a frequency with only static. If it is a frequency with static, you will hear alot of noise. If it is a frequency with a weak station, I guess the \\"modern\\" radio will lock on to the Belkin instead of the weak station. I think this is up to your car radio. When I try it the first time, I can hear both the weak station and my music at the same time. And then all the sudden, the car radio just cut off the weak station and lock on to the Belkin. Pretty cool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't expect much...","review":"You have to really want or need to hear your audio stream through an FM radio to justify buying this item. It basically does what it is supposed to do, but there is a constant whistle in the background. Also, there seems to be an inconsistent output level as the volume rises and falls. As long as you keep the Tunecast within a few feet of the radio and in some cases orient it's position just right, then the sound quality is listenable. Even at that, a scratchiness is usually present along with the whistle. Living in a metro area with very little empty space on the FM band is likely part of the problem. At least the digital tuning, with 4 settable frequencies, is a plus.If music clarity is important, then forget it; find another way. If, as in my case, the purpose is to hear speech off of an MP3 player or by way of a 900Mhz receiver, and you get a price marked way down from list, then it could work for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"The concept is really great and I was really looking forward to it. I used it in my car to listen to audio books. The biggest problem with it was that I had to turn the volume all the way up on my radio and still couldn't hear the book. It is possible that this wouldn't be as much of a problem with music, but for me it's worthless"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works fine indoors with careful tweaking","review":"First impressions at an arbitrary FM frequency were that the sound quality was not that great. Background noise was quite apparent, and the unit had to be placed very close to the FM receiver to give a reasonable sound quality. However, after experimenting with FM frequencies and using full volume on my ipod nano, (with the ipod EQ setting on loudness) I obtained a pretty good sound, sounding better than FM and only slightly inferior to DAB sound. The ipod did need to be placed very close to the Pure Evoke 2 DAB/FM radio I was using and using a higher than usual volume on the radio. I'm now pretty pleased with it as it does exactly what it says it does, no more no less. Not a bad price either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible reception","review":"The reception was horrible unless the transmitter was actually touching the antenna (we tried it with the house stereo).

We also tried it in the car, but it wouldn't pull in at all enough to listen to on any station.

Also, the best thing to do is go to a custom install shop and for about 120 bucks they will put something in your car that directly connect though your antenna into your head unit so all you have to do is hit a button and there's a direct connection from your player to your head unit.

It's supposed to turn on whenever it detects music playing on the attached MP3 player, but I've found that it only does so about half the time with my iPod classic and even less than that with my Shuffle. The power adapter is terrible, as well - it doesn't even fit in the outlets of several cars I've tried, and with several others you have to hold it in just the right place or else it falls out. It also has a weak signal strength and cuts out at random times (I suspect that at times it's been overridden by FM transmitters in other cars next to me while I was on the freeway).It's okay, I guess, but I would just avoid it in the first place and spend a little extra for a transmitter that actually works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wimpy","review":"I've now returned two of these.

Sound quality depends on how crowded the radio dial is with stations and your ability to find an empty station to tune into. This belkin is great in that it does not restrict you to 2 or 3 stations like most other devices do. You can transmit on any frequency that works for you. I played with it for a few days, and set the memory to a few stations which are unoccupied in my area and it works well. It eats batteries, but it also comes with a car adapter to minimize that for when you are driving.

It's not crystal clear like a radio station, but I get very little static and background noise. I can also change the frequency if weather, etc. interferes.June 2007: I've had a year to use this product now, and I would lower the rating to 3-4 stars if possible. Reason?

I found it slightly annoying that one had to reset the frequency on the transmitter every time one started the car, but that was a minor annoyance.It lasted about three months without trouble. Then it started being somewhat unreliable. Sometimes it would come on, and sometimes it wouldn't. I found that jiggling the power cable would sometimes get it to start, and that it ran on batteries reliably (although the signal seems weaker with batteries). Finally even jiggling didn't work, so I opened the device up and found one of the wires was apparently loose inside. Jiggling it allowed me to keep the device working for a few more months. All together it lasted about eight months. I ended up buying a device that allows my iPod to connect directly to the car stereo (if you own a Mazda, check out sylfex.com.

You have to turn the volumn to maximum."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very poor product","review":"I have tried this product on 4 new model cars with better than average quality radios, tried many stations, new batteries and tried it with MP3 and CD players. In all cases I found the sound quality to be so bad I cannot use the product. The sound lacks top end (treble) signal, is distorted, sounds muddy and suffers from interference. It is extremely poor. I realise the sound will not be as good as the original but the amount of degradation is extreme.Finally, I used a Marantz Stereo Tuner as a sound source into the Tunecast. This tuner provides magnitudes better quality sound than a car stereo or MP3 player. Using this source, I could directly compare the same radio broadcast directly on my car radio and then the same station via the Tunecast by changing the radio station. Again the Tunecast quality was terrible compared to the car radio.This is a totally useless product; I can never use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately a worthless accessory","review":"I really looked forward to giving the Belkin transmitter a try. The concept is perfect - a totally portable music library accessible anywhere. I thought of all the places I could play my music, home stereo, both cars, workshop, office. My first try was with my home stereo. I could hear the music, but the quality was less than sub-par. The next day I hooked it into my car system, the sound (noise) was even worse than in the house. I have tried a variety of frequencies with no luck on any of them. Since I live in a fairly rural area of PA, I can't imagine it is a problem with competing signals. I am extremely disappointed in this product. Not having this option really limits the versitility of my Dell DJ30. Save your money, don't buy this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT IN STEREO","review":"That's right folks, take your great mp3 player and reduce the sound to mono with a nice hiss. Didn't they get rid of that in the 60's?. I had to open it up and add an antenna to even make it work at all, search \\"tuncast mod\\" for that. Very disappointed, go to cruchfield for a wired in solution or the transmitter from C Crane may be the only choice that works."},{"rating":"2","title":"First one broke, second one working","review":"I bought this of Amazon because the price was good and I needed an FM transmitter for my MP3 player and DiscMan. The first one I received just would not auto turn-on. It would turn on when I manually turned it on, and even the sound quality was acceptable. But then it would turn-off ever 60secs or so. I believe the problem was that it could not recognize the signal coming to it.So I exchanged this for another and that one works beautifully. It turns on Auto, turn-off Auto. I don't have to worry. Also the car adapter comes handy as it saves the battery power. The good thing is, there is hardly any distortion in signal between the switch from battery to car adapter.Pro's: Good quality, auto-on and off, well priced, not very bulky.Con's: The first piece didn't work (had to replace it), the cable is too short and makes the unit hang with the mp3 player.I would say its a good buy under $40. At the low price it would be difficult to find something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"okay while they are working","review":"I've owned 4 of these over the years and they all stopped working. From shorts in wiring to just not broadcasting for whatever reason I'm a little disappointed with these units. The one year warranty will most likely see you through but after that all bets are off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid at all costs.","review":"I used to own a similar version of this product which worked great, and was hassle free. I expected the same out of this, but was thoroughly disappointed. Regardless of where I am, the signal never comes in entirely clear, or to the point of not being annoying. If you don't want something you have to modify out of the box, this is most definitely not for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"Do not purchase this item. It is cheap and rarely works. It is horrible at night when more stations can come through your stereo. I live in the middle of the mountains, so i can't even imagine how bad this item is to use in the big city."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst product ever from Belkin","review":"I regretted for not checking out Amazon reviews first before I jumped on this bargain. It was on sale for a reason, because it is terrible. Will not work in a big city with lots of radio stations (even if you use their suggested frequencies). And then I found out the batteries kept draining for no reason. I threw it in the trash; worst investment ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Performs as expected","review":"After reading several reviews on many other models I pulled the trigger and bought this one. I'm pleased with it's performance as I understand how it performs; thru FM frequencies... With that said, added performance can be had by extending the length of the audio wire which is most likely attributed to it's dual function as an antennae. Also, careful selection of the FM frequency is just as important as the individual volume adjustments for each unit. Since I will be hiding this unit within my dash, I'll be cutting the power cord and hard wiring it into my vehicle, so battery life isn't a concern of mine. I'm using it to broadcast the audio from my Droid (GPS, internet, video playback and MP3 playback) that I've got a windshield mount for and it functions just fine for my needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't get the station needed","review":"Where I live (CT) the ideal station for a transmitter is 87.9, but this one only went down to 88.1! Why? I returned it, and am still searching for another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after four months","review":"This product worked all right for the first few months that I used it. I used it almost daily for my commute. The reception had a bit of static in some locations, but I wasn't expecting it to be perfect. However, it just stopped working suddenly after only about four months. Overall, it was not worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turns off and on randomly","review":"Absolutely terrible product. It started to randomly turn off and would not turn back on after only a month of having it. Big waste of money. Get a transmitter that connects to the bottom (dock connector) of your ipod instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh....","review":"If this is the only solution for listening to whatever it is you want in your car, go for it, but a better investment would be another car stereo with an auxillery port + cable. No static with that setup. I'm sure static is a problem with a lot of these transmitters but like I said, why bother with one of these when you get a much better solution like the afformentioned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inexpensive and the quality of the transmission reflects it","review":"I bought this item due to the cost; it's very inexpensive. This was the first time I had purchased an FM transmitter so I didn't know what to expect. The reception is terrible and the sound quality extremely poor. I returned it the next day in part because the batteries died within an hour. I would suggest spending the extra money and getting better sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worthy","review":"I bought this because it seemed a good price. The second the scratchy sound came through, I thought two things:1- my fathers advice- it's better to buy the best thing once, than the cheapest thing twice2- why would I have spent so much on my ipod and then so little on this?just return it and get the best thing you can afford."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not be a worse product.","review":"I returned this the day after I bought it. I know sound quality is never perfect with transmitters, but this was beyond terrible (and I've used them before, so I know how to pick a good station!). I couldn't even listen to it. It also just kept turning itself off after a few minutes!

I tried it in several different cars and it does the same thing in each. I'm going back to Belkin to get a replacement (only because they will not refund me).* The reception is average to bad at best. As several other people mention, the device will not go to the very low frequencies which would be nice. If you live near a major city, good luck finding a frequency that will work for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was horrible","review":"I bought this device with a little scepticism because I either saw a really good review or a really bad review. I tried it anyway, expecting maybe a little fuzziness in the reception or decreased volume. I did not expect, however, for the device to not work at all! I put batteries in it, it did not turn on, even if I manually turned it on. I then plugged it into the car cigarette lighter, it still did not turn on. I was very disappointed! I don't know if it was a bad pick or if they all just suck. Spend more money on a good one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to use. Doesn't over power competing stations.","review":"I purchase the Tunecast II because I thought it would be an upgrade to my irock 400FM. Guess again. It was very difficult to use and the signal strength wasn't as good. It didn't lock on in stereo if there was any signal at all on the underlying station and there was a lot of static. Also, there was a constant beeping tone that was transmitted along with the signal. Very annoying. It didn't save the last station setting and it took for ever to turn on or off automatically. I returned it. It wasn't worth the extra money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational and enjoyable.","review":"Defying Gravity is an honest and charming account of twelve (actually thirteen) women's belief in themselves at a time in one's life when many of us merely settle.

I read the second just to be sure the first wasn't the only badly written one in the book.Without being specific (because I would end up being sarcastic), I found the writing cliche-ridden, saccharine, and uninspired. I'm not implying that the women depicted in the book led uninspired lives. I'm saying that the writing is uninspired. There's nothing in it that cuts to the bone. Nothing is said in a fresh, intuitive way.This is the kind of stuff I used to read in the Ladies Section of the newspaper fifty years ago. It's writing with dimples, with mischievous eyes, wearing a pinafore.I'd rather scrub floors than read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cant HEar clearly","review":"I can't hear very clearly with this item.

I am looking for another stethoscope that is lighter and fits better. The sounds are good, but wearing it is aggravating! It makes my ears hurt just writing this review."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Get What You Pay For!","review":"Just being a Nursing Assistant, I don't really need the best of the best stethoscope. This one gets the job done. I can hear clearly, and I think it fits fine in my ears. Of course, it's no Littmann, but hey, you can't expect much for this price. I'll stick with this one until I get higher up in the medical field. I would recommend this one for anyone who is a student or new to the medical field."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this.","review":"This is one of the worst stethoscopes I have ever used. It is very poor quality, the joint at the head is loose so I constantly have to readjust it and the plastic smells terrible. I could put up with the smell but for the lack of working well.

I bought it in a bundled package for around $30.00. After starting into my first quarter and comparing with other stethoscopes I was very disappointed. I had purchased a cheap $10.00 stethoscope at Wal-mart just to practice with prior to buying the prestige and I could actually hear better with that. My second week into my second quarter the prestige ended up breaking. Aside, from that I was always having to check if all the pieces were screwed on tight otherwise they would just fall off. After comparing the prestige to other brands, I would definately go with the Littman. It's a little bit more money but definately a better quality and comes with a 2 year warranty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally - A compilation that includes Je T'Aime...Moi Non Plus","review":"If buy this for nothing else, Buy This for Je T'Aime...Moi Non Plus!

Perfect for the infamous making out sessions-from \\"Je T'Aime..Moi Non Plus\\" to \\"You Showed Me\\" (my favorites)to the cutesy love songs-\\"A Groovy Kind of Love\\".

Not only does it read like a thriller at times, it also has some of the most fabulous mountain photographs one can imagine. And what better mountain than the fascinating Eiger is there? Well, maybe the Matterhorn... but it does not hold such climbing fascination as the treacherous wall of stunning Eiger.

I think that music has taken a back seat to his now bergeoning movie directing career. The only redeeming tracks on this album are \\"American Witch\\" and \\"Let it all bleed out\\" which utilize pretty good riffs. The first hint that RZ was on a major downward spiral was when I heard horns playing on the Sinister Urge album...My advice would be for him to quit while he is well-behind...he will never recapture the magic of White Zombie. \\"La Sexorcisto\\" is probably my second favorite album of all time: there is not one weak track on that album.

This album properly reflects the nature of this album. Rob takes away the theatrical he's known for, the movie clips, the crazy circus feel, and creates a smarter and darker album. This was a risky move, and in many ways is more of a chance than most musicians take. Luckily, Rob, knowing his career in movies is going well, doesn't have to play by the rules to make something he's interested in. The trouble is that most music fans like the same thing, again and again, and want the old rob. Which is a shame as this album has a lot to like, but its something that requires a little understanding and a little more patience. What is ultimately found is an excellent album, with some great music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worthy of the Name 'Zombie'","review":"What a waste of money!

Don't get me wrong, it's quite enjoyable.. but nothing special. I had reservations before the release having read an old interview where Rob apparently says he doesn't give a s**t about music anymore, he's into making films now. Fair enough, he's been making music a long time now. Maybe it's understandable that he's tired of it and more interested in doing something new... Okay..so stick to the movies Rob. This album sounds tired and uninspired to me. Was it a contractual requirement ? I don't know. Even the artwork for the cd is lacking.. Remember how you could pour over a White Zombie / Rob Zombie cover/booklet for ages ? Maybe I have it all wrong.. I just don't feel any heart in this latest album.

So needless to say I had not heard the single \\"Foxy Foxy\\". I figured it's Rob Zombie, it's gonna rock. All I can say is that Rob fell flat off his educated horse on this one. The songs for the most part are not heavy. His vocals, while sounding more old school Zombie, still come across as weak to me. Not to mention he has John Lowery from Marilyn Manson fame on guitar, but even John's solo album \\"Vertigo\\" is overflowing with hard driving guitar / solo shredding on some of the tracks. So I will let the blame fall on Rob since the band is more than capable of rocking out. It is just and uneventful weak release that he should've just made another movie instead of recording. The lack of a Parental Advisory Sticker should've sent up a red flag to me but oh well.

This latest from Rob Zombie has been a long time coming. Although, I am not mad at him, because his movies are amazing. It just seems like we waited forever to get a new CD release out of him. But, it was well worth the wait.On Educated Horses Rob Zombie changes some things yet keeps some things the same and the finished product is outstanding. A lot less screaming (which in my opinion is for the better), he seems to have taken on more of the industrial sound over the metal. Don't get me wrong, the metal is still present, but the industrial is the more prodominant sound heard here. I like it a lot. I would have to say that I like this CD (as a whole) the best.There are so many good songs on here. There is not one that I skip over.

And, to be consequent, it's probably the best one since Down's second album (2002).The unique atmosphere and intensity Zombie and his band are creating in such a short running time (less than 40 minutes!)are awesome.The reduced sound - less electro stuff, less sampling, but more excellent guitar work instead - suits them well.I also think that \\"horses\\" is not only the best rock album within four years but the best Zombie-album since \\"Astro-Creep 2000\\" and the feeling of the new album is very much the same like the one of White Zombie's song \\"Blood, Milk and Sky\\" which is one of Zombie's best songs ever.One should also praise John5 for getting rid of the Marilyn MAnson-conventions! I never heard such a great guitar-play from him like his stuff on \\"Horses\\".Great stuff!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I mean seriously, what ever happened to good ol white zombie, Rob went soft, this is the worst thing I've heard since micheal jacksons thriller!"},{"rating":"1","title":"","review":"An interesting instrumental number opens this record, followed by the extremely catchy \\"American Witch\\", with its hard-pounding, heavy-driven tones and instant grabbing chorus. From there it goes downhill. Sure, Rob Zombie fans will probably like the appeal of tracks like \\"Foxy, Foxy\\" (which kind of sounds like the unlistenable \\"Living Dead Girl\\"), or the \\"party songs\\" found in the middle of this disc. A couple of tracks have a Southern feel to it, some tracks start in an interesting way until Zombie's voice kicks in. The last song \\"The Lords of Salem\\" at least has an interesting atmosphere, with a slow, punishing guitar riff but that's the best thing about it. Overall, this is a typical Rob Zombie record, which is already a hit among people. Its annoyance factor is really high; listening to it might actually decrease your IQ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy something else 'cause it's BORING","review":"Well, all I can say is that I am disappointed. And that I should listen before I buy next time. I heard there was a new Zombie lp out, saw it at the store and bought it. Brought it home, hoping to enjoy and man, all I can say is that it's BORING. This is a tired Rob Zombie, not one hit - but all miss. And y' know what? Don't believe the hype, believe me, if you want something fun to listen to - buy the new Alice Cooper and pass on the Zombie.

And that is really sad because I love Rob Zombie and his music."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the?","review":"This is an example of when good(or in this case Kick ass) artists go bad. This is like Zombie, only watered down. There isn't a track on here that starts your blood pumping and takes over your soul. I have been a fan since White Zombie, I have all CDs and movies, and been to see every concert that came my way. I sure hope this isn't the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Educated HorseCRAP!","review":"I've liked Rob Zombie from back in the day,and after reading some of the other reviews,I truly do NOT know what everyone is excited about with this CD.I guess Rob wanted to kill about 35minutes(total minutes of cd) and decided to record a CD real fast.This CD has nothing that as I am sitting here typing this out anything thing that stood out enough to give it a half way decent review.I wish we could leave the star rating system blank,cause this cd doesn't deserve the \\"1\\" that they made me post!Very dissapointing,as much talent as Rob has shown on the rest of his albums.I bought it,listened to it,sold it.Sorry Rob,please put a little more effort into your next album,PLEASE!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Guess Zombie Fans Want Hellbilly Deluxe Repeated Over and Over","review":"Didn't bother reading through the negative tripe littering this album here on the site, as I'm sure most of it is from non-fans who expect their bands to play music exactly how they want it. I found this CD to be another step forward in the evolution of Rob Zombie, as he's no longer just trying to bash our brains in with heavier-than-thou riffs (although Tracks 7 and 9 would beg to differ). The best songs are Track 10 - an ominous piano, slide guitar and sludgy guitars make this a lovely romp through the dirtiness of Zombie's mind - and Track 11, which is a cacophony of slow - but screeching - guitars, Zombie's chanting and an unpredictable ending that sounds like the band simply jammed it out and called it an album. Get this to hear how Rob has tinkered his sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Awful","review":"First of, John 5 is an amazing guitar player, but he is restrained to power chords on this release just like he was in Manson. But he can wail, just listen to his solo stuff. I can only assume that person didnt know much about his guitar style.That said, his inclusion doesnt really add up to much on Educated Horses. The whole thing falls dead on its feet in under 40 minutes. I understand change and new direction but this just seems so forced and fake. The riffs are the same ol' back forth notes, with a few pretentious acoustic numbers. The cool horror film samples would have helped this album some, but not much. Get everything he has done before this, but skip the new one cause it is average at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"WTF?!?!?!?!?!?!?","review":"DUDE?!?! What happened, when i heard about a new Zombie cd i was like O YEA! and then when i heard foxy foxy i was like WTF?? What happened to Hellbilly and Sinister kind of music?? I dont know what happened but, I'll admit theres a few decent songs like Let It All Bleed Out and The Scorpion Sleeps, but WTF?!?!?!?!?"},{"rating":"2","title":"back again","review":"Probably not Zombie's best work but it still has it's good points. Songs like Foxy Foxy, Let it all bleed out, Death of it all, and Ride are very good. All the other songs, although not liked quite as much by me, are still good. So overall, Zombie, well done. Another good album release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remember when Rob Zombie was cool?","review":"This is the one of the worst cds I have ever listened to. Not because the music is so wretched, but because Rob Zombie has so much more talent in him than what's shown on this album. If \\"Astro Creep: 2000\\" was a punch in the face, then \\"Hellbilly Deluxe\\" was like a slap in the face... \\"Educated Horses\\" would rank somewhere around pissing in the wind. This album is weak on all fronts. There is no hard rock song and nothing that true fans should be looking for. I'm a deep down fan of Rob Zombie, but he's seriously fallen off his bike musically. If you were hoping for something in the direction of his earlier work then you will be very upset with this album. If you're a poser who never liked White Zombie and thought that \\"The Sinister Urge\\" was a work of art, you will still probably not like this album all that much. If I ever met someone who thought this album was hardcore... I would punch them, slap them, and then piss on them."},{"rating":"1","title":"thanks, but no thanks","review":"don't buy this lukewarm turd of an album...find it for free and be disappointed (you will, guaranteed).. like i did.thank god for the internet,albums like educated horsesh it deserve to be illegally downloaded a million times over.zomby doesn't deserve to make one red cent off this crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"I cant believe this","review":"This cd is so bland and boring. What happened to the Rob Zombie who use to write songs like thunderkiss65 godslayer and every song on astrocreep 2000. I dont know who sold out worst metallica or rob zombie. Plus what is with all the fillers hes been putting on his album. I gave him a bit of mercy when sinister urge came out because that was a very rushed album. But theres no excuse for the poor music hes writing on this. What makes me angrier is that the album started off pretty good and heavy then foxy foxy came up and that song is ridiculously bad. Then the album just seems to go on and on. If you want a really good album I suggest every go out and buy the new Sepultura album it doesnt dissapoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"Fell way short of my expectations. Would not listen to any songs on this CD again. Love Zombie but this one has nothing special on it fairly bland. Would not purchase this CD and glad I didnt. And I'm not bias I'm a fan and haveb been since White Zombie. This CD just doesnt cut it."},{"rating":"2","title":"evolved as an artist","review":"This is the first album that actually shows the growth that rob zombie has made as an artist. Don't get me wrong, I love hellbilly deluxe and the sinister urge. I have practically wore them out from playing them so much. They do sound alike though. That isn't a bad thing if that's what was intended but now more than ever it was time for something a little different, not too different, but at least a little. Instead of going track by track i'll just tell you that the whole album is great with the possible exception of the song, 'ride.' It's a great song but at the same time I like the others on this album a little more. I can't wait to see him perform these songs live. I like the new lineup he has in his band too. They bring another kind of energy. I'm glad Blasko is still there because I look up to him as a bass player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happily Different","review":"Rob learned some skills from doing the original \\"House of a Thousand Corpses\\" soundtrack it seems like, and his new album proves it. While I love his two solo albums (but not quite as much as White Zombie's stuff..) he let me down when his second album was \\"Hellbilly Deluxe Part II\\"The music on Educated Horses is definitely a different listen and not for your angry mall-going angsty teen. Its a good romp through old rock and shlock horror that we've not seen since the early days (1980s) of White Zombie. Except this time Rob's vocals don't sound horrible.I highly recommend this to any Zombie fan. And while it still maintains its integrity as a Zombie album, I can also recommend this to a wider audience who just likes rock in general. You can call this Heavy Metal--Heavy like 80s hairspray.~xxyberprinzess"},{"rating":"1","title":"Retire PLEASE","review":"I used to like Rob Zombie, up until Hellbilly Delux. Everything after that is garbage. This album is no exception. Every song sounds the same and is very predictable. The lyrics are nonsensical, Educated Horses? He says that phrase in like 3 or 4 songs on this CD, I think he is running out of material and throwing crappy CD's together to scrap in some extra money. He needs to quit before everyone forgets he used to be talented. I don't recommend this CD to anyone except the die-hard stalker-type fans that will buy all of his CD's/merchandise regardless. 1 star, I went through this CD in less than 10 minutes, very disappointed, and will never put it back into a CD-player again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Verry good Disc","review":"This is what i expected. A verry good disc. All of the tracks is great well worth the money. If you like Rob then get it you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tommyco GEL Kneelers are not worth the money","review":"I paid $20.00 each for two of these mats. First of all, the mats did not arrive in the color that I ordered. Secondly, the logo on one of the mats was backwards. Thirdly, the gel, inside of the mat has already broken down, where I have applied pressure with my knees. You can see patterns of the breakdown in the form of air bubbles inside the mat. I would not recommend that anyone pay the price they are asking for these mats. The mat does not offer enough cushion, anyway, and it is heavy to lug around. Thumbs down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not buy this","review":"I would not buy this again. I stored this on a hook in a closet, which seemd like a reasonable thing to do. After about two weeks, the handle pulled apart. In addition the gel provides minimal cushioning. Had I realized there was a 30 day limit on returns, I would have sent it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk!","review":"My grandmothers had good meat grinders. I thought this would be comparable. What a mistake!! It's a piece of junk. The workmanship on the product is extremely poor! There are burrs on the metal that cut into the surface you mount the grinder to. The handle and the blades do not fit securely because the alignment is off. It's impossible to turn the handle (even when attempting to grind potatoes and onions). Not one piece of beef went through the grinder without plugging. And, any \\"juice\\" generated when attempting to grind, leaks out the back (again because of poor alignment and fit of the grinder components). It's true...they don't make things like the used to. Perhaps I can use this as a boat anchor. I'd look at garage or estate sales if you want an old fashioned heavy duty meat grinder!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Exactly What We Expected!!","review":"The grinder is very solid and seemed to be of decent quality. The cutting disks were poorly machined and holes were full of metal shavings. After several attempts at cleaning the holes, we still cannot use the smaller disk without fear of having metal splinters in our meat. It is effectively useless to us unless we opt to purchase new disks. Definitely not worth the money if this is the quality you'll receive."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE AND HAZARDOUS!","review":"The grinding rings had pieces of metal left after being drilled, and no matter how hard I tried to get rid of them - they were there. Of course I didn't use it to prepare food since all the metal remains would have ended in my meat. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value for money","review":"I bought this product for my wife after the much more expensive electric grinder did not work. It works fine, but gets clogged from time to time. She uses it for grinding chicken. The clogging may be due to the fact that chicken is a softer meat compared to beef. With beef, it might work better. We haven't tried sausage stuffing either. Remember to keep the parts rubbed in old after using to prevent rusting. If it was made out of stainless steel, it would have been better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Handle broke after 5 minutes of use","review":"I sincerely regret purchasing this grinder. Very poor craftsmanship - screws do not fit securely, and the handle broke apart after 5 minutes of use on soft chickpeas! We didn't even get a chance to use this on meat! If zero stars were an option, that's the rating I would have chosen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do yourself a favor and get a real grinder, not this junk","review":"If you want a meat grinder that DOESN'T grind jack, buy it.

The parts dont fit well which ends up making the meat more of a paste then a true ground product. Secondly the blades are just horrid and poorly machined.Everything has the potential for rust its nasty. I am going to keep this short and say buy a better grinder then this because it is unworthy of any attention or admiration. GARBAGE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"This product is really bad.. I don't care about the POOR quality of the material; I care about that no piece of meat went through the grinder. Dont waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I was very disappointed with this grinder. It came with two discs, both of which had holes that were way too big for fine grinding. When we went to clamp it to the kitchen counter, my husband was barely able to get it attached, as the opening on the grinder isn't big enough. Also, the grinder and all assorted pieces rusted almost immediately upon cleaning. I suppose you get what you pay for. I'll continue looking for a better one."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"The product is a real bad quality.It doesn't work well.When We tried to grind some meat We found some small metal pieces going out with the meat!!!IT'S DANGEROUS to use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair Product","review":"I used this product to grind an eye round roast.

Spanning locations from the gas fields of Oklahoma, the halls of Congress, a boardroom in Chicago, and the parking lot in front of Penn Square Bank, Zweig does an admirable job of weaving this saga through apt characterizations of the major players involved in this debacle. The effects of this bank's failure continue to be felt 20 years later and have shaped the banking industry as we know it today."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book should not be out of print!!!","review":"Even if the illustrations weren't so gloriously detailed and cozy, this book would win you over with its satisfying story. The patchwork cat is drawn so lovingly that she almost shimmers from the page. Her adventure, which is just scary enough, and her rescue, which will make everyone cheer, are appealingly told from a kitty point of view.

Each desk top speaker has a subwoofer built in which really improves the sound. I havent upgraded my sound card but you can expect stereo quality sound. DVD sounds good!

Can't beat it with a stick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value - highly recommended!","review":"This is a very sexy speaker system for your computer, and the quality and price are just right since most people don't use their computers as their main source of audio in the house. They're a no-brainer to set up. Save the big bucks for your video entertainment center's sound, and these will satisfy all of your hamsterdance and greeting card sound needs.

I would be forced to jiggle the connections on the subwoofer until the speakers worked - and then, the slightest movement of a speaker wire would cause the speakers to fade out again.At this point, I am unable to get power to the speaker system at all.

You COULD spend $300-400.00 on a Bose or equivilent or you could spend $80.00 and get superior, clean, deep sound from these. Ive had these speakers now for 9 years and NEVER had a problem with them. I've had them in a small home office (12'x12') and Ive had them at work with me (14'x25'). The bass is lost a little in the much larger office which is typical but you dont loose ANY of the over all sound quality. I would by 100 of these as gifts for friends and family (if thats what they really wanted). I'd give these 6 stars if it were possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speaker system uses innovative design to produce great sound","review":"Upon purchasing this system, I was a little skeptical of what it would sound like. I had never seen speakers with such a design and down-firing midranges. However, these speakers produce a great sound for the price. The bass is deep and clear, and the trebel, a bit tinny at times, is not overpowered by the lower ranges. The unique three way design of the satellite speakers provides great quality, and exceptional bass response for 3\\" speakers. Great deal, you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"great before bedtime","review":"During crazy times at work, I take a couple drops in a an ounce or two of water shortly before going to bed. It helps relax your mind when too much stuff is spinning around in your head and it's impossible to get to sleep. I read a review for another brand and someone was taking over 50 drops before bedtime. That seems a bit excessive to me, as I take 4-7 drops max.

Our problem is two fold. First is my daughter's only power outlet is flush on her dash and near her steering wheel and wiper control arm. It is a very tight fit. Make sure you have plenty of room if you chose this design. The BIG problem is she has an ipod video, the largest and heaviest ipod, and when she goes over any bumps the whole unit flies out of the socket!!! I contacted Griffin and they sent me a collar from a previous model and a new power arm and neither worked. I since know of a friend that has the same unit and has no problem.

It's a nice, stylish design. Very sturdy and it is positive (and necessary) to have the option to dial in any frequency in the given range. However, music sounds muffled and audiobooks sound like muffled 'from outer space'. Does not work for me, just does not cut it because of the poor sound quality. This product may still be better than others because of the quality look and features. In my opinion this transmitter like others would have to be much stronger. So if your only alternative to singing the songs yourself is a FM transmitter, then this appears to be a good choice - if you expect for $50 more than 1930 radio quality, FM transmitters are not your way to go currently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Device","review":"I was stoked to order this transmitter and was SO disappointed at the sound quality and static.

The Griffin Road Trip fits my needs as I quickly had the transmitter setup and working on frequency 96.9 - the middle of the dial! While I have yet to travel outside of Atlanta with it, I have been pleased with the simplicity of operation and the lack of static or interference from radio stations nearby on the dial. The one drawback, perhaps found on ALL FM tranmitters is the sound quality. While the sound quality suffers somewhat, it is certainly good enough to listen to for long trips around town (an hour or less)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Sound Quality","review":"I bought the Griffin RoadTrip about 4-5 months ago. I loved it as soon as I plugged it in. I live in Denver, and never had to switch frequencies to find a better sound. However, my Civic's dash comes out further from the cigarette lighter, and it was even awkward with the extension. I never quite got it postioned perfectly and found myself constantly messing with it to get it where I needed it. In the end, one of the screws fell out and the wires got severed. The Ipod seemed to be to heavy to be held in a good position and the thing would swing around whenever I went around a corner. At least I didn't pay full price for it :)As far as sound quality, it was excellent. But in my car it just didn't work out. I think I'll have to get a transmitter without a base."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware!!!","review":"I have tried both the Griffin Road Trip and the Belkin Tunebase with my iPod Classic, and found both products to be worthless. I don't live in a major metropolitan area, though it's still hard to find an empty space on the dial without a strong signal on either side of it. Nonetheless, trying every available spot on the dial resulted in occasional success, only to be compromised with unacceptable amounts of static a block away. I have an '03 VW Passat, and perhaps the radio is more shielded than others. Bottom line: it's an expensive gamble!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Decent for your Ipod & car","review":"I received a Transpod for Christmas and had a hard and frustrating time finding a station that would broadcast with minimal static and in the end, I could not find one with the Transpod. As an experiment, I tried my husband's Roadtrip and absolutely loved it. It was night and day compared to the two FM transmitters. That same day, I exchanged the Transpod for the Roadtrip and have loved it ever since!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Griffin Road Trip","review":"I bought this to replace one for my son-in-law (part of his first one was stolen with his iPod a year ago). Currently, our family boasts 4 iPods and 4 Road Trips. I use mine daily - next to an iPod-ready stereo (next car!)this is the best way to listen to my iPod while driving. There are some occasional issues with static occasionally, but overall I am very happy with the Road Trip I have purchased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Product","review":"Works well in areas with little radio stations.

I also had to turn the volume WAY up on the radio in order to even hear it. I tried in my Nissan Maxima, Dodge Ram, and home stereo and had the same problems in all cases. The sound was so bad that I couldn't stand to listen to it. Maybe all FM transmitters are this way. If that's the case then buy a wired hookup, or spend your money on a new car stereo that is iPod compatible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Transmitter","review":"This is a great FM transmitter although the only problem is if you drive a truck or SUV as I do, even with the extension, it's hard to find a good location for the iPod and even when you do, it's kinda hard to change songs, etc. while driving. Other than that, it does everything it's supposed to. It charges fast a efficient, transmits extremely clear on any open station, presets work kinda weird, but you shouldn't have to use them much so it shouldn't be a problem. Griffin made a great product and it is a steal for the price. It is so nice driving down the road listening to what I want to listen too, and not what is on the radio. It's amazing how nice it is, and how much more music you can listen too without commercials."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work in Los Angeles in my Camry","review":"While I read great reviews of this item and had great hopes, it didn't work in Los Angeles in our car. The company was great and retested and resent the item, but it was not able to hold the available frequencies in the area. I spoke to a guy at a car radio place and he said it wasn't the item, but the area and how crowded the airwaves were. Great company to work with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"I purchased the Griffen looking for something easy to use with an ipod touch in the car. It initially worked pretty well except for the fact that the unit would swing back and forth when the car was turning. Not wanting to have the ipod hit the console regularly, I used black eletrical tape to keep it stable(The black tape matched the unit). That worked and I was fairly happy for a while. The problem that has now developed is that the unit will lose the radio station after 2 minutes of playing. I thought that it might be the vibration of the car ( I drive a nice car with a smooth ride) but I can be standing still and it will lose the station. At this point the unit is worthless. I am going to try to get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Unless you live in the middle on a cornfield don't buy this or any other wireless FM transmitter for that matter, because they don't work. Even when the signal is supposedly clear you have to crank the volume up as loud as it will go and the sound quality is completely subpar. The cradle looks pretty good and assimilates with your dash great - too bad it doesn't work worth a damn. I care entirely too much about my music collection to tolerate such an inferior product. A $9.99 cassette adapter sounds 20x better than the best signal this supposedly top-of-the-line transmitter can give you in a midsize city."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"THis is so much better than the itrip.

Until I received an email to my personal email address from this seller talking about changing or removing my posting because it made them look bad! I was really upset by that. I think that they have done this with other customers. That is why they are rated so highly. I think that you (the buyers) should look at the negative comments before you purchase from this seller.

It worked exactly as advertised right out of the box. Just plugged it in and it worked flawlessly. The reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is the audio range. While I can easily hear it and most people wouldn't listen to music that loud, my car radio volume control was about 70% to really get the full experience. With CD or other FM, I keep it about 45-50%, so this curious drop in volume puzzles me... But, who am I kidding. For what I paid, this is an excellent investment.

I tried so many different fuzzy stations like it said in the directions and only one somewhat worked. The sound quality was poor at best and often I just found it too annoying to even bother listening.

I didnt do the research the wife did. I used it maybe 1 week. When I first used it I thought the device with the ipod plugged in was too bulky and blocked some of the heat/ac controls in my truck. There was alot of interference from engine noise (a high pitched whine that got worse with speed). In 1 weeks time I went thru 3 different 7.5 amp fuses in my Nissan Frontier. Just before the fuse would blow the engine noise interference got really bad. I emailed tech support with the problem but they never answered. Its ok because I had decided to return it at this point anyway. I seem to be in the minority with my experience but I was not happy with the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I've given this gadget enough trial and error and am still unhappy with its quality. I have tried it in suburbs, rural no man's land and urban centers (I travel everyday all over the map for work) and it constantly let's me down. I read before that it transmits at a quality somewhere between FM and AM broadcast quality . . . It's definitely closer to AM in my opinion. Bass is totally gargled sounding and high end produces a very annoying mid-range that kills the best of my rock ipod tunes and minimizes all the immensity of Thelonius Monk and other Jazz monsters . . . don't waste your money, unless you enjoy the archaic sound of AM broadcast, which isn't so bad if you're listening to NEWS, but music, uh-uh, this transmitter is abhorable. Maybe there's nothing better out there, it seems like a difficult technology to master, but I guess I'll have to spend some more money in hopes of finding a more dependable transmitter.

I sent this item back, thinking it was defective since mine worked so well. The replacement worked no better. I wrote to Griffin customer service asking them why this new transmitter, when put in my same old car, with my same old ipod, set to the same old station, would not work and they never got back to me. I would recommend saving your money. If you really want to listen to your ipod in your car, either get a new stereo that is mp3 ready, or get the ipod kit and have it hardwired to you current car stereo.

First of all I had to crank the volume almost all the way up in order to be able to listen to my IPOD and also the swivel is a pain in the butt every time I would take a curve it would disconnect itself turning on the radio which would almost make my ears bleed since I had to set up at such high volume. I do not recommend this product at all. I'm sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning! NOT for iPod Mini!","review":"Yes, yes, I know. Griffin has iPod Mini compatability all over their RoadTrip web page. But the sad fact is, when you recieve it you will NOT find an adapter for the iPod Mini in the box although there are adapters for other iPods. When you read the instruction book you will find that you must purchase an adapter from Apple Computer to make it work. Calling Apple, I find that they no longer sell the adapter. When I called Griffin I was surprised to find that if you have any other iPod than Mini and the adapter is not in the box, they will send you one. They recommended that I return the RoadTrip, which is what I did. Save yourself the aggrevation -- if you have an iPod Mini stay away from Griffin Technology."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect in almost every way","review":"This works just as it is supposed to and does it perfectly.

We are completely illiterate when it comes to ipods and such. This arrived and we were trying it out about 5 minutes after ripping open the packaging.

If we encountered any sort of road that wasn't completely smooth (eg, railroad tracks), it would disconnect. THEN to top it all of, it COMPLETELY quit working after about 13 months - just over the factory warrenty. nice.I'd never give it another try and never recommend it to anyone else.

My only complain is something that someone else has already mentioned,and it's that I have to take my iPod out of it's case every time I want to put it into the roadtrip. Other than that though I'm very happy. I live in San Diego and have driven all over the place, downtown and through rush hour traffic and I've never had any interference. Some people have talked about the extension arm swinging around, but as long as the screws are tightened it doesn't happen. Overall I'm very happy with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product Great sound","review":"This product has a great sound it is the best of the Ipod chargers/fm tuners that I have ever used. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that it is bulky and when I attach it to my car lighter it bumps into things including my leg when I'm driving. I also can't let other people change the songs on my Ipod because of this. I still think this is worth the money that you would pay to get one I would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the product except not compatible with covers","review":"I love the product. It works great in most areas and I travel around Los Angeles area (Orange County, Long Beach, Riverside County, etc) and I use 96.9 most of the time. Sometimes it gets fuzzy but very rarely and I just use 97.7 and it fixes. The only thing that I don't like about it is that it's not very compatible with cases or covers on your ipod. I actually modified my case and the holder so that it fits my ipod without taking off the case. I just warmed up the holder with a lighter until it got soft and then angled the sides out until it hardened. Seemed to work fine but then the bottom of the case I have had to be cut out to make a good connection. The biggest improvement they could do to it is to make the dock connector longer so that if you have a case with a large bottom the dock connector will still go into the ipod."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"Bought this item because it provided desired functionality of both a charger as well as transmitter for I-pod.

It just stops playing after 2-5 minutes.For the cost it's acceptable, but the performance is down right wretched.

My CD player broke in my car (stuck CDs), and I bought this as a cheaper alternative to replacing the car's system. However, the unit will not even power on in my 2003 Infiniti G35. Another reviewer briefly mentioned that it wouldn't work in his Infiniti either, but I had chalked it up to being a fluke. Not so. Not compatible at all.It did work in my husband's Ford Explorer, but the sound quality was so bad it is unusable, even on a clear radio frequency. I had expected it to be the same quality as listening to an FM radio, but it was far, far worse. Even with the volume cranked as high as it could go on both the radio and the iPod, I could just barely hear it, and it certainly wasn't enjoyable. Changing radio stations didn't work either.I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work","review":"After having my old $17.95 charger transmitter stolen from my car I replaced with this one.

I like the ability to select any frequency at will especially in radio congested areas (a very definite plus). The biggest drawback is the limited flexiblity for mounting the unit....great in my truck, awkward in my VW and impossible in my Camaro (unless I want to mount the Ipod upside down...the actual tx/charger only rotates 180 degrees at the end of the mount). I also have a Monster cable Tx/Charger which I find easier to use....especially with teenagers wanting to change/play their own music. The 4031-RDGC unit is great for a static mount (if it fits) since the unit is made to be a semi-permanent unit. It is reasonablity heavy and puts a lot of twisting torque on the cigarette lighter plug in which it is installed but so far so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the audiophile, but GREAT for me!","review":"I live in the suburbs of Chicago, and wasn't sure this would work at all for me, but I love it! I couldn't find a single radio frequency that was unused at all times -- but to my surprise, the Roadtrip was able to \\"trump\\" a weaker station and play my iPod music instead! It holds the iPod in the perfect position for driver access, and also keep it close to the radio, which is important for FM transmitters. True, it doesn't sound perfect -- it has some low-level static, but to me it sounds more or less like you're listening to the radio...which is good enough for me!

Told in alternating voices, the plot soars hilariously. Marta, a composer from Eastern Europe, and Gerald, a ghost-writing ex-pat from England, live in mutual disharmony, misdirection and misunderstanding on a Tuscan hilltop. It helps, but is not necessary, for the reader to be somewhat knowledgeable about Pier Paolo Pasolini, East European mafia, gourmet cooking. Add to this, Boy Bands, UFOs, ghostwritten \\"autobiographies,\\" Italian filmmaking. Not since \\"Somebody is Killing the Great Chefs of Europe\\" have there been recipes of such escalating ludicrousness. Hilarious! I'm gratified to learn that there are at least two books that follow this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cooking with Fernet Branca","review":"Some of the recipes were a bit disturbing but am hoping they were meant to be funny...and if so, they succeeded.

Perfect for a cozy afternoon on the sofa with a pot of tea (with a dollop of Fernet Branca)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"This is a very clever sendup of all those ghastly books about Finding Yourself In Tuscany, With Recipes. The author skewers the language of travel and of cookery ('boning a Jack Russell is a difficult job') while at the same time satirising a number of other targets including Eurotrash, obscure operas and the self-importance of the Brits abroad. Making this kind of satire work demands the precision of a Swiss watchmaker, and Hamilton-Paterson certainly has this kind of forensic skill. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe I paid money for this !","review":"Just like I said in my review title, I can't believe I paid money for this.

It split in two places during installation. The handle itself was either slightly warped, or just shaped improperly because although the head was aligned with the handle for two thirds of the length, the fawns foot at the end appears twisted out of alignment.On the other hand, the head is mounted now and it is at least as good as the average cheap hardware store axe."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Caribbean awaits for romance!","review":"What a WONDERFUL guide to the Caribbean!!

He cross-references scriptures throughout the text, so it is very easy to find his explanations on various troubling scriptures. A must for any bible student."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book dealing with a complex subject","review":"This book is, quite simply, the very best book I have ever read on the subject of the Godhead. Readers may not agree with Bernard on every single issue (and I don't), but he presents the Oneness argument in a clear, coherent manner while at the same time dealing with difficult Trinitarian proof texts. Most of the Trinitarian books I have read on the same subject completely ignore difficult Oneness passages, dismiss them without argument, or appeal to church history as the final authority. Bernard has a clear understanding of the struggles between divergent views on the Godhead in the early centuries of the church."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Light shining into the darkness...","review":"This book blessed me a great deal. It opened my eyes toward my paradigm of the Godhead and it confirmed to me the truth behind the scripture when Jesus says \\"no man knoweth who the Son is, but the Father; and who the Father is, but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him\\". It takes Divine revelation, and a willingness to lay aside the doctrines of men, to know God.Deu 6:4 Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is *ONE* LORD:Jesus (the Son of man and the Son of God) is the Only Begotten of the Father, yet the Holy Ghost is the one that overshadowed Mary and deposited the seed. Hence, the Holy Ghost IS the Father. Yet, in other scriptures, the Holy Ghost is descirbed as the Spirit of Christ. So... the Holy Ghost is the Father and also the Spirit of Christ... so Jesus is the Fullness of the Godhead. God fused with flesh. It's so simple."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oneness is the only biblical way !!!","review":"Oneness is the only Biblical way to describe God. All the other ways like the trinity are shooting in the dark. I have to admit that the trinity is one of the most impressive weapons used by the devil to send people to hell. There is no way you can make it to heaven believing in more than one God. Even satan knows there is only 1 God and he has seen him (James 2:19) \\"You believe that there is one God. You do well. Even the demons believe and tremble!\\". I know that if you believe in the trinity, you have not received the gift of the Holy Ghost meaning that you are lost and living without the living water flowing from you.

However, Abby Dobson does a great job starting things off with her heartfelt lyrics on '4 the love'. She obviously has seen a few things in the music industry that has compelled her to tell her side of the story & let everyone know that she does sing 4 the love. My other favorites include Ebony 'Can't Let Go'(the beat & hook are crazy on this one!), Chinahblac 'Bae-be'(performance reminds me of the ever-soulful Bilal & again the beat is great), Wynter 'Love Like This'(can't remember the last time I heard REAL r&b like this).

I was debating between this and the ADC 603 which I read had some issues with loudness, but I haven't had any volume problems with this stethoscope. In terms of construction, it's pretty light but I can't speak much to durability because I'm not using it all the time.

I've been using it in a quiet environment and my hearing is fine. I can't imagine using this in even a room with A/C running, let alone an ER, unless you are monitoring someone with a very loud heartbeat. My advice is to invest in a top-of-the line Littman, and save your money elsewhere where people's lives aren't at stake. Just put a luggage tag on your Littman so someone doesn't walk off with it!

Already middle-aged at the time, Wright is a good twenty years too old for the part and his skills as an actor fall dramatically short of his talents as a writer. Nonetheless, I can think of no other \\"serious\\" author who has appeared on-screen in a film version of one of his novels (Norman Mailer, of course, directed a movie based on his \\"Tough Guys Don't Dance\\"), and for that reason, this otherwise amateurish version of \\"Native Son\\" ranks as a curio.

Each cup can hook to 3 different levels of eyes. The hook and eye is hard to get undone with one hand, but with a little practice you can become a pro. Last time I nursed I used Wal-mart cheapies that had only one place to hook the cup (easy plastic clasp). Some days I had those cups so stretched.

Francesca Nicoli's voice is the main protagonist of the spiritual manifestation that is Ataraxia. Her voice, at times low and soothing, at times airy and etherial, tops the complex and fragile musical arrangements. Amazing acoustic guitar work and transparent, gusty keyborards intertwine with the chilling ambience, that comes straight from within the ancient walls of S.Ruffino, the sanctum of Ataraxia creativity. The lyrics are in Latin, Portugese, French and English. One curious aspect of Il Fantasma Dell'Opera is that it contains a cover of Kate Bush's \\"Wuthering Heights\\", turned into \\"La nuova Margherita\\" and sounding nothing like the original :) This is one of the rare albums that I can without hesitation call purely brilliant from begining to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is HORROR Metal","review":"Brillant black/horror metal with progressive and thrash influences. The compositions are complex and the guitar work is intense. Most of the songs have spooky effects and keyboard parts on top of the brutal guitar work. The lyrics of the album deal with horror themes of ghosts, monsters, vampires and pyschological horror. The most admirable thing about DM is that they create a great atmosphere of spookiness and horror without resorting to typical black metal themes of satanism. This is metal for Halloween!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the Reviews, Bought It and was Ripped Off Too!","review":"Upon receipt, I read the instructions and tried to sync the remote, which did sync up, but the display on the remote was blank?

I read the directions multiple times, new batteries etc. I had the same experience with tech support that the others did. They want me to package up the unit, mail it them and wait for them to return it or a new one. It would cost me almost as much as buying a competitor's unit which is my plan. I think they have a pretty marginal wireless system that sounds like it works occasionally and other times it does not.

Since I know no Italian, I had a hard time knowing which English word went with which Italian word (and since I was listening in my car, I couldn't check the book while driving to find out).

The 3 dances each start with a warm-up and end with a cool-down, are broken down into easy to follow segments, and are set to music that is actually dance-inspiring. The production quality is a little silly (or maybe just BASIC)--sort of Euro-90s but, that said, very fun.

Also, it lacks modem lights, which are useful for a quick check of whether or not it's on, and/or receiving/sending data.

Bump head works overall very well and when it doesn't, I'd surmise its all on me and not the machine. It's 108 F in Dallas this summer... I wasn't reading the directions thoroughly - I tried to get out, get it done, and get back inside.So overall - it works. It's reliable. It's an excellent value at $100.

I gotta say it was a pain in the butt to start and that to me is the most important thing when evaluating a power tool It got to the point where I dreaded this part of the job because nothing is more frustrating then pulling 8-10 times as you hope and pray that it will start. After a few seasons it broke and the repair was more than the unit was worth.Under advice of a co-worker I bit the bullet and got an Echo. Starts by the 3rd pull every time and I sure wish I wouild have done this the first time.

Starts right up each time - just be careful to follow instructions when starting hot, or let cool down first. A bit heavy for large yards - begins to wear on back after awhile. Also, the \\"U\\" handle begins to rotate with some attachments and can't seem to tighten enough. I bought attachments - edger, blower and they require more bending for a tall person like me.

It started very easily, but it wouldn't Idle (the router kept spinning at high speed). I fiddled with the screw that adjusts the carburator with out success, then I concluded that it's probably a compression problem. The starting cord hangs by about an inch, there's no tension!This is extremely frustating and customer service is not making it any easier. After some online searches, I discovered that the Poulan and Weed Eater brands are owned by the same company. I would advice everyone to instead buy a Hitachi or Black & Decker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk, absolute Junk!","review":"Today the entire item went in the trash after just two uses.

I called Amazon and they didnt care either. Only 30 day window from purchase to return. 2 of those weeks were delivery time. The idiot i talked to asked, why didnt you call us first when it came in broken? My reply, uhhh because on the box in bold letters it says to call a specific number if product is damaged, which i did.So, i am out $$$ and have no product either. It never got used a single minute.

It makes sense that this joint would snap since it is a real pressure point on the machine. I contacted the manufacturer who told me to use an authorized repair service, but the two in my area don't want to work on it because they don't believe it is a manufacturer problem and they say it will cost me more than I paid for the machine. Amazon won't let me return it. If I had it to do over again, I would never have bought this from Amazon because getting the warranty honored is turning into a real problem.

He was unable to start it either and determined it was unable to produce a spark. Now I am waiting till Monday for them to take it apart and diagnose the real problem. Amazon can't help till Monday since it is a gas product.

Kelley presents a rigorously logical exposition of the notion that war is relatively recent and a result of social organization. All societies kill, but only those that are segmented and labeled appear to engage in large scale planned violence. Sometimes his conclusions are counterintuitive - as when he argues that, rather than scarcity, it is abundance that leads to war: \\"...it is under the latter circumstances that that a society can afford to have enemies for neighbors.\\" While the prose can be somewhat dry at times, the reader is rewarded with numerous thought-provoking insights that are missing in watered down accounts of war intended for the general audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable prose","review":"This book is impossibly jargon-filled. The author writes as if addressing a tenure committee. Consider this sentence from the introduction: \\"Defining war and delineating the boundaries between war and other partially similar phenomena raise important issues with regard to both classifying hunter-gatherer societies in terms of the presence and frequency of warfare and ascertaining the point in a sequence of conflictual events at which war has begun.\\" After reading this sentence how many readers will proceed any further?

The second one (The Saga of the People of Eyri), however, is a bit of a disappointment.

The \\"girls\\" in the video are all excellent dancers, and their moves are very interesting to watch, but the instructional part is very poor. They barely show you the steps, and when they do, it's very fast and hard to follow. Some of the steps are not demonstrated at all, and it's just assumed that you know how to do them. This is definately not a beginner video, and even if you are a good dancer, you need to have a good handle on hip-hop moves in order to follow along. You do get a good cardiovascular workout though, once/if you finally get the hang of it. I had to do a lot of rewinding, and watching the steps over and over, just to figure out what they were doing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too hard","review":"I have a few of the other Esquire-Dance Away videos and I really enjoy working out to them. The dance steps are simple and follow an aerobic workout style, the instructions are easy, and they are fun to do. This video is nothing like those others. It's very hard to follow. The dance steps are ridiculously hard and only for devoted dance students. Sure it gets your heart pumping, but not if you can't follow anything they are doing. You just stand there looking dumb founded watching the girls on TV dance. Don't waste your money unless you are an expert dancer and already know how to do the moves they claim to teach you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product - old version","review":"I work for the developers of this program.

This is an album where the Corrs made no compromises on their music. There truly is no bad song on this CD and all the songs are new original material. The best and most powerful song is the instrumental \\"Silver Strand\\". Sharon sounds like a virtuoso in this song because her violin playing is incredible! \\"Goodbye\\" is also good.\\"Summer Sunshine\\" is a good song but sounds too pop-ish like \\"Breathless\\".I rate this album an A++++++++ and is worth every cent. Enjoy and savior this album because I hear rumors that this is going to be the Corrs' last album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Cd!","review":"This group had never been interested until listens Summer Sunshine and I like a lot although this cd doesn't go it is necessary to be the but successful of this group I find it super, and it stops my it is very good its second it Single angel this good one but not as much as summer sunshine, to those that they like the music Of The Corrs they have to have this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this cd!","review":"I still listen to this cd on a regular basis.

Signal is clipped everytime sound gets louder. The Corrs is great and I love it like other reviews but I can't stand this sound quality (digital signal processing)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid effort","review":"The Corrs are back, and it's a joy to hear the dozen new songs they present on Borrowed Heaven. Highlights include Angel and Goodbye, the contrasting but touching tributes to their mother, Jean, written by Andrea and Sharon Corr respectively. The title track is infused with the African beats of Ladysmith Black Mambaso, which lends a lovely dimension to the Corrs sound. The beautiful Time Enough For Tears, from the film \\"In America\\", is a worthy addition, albeit a little different from the rest of the album. Even If is impossibly catchy, but overshadows the similar-sounding Confidence For Quiet - indeed, there seems to be a standard song structure formula across a few songs, but other than that, the album as a whole is more than pleasant and showcases some fine work by the band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Commercialism just does not work for this Band","review":"As a huge Corrs fan I hate to give them this rating. I hate to say this to a band that I saw live 2 days in a row and paid for front seat tickets, because I love the music they play. I am not much a pop fan (I listen to classical, opera and rock music) but the Corrs grabbed my undivided attention for some time. I was very excited for a new album. But when this album came out it was a very big disappointment. Imagine Sharon is very much under used in this album. This album does not have any stand out picks. I know they are a big Fleetwood Mac fan but why follow them!!! I am not giving up on this group. I will still watch their concert if they decided to come back to my country. But I really hope and pray the next album would be in the league of their former albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"They tried to change...for worst....","review":"Poor album, probably, the worst, they hired a new producer and tried to change their sound to techno and it sounds awful, if you are a fan of the band, just buy the single \\"Summer Sunshine\\", the rest of the CD is not worth"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Offering from A Good Band","review":"This really is a mixed lot with some catchy tunes and some haunting melodies and also some fillers. Like 'In Blue' before it, this does not reach the standards of 'Talk On Corners' or 'VH1 Live in Dublin'. Standout tracks are 'Summer Sunshine', 'Long Night' and the Gavin Friday/Bono collaboration 'Time Enough For Tears'.Other than that, the rest are B-Sides at best...Disappointing"},{"rating":"1","title":"Corrs have become porr","review":"I used to love the Corrs, until I bought Borrowed Heaven. They've become too Americanized for this Ami's taste. I liked their Irish roots, which seemed to fall off for this album. They were my favorite band, but now they're not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful and very disappointing","review":"I have bought and enjoyed all of The Corr's other albums and was excited to finally get a new one from them. I was sadly disappointed. I don't think it sounds like their \\"signature sound\\". There are no Irish sounds and all of the songs sound the same. To me, it sounded very \\"80's, techno\\". I hope their next one will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Formulaic","review":"By about 6 songs in, I realized this CD was going in one ear & out the other, with no real standout track. It is overproduced, full of the modern day effects (electronic drum fills, vocal telephone effects, etc.). The beats to many of the songs are very much the same, each song breaks into the big sing-a-long chorus, but that's just it...they all get to sound the same. Somewhat of a moody feel to it, suspecting they're trying to fit into the current radio play style...and it doesn't work, at least for me to be an enjoyable, or memorable CD. I was disappointed - this band caught my ear by being SO different, and now this release is surprisingly predictable. There's so much studio editing here that I doubt if much of the finished product is \\"the actual band\\", or resembles what the band can do live."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge step down from \\"In Blue\\"","review":"The Corrs are one of the few bands that emerged in the 90s and made beautiful and enduring music. They got consistently better since their first album in the mid 90s and hit their musical peak with \\"In Blue\\" - a classic album. Unfortunately, the band has been unable to recreate the magic of \\"In Blue\\" on \\"Borrowed heaven\\". Andrea Corrs's sweet and infectious voice is not enough to save this album either. While \\"Borrowed Heaven\\" and \\"Long night\\" are songs that belong to the same league as previous hit singles such as \\"Breathless\\", \\"Dreams\\" and \\"What can I do\\", the rest of the album while being very listenable does not have any standout tracks. I am still confident that their next studio effort will be significantly better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still great, but not different","review":"I've enjoyed them for years, but after a somewhat long break, I expected (or hoped for) some evolution to their sound. This album comes across as conformance to their formula of songs: Pop - ready for radio, followed by deep and reflective, finally, the obligatory \\"irish\\" instrumental. Andrea's voice is featured well and it appears to have matured. The show supporting the album in Dublin was wonderful and well produced. Interestingly, Caroline's drumming is less featured now that the band is supported by a \\"real\\" drummer. Sharon's violin and vocal performance was the highlight for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't just listen to it once...","review":"At first glance, I was more than slightly disappointed in this album, but upon revisiting their previous albums (and concerts) including Live at Lansdowne Road and their Best of Videos, I found a remix of Summer Sunshine on ITunes, and decided to give it another listen... I was in utter shock that I didn't like it the first time I listened to it. This album is another excellent masterpiece by the Phenom I call the great and awesome Corrs. I'd recommend it to any fan and to anyone wanting to indulge in a far-from new but excellent band. I'd put this album up there with my favorites of all time.Long story short, don't just listen to it once, listen to it, then listen to the other works of the Corrs, then listen to it again. If you don't like it even then, I'd be shocked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another GREAT album.","review":"This album was well worth the wait. I didn't like all of the songs right away because, as usual, their style is a little ahead of their time. But, the more I listened the more and more I liked all of the songs. Andrea's vocal range is absolutely AMAZING, and she shows it off well on this album! Her voice is right up there with the late Karen Carpenter's. Of course, Sharon can out-sing 99% of any other singers out there as well. Many of the songs are upbeat, perfect for driving along the beach. All of the songs have deep meanings, which is hard to find in music these days. It's the perfect album to play if you are having company over or a dinner party. Their music appeals to such a broad audience, it's perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Borrowed Heaven\\" is heaven...","review":"I've been a fan of the Corrs for about 5 years now and I have most of their albums (except for the \\"best of\\" and \\"live from) and I'm happy to say that their latest album is a welcome addition because it's mature, it's sweet, and it has great lyrics. I would give this album 5 stars but I can't because my favorite album of all time is \\"Talk on Corners\\" which I still consider the best album of the Corrs. I'm really hypnotized by the melody of \\"Time Enough for Tears\\" while \\"Even If\\" and \\"Hideaway\\" are very catchy. \\"Summer sunshine\\" is also one of the great songs in the album. If you're a fan of the Corrs, I recommend getting this album and if you never heard about the Corrs before then I suggest buy this album together with \\"Talk on Corners\\" and I'll assure you that you'll like what you hear."},{"rating":"2","title":"The new kind of music","review":"I'm a big Corrs'fan and I've bought all the CDs. When I listened Borrowed Heaven my first impression was it: this is new, sounds different. Although the best CD of their career is Forgiven Not Forgotten, Borrowed Heaven offers a new kind of music, different of their classic celtic sounds.If you're a big fan buy it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoped for a little better","review":"I'm a big Corrs fan and have been since their beginning. I expected more, and had hoped for more from the Corrs with this release. However, after several listens this CD begins to grow on you. \\"Long Night\\", \\"Humdrum\\", \\"Even If\\" and \\"Silver Strand\\" are the strongest tracks and \\"Summer Sunshine\\" is a good pop single. The weakest track, in my opinion is \\"Angel\\". For some reason I find it difficult to listen to. I have the Australian pressing which includes the bonus track \\"Miracle\\". It's a shame they left it off the U.S. release because it is one of the better songs on the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelente Producto","review":"Excelente Disco, el mejor de The Corrs, según mi opinión.

It's a good pop album, but not a masterpiece for the Corrs. WHERE'S THE BODHRAN AND THE PENNYWHISTLE? Where are the defining Irishness that put the Corrs ahead of other pop acts? I have to say, the EPK acoustic versions of these same songs made a better lasting impression on me than the actual album... at best, this is a continuation of \\"In Blue\\", and 1 of those is enough!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the Corrs I'm used to, but still good","review":"I've been a huge Corrs fan ever since their debut album and I have ALL of their recordings and DVDs. I was a little puzzled or confused after spinning this CD for the first time. The songs seemed pretty plain and something was missing. It was that \\"Corrs signature sound\\" that was missing. I can tell in all their other recordings that it IS the Corrs. With this one, I would have trouble. It's still a good album, very relaxing and mellow, but that spark is not present.My favorite song on the CD is \\"Time Enough For Tears\\", oddly enough, the Corrs did not write that song. It has a powerful melody line and excellent vocals that make you think. Summer Sunshine and Angel were the next runners-up. Humdrum was clever and Silver Strand was the only tangible piece of \\"Corrs signature sound\\".There is enough good material to warrant four stars, but the cherry on top is missing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but ....","review":"I so wanted to love this album as much as the Ultimate Coors, but I was a little disappointed :-("},{"rating":"2","title":"Like an old friend...","review":"you always know what you're going to get with the Corrs: music you can tap your toes to, and a sound that is equally unmistakable and satisfying.The downside, as many point out, is that all their music sounds the same. I disagree with that assertion; their music shares similarities to be certain, but the production is really the consistent thing here. A close listener will note the songs all have their own character and nuances, even if the production keeps the overall sounds consistent.This CD is a solid effort, with \\"Summer Sunshine\\" being the most catchy, upbeat, and clever song I've heard in a while. The other tracks are mint Corrs, and as I implied earlier, this is a good thing.If you like the Corrs, you'll like this CD. If you don't, you won't. It's that simple."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavenly Transfixes You","review":"After having their hit \`Breathless' became a number one single selling in 15 countries four years ago, the siblings are back with a more religious and mature album, slightly back to their original Irish root which was absent in the previous album \`In Blue'. The album title song \`Borrowed Heaven' is a collaborative project with South African's Ladysmith Mambazo, attempts touching our spiritual side with its simple but thoughtful lyrics, reminding our innocent presence in the world and its materials that are yet to be given back to God. The optimistic 'Angel' and 'Goodbye', a blend of rock and classical violin, canvas their emotions toward their late mother who died of cancer. With the majority of equally phenomenal tracks, the foursome's unwise choice came after deciding the blandly misleading and shallow \`Summer Sunshine' as their first single and an opener of \`Borrowed Heaven'."},{"rating":"2","title":"A PHENOMINAL cd from a PHENOMINAL band!","review":"\\"Borrowed Heaven\\" is nothing short of a masterpiece. The listener experiences a world of emotions when hearing this cd-we hear about the pain of break-ups (Long Night), about over coming these break-ups (Baby Be Brave), being an independant woman who is proud to be this way (Humdrum & Confidence for Quiet), and a beautiful song about the loss of the band's mother-written with positivity and hope that she is in a better place (Angel), then the philisophical \\"Borrowed Heaven,\\" perhaps the best track on the album-if one must be chosen! The instrumental \\"Silver Strand\\" is absolutely amazing and uplifting. Every song on this album is amazing and should be heard by everyone, even the ones not mentioned. This album is nothing short of \\"Borrowed Heaven.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"They've Done it Again!","review":"At first you might have second thoughts and even convince yourself that you don't like this album, but after a few times through you won't ever take it out! The Corrs have somehow blended the traditional sounding \\"Forgiven Not Forgotten,\\" with the more contemporary, poppy sounding \\"In Blue.\\" You get it all here, and over time it only gets better. You might even be ashamed of yourself for ever giving it a second thought. This band has proved time and time again that they have what it takes to be world renowned, and with a new addition like \\"Borrowed Heaven,\\" they aren't going anywhere but up.This album is a must have for any Corrs fan, and might be just the thing to take in a few new fans looking for some beautiful, original music. You might even enjoy it on a higher level if you understand the meaning behind some of the songs.You'll be glad you didn't overlook this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album but not their usual stuff..","review":"I became a Corrs fan when IN BLUE came out and since have all their albums. I enjoy this new release from the Corrs. It steers somewhat away from the heavy Celtic flavored music that they became well known for but at the same time, I didn't feel that the songs were overproduced with the new pop edge at all. This album will most likely disappoint those who mainly favor the full Celtic instrumental sounds of the Corrs but for those who do enjoy pop influenced music will also enjoy this album and I think the Corrs will win many more fans from this release, atleast from the USA. I really don't think it's any more pop-based than IN BLUE is but that's my take."},{"rating":"1","title":"HP 2500...has many problems","review":"The HP 2500, while a good printer, is in the midst of several quality control problems.

They were pretty good. Whenever I make gluten free pancakes, you have to make them your own way. Some mixes, I have to add more liquid than it calls for.

Now don't get me wrong it probably has the most realistic story but aside from all that, wheres the fun? The multiplayer is just insanely horrible and the graphics are somewhat decent. It's not that I suck at the game and I'm raging, in fact I've gone quite far it's just too boring..."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, not sure what the hype was all about","review":"Way too much hype for this game. Its alright but nothing spectacular. Missions are pretty much the same throughout and gets boring after awhile. Way too many simulated violence and swearing. Not needed at all for a good game. If they ever come out with a GTA5 I'm pretty sure I won't get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"ehhh...","review":"It's alright. The graphics are amazing, but the gameplay gets old really fast. I just don't find it as enjoyable as the previous installments in this franchise. The camera angles while driving are terrible also. Plus it is difficult to turn your character around. he moves real slow and is very uncoordinated."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect game","review":"forget about all the previous versions, because this version is just perfect. the grafix is good, but the gameplay and the storyline is very nice to the extent that you might stop playing it just because you don't want to finish the game as fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ummm..no","review":"This is the fourth installment in the GTA series, yet there are still basic rudiments of gameplay that are still broken and in desparate need of fixing. The controls make doing even the most simplistic tasks complex, and I don't like how you are forced into doing tasks at the beginning of the game before the world completely opens up to you.I also don't like how you can't customize your character's gender or looks in anyway. Yes the story is dependent on being Nico Belic but the story could just as easily have been constructed to give the player more freedom in who they want to be.The best thing about GTA IV is the graphics and I can't see anything else about this game that deserves a perfect rating but it has received several perfect reviews as evidenced by metacritic. Color me perplexed because I just don't get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop reading reviews. Buy immediately.","review":"This game has many problems including occasional problems with AI (especially friendly characters), some less-than-pristine graphics and cut scene motion capture, among other things.However, all of those things are completely irrelevant. The problems the game does have is like having a small smudge on a diamond the size of your head. I've been an avid gamer, playing games since the 80s. GTA IV is without a doubt, the most polished, fun, and nearly flawless in all aspects. It's not my favorite game I've played, but it comes close.It is pointless to go into specifics because you shouldn't have read past the title of my review."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst games","review":"I have been a long time GTA player. I have been playing GTA from the time the very 1st one came out. I liked all the other GTA games but GTA 4 is just beyond bad. The only reason why anyone says this game is good is because they are a GTA fan boy. This game is so boring. I almost feel asleep playing this game. I have tried to play it a few times but every time I tried to play it it felt more like torcher than having fun. If you want a good GTA game get 3 and pass on this crap or even better buy a good game like Saints Row 1, 2, and 3. Forget about this game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Game","review":"This game is pretty good and the price is a bargain. You can do alot more in this gta game than the previous gta games like watch tv and drive drunk. i gave it 4 stars because the driving is kinda awkward and it takes some getting use to."},{"rating":"2","title":"GTA IV","review":"This game is one of the best GTA. The graphics are nice and look really good when in HD. The missions are fun and for the most part give you a challenge. The story lines are better then the previous GTA and even have some twists in them. All in all this game is great and I would recommended it if you like GTA."},{"rating":"2","title":"overrated","review":"the game is a little repetitive at times. i thought the story line in san andreas was bad, now i think san andreas could have won an oscar after playing through some of gta 4. however, for thirty dollar's it's a great deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game","review":"There's not much I can say that hasn't been said better already but I'll give a quick list of my top good and bad points about the game.Good:-Graphics-Pure fun factor-Tons of missions-MultilayerBad:-Repetition-Some unfair missions-In game friend system is annoying/pointlessOverall worth playing. Not the best game ever but definitely great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleh","review":"Way Way too many bugs, had 3 save files crash corrupting all my data. Missions are horrible long always ending in a huge chase through the city, and if you fail you start over at the very beginning. Graphics are great, but this is not rockstars best effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"This Game is by far not what I expected. After waiting in a long line and 80 bucks it was a waste of my time and money!!! While the graphics are a step above the gameplay has somewhat diminished. The missions are boring and this game brings me no exitement. San Andreas and Vice city were good from start to finish and afterwards. But this I don't know what this is... It freezes quite often too while playing in multiplayer mode I know the problem has been acknowledged but O well it is what it is. Now I know the next series to come out I will buy off of amazon at a discounted rate!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok","review":"My cousin plays it when he comes over but he is the only one that plays it. I don't usually play it because it seems like rubbish but he seems to like it, he is the only one that plays it....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good overall game.","review":"GTA 4 is a good game. you can do many things that are just so much fun to just screw around. there are darts bars etc. if your not willing to play missions you can do pretty much whatever you want. this game is a must have game for xbox 360 owners if you want to just drive around and have fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Game Constantly Freezes","review":"This would be an otherwise 5 star game if it weren't for the fact the game constantly freezes (purchased the special edition for the XBOX 360). I can go through no more than 1 mission before the game freezes. Then after the first freeze, it freezes constantly every 10-15 minutes. It's not the XBOX because all other games work fine.I have contacted Rockstar and they have not replied and there is no patch to download. Buy the game, but play it immediately so you can test it and exchange if you have to within 30 days. I waited a while to start playing it because I was already playing 2 other games and now it's too late to exchange.If you can find a game that doesn't freeze, you will have at least a 4 star experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but over-rated","review":"It's a fun game to play if you liked the GTA series before, but it was over-hyped with all those perfect reviews when it is clearly not perfect. The most apparent flaw is the cover system, it works sometimes but other times it won't work the way you want it to and you might end up getting killed. Sometimes the game wouldn't even let me fire my gun while in cover which is very frustrating. If you played Gears of War you'll be disappointed with the cover system. There is about 30-40 hrs of game play. I wouldn't recommend this game to buy, but it's worth a rental."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't hold up to previous titles.","review":"Although this game is very well made it doesn't capture the amazement of previous grand theft auto titles. That being said its still a very well made game that everyone should play at least once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as expected, but good","review":"Ive read amazing reviews from this game and videos showing that this game has great game play and amazing physics. When i got it i passed the whole story ( which was repetitive and not very creative) So its over, then what?Nothing. The game has few fun stuff to do and then it starts getting boring. The 3 star of fun are because of the physics engine, it is fun how the physics work for the game but it starts getting annoying. So if youre going to buy this game, be warned if it doesn't satisfy you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grand theft auto IV","review":"The Game was in excellent condition an Ship Very quickly We're Very Satisfied. Thank you"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as 3","review":"Graphics are good, but everything else in this is less than GTA 3.The music, the story and all the elements except graphics were better in 3.Would I buy it, yeah. Get the special edition with the lock box. Quality stuff there. It is a fun game. I guess it would be asking too much to top GTA 3. Lets hope GTA V is the one. Online turf wars defending your patch with your buddies and more life like on line interaction.... Give it to us!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GTA4 Rules!!!!","review":"I will keep my comments simple. For those who have never played the GTA series, this latest installment will blow you away!! I suggest playing Vice City and San Andreas first, then play GTA4 on an LCD TV last. I have a personal connection with GTA 4 because I'm originally from the Astoria section of Queens, NY. Let me tell ya, the attention to detail is amazing compared to NYC. The First thing I did before I started any missions or mayhem, was simply steal a convertible, and drive around the city. Times Square is awesome at night, and if you drive down by the Hudson river at dawn, you can catch a glimpse of the sun rising over Liberty City AKA Manhattan!! Unlike the cartoon-ish look of Vice City, which I enjoyed also, GTA4 has a very gritty, urban look which gives the player a sense of realism. I wish the twin towers were still standing, that would have been an awesome sight as well. Rockstar, has once again, out done themselves!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome! ---Can't Wait for GTA V---","review":"Really awesome game. Would recommend it to anybody that has a XBOX or PS3. Amazing online with my friends playing team death match. Anyways, I can't wait for GTA V next spring 2013."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Game","review":"I've always been a fan of the GTA series, and this one does not disappoint. I like all of the features included within the game and the graphics are amazing! Definitely a fun game for everyone, just wish there was a multiplayer without using XBox live."},{"rating":"2","title":"liss espsito","review":"I am very satisfied and happy because the product arrived just in time, attention and speed was great, I highly recommend them. thanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"fun for ever","review":"I have been playing this game for a long time and i am only 10% done with the story mode. THe best thing about this game is that you dont ever need to do the story mode, you can just do your own thing. Also the cheats on this game are very helpful and make the game more fun. with cheats you can spawn nice vehicals get rid of your Wanted Lever or add to it. Its lots of fun"},{"rating":"2","title":"Papi vamos a hacer maldades!!!!!!","review":"Justo como dice la cancion en la estacion San Juan Sounds!!!!!!Defintivamente el juego del 2008.

I played it for several hours and lost interest. It has got to be about the worst story ever written for a video game. The characters are all shallow and not at all interesting. The gameplay is slow and repetitive, to the point where you feel like you are doing the same boring tasks again and again... oh wait, you are. The driving portion of the game becomes annoying very quickly... there is no realism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Constantly Freezes!","review":"I would've given GTA 4 Four stars but every single time i play it it freezes, and a lot of ppl have had this problem. The things i don't like about the game is: No character costumization, no safehouses to buy, and missions are very repetitive and similar to previous GTA games."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miss the cheats - too much freezing","review":"No more flying cars, parachutes, or jet packs to get around with. I used to spend hours just screwing around in San Andreas and was hoping for the same in Liberty City. Nothing left to do here but play the missions, which get boring after a while. In addition, freezing issues made it difficult to even play the game. It doesn't just freeze, it locks up the whole console so you have to reboot."},{"rating":"2","title":"My review","review":"Well the game is very fun and all but I don't recommend these people I got my game And it didnt work so but GTA somewhere else"},{"rating":"1","title":"Corrupted download","review":"got it for five dollars on digital download, which is nice. However, and this is a major however, twice I've downloaded it and not been able to install it. will keep trying as the pc mods for these games usually make it worthwhile.update: download did work, just be sure to get the 1.7 patch as this cleans up a fair amount of the problems many people have reported when playing this on windows 7. In adddition, I suggest you lower the vehicle density to below 30 as you can cause a traffic jam at higher levels."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice","review":"it got here way faster then expected it suks tho because i have not gotten my xbox360 i ordered i played at friends house game is awesome its brand new still in wrapper and everything will buy from them again"},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of all the GTA'S this! is the worst one.","review":"Let me point out the flaws.1. you can't buy safe houses. which I thought was very lame.2. cell phone goes off. during a shoot out?3. who says \\"ting\\" and \\"bloodclot\\" NO RASTA SPEAKS LIKE THAT!4. the part I hate the most is lack of cheats! you can't have a million bucks if you wanted too.5. the cars and bikes flip if ou make sharp turns and barley any stores to shop for cloths. you can't find any good looking cloths.6. no hair cuts or tats.7/ NO HOT COFFEE SCENE?pass this game!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what i expected","review":"to be honest i didn't like it at all very short not the best graphics over all pretty bummed out not worth the price and not worth the trade in price either"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow thought because of the reviews it was amazing","review":"At first i thought the game was fun. it had some stuff from San Andreas like girl friends and other stuff. I am a girl and love GTA series so i thought that it was going to be amazing. First when i got it i was like its awesome and i wanted to play it because of coures its something new and i am a gamer. However the missions are way too easy. I don't need to heal. I have Mafia 2 and its so much better than this. The cars are not that great and the missions suck. I can't stand the main characters voice either. That being said since i am a gamer i will have to finish this sorry excuse for a game but my overall experience with it is its a bad buy. If you are interested in it rent first."},{"rating":"1","title":"bitterly disappointing.","review":"Bitterly disappointed with this game i'm afraid. i used to play san andreas for literally years but after two days i'm sick of this game. it's just frustrating to play. the handling both when in cars and on foot is shocking, not realistic it's so bad you just get pissed off whenever you have to drive anywhere, and you have to drive everywhere. it feels slow, takes ages to set off again after stoping, when you do eventually stop, you have to use the handbrake to get around any corner and once you do it just sends the car into a slow slide that kills your speed and usually just slowly bounces you off a wall.the plot is monotonous and they've tried to cram the script with crappy jokes which would have a 8 year old giggling.pretty gutted the only fun thing on this game is the crashes and it takes so long to actually get your car up to speed it's not even worth it. pretty graphics - balls game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst entry into the series.","review":"There was so much hype surrounding this game, and it just fell sooooo short from expectations.Lets start with the main problems,All the customization options from GTA: San Andreas are gone. No more bike ridding, bodybuilding, haircuts, tattoos, stamina, underwater swimming, Airplanes, parachuting,Car customizing.Its essentially GTA 3 with better graphics and storyThe developers said this stuff \\"wasnt possible\\" in this game. Which is complete bull, if its was possible in the previous game then why is not possible in this game with superior console power?Onto the Online play.Its So-So, nothing exciting. Some interesting gametypes, but the aiming system is pretty bad. People dont die if you plow into them with a car at full speed.All enemies,friendlies,and weapons show up on radar making it pretty cluttered.More of a rental if you ask me."},{"rating":"2","title":"grand theft greatness","review":"grand theft has came along way from when they first got started from the one on ps1 now this one when your going to fast in a car and hit somethin you fly out its realistic"},{"rating":"2","title":"Need I say more","review":"Lets be real people its GTA IV, should there be a negative review.

I have been playing GTA since the very first game and nearly every game has been better than I could have imagined, however, GTA San Andreas came out and that was just a ghetto clone of GTA Vice City. And now we have the same game as San Andreas with better graphics and cut scenes but with the same horrible camera angles and camera control. So thank you Rockstar Games for making an awesome game with a piece of junk camera that makes the game worthless. I think I will just wait for the game to come out for on PC, if it ever does, so i can play GTA the way it was meant to be played, with a mouse and keyboard."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Waste","review":"I love the GTA4 concept, but this game is a waste of time (and money). You spend all your time driving across town from mission to mission, rather than shooting bad guys and driving fast. And if you screw it up, then you get to drive across town to try again. Then, the game wants you to go on dates with various women you meet. (WTF!!??!) If I wanted to go on a date, I would do that instead of playing video games. Want more health? Well, you have to waste you time and find a diner for that. Most games just restore your health after a certain amount of time and get you back in the action. The controls are counter-intuitive and impossible to use as well. Basically, it looks like the designers spent their time pandering to the interests of oversexed 14-year-old boys and not enough time just creating a good game."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst game ever","review":"this was the worst game i have ever played all the missions are the same the reload on the gun is fake the ia is the worst i have ever seen the way you die is fake (you hit a car gently and you fly 20feet in the air)you hit cars gently with your car and you fly out and die DO NOT BUY THIS GAME BUY A GOREAT GAME LIKE BIA HH OR COD WAW!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Grand theft auto 4 I never got it","review":"I never recieved my Grand Theft auto game and am not pleased on how you guys never returned my message so I won't be going through you anymore and will tell others about this experience"},{"rating":"1","title":"This sux","review":"This person never sent me the game.

Defiantly worth the wait, GTA IV brings a brand new story to the next-gen consoles. But I don't think that it's worth all of the hype. It could have been more customizable, with better weapons (I mean come on, they've basically have been the same since Vice), and better vehicles (A car being the coolest vehicle in the game? Pretty sad). It is a good game, but it feels like I've played it already compared to Vice City and San Andreas.Personally, I think they should have just used the same engine as San Andreas (with all of the customizable glory) and added new features that were in this game.But there is one good thing out of this GTA game, MULTIPLAYER!

At the end of the game all you can do is steal cars, or be a vigilante cop.5) Driving physics are a little stupid. Feels like all car tires are greased with lard. Doing good drifts is almost impossible. Some cars turn like pigs.6) The camera angles are stupid.

Whether your favorite games are racing, shooting, or action, Rockstar makes some of the best. Personally, I'm a huge fan of sandbox games, so this falls in perfectly. I've been a fan of the Grand Theft Auto for a long time, and this one is the best one yet. For many fans of the GTA series, San Andreas is still the best of the series. Many disliked the 'heavier' controls; they desired a more arcade feel to the game like the earlier ones. Yes, arcade is good and the controls seem sluggish in the beginning, but that's the joy of the new generation of games. This game could not feel 'arcadey' while having the (somewhat) realistic physics and human reactions (via the Euphoria engine) like it does. This game has been out for over two years and I still play it.

This is because they did not include the two best aspects from San Andreas apart from the missions, since there is no sense of one becoming powerful by conquering territories, and even though money has no function in this game, they should have had the businesses that were so fun in San Andreas. Also, what happened to the beautiful houses of Vice City, come on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Size is important","review":"I've purchased three pair of Crocs over the past few years, and I love them. They are undoubtedly the best sandal out there. Comfort is incomparable. Usually though, when you choose size 10, for example, what you receive is a generic size 10/11/12, and they are so marked. This time however, size 10 meant size 10, which is slightly short...even compared to all my shoes and other sandals, which are size 10. This made this pair of Crocs uncomfortable. Because they are kind of expensive, adding a return shipping fee makes the cost very much on the high side. So, I decided to keep them. Maybe they'll stretch....if not, I'll give them away. Bottom line; disappointed. Be sure you contact the seller to confirm the \\"actual\\" size before you buy.SEE THEM HERE:http://www.amazon.com/crocs-10042M-Crete-Flip-Flop/dp/B001KZHRPA/ref=pd_sim_dbs_shoe_10"},{"rating":"1","title":"squeeky crocs","review":"They are crocs and they are nice - but they make alot of noice when you walk = the straps squeak"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good speakers that lasted me way longer than I planned for","review":"The sound quality on these is very good.

Almost 100% like what I imagined with little embellishment. At 2.5 hours, however, it is kind of slow-paced and put me to sleep in various places. So far I watched The Sleeping Murder. The actual novel was extremely scary, not because of anything that happens but because of the implied consequences. Here, they try to create that atmosphere with Hitchcockian music and a lot of screaming, but it doesn't come out right. Somehow doesn't seem anyone has figured out the best way to get Miss Marple on the screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Dixie Dregs Masterpiece!","review":"This is another great inspiring album. It embodies the unmatched guitar playing of Steve Morse, and the unbelievable playing of the rest of the band(Dave LaRue, Rod Morgenstein, Jerry Goodman, and T Lavitz). The open track \\"Aftershock\\" is an awesome display of their developing styles. \\"Sleaveless in Seatle\\", and \\"Yeolde\\" are heart felt tunes that could result in uncontrollable tear shedding. (which has caught me a few times). The album also includes an instrumental cover of the song \\"Shapes of Things.\\" Lastly, personally my favorite song off the album is \\"Ionized\\" which is totally mind-blowing because of the quick arpeggiated lines and the harmonized violin and guitar passages. Truely astonishing! I've been a big fan of Steve Morse and Dixie Dregs for quite some time now, and the first time I saw them live they played material from this album and it was truely remarkable."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS A GOOD BOOK","review":"AS THE VICE PRESIDENT OF A SMALL/MIDDLE SIZE DISTRIBUTOR, WE FOUND THIS BOOK GAVE US SOME GOOD IDEAS ON MEASUREMENT.

This puts the ultimate success (or failure) on those key decision makers who initially set the goals for the organization.If you (or the company you work for) are looking for a clear way to communicate action to the \\"troops\\" who get the job done, this may be your book.

I plugged two power cords in and it didn't keep the time, but I was too busy to take the time to return it, so I am out the money. I took the batteries out and threw it in a drawer.

Perhaps I have a faulty one, but I am in the process of trying to return it for a refund. Have not used it- put it right back in the box... The chimes are not at all gentle nor melodic.... sounds more like somebody strumming across metal bars with a wand and then of course they hit the plastic of the console adding a CLANK CLANK CLANK CLANK. Save your money- buy a more expensive model that does what it is supposed to. Hopefully I can return this if not I will give it as a present to my 6 yr old nephew.

It's hard to imagine how such a simple-appearing clock could be so complicated! The instructions are senseless and bizarre, so I had to figure things out on my own. It isn't obvious which \\"mode\\" the clock is in, and you have to switch back and forth between several buttons to set it, so setting it becomes a task. Also you have to be careful to set the clock on \\"auto\\" rather than \\"alarm\\" using a small switch so it's hard to discern.There's no power cord, although you can pay another $10 for one if you want to add that to your investment. The batteries run down quickly and then - no alarm goes off! Very disappointing. I am returning this asap."},{"rating":"2","title":"FINE FOR $10-15 (if you can read and follow instructions)","review":"When I bought this about 3-4 years ago I turned the chimes off the first day (What an annoying sound!)and just used it as a bedside clock. Fine. But when I changed the batteries and had no instructions, all I could do was make it show a variety of flashing numbers with no meaning. I must have spent hours---and asked various younger family members to spend hours---trying to set this silly clock. I am someone who freaks out at a contantly blinking 12:00 on a VCR and obviously was annoyed by a piece of meaningless metal that flashed numbers and clattered!I couldn't Google for a copy of the operating instructions because it had no visible names anywhere on it; only \\"Made in China\\" and patent numbers.

It's very cheaply made and the controls are cumbersome. Most people don't need an alarm clock that tells them the day of the week, the month or the year. The first time I set the alarm it didn't go off. The chimes sound nice but they hit a flimsy little metal bar that gives you a tapping sound along with the chimes.

I have had it in my car for a while now and played it over and over again. I liked it the first time I heard it and as it grows on me even more, I find something new and different each time I listen. It reminds me a bit of the whole Cracker scene. The only thing I am sad about is that this is the only CD Sordid Humor ever released and besides some producing and behind the scenes work, they have relatively disappeared. Well worth a listen, at any rate."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Spiky Great Robot","review":"Another Revoltech anime super figure.

Yes at first they were amazing. Despite cheap construction and parts that aren't interchangeble I wasn't phased. I have three dogs and more cats than I can count. I am also a germaphobe and can't stand animal hair. I've gone through every vacuum out there and will pay anything for one that will do the job. Well, I hate to be the bearer of bad news but these are no different than any other. Dysons DO lose suction. Despite regular maintainence and filter cleanings they ALL stopped working- EVEN THE ONE IN MY CABIN THAT GETS PRACTICALLY NO USE!!! I just replaced them with a $65 Bissell Powerforce from Walmart and my carpets haven't looked this clean in years! Yes, it will eventually lose suction too but I'll be out $65 not $500!

Any moisture, even just regular humidity that gets sucked into the cyclone ruins it and it has to be replaced.

Dyson is not worth the money if you have to replace parts and the machine become unusable after only a year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Durable","review":"I personally don't own a Dyson but I have two close friends that have owned this particular model and they are both very dissatisfied with it. Both have ceased to function and had to be repaired within a years time.Beware of those reviews that are based on only a few months use. You'll find that as you do your research that after some time on these machines people tend to not like them for a number of reasons. For what you pay for these they shouldn't be breaking as much as they are. I wouldn't perceive this vacuum to be a good value and certainly wouldn't purchase one based on what my friends went through with theirs."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING: DYSONS ARE JUNK!","review":"Do not purchase these products. I spent nearly $600 on this vacuum and it has been nothing but problems. Eventually, I tossed it.

I called Dyson and all information was documented, I was asked about the canister being full, I told the truth, and was told that my warranty doesn't cover the sweeper because I didn't follow the instruction and that the info. was documented in case I contacted Dyson in the future. I can't believe that a sweeper that costs this amount can be so easily destroyed without any bells or whistles alerting to the canister being full.

This baby does the job!PROS: great suction, long cord, easy to empty, automatic height adjustment with bare floor setting, very quiet for a vacuum.CONS: detachable wand is a little awkward for me to use.Overall, I was skeptical about investing this much for a vacuum, but very glad that I did. I hope I am this happy a year from now."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!!!!!! POORLY BUILT!!!","review":"My husband and I own a vet hospital, so suffice it to say we have LOTS of animals in our house (10). We specifically purchased this machine because we have heard so many great reviews on how well this thing sucks.Well, suck it does, in more ways than one!! Yes - it has lots of power & will pull your wisdom teeth out of your head if you get it too close. HOWEVER: we had this for LESS THAN ONE WEEK and used it ONCE and it broke. Got something stuck in the hose, and when I went to empty it the part that I had to take off to empty it wouldn't go back on. I'm usually very good at mechanical things, and played around with it. After 45 minutes of trying to put it back together, one of the pieces then came off and wouldn't go back on. I called Dyson, and they told me that since it was MY fault it broke they wouldn't honor the warranty. It's that kind of customer service that will make sure I NEVER buy a Dyson product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ITEM!","review":"I thought I would like the Dyson but after 4 years let me tell you how my vacuum lasted or didn't last.After 2 years I was carrying the vacuum up by the handle and it broke. Cutting my hand with sharp pieces of plastic. To replace the piece it cost me $125.00. Sorry not under warranty!Everytime I vacuum which is once a week, my vacuum looses pieces of plastic.Now at almost 4 years old, I can not use it anymore.The hose is connected thru the handle that you push. After years of removing the handle to clean stairs and dust on walls the 2 little pieces of cheap plastic that keeps the handle to the vacuum have worn out and you cannot push the vacuum since the hndle does not stay in place.I have recently bought a Hoover with a cyclone. The removable hose is connected to the side which makes it easier to clean corners and edges where carpet meets the wall.

It is amazing how much stuff it pulls out of carpets. We have three dogs, two cats, and three children living at home. I don't know what I did before this vaccuum. I could love it if Dyson came out with a broom vaccuum though. It is bulky and I'd love to have something smaller to do those quick touch ups. The hair accumulates on my ceramic and hardwood floors and I hate to lug out the Dyson for those small jobs. I have no complaints though because it does such an excellent job. It was worth every penny. If you have allergies, this is the vaccuum for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dyson \\"Animal\\" WORTH the $$","review":"We just moved into a brand new home. We have pets and we bought a less expensive Hoover at Target. Used it twice before the belt was caught with new carpet fibers and pet hair. Twice....holy cow $$ down the drain. Went to Bed Bath & Beyond and the clerk was very accurate and knowledgeable in his description and use of the Dyson. I learned before in vacuum's that you get what you pay for and I didn't head my own lesson. Don't get a cheap one, it's not worth it. If you want a clean house get the Dyson, spend the money once. It really does work. Unbelievable what came up on a brand new carpet that the pets didn't even lay on or walk on in a two foot section.

EVERYTHING seems to get stuck in this thing. I am frequently taking it apart troubleshooting and wasting time I do not have. I have never written a review about anything before but have become so frustrated with this product that I felt I had to share in the hopes of saving another person from wasting valuable time and money on this product.PS My husband has a different Dyson model at his business and that one is just as dissapointing so I know it's not just a matter of a faulty vaccuum cleaner.

(Oh goody....I can clean house now lol). I put it together marvelling at its weight and wondering if I'd be comfortable with such a heavy machine.It is very easy to maneuver and is virtually self-propelled. I cleaned the living room and dining room carpets. Then I used the hand tools to clean where my regal cat likes to nap on the couch and the decorative pillows. The machine is incredibly powerful! What was pulled out of the carpets and off of the couch (which had been cleaned merely a day before) made me a little queezy. I have a whole new perspective on what a quality vacuum cleaner can do.Now if it holds up and lasts through its warranty, I will be 100% pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Believe the hype","review":"While looking for a vacuum, I saw the significant price difference between Dyson and the other brands.

And not only the floors but the furniture also. If you want your carpets and furniture dust free - get this beast. I have horrible allergies and would alway sneeze when cleaning but not with this vacuum. I can't say enough about it!It is also so easy to clean, no more silly bags!

It gets our carpets super clean and we love the fact that you can see what you're getting in the canister. It just emptys right into the trash can without touching it or making a mess. The only downfall is the instructions....they are limited and it's hard to tell what a couple of things do but there is an 800 number with helpful people to answer our questions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price","review":"I replaced a $50 bagless bissell with the Dyson and perhaps had my expectations a little too high. It is definitely a huge improvement over the Bissell (what wouldn't be?), but I still see dog hair left behind. Dyson makes a big deal about its engineering, but it seems like it was designed by an engineer who didn't actually vacuum a house. It is too bulky to get the space beneath the cabinets to the toeboard - you need to stop, get out the wand, and add an attachment. To stretch the long tube for the wand, you have to be very careful or the whole vacuum will fall over. The wand itself is too long, making it difficult to use for things like vacuuming the furniture. I bought a refurbished model and paid about 1/2 the retail price. I would say it is just worth what I paid for it. If I were buying again, I would buy something else. I'm just very glad I didn't pay full retail price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best vacuum ever made!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I have gone through several vacuums (oreck, miele, kenmore) with no luck. I have always heard good things about the dyson but was always put off by the cost. When I had finally had it with my last vacuum I broke down and bought the dyson dc17. OMG! I tried it after I had already vacuumed with my old vacuum and I couldn't believe how much my old vacuum left on the floor. I would definately recommend this vacuum to everyone. It works wonders with pet hair. It is expensive but it is definatly worth it, and when u compare with how many vacuums you can go through trying to find a good one it is so worth every penny. Buy this vacuum and you will not regret it one bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous for Lab Owners","review":"We purchased a Dyson in February. It has been a wonderful piece of equipment.

LOVE IT!!! Worth every dime."},{"rating":"2","title":"sweet","review":"If there were six stars I would give this seven stars. I had another dyson which I liked well enough but if you have cats and/or dogs this is the sweeper. My carpets have never looked better and believe me, with 3 cats and a doberman it's a challenge. The downside would be the attachments - kind of a pain to use but a small price to pay for the rest of the sweeper. I guess some would say it's heavy or cumbersome but not a big deal for me. I hope it lasts because at this price I do expect longevity."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE if you have new carpet","review":"I recently upgraded my DC14 to a DC17 and had very terrible experience with it. The DC14 was a wonderful vacuum and worked flawlessly for the pass 2-3 years.

Took the fur from three cats off carpets and didn't break a sweat. After Miele, Hoover, Eureka and Oreck, I think I have found a great vacuum!

The wand is a bit too long for cleaning chair upholstery, but overall this is the best machine I have had in years!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Gift I could ever get","review":"My girlfriend and I both got iPod's and acccessories this holiday season.. we then proceeded to return them so we could get this Dyson instead. It was the best decision we made! The DC17 picked up more dirt and cat hair from our carpets than we ever thought was down there.. and we just vacuumed with our Bissell last week! It is truly a wonder.. finally I can make lines in the carpet when vacuuming, and I love the hose that detaches and you can get in the small crevaces and beneath the couch with the low-reach tool. If you're looking for a vacuum regardless if you have pets or not, this is the one. Well worth the investment!! Especially with their new 5-yr warranty. Go Dyson!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing vacuum!","review":"The Dyson DC17 Animal picked up more dust, pet hair and whatever than I care to disclose publicly on a single oriental carpet in my home! The colors of the carpet were unrecognizable and my wife vacuums regularly with an Oreck XL! The first time we used this Dyson we literally filled the clear Dyson bin three times! (We never imagined we were living in such filth!) We have one eight year old English Springer Spaniel and she sheds. This machine is made to order for her! The Oreck which cost about the same as the Dyson DC17 Animal is going to vacuum heaven.This vacuum is a little pricey but if it holds up, it will be worth it. We also bought a handheld Dyson which is a little bulky but works well for small jobs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent vacuum.","review":"I have had my DC17 Animal since 2006, and it is still working like a champ. Had to replace the belt recently, but that was my fault as I got something caught up in the beater bar. Found a replacement belt and the vacuum is working like new.Pros:No bag to change.Does a tremendous job of removing dirt, debris and pet hair from carpet and furniture.Still functions just as well today as it did brand new.Comes with several attachments.Cons:Is a bit heavy and can be hard to maneuver into/out of tight spots.The hose on the attachment wand is still very inflexible and is heavy.Emptying the canister can be messy if you do not have any means to empty outside.Hard floor surface attachment did not function well for me. Would not remain adjusted.I use my DC17 to vacuum carpets, vinyl and hardwood floors. I use the attachment to clean hard to reach places on the floor, walls and ceilings.When it comes time to replace this vacuum, I will definitely look to get another Dyson model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what is supposed to do VACUUM!","review":"I will recommend this vacuum, worth the price. Being a previous owner of a Hoover, this surpass it by leaps. With hoover I have to pass a speck of dirt 2 to 3 times but with Dyson, dirt is all gone in 1 pass.Cons: poor instruction manual, you have to figure out where goes what and what that attachment is made for.- you have to take off all the power cord if you want to use the attachement"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"I've had mine since January 2007 and love it's performance. I had a dirt devil before this and what I did when I first got it home was vacuum an area in my living room then vacuumed over it with the Dyson. Oh wow! The Dyson picked up so much stuff even though I just vacuumed!So why only 4 stars? Well two reasons.1. I hate the hose. Instead of a \\"hose\\" you have a handle attached to the hose which makes cleaning up stairs or hand held jobs awkward.2. Don't use this if you have shag carpet. I have a red,throw rug that is shag and it nearly ate it. I noticed it when the canister started becoming red that it was eating my carpet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Customer Service","review":"The vacuum itself works very well. It sucks up everything. I do wish the attachments would stay attached to the vacuum when they are not in use.When you need service, watch out! Customer service is very unprofessional, unless their job is to say \\"no.\\" I had a problem with the motor and the vacuum was very loud. After spending several hours and putting about 100 miles on my car, I finally was sent to a UPS store that would send it back as customer service described. When it came back from the Dyson service center damaged, I had to pay to fix the damage, as it wasn't a \\"manufacturing defect.\\" I had to hang up on the supervisor because I couldn't handle being interrupted and yelled at any longer. I don't think she let me finish a complete sentence in the 10 minutes I was on the phone with her. Very frustrating.If you buy it, hope it doesn't break."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible to remove clogs","review":"We have two cats and we clean the filter on a regular basis, but it still gets clogged in the main filter area where the holes are small and impossible to get cleaned. We had to take it in several times due to clogging, motor, and other issues. It was not worth the hundreds of dollars we spent. It worked great for 6 months then had nothing but cloggnig problems.

Do not buy this poorly designed vacuum."},{"rating":"1","title":"For $550, I expect a little better quality","review":"I have cats, two domestic longhairs and a Siamese. When they started shedding the the spring of last year ( 2007) I bought my \\"animal\\" It does have great suction IF you keep the filter clean. After you empty the dust container be sure the rubber collar makes a good seal with the bottom of the dust container, otherwise the filter will clog in only a few minutes. The cyclones do fill with dust and there isn't an easy way to clean them. I have soaked it in water and Is seems to have done some good, but it would be nice if you could disassemble it for cleaning.The beater brush housing is cheap plastic and broke when I hit the fringe on my oriental rug. Should the belt ever break it will be near impossible to replace. The little channel the belt runs in stays full of dust.It will go under only the highest furniture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Machine","review":"I researched what vacuum to get after our Hoover WindTunnel bagless died after six months, and I was curious about Dyson vacuums. I love this vacuum, and if my son will ever let me use it I would love it more!We have two long hair cats and this DC17 Animal is amazing with how it picks up the hair and doesn't lock up the roller on the vacuum. With the Windtunnel I would have to use scissors on the roller, so that the roller would work again.It is a expensive vacuum, but I am hoping it was a good investment. I am a bit worried about repair and parts issues mentioned by other Dyson owners, but so far this machine works perfectly, it's quiet and easy to use.I believe I picked a winner, and if that proves not to be true I will let you know.Cat in AK"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sure beats our Hoover Allergy Vacuum","review":"This is the best vacuum we have owned. We have a pug that sheds alot, a whole lot. Our last vacuum always left dog hair all over the place and the DC17 picked it up. When I got the Dyson home I took it out of the box and put the handle on. I wanted to fire it up but first I put a clean bag in my old vacuum and vacuumed the house. I then vacuumed the house with the Dyson. You really can fill the canister 2-3 times vacuuming the house the first time. I was amazing the amount of hair and dust that it picked up and it never clogged. We live in the desert so sand and dust is always a problem in our house. I know that the price is a little steep but it is well worth it.

After months of begging (suprisingly, his begging - not mine), my husband bought a Dyson. With price match we got it for $[...], including tax! Needless to say, we were thrilled not only with the price, but the performance. After running the DC17 over our carpets, we saw the the \\"nasty\\" aspect of the carpet equated to only 2 or three spots that were easily removed with spot cleaner.Result? Our carpet looks brand new!We have to give a quick WARNING, though - when the handle is down to vacuum, the hard plastic corner on the right side just above the wheel is pretty sharp. My husband took the dyson on it's first joyride around the living room and the corner cut the side of my leather recliner wide open. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"A BIG disappointment","review":"I have owned the DC07 model for a number of years and would rate it 5 stars plus.

On the DC07 it is very easy to remove parts to see where the problem was. Not true of this model. It is difficult or even impossible to remove most things. There is also at least one part that has a very cheap piece of plastic in it that breaks easily. I would be very reluctant to purchase another Dyson."},{"rating":"2","title":"what a deal","review":"Dyson DC-17 AnimalMy wife asked if it was okay for her to spend the money on this. Me being somewhat laid back and both of working in the medical field (she is an R.N and I am a Surgical tech).I told her if she thought we could afford it,(we are buying a new house) it was ok with me.She was very excited about getting it and tracked it's movement until it got here.She is in love with this thing, I can not believe how it cleans.I only thought the carpet was clean. we have a cat and after cleaning the carpet with the old one, man what a difference, I think this thing would suck the carpet off the floor along with all the dirt.it was money well spent.if you are thinking about buying one spend the money you will not regret it.she researches everything she wants to buy and thinks about it a lot before she will spend the money.what a great wife I have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT Waste Your Money! Akward, heavy, disastrous design.","review":"After 1.5 years, the design has not changed.The hose completely came apart. It weighs a TON and has the DUMBEST, lousiest design ever.1. cannot vacuum under furniture because it is so large,2. the hardwood floor attachment pushes stuff around because the bristles block the suction3. the hose and entire design are incredibly akward --to get suction the hose will bend and block air, thus you must often hold + unbend the hose while simultaneously vacuuming.4. you will injure your back with the weight of this beast.5. save your money, it breaks just like the cheaper brands, and the hose replacement is well over $1006. So after 1.5 years of a broken back, you can have my piece of dirt for free and I'm going to buy a new cannister every year as they break all the time anyhow."},{"rating":"1","title":"great vacuum, stinky smell","review":"I have had the vacuum for 17 months. The suction and cleaning ability are still fantastic. It brings up much more than you can see. The downfall, which is tremendous, is that it after over a year of use the unit smells. Every time I now use the vacuum the exhaust smells and I have to air out the room. I have cleaned the unit often and still cannot get the smell out. I would recommend another unit because of the stench."},{"rating":"1","title":"short and sweet","review":"i will make this short and sweet. i was a diehard fan of the dyson and purchased one within 6 months of them coming out several years ago. i just bought a hoover carpet steamvac to get some of the stains out. what did i end up sucking up? white styrofoam beads from almost a year ago that i assumed my dyson had picked up on the many times i have used it. apparently not, so now i am searching for a new vacuum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clean the house, then clean the vacuum!","review":"I received this vacuum as a gift. It worked great for about 5 months, then it started making a terrible noise. I called Dyson and they just sent me a new belt. They were of no help!!! The problem is a design flaw. When the vacuum gets hair and dirt around the gear it causes the clutch to engage (ie., making the terrible noise). I then have to spend an hour cleaning the gear!! This is not want I would expect from very pricey vacuum. I have an active house with a husband, a dog, and a child, that is why this model was given to us. I do not feel it is a quality product. I will never own another Dyson again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed with my Dyson","review":"This very expensive vacuum doesn't pick up noticably more than my old bagless vacuum. I can't vacuum throw rugs or certain areas of my large area rugs without it making a very loud rubbing/grinding sound. I think it has to do with the automatic carpet height adjustment. I can't use it on half the rugs in my house because of this. The wand is a joke. Due to the angle you have to hold the wand to vacuum the floor, the hose kinks and it picks up nothing. Not worth the money at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Every Penny","review":"This vacuum is amazing!

Then the little cyclone things at the top became plugged and the unit would not produce suction. There is NO EASY way to break the canister down to clean it and Dyson would like you to take it to a certified repair shop to have it cleaned. through much internet research I found vague instructions on how to disassemble the canister, cleaned it and it worked OK. Now less than a year after buying it, the motor has burned up. I would not advise purchasing this unit until Dyson redesigns it to allow for better maintenance and reliability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware Vacuuming Berber Carpeting","review":"This vacuum sucked up my high quality Berber carpeting and left a bare spot 8\\" X 1\\" that I now need to get repaired.

I use (ahem used) mine around 2 times a week and take care of it - clean the filter at least every 2 months. Bottom line... don't buy this vacuum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Consumers Reports is correct","review":"Consumers Reports is correct, this is a very poor vacuum. We have light wood floors and you can see our dog's hair on the floor after we vacuum. When we called Dyson they told us to use the hose with the floor attachment to clean to floor. We have in/door carpet in the garage to collect up debris before we get in the house and after vacuuming this carpet you can still see grass on the carpet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Customer Service","review":"I have owned my Dyson for over two years now, and am in the Military, and found myself serving in Germany.

I still have four years before I will be back in the U.S. This cavalier attitude on the part of Dyson has me regretting my purchase.

I find it cumbersome, inefficient, and I ALWAYS have to clean out the spinner brush. I do have a golden retriever who sheds like crazy, but I thought my cheap vacuum surpassed this one by far. It is also very awkward for stairs and hard to reach places. I found this to be a waste of money, and would gladly take my cheaper vacuum any day of the week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review","review":"got my dyson refurbished from ABC vacuum in Austin, TX. So far the vacuum is working pretty well. It is all mainly plastic and doesnt look as sturdy as the picture shows but it suctions well. Its really smooth to use as well. My wife that just had a C section tried it out and said it was really smooth to use. She vacuumed one room 6 days after surgery and said she loved it.ABC vacuum included a few other tools and cleaning solutions which is a plus. Never thought i would spend that much money on a vacuum but its working out ok so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just try it!","review":"I bought this for my wife before our baby was born because we wanted to make sure we were getting every bit of animal hair out of the carpet. We had a Kenmore that was on the top of the consumer reports list and we thought it was doing a great job. That is until we compared it to the Dyson.Amazon had an insane sale on this vacuum so I purchased one to try it out. After putting it together, my wife used the Kenmore on the carpet just like she always does. Then we used the Dyson. We were both shocked at the amount of animal hair that the Dyson picked up that the Kenmore missed!! It was incredible. That evening she went through the whole house vacuuming everything. It filled the canister!!These Dyson's are expensive, but they are truly worth it. We thought we had the best Kenmore money could buy, but the Dyson destroyed it in one afternoon.Highly recommended if you have pets."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 2nd Dyson- This one is a DC17 All floors model","review":"This is our second Dyson. The first one was a very early model DC-14(bought in 2004) so it had some design flaws that Dyson has clearly corrected in this more powerful DC17. The plastic parts on both models take a beating so I am hoping that this new one lasts longer. My first one only lasted 5 years but, to give Dyson a break, I use it every single day! We have dogs and the hair is an issue. This new DC17 All Floors model really does a great job. Much stronger beater bar and the easy control on the handle to turn the beater on and off is a life saver. Don't use it with the beater on hardwood floors. It seemed to scuff the wax finish. Just turn it off for those wood floors. It still does a great job. It's heavy and it's strong so get ready for that. I do want a vacuum that does what it is suppose to and this one does! We are happy Dyson campers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality.","review":"We purchased the Dyson DC in August of 2006.On August 2009 we noticed the Dyson was not cleaning as it should. We sent it back to Dyson who told us the clutch on the motor was broken and it would cost us $107.00 to fix it. Since we paid over $500 for this Vaccuum and it was only 3 years old, we were surprised to find out that we would be charged to fix the Dyson. Three months after we purchased this vacuum the warranty went from 2 years to 5 years. Seeing we only missed it by a couple months we hoped that they would fix it. When you pay five hundred dollars for a vacuum you figure on it lasting more than three years. I have a ten year old bissell at our cottage that still runs like a charm. We were told by dyson that if we didn't pay the 107.00 that they would not fix it. I had them send it back unfixed. I will not be buying a dyson again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems from the start, unfortunately.","review":"I was really excited to get my new Dyson vacuum cleaner. It worked great the first few times I used it, but then I started to have problems with suction (isn't that what Mr. Dyson swears will never happen, EVER?) I'm a fairly intelligent person, so I knew to check the filter and the canister, and make sure that everything was locked into place. After cleaning everything I could detach thoroughly, it was still not working well, so I brought it to the local Sears repair site. They looked it over and \\"fixed\\" the problem. I brought it home and tried it out and it worked great...until about a week later, when I had the same suction problem again. I have not been abusing the vacuum; I am very careful with it and have been cleaning and storing it properly, so I'm frustrated that it is not working like it should be. The time has come after four years of using this VERY mediocre vacuum to purchase a new one, and I don't think I will be buying another Dyson."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm embarrassed!!!","review":"I've always took pride in cleaning my house. With two dogs I vacuum OFTEN!! My vacuum of three days ago was a Miela. It's now retired to the basement. I now am a proud owner of the C-17 Animal. It's a tad bit heavier than I'm used to, but the results are well worth it. I've vacuumed every day since I've owned it and I'm still pulling up dog hair and dirt! By the time I'm done, I'm wondering if I'll have a carpet left. My carpets are brighter, softer, and even smell better. I highly recommend this vacuum to anyone, especially to the homes that have canine occupants. The directions weren't the greatest, but if you've ever vacuumed before you'll get the hang of it.

What little heat coming off the brickettes will be doused by any drippings.It may be great for making s'mores, or warming your coffee, but anything else? Give it up.I'll add that if Amazon were honest about this piece of junk, they'd have shown a full-disclosure series of shots indicating it had not air-flow control system.Being a tad more familiar with the physics of fire, I'd have recognized that this product was a loser from the get go and saved myself the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget It !!!!","review":"I am an avid vehicle detailer and have always taken the very best care of any vehicle I've owned.This Wash Brush is by far and away the very worst product I have ever used!

Also, the saga of being forced landed in the desert is an embellishment of the experience of Frank Maglio.There has been several investigations into the claims made by the author with only one victory being substantiated. Most notably Hub Zemke and the Americn Fighter Aces Assciation have rejected his claim. Articles in aviation journals and TV have also shown the fiction in this novel.

And the copy also makes much of the fact that he was \\"the youngest major in the Army Air Force,\\" or something of the sort, which may actually have been a record he held for 15 minutes, since the mid-1940s were a time when young officers were getting promoted right and left to fairly high ranks; there probably were bird colonels a year or two older than he was.

While I deeply agree with much of what he says, the disconnect between his views and the prevailing way schooling is being done is frightening. \\"Teaching as a Conserving Activity\\" was written in 1979. The fact is that schools have only made things worse and have reinforced the bad model Postman criticized so trenchantly. I hate to say it, but things seem even more distant now and Postman's ideas even less possible. The ideas Postman champions are not to be found in the education enterprise. Instead, one has to look to movements such as Democratic Free Schools such as Sudbury Valley, the unschooling movment, or other modes of Alternative Education which our society shuns. The grip that the dominant model has on our society's notion of education is lethal; it is killing the souls of young learners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not horrible but c'mon you can easily do way better","review":"I don't know anybody who would actually buy this stuff.

Giddens admits to some of the criticism of globalization but he glosses over the horrors of ecological risk and global inequalities and touts the joys of democracy as being spread by globalization which results in \\"pure love\\" relationships.

But the larger dome magnifiers are thicker - - - and heavier. That's the trade-off for getting a much larger field of view. Note that this product weighs a pound. After a long period of use, it can start to feel heavy.If you plan to use this for long periods of time, consider the smaller, and much lighter, 2.5 inch magnifier, or maybe a 3 inch. You give up viewing area, but gain a magnifier that's easier to use when you aren't sitting at a table or moving over or around an irregular shaped object. But on a table, the extra viewing area is really nice to have.I don't plan to give this one up any time soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a porn film...without the porn","review":"A young white boy and a middle aged black man fall 'in love' in a German prison. The film quality is lousy, and the acting is not much better. Looks to me like they rounded up the Sunday beer bust crew at a leather bar and decided to make a movie. The odd thing is the characters do actually have sex in the movie, but they cut it out to the point of nonsense. This is really like a porn movie without the porn. The young white actor was fairly good in his role....because of his expressive eyes. ALL of the other actors were terrible. Don't waste your money on this one, guys. The entire movie revolves around sex, and they cut it all out. There is not really any other plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!","review":"This movie is so boring and the lines are so poor that you could sleep on it.

I saw higher-quality student films in college. It's as though someone attempted to make a hardcore porn movie and left in all the stupid parts and cut out all of the graphic sex.I am not sure where this prison is supposed to be, but it's very inconsistent. Some people have coffeemakers and can wear piercings. Some practically have an apartment, while others have just a bench and sink. A gang or two of rough guys has free roam. The guards seem to be involved with some of the prisoners, but it's difficult to tell, and there's some kind of drug-trade theme going on. But the story is so disjoint and clunky that you can't follow this easily.Don't even think this movie is \\"hot.\\" It's not rough prison sex, there is no chemistry between any of them, and the production values are so low you might as well get drunk and just laugh at the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oz it ain't!","review":"The editorial calls this movie a german style \\"Oz\\". Well, they both take place in a prison, but that's where the similiarities end. \\"Oz\\" has talented actors, imaginative story lines, high quality production. \\"Lock Up\\" has penises!The movie looks like it was filmed with a camcorder the director borrowed from his mom. As for the actors, I can imagine the casting director going to a Berlin leather bar one Saturday night and saying, \\"Who wants to be in a movie\\"?The annoying thing about this film is that whether you're looking for a good story line, or hoping for a bit of gay porn, you're going to be frustrated either way.

I would have loved it to be longer and more developed...the love story could've had more punch in it. But the story is well paced and easy to like, and the two leads are well-rounded enough that it's quite easy to root for them to become a couple.

Dramatic content NOT very good or believable. Do German prisons really allow inmates to choose their cellmates and to set up housekeeping as lovers? Attractive actors. The \\"special features\\" interview with the 2 lead actors is very \\"honest\\" and worth listening to to hear their views on porn.

There wasn't a plot point you couldn't see coming, even if you haven't seen Oz. While everyone involved gets full marks for trying, this is only one or two steps above an amateur effort--not a bad effort, but amateur none-the-less. The predictable script aside, the other element that really robs it of any punch is the fact that all the punches are so badly performed. With the exception of the shower scene, the violence is badly performed, so what is supposed to be brutal comes across as amusing. I can't say that I really hated this movie (Marcel Schlutt has enough charisma to carry the film), it's not one that I would recommend to anyone--not because it's out and out bad, but becuase it's not really good.(C)2005 Joe Edkin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interacial love between male prisoners!","review":"This DVD was entertaining at best,but the production quality really sucked.It appeared like the movie was shot on video tape instead of film.The two main chracters were eye-candy,and they seemed to have good chemistry,but I felt like the writer or director was basically filming his sexual fantasy.It would have made a better rental than purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Censored Version","review":"This is actually an edited version of a porn movie.

Because this cd sounds so horribly mixed any other way and you couldn't listen to it any louder to hear the lyrics.

Boadt assumes that God has had little or nothing to do with the writting of the Scripture, and apparently the cultures that surounded Israel were the true source of inspiration.

A historic revisionist, Wellhausen claimed that he was presenting the \\"true\\" story of the Torah when in fact his theories called the whole foundation of the Jewish religion into question. Although this book is published by a \\"Catholic\\" press (Paulist), it is also infected with anti-Catholicism. One, after all, cannot be anti-Semitic and also pro-Catholic. To suggest that large portions of the Torah were falsified is also to suggest that Catholicism is falsified at its very foundations. Jesus, after all, was a Jew; and as Pope Benedict XVI has said, without Abraham, there would be no Christmas. The Jewish people are Catholics'elder brothers and sisters in the faith.

Once you have gotten used to the speakers' speed on the tapes, you can be sure that what you learn is useful; the few times I had a chance to people talking Amharic to each other, I was amazed how much I understood. The reason why I rate this book 4 stars rather than 5 is that it merely depicts the script as it is written in print; it does not show how to write it, e.g. the order and direction of the individual strokes is not illustrated.

For example, The lessons on \\"glottalized\\" sounds (sounds made in Amharic that we don't make in English) helped me to better understand, say, GiGi (has a series of highly recommended albums sung entirely in Amharic--beautiful!) when she belts out an Amharic word that my ears can't grasp.

Fans of classical bodybuilding will admire the great photographs of Steve in his prime, and will find much to admire in this practical, logical, and inspirational guide to getting in shape. Hardcore enthusiasts and fans of monsters like Dorian Yates may think the approach (and Reeves' physique) almost quaint, but the author's proportions were classical and his look is still stunningly impressive: what used to be considered in saner times \\"the Olympic Ideal\\". The book is worth a look, if you can find it, and bound to be a collector's item very soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Explosive, natural gains","review":"I believe that this is the best book for bringing out your potential.It is intense--you work out hard three days a week and then rest four. This is the way the natural guys, Reeves, Ross, Park, Delinger, Grimek, Stephans, Eiferman, Tanny etc did it back in those days and they got some incredible results--drug free.The other thing I like about this training program is that it gives you the time to have a life outside the gym.I just heard of Steve Reeves passing. How unfortunate. HE was indeed one of the real legends of bodybuilding and will be sorely missed.Buy the book and use it. It's the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely One of a Kind","review":"Interested in knowing a lot about the living legend SteveReeves? Please enter. If you're into bodybuilding, all the rightstuff for building a classic physique is here; how and when to work out, what to eat, what not to eat, when to rest, etc.; every ingredient for achieving a great build naturally. In addition to bodybuilding, Steve also unveils his everyday recipe for staying physically fit for life. Some of the topics include the power of walking, the importance of water, getting smart about nutrition, etc. With 175 rare pictures of Reeves, the book also delivers on biographical data: from childhood, to bodybuilding fame, to worldwide movie star, to Reeves' current activity. It's all documented, it's all interesting and it's all the write stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!","review":"I ordered this item from shopzeus and it arrived in a timely manner, new in the box. I turned it on, the heating plate worked, and the stirring mechanism spun, so I figured it worked. A few days later I tried using it, and placed a small glass bowl with water inside on the plate, then turned on the stirrer. Nothing happened. I tried again, still nothing. I contacted SHOPZEUS 4 days ago and informed them of the problem and have yet to recieve a response. The reason i purchased a new one was so i wouldn't have to worry about a malfunctioning device, now i paid full price for a broken item, and they won't return my emails, or help me in any way. I will not purchase anything from them again, nor would i recommend them to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Took me 6 months to read","review":"I'm one of those people who usually finish a book, no matter how painfully boring. This book tested that theory. Granted, I will note here that this is the first book I'm reading in the series, and perhaps that contributed to the lack of interest I had in the characters. They all seemed the same to me. The action scene near the end was pretty good, (hence 2 stars) but I found the book only slightly more interesting than that Era-crap (to which I had to resort to coffee and mandatory pages-read a day in order to finish).Jenny is an interesting enough character, but all the other characters seemed like little wooden miniatures. Again, if you've read the other two books and know more about the series as a whole, you may like this book. Definitely not one of those series you can enjoy from any point.The writing style didn't impress me, but it wasn't too painful. Dry but with hints of flavor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Top heavy with an overemphasis on character development","review":"Moreover, much of this character development takes the form of chirpy asides and dense, introspective naval gazing. When the action finally begins it is invariably accompanied by a maximum of discussion.Reading this book was a bit of a chore, not worth the effort invested."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this series esp the strong female protagonist","review":"Haven't liked a series this much for a while now. Jenny Casey is a kickass lead with just enough fuzzy spots.I inhaled the first 2 books in the series. This one took a while to finish. I had to make myself read through the middle, where the UN testimony dragged on a bit. Once the action restarted, I finished it in one sitting.The last scene was poignant..I'd like to read more about the Feynman AI. His recovery from the blackout felt a bit rushed.On the whole a great book. 5 stars for the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the purple color...........","review":"but it fits kind of weird on my Bengal cat.

This is a terrible book. If I had been able to even thumb through it (rather than just rely on other reviews here) I would have immediately put it down. Full of the most obvious conventional wisdom (Married people can be miserable! Work on yourself! Take a class! Buy a pet!). It took me an hour to read its 125 pages (designed with lots of blank spaces and ENORMOUS fonts). And the co-author who is a \\"doctor\\" is actually an ER doctor according to the bio, not a psychiatrist (as you might think). The other author is a massage therapist. There are LOTS of better books about the single life and its ups and downs.

I find it painful to read a book where the publisher has not invested the energy to make sure that apostrophes are placed correctly. The text of this book is sadly about on the level or many greengrocers' signs, repeating in published print common errors that I distinctly recall having addressed in middle school.In an apparent attempt to cover for his low state of literacy, the author has tried for an \\"educated\\" sound, replacing every instance of the word \\"in\\" with the word \\"within\\". He invents words like \\"asperse\\". Often, I can not tell what a given sentence means after several analytic readings.I would stress, however, that this should not reflect poorly on the author, who is clearly not an academic. It should reflect brutally on the reputation of his publisher for not taking editorial responsibility."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Collection of Hard-to-Find Freestyle Classics","review":"This is an excellent collection of rare Freestyle tunes you won't find anywhere else, all in their extended editions. Some of these are available on vinyl but the quality isn't always the best - the quality of the audio here is excellent. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good gluten-free Clif Bar substitute","review":"It's hard to find gluten-free energy bars that aren't too sweet, and this totally fits the bill. You wouldn't want to eat these as candy -- there's some subtle truth-in-advertising in the \\"Choc-Bar\\" name (say it out loud) -- but I think I ate at least six of these on my last backpacking trip, and I am pleased to report that these are VERY tasty with plenty of water when I've been getting a serious workout and need the energy. Comparing labels, the nutrition and caloric content of an entire Choc-Bar is pretty similar to that of a Clif Bar. (The label says the \\"serving size\\" is half a bar, but that would be like eating half a Clif Bar -- there's no way I'm stopping after just a few bites when I'm in the middle of a nine-mile hike!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Concept","review":"I greatly enjoyed this book, from both a scholarly and a magical perspective. Philip Carr-Gomm, one of the formost authority on Druidism/Druidry today, uses knowledge of Celtic myth and superstition to create an oracular deck which is both beautiful and interesting. Besides having fascinating cards, the deck is very simple to use and should be of particular interest to anyone who has immersed themselves into the Celtic mindset (an essential tool to those of the Celtic Druid path). With proper attunement, the deck works very well and is streamlined to a very particular taste. The only thing keeping be from giving this work 5 stars is its lack of accompanying story. The imagery is beautiful, and the system precise, but I think that the explanation and readability of the book portion could use work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beauthiful ilustrations and disapointing card stories","review":"This is my second deck afeter purchasing \\"Oracle of the Dreamtime\\" which is an incredible deck!. The Druid Animal Oracle has very beautiful cards and poor stories and imaginery backing them.

I just started looking at it now, and I just love the art work. It was one of the things that drew me to this particular set. The book seems to be very informative, and goes along with the card set. For the price, it's well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Druid Oracle","review":"I liked the style of the cards.

The town of Calico needs redemption and the people needto pull together - but there is much more to the story - love, hate, jealousy, sickness, tolerance, sharing, joy,and much more - the characters are well written and their actions in line with their \\"life style\\" - enjoyed it very muchand will try to find more books by the author! Jack Curtis is an exceptional writer, for sure.I was not impressed with the movie THE SECRET OF GIVING that is based on this book - thewriters changed the story almost completely and lost the real meaning of Jack Curtis' book.I would like to see a movie made on the book itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"He is better reporting a story then making one up","review":"Sometimes I wonder if the professional review organizations give every book such great review? I had some high hopes for this book as I have read some of his non-fiction work. I came away from the reading a bit disappointed. The story was inventive, but the cast of characters were a little to stereotypical and not very well developed. As the book unfolds the story that interested me from the dust jacket started to get a little unbelievable with his writing, I just kept saying \\"No Way\\". With the combination of the lackluster characters and the increasingly unbelievable story I lost interest at the end of the book. I simply finished it becuase I had put the time into it. I would stick to this authors non-fiction works"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"I enjoy meditating on God's name and this book allows me to this in a variety of ways over a year.

Everything is accurate, according to my knowledge, and the tone and mood of the documentary lend themselves to their subject. Knowledgable figures are interviewed, including regarded poet Jane Hirshfield and His Holiness the Dalai Lama. Important events in his life are given appropriate coverage, including events in Bodh Gaya and Benares. As a beginner who desires more knowledge about Buddhism, I found the information in this documentary helpful to illuminate some of the more difficult Buddhist texts.

I'd recommend this to anyone curious about the history of Buddhism.I give it 4 stars, but I really would have loved to seen or heard Gere in this, as several posters said that he was in it. I watched the on-demand version, and he was nowhere to be seen or heard in it. Nor was he in the ending credits. That was a bit of a disappointment :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly Lacking","review":"I am unhappy with what I've seen (perhaps mostly due to my studies). Although in a positive light, this presentation misses much of what Siddhartha Gautama was trying to convey. Likely, it is a simplification in order to address those of little patience. However, I believe many important aspects are unfortunately missing. For example...although modern Buddhism stems from Siddharta Gautama, he was not the only \\"Buddha\\". Furthermore, the simplification of dukkha (\\"suffering\\", etc.) is lacking in much of what was trying to be conveyed. Although I am an Orthodox Christian, I sincerely respect that which \\"the\\" Buddha was trying to teach. If you truly want to understand the teachings of Buddha without having to read the various sutras (discourses, scriptures), I recommend listening to the very open and non-biased (at least in my opinion) discussions led by Joseph Goldstein. No need to buy anything from him, as all of his discussions are free on his (and other) websites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Save on electricity by getting your own enlightenment","review":"This is a well-designed and paced documentary on the life of the Buddha (I have read a few and this is a great synopsis.) It is presented through soundbites from artists, poets, monks and others. We also get the stories augmented with drawings or watercolors. The narration is by Richard Gere. This is a short review but it is not easy to include the details of the presentation without giving a presentation. Beside the different insights into Buddhism, the thing that I took away was the different locations where Buda was born, died, and received enlightenment.I only saw the Blu-ray version so I cannot compare. However, there is a small documentary on the making of the documentary. You will need to re watch the presentation as it is packed with information and ideas that do not give you too much time to think in-between.Little Buddha"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buddha","review":"An excellent telling of the story of the founder of the Buddhist religion, comperhensive and well done with excellent research."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buddha was Born in Nepal not in northern India","review":"I couldn't believe the knowledge of film maker.

There was no entertainment value or self-improvement value to it whatsoever. In watching this documentary, it will be painfully clear how a person who gains unique insights to life generates a following of people who then completely distort and misinterpret his teachings and turn them into a religion. The followers of Buddhism are seen performing rituals and ceremonies and worshiping idols as if doing so conveys some special favor or wisdom. You see the sheeple grasping for hope through reverence of some guy who had some interesting insights into life a long time ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"WHat a waste.

It's an astonishingly wide-ranging book, and highly recommended for anyone with any interest in any of these subjects in particular or in evolution as a whole.

The author fails to properly quote all of his sources and frequently interjects his own tedious opinions, which I found to be trite and irrelevant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very well organized","review":"I had bought this book over 20 years ago, and finally had the time to sit down to read it from cover to cover.Sugden included a lot of photographs, maps, and manuscripts, which made the book visually pleasing. Reading the text was a nightmare, however. Each chapter went from start to finish without any break. His tendency to either go off tangent or assert his own opinions also made it very difficult to follow.The book itself was not very well organized either. Details pertinent to Paganini's early career were not mentioned until in the chapter concerning his death. Other trivial information (such as LeRoy's Miracle Cure) was mentioned ad nauseam.If one had the patience and persistence to put up with this seemingly random pile of text, it could be informative, and provided additional insights to the life of Paganini beyond his obvious musical accomplishments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Some things cannot be improved upon. Unfortunately, Creatures is one of them. The original game was brilliant and fun, but each new version and expansion is worse than the previous one, with this one being boring and unplayable.

So you will be able to play the basic game but not the Exodus part."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointing","review":"I'm a big fan of cute breeding animal type games. The Sims Pets, the little chao in the Sonic games, and Viva Pinata are all great.Honestly, Creatures was dissapointing. It doesn't come with instructions, and it doesn't have that \\"walk you through it tutorial\\" thing that most games have. It was too hard to figure out how to operate it. Typing text controls is just clunky.In all fairness, I think the concept is great and if someone was willing to put a few hours into learning the controls, it might be a neat game. But as far as pick-up-and-go factor, I was bored and frustrated within 30 minutes and haven't played it again since."},{"rating":"2","title":"The revenge starts here.","review":"This is the play which first introduced to the Elizabethean audience the sub-genre of the revenge play. It was in fact so popular, that it was soon immitated. The play is a typical renaissance play, and so it has both main plot, and sub-plot. Both of these deal with revenge, and the character of revenge is actually present on the stage. It is very inventive play, and should be a required reading for anyone seriously studying Elizabethean theater, as it provides context, and most likely inspiration for the better known plays of Shakespeare. Thomas Kyd happened upon a formula with this play, which was emulated until the closing of the theaters some 40 years later. This play started a trend, which is still going strong today, as revenge is a powerfull, and popular topic, which transcends time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!!","review":"This rub is amazing!!! I saw it in Bristol Farms and asked the meat guy if it was any good and he gave a rave review. I'm always on the search for great rubs and marinades and this will be a keeper.

When the handle slide off, either the tool or the handle falls into the greenery. The both handles were punched from a sheet metal and in my case have had such sharp edges that I cut my hand. I filed them off to prevent that from happening again.A smaller issue is that the adjustment screw cannot be held in place, and it hits the opposite handle under a wrong angle.Workaround: Use silicon or \\"grab it\\" type of gel to attach the handles in a more permanent fashion to the pliers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent primer on voluntary simplicity","review":"This book introduces the reader to the philosophy and lifestyle of the Amish people.

I find the Amish reasons for not using electricity to be inconsistent. I agree with being independent of the world, specifically the large corporations, but substituting gas generators for electricity leaves one still dependent upon petroleum distillers. If they composted and used only homemade methane gas then they would be independent.

Mr Deaver do you think you can write a little faster. Thank you an avid reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Up to Par","review":"Perhaps I shouldn't review this, because I only gave the book 100 pages, but being a professional book reviewer, I feel comfortable in feeling that if a book doesn't do it for me in the first 100 pages, it's never going to. \\"Coffin Dancer\\" is a very disappointing read after the rollercoaster of \\"The Bone Collector,\\" the first Lincoln Rhyme novel. I was really anxious to read \\"Coffin Dancer,\\" because I like Rhyme and Amelia Sachs so much, but it moved slow as a slug on a hot day. The only thing that drove the plot was the romance between Sachs and Rhyme; the killer could have zapped his target very early in the book [he had means and opportunity, and time] but for some mysterious reason he never bothered to pull the trigger. I wish I could recommend this Deaver outing, but I can't. I will read \\"Empty Chair,\\" because I like the protagonists so much, but I'd tell others to skip \\"Dancer\\" unless they need a sleeping draught."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Coffin Dancer","review":"I have read a number of Deavers books and he always keeps me in suspense until the end of the book. I would definitely recommend this book and put it up there with Michael Connely, James Patterson and other such authors. I thoroughly enjoyed this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best","review":"I was very disappointed with this effort. Deaver did not develop the characters well at all. The wife of the pilot blown up in the beginning exhibited very little sorrow at her loss, although Deaver made a weak attempt to cover the issue later.I also find it very hard to believe all the drinking Pearce did before flying the Lear. The book picked up, but way too late."},{"rating":"2","title":"HURRAY -DEAVER FOOLED ME AGAIN & I LOVE SURPRISES!","review":"Mr. Deaver fooled me again! If you think this is another \\"predictable\\" story, just keep reading! I get such joy from thinking I have a plot all figured out and then being surprised. That's what Deaver did in the Bone Collector and he does it again here. At first the plot was too easy and I had it figured out and was starting to get disappointed then - WHAM! Deaver did it again. Like a fine Bordeaux, the book opens up the longer you read, and the twists and turns are worth the wait. Thank you, Mr. Deaver for a good, fun read. Keep up the good work and I will keep buying your books - because I love surprises."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost outfoxed","review":"I just love Deaver's character Lincoln Rhyme, and of course I love Amelia Sachs. The sexual tension between these two in this book is great ... and just what the doctor ordered! I don't like books in which readers know throughout the whole book who the killer is, and you're just plugging for the main character to hurry up and get him. This surprise ending was a GREAT shocker. How we can all invite the villain, unknowingly, into our own homes is quite frightening... and quite realistic. And Deaver's book describes this to a T. Great mix of police work, gruesome stuff, romance, psychological thrills and once again (after The Bone Collector) a look into a great detective who does it all from the \\"comforts\\" of home -- he's a quadriplegic! What a super idea by Deaver. My hat's off to this sensational writer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME BOOK!!","review":"This was the first book by Jeffery Deaver I ever read.

This is a great reading for anyone who love myster/thriller books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"'The Coffin Dancer' by Jeffery Deaver","review":"The book follows Lincoln Rhyme and Amelia Sachs with their hunt for a serial killer known as the 'Coffin Dancer'. Rhyme uses his forensic knowledge and experience to get into the mind of a murderer. With Rhyme guiding her, Sachs is able to collect information and evidence that will eventually lead them to the killer. The book is full of surprises and has an excellent twist at the end. It keeps you really interested right from the start. It lets you heighten your imagination in many ways making it a brilliant read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Struggle","review":"I really had to struggle getting through the first half of this book.

The book is agonizingly long. A waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great suspense novel that twists and turns","review":"I loved this book. it is definitely the best of the rhyme series. (Although, admittedly, i have only read two.) I enjoyed the Bone Collector a great deal, and this one is even better. I fairly raced through it as Deaver kept piling on the twists and turns. His characterisation is so subtle that you don't even notice it. A sign of a truly great writer.The plot is a cracker. I'm not going to describe it, because i don't like doing that. this is a review, not a synopsis. But rest assured that it is great. it keeps you turning the pages at great, whilst the obnoxious Percey Clay seems determined to undermine Rhyme in everything he says and does.A great cast of characters, a great plot, and a great twist to the end. Some people get tired of all the twists, but what's the point? Just let the water rush over you. Enjoy them while they last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can I give it more than 5 stars?","review":"If you want a book that you can not put down, this is the book for you. It makes you want to read just one more chapter before putting it down. I am so hooked on Jeffery Deaver. His books are the best you'll ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"DANCING ALL OVER THE NYPD","review":"This book wasn't as good as the other novels I have read by Mr. Deaver but that doesn't mean that it wasn't good. The famous twists and turns are there and the plot is good. The novel did not read at breakneck speed, more like a slow jog. The novel got bogged down in the budding romance between Detective Sachs and Lincoln Rhyme, investigator extraordinaire. There was plenty of blood and mayhem to make up for it though. Overall it was an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor, simple-minded characters","review":"The detective here, Rhyme, is such a crybaby. What's supposed to come off as his special 'brilliance' is actually bleeding freakin' obvious stuff. \\"Wow, Lincoln,\\" you'll say, \\"You figured that all by yourself!\\" You'll feel sorry for him and the other sorry characters. You'll gaze through ENORMOUS HOLES in the plot and see the starry sky. RECOMMENDED FOR THE WEAK-MINDED."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS BOOK IS DREADFUL!","review":"A lot of people seem to like this book-- and all I can say is, their standards must be way low. There is not a SINGLE CHARACTER MOMENT that WORKS in this book. The love interest isn't believable (and not because the hero is paralyzed. That isn't the problem). The Nemesis isn't believable-- none of the bad guys are. The interplay between the characters-- at no point did I buy a moment of it. I finished the book, yes, but mostly as a technical exercise. It has one good trick up its sleeve, but even the character motivations for that are not brilliantly constructed. And the forensic stuff is so arcane that only the brilliant hero can get it-- not regular readers like you and me. Hey, I love a good thriller. Unfortunately, this is not one. Kind of a shame, really-- all that intelligence, and not a decently conceived and executed character in the bunch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly overwritten. Loosely joined and unbelievable.","review":"Start out with the beautiful fashion model turned cop. That's something that one can believe easily! Then put her into at least four situations in which we're supposed to believe she's been shot, blown up, or some other terrible deed has been done to her, only to then be told that nothing happened. How many times do you go to this well, Mr. Deaver? Or consider that villain and protagonist are both so smart that they both know what the other is planning. ALWAYS. Add in unnecessary filler, stereotyping of characters, and a stupid plot twist at the end, and you get a waste of time and money. I'm sorry I wasted the effort to read this.I am not one to pan a book just for fun. I figure everyone has their own style. But I felt compelled in this case to warn you that this is contrived melodrama at its worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy","review":"If you know nothing about flying rest assured anything relating to aviation is total BS! There is nothing realistic about the flying related portions of this book, this includes the pilot characters. What a joke they are. All this wouldn't be so bad if the plot didn't revolve around flying and the main pilot character."},{"rating":"2","title":"suspense thriller at its best","review":"Jeffery Deaver keeps outdoing himself. \\"A Maiden's Grave\\" and \\"The Bone Collector\\" were terrific reads and \\"The Coffin Dancer\\" is as good, if not better.

Went out that evening and bought book and finished reading it the next day. Have never read any of Deaver's books before but I went out the next day and bought 3 more including the first one about Lincoln, The Bone Collector. Enjoyed the way he used time frame in developing the story. Also enjoyed the way he developed the Amelia/Lincoln relationship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coffin Dancer","review":"I wasn't disappointed. The Coffin Dancer was one of Deaver's best novels. The twists & turns were exceptional and the typical Deaver surprise ending kept you guessing until the last moment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read","review":"I have read almost all of the Lincoln Rhyme novels and thought that some of the endings where not up to the rest of the book. These are great fun reads and I love the antisipation of getting started on a new one. This time I was caught off guard. The book grabbed me right away and was hooked. Great twists and even the ones I saw coming ending up catching me off guard again later. Hands down the best of the Rhyme novels so far. Keep it up Mr. Deaver!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So good a driving distraction","review":"Bought this to listen to during an eleven hour drive to the Outer banks of North Carolina. It was so well read by Joe Montagna that I became completely engrossed to the point of missing two different exits and once getting on I 64 west instead of east. I would caution parents that it has strong adult language and would not recommend listening with kids in the car."},{"rating":"2","title":"solid thriller","review":"Having finally succumbed to the Deaver phenomenon I came away fairly impressed. Deaver has the typical clean and efficient thriller writer writing style that makes for an enjoyable reading experience. The reader also comes away learning much about the world of forensic science.The quadraplegic forensics expert Lincoln Rhymes is certainly interesting, if not in the same league as the Poirots and Holmeses, the interesting shades of his personality make him a likeable portagonist. The sexual tension between him and his Protegee, the 'beautiful' Amelia Sachs is also promising. Although Deaver's forays into the other aspects of his charcters' personality seem a little hokey.The plot certainly goes through more twists and turns the average thriller, and things are never quite what they seem, it will interesting to see how many people figure out the major twist, it's not very difficult to guess, but I certainly missed it, don't quite know what that says about my intelligence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deaver continues to stun","review":"After reading the first Lincoln Rhyme novel and the current last, Empty Chair, I can honestly say that Coffin Dancer is Deaver's best in the series. It moves at such a fast pace and is so fascinating, especially the knowledge of forensic and physical evidence. After reading this book, I would question other detectives in other books who were not using such a great form of criminal detection! If you love intellectual, suspensful mystery novels, this book is a must. Another plus is that the ending of this book is so twisted from what you might have been originally thinking which is different than Bone Collector. This is the Deaver novel that should be made into a movie. You'll be fearing the coffin dancer and his criminal intelligence for weeks afterward!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the Bone Collector","review":"For those who like plot twists and surprises, this is the book for you! Deaver deepens the great characters in \\"The Bone Collector\\" and continues with his vast description of crime scene investigation. I bought this book because I enjoyed \\"Collector\\" and the elements within it. But I feel that this book was better than the first and the ending was exceptional. This is a book that pulls you in from the beginning and doesn't let you go until the last page. That's just as well because the plot twists end with the final words. Not even half way through \\"Dancer\\" I raced online to preorder \\"Empty Chair\\". It'll be money well spent if it's half as good as this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical Deaver/Rhyme - chilling plot, relentless search for villain!","review":"We're slowly catching up on some of the earlier Lincoln Rhyme stories, featuring his sidekick and \\"leg-man\\" Amelia Sachs, as well as a few other regular supporting cops from the NYPD. The elements are similar to Deaver's other tales in this set: a bombing murder gets things started, with a hired killer set on killing off the other key witnesses before they can testify in another high profile case. Thus begins the race between the genius Rhyme and the bad guy (\\"the Coffin Dancer\\"), with plenty of forensic crime scene work done by Sachs, whose relationship with Rhyme turns ever more amorous despite his condition as a C4 quadriplegic.We can count on Deaver to deliver a thrilling plot, clever detecting (Rhyme per se is very reminiscent of Nero Wolfe!); and sustained action that keeps us flipping pages quickly! Twisty ends usually entertain right to the last page -- \\"Dancer\\" is another good entry in a good series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"my personal thrill ride of the year","review":"I doubt I will read anything soon that will keep me up as long as this book did. Read in two nights, I enjoyed it even more than the first in the series, which has never happened to me before! Keep going, Jeffrey! You just keep getting better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping!","review":"Having read this book last year, I decided to read it again and loved it more the second time around. The relationship between Sachs and Rhyme is good. The 'Steven \\"soldier\\"' character is compelling - I just love him! Where was Thom (Rhyme's personal assistant) in the film, \\"The Bone Collector\\"? Like the other reviewers,you have to read the first Lincoln Rhyme novel - so buy it and ENJOY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Instantly hooked","review":"This is a fast-paced thriller with twists and turns that moves quickly from scene to scene without losing substance along the way, the downside of many books written in this format. Jeffrey Deaver has successfully blended intricate plotting with characterization. Lincoln Rhyme and his protegé, Amelia Sachs, are thoroughly engaging characters. The forensic details fascinated me, knowing too little about forensics to question plausibility. I agree with one reviewer's comments about the number of people who died all to protect a self-centred woman unconcerned with the lives she put at risk, and I could not drum up sympathy for this character. Other than that, a great way to escape for a few hours. The twist at the end was an unexpected bonus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't miss this one!","review":"Sharply defined characters, intriguingly choreographed plot twists, dry humor, a drop-dead surprise ending--it's all here in this latest blockbuster! This is my first experience with Jeffery Deaver, and it will NOT be my last. Buy this book, share it, read it! You will NOT be disappointed. I personally guarantee it."},{"rating":"1","title":"good plot twist at the end--but thats all","review":"This book was annoying in many ways but the thing that bothered me the most was the Mrs. Clay did not even seem to care that her husband and friend were dead. All she cared about was... her airplane? It just seems really silly to me. I found myself cheering for the villians instead of the victims."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enjoyable, but not credible","review":"1) The killer is unstoppable even by all the forces of the police and the FBI combined, and 2) The criminologist is a Sherlock holmes with none of the credibility of Holmes. To the point that the total lack of credibility ruins the novel for the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Time pass read","review":"Though i am averse to fiction stuff yet i sometime fiddle with these when i am too saturated with reality. This novel really took me off to a non-real world and pace of the story never let its hook off me . I never felt like reading 500 pages . Though the theme was quite the same as other rhyme novels (lincoln chasing a ghost like criminal who leaves no trace)yet there are brief interesting interludes like gay feeling of coffin dancer for his accomplice or The seducing of Linclon by Sacks (which might be given more space in future novels) . Overall a return on investment though not a overthetop kinda stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deaver weaves a twisted plot","review":"Jeffery Deaver has weaved a plot that will shock and enthrall you. The plot catches your attention in the first chapter but then lets up. It gets less exciting to fully place the intricate puzzle that all comes together in the end.Some parts are hard to believe. Lincoln Rhyme, the main character, is a paralyzed criminalist and CSI, crime scene inverstigator. Since he is bound to his wheelchair, he focuses his concentration to analyzing evidence and out thinking the perpertrators. Some of his ploys are hard to swallow, but then again, I'm not limited to his world and concentration. At some parts, I wanted him to be wrong and others, vise versa.Nobody could guess this ending, and if they do, they have too much time on their hands. This is my favorite book, and I suggest that people who love twists to pick this up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read like the movie \\"Ronin\\"--what's going on???","review":"I always consider if an author had his hero as handicapped, his heroine a detective--especially a \\"beautiful\\" one, or created his so-called hitman not as a professional but a pyschopath, then the whole story would be totally pretensious and unnatural. To my regret, this book not only included these three bad factors but also with completely unbelievable police procedures, poorly written dialogue, and worst of all, so many made-up stuff that read as false as you could get! I have been fooled by those blind praises (were those made up by the author's kinfolks?) on this particular Amazon page, and foolishly enough to waste money buying it. I've tried to drudge along in order to make my money worth but still failed. This is a horribly book, one of the worst books that I've read in this summer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame Continuation of the Bone Collector","review":"I truly despied this book. The writing was great. I will the author that much but it just went on and on and on. The story was going NOWHERE! I was so excited to get a book that continued one of my favorite books last year- The Bone Collector. This truly was a waste of my time. I finished it just so I could I have a closure to this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous --- Again!!!!!","review":"I'm getting hooked on these books! But I'd rather listen to them than read them. Can't wait for the audio to come out. That way my mind can create it's own pictures as the story unfolds!! I am a little disappointed that this is a new story line instead of continuing with the story left hanging in the \\"Bone Collector\\". Rather than Christopher Reeves (who is terrific, but too clean cut) as Lincoln (it might be too much for him, and he'd have to \\"dirty up\\" some), think Robert Pastorelle (of TV's Cracker and Murphy Brown). I \\"see\\" him in the role when I listen to the Bone Collector. He has that dirty, scuffed-up, hard drinking, hard living, \\"I hate the world\\" attitude about him."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!

C'mon, Mr. Deaver. Try for something original next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting.","review":"Deaver writes great books. This book involves aviation and only contains a few mistakes that would offend some of the more critical aviation buffs. Those little errors do nothing to hamper a great story. Deaver really knows how tho spin a tail and keep you hooked. All of the Deaver books I 've read so far have been worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"good until the \\"surprise ending\\"","review":"I enjoyed this book, until the true identity of the 'Coffin Dancer' was revealed. Actually, I enjoyed the book until I had a chance to think about it. . . and think about how completely ridiculous and unrealistic the surprise twist was- I'm tired of mystery and suspense writers relying upon amazingly unrealistic shock endings, rather than intelligently crafted ones. Perhaps all the talent died with Dame Agatha? One more thing. . . the bit about altitude-sensitive bombs on airplanes: does Deaver have any idea how many times the 5,000ft/Denver thing has been used???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpected twists drew me in","review":"After reading \\"The Bone Collector\\" I couldn't wait for this one and I wasn't disappointed. I think Lincoln Rhyme and Amelia Sachs play off each other perfectly as they are NOT perfect people. The killer is highly-detailed and complex. I had one problem and that was with Percey. Her husband is dead barely 24 hours and all she can think about is her plane! This didn't ring true, but it wasn't enough of a problem to spoil the book for me. I'm looking forward to the next Lincoln Rhyme book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read","review":"This book is not quite as good as The Bone Collector but another great book by Mr. Deaver. It starts really slow then pick up the pace once he got started. As with all Deaver's books, he always come up with a lot of surprises and supsense and this one is no exception."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Coffin Dancer Reveiw","review":"I really enjoyed this book because of all the twist and turns inside it. The way that the murder himself is killed is very interesting.The book is all about how to disguise and figure out who the murder is.

No response yet. Buy this product if you want to keep yourself from seeing your own documents! Good luckFollow-up: Lexar emailed a link to new software which remedied the problem, about 36 hours after they said they would.

I tossed mine after a couple of weeks because it was working OK. Just after that it started having problems and stopped working altogether. Creative has extremely poor tech support and will NOT lookup customer information to allow you to return a defective item if you no longer have the receipt. They have an uncaring attitude.While it was working it would often crash and require me to restart it. Also, the battery life is very short. Getting playcenter to recognize the device to transfer files to/from the computer is also a challenge and requires a strange combination of plugging in/unplugging, turning off/on, etc.The only good thing about the unit is the large storage capacity, but that is useless if the unit does not work.For such a high-priced item I am extremely dissapointed in Creative and this experience has taught me to never buy anything from them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept but very buggy, think twice - read all reviews","review":"Well, first its a great concept and initially you'll think - this is better than sliced bread!Problem is that this unit has 2 major design flaws, if you don't get one of them - you'll probably get the other. I was 'lucky\\" enough to get them both.1. Battery bug - ahh yes - this is a stinker. After a while, the NJB stops charging the batteries fully. There's a long explanation as to why - but problem is that you're stuck. Your NJB which is supposed to last 4 hours on battery will start to last 45 minuted.2. Frequent hangs causing reformats: this one is really bad. Many people, such as myself, have encountered the dreaded \\"freeze\\" in which the NJB fails to boot (yes boot, it has a hard drive remember?) and the only thing tech support can say is \\"reformat it\\" therefore losing all your data (music.)Think twice before buying it, we have a love hate relationship.

The seller (a major computer manufacturer in Austin TX) won't make good either since it has now been longer than 30 days."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"OK, the shear storage capacity of this thing is impresive, I'll give them that. However, I am totally crazy about the penchant of this thing to just hang for no apparent reason that I've been able to determine.

I didn't expect a sequel so many years coming would be as good (it didn't hurt that I reread the First and Second Chronicles). My only complaint is the same as another reviewer: not only does Mr. Donaldson seem to like to use the most complex word possible- he uses it too much (I have read/heard the work \\"puissant\\" more times in this book then I ever have or ever will again). Plus, while I know writers are supposed to be descriptive, I think ALL the chronicles are TOO descriptive. I have to fight myself to not skip ahead just to see the story move along.

Have we not learned form history? Or, are we still the same old prehistoric creatures? I believe that we have truly come a long way and certainly quite capable of making decisions that could possibly help people in the future. Stop watching Sci Fi freak horror shows and start visiting hospitals where reality lays, in a bed without a functioning limb, degenerate organs, and countless other medical conditions that can be resolved through stem cell research.

Events are not chronological. For example, he tells of seeing his grandfather three times in twenty years and then jumps to another topic. He jumps from his life with Gae Exton to Dana and back again with other events thrown in between. Shorter chapters in chronological order would have made this book more interesting. And while I have sympathy for the tragedy which befell him, how many others have suffered this fate without the benefits of individual attention by doctors, nurses, security guards, and more. While recovering in the hospital after the accident,Chris mentions he didn't like the food. A chef at a nearby restaurant offered to cook him anything he would like at no charge. Is this the norm? I think not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tremendous story of courage & inspiration!

But the way out of that misery is through your relationships. The way out of that misery or obsession is to focus more on what your little boy needs or what your teenagers need or what other people around you need. It's very hard to do, and often you have to force yourself. But that is the answer to the dilemma of being forzen--at least it's the answer I found.\\" . . . . . . . . . . . .

Then after I swiped it over the stencil the line was not very distinct--it had a halo around the lines. The part that really bothered me though was that the line rubbed off before I had it quilted.

It is an \\"easy to complex\\" book which is perfect for the classroom or for the manager who wants to improve his or her strategic management skills in the comfort of their reading room. The strategic management model developed by the authors is easy to follow--and remember--to include the many connections it makes with external and internal analysis. I am most impressed with the authors' coverage of leadership, organizational structure, and culture. Not only will you learn the basics of strategic management--but it is a quick read and includes some outstanding case study's to reenforce the learning. A great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun game","review":"my older girls had earlier versions of this game so I ordered this for my new computer and my 9 year old loves it!

It is more than a movie, it is truly an experience. A wonderfully acted & directed movie. As an adimant Aidan Quinn fan, I guess I am a little biased, but this is a must-see even for those who aren't. The end of the movie was probably the most emotional for me, and I often find myself stopping the tape before it gets to that part.

I have recommended this movie to many people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-Catholic film disguised as tragic romance","review":"The jacket cover says its a story about a burned-out school teacher looking for his father. Rather, it's a story of young tragic love, with The Catholic Church painted as the villain.This film pulls out all the stops and uses every anti-Catholic stereotype we've seen before - overly repressive clergy at service to a Church obsessed with money and sex. A twisted priest who provides poor council in the confessional. The main character ultimately killing himself, we are led to believe because of the guidance offered by the priest.Masquerading as a story based on real-life experiences it is anti-Catholicism of the most insidious kind because it is a moving story. Those unfamiliar with the Church will come away blaming it for all of the problems in the film.The film pays attention only to young passionate love, and gives no time to old love, sacrificial love, or agape love.This is truly a disappointing film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old Irish drivel","review":"I am sick to death of this kind of Irish film where the same old actors are wheeled out in their tweed jackets and flat-caps to portray yet another load of down-trodden Irish characters with something to moan and whinge about. Films about modern Ireland never ever seem to be made and I get the feeling that the world must think that Ireland is stuck in the 1940s as thats all you ever see in these films.The story is the usual rubbish about forbidden love and it's been done a thousand times before. I do however disagree with the comment by a reviewer which claims that this film is 'anti-catholic' - it is not - this is unfortunatly how Ireland was at that time - ruled by the iron fist of the church. But this need by Irish film directors to constantly hark back to this time period is beyond me.

Secondly the first 3 chapters make very little sense and have terribly confusing questions (and no answers) that will turn you off before you get to later on in the book.

So many business books detail plans to drive sales, or improve numbers, and this one helps to focus in on keeping employees and raising your potential.

Ignore the \\"grabber\\" title, I'm not sure that it really applies, and go straight to the meat of the text -- you will be well-rewarded!It is extremely well organized and presented, with enough examples to make the point but not so many that you lose the thread of what they are trying to say... And what they are trying to say will either revolutionize the way you manage, or will affirm what you were already doing instinctively, and show you how to do it better.I was first given the book-on-tape version, and then ordered the hard copy so I could mark it up, make my own notes, etc. It is truly terrific!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it and now that I've seen this in action for over 3 years, it works","review":"I've had to go reread this book for work and I tell you, this stuff really works.

It also gives me a lot of time to read other revolutionary management books.To me, management books are the essense of life. I have read hundreds of them.

Before, I couldn't say I REALLY knew how to manage people, but now... I do. If you are in management, I dare you to read this. Why? Because the truth is, the way your employees are working is because you either know what you are doing or you do not. This book is like a mirror- look into it. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great regression analysis of the root difference between ok managers and great ones","review":"I am continually impressed by the management books that Gallup puts out. In this book, they treat the difference between great managers and so-so ones as a form of regression analysis, and they have used their statistics and polling know-how in order to great use.

These particular nuts and bolts belong to an approach to managing others that emphasizes individual relationships, recognition of strengths and a flexible approach to rewards. The book's weaknesses are understandable - in a book format, how can you offer readers the type of individualized approach and personal strength identification the authors discuss?The book's strength is the identification of a number of approaches that have worked for some of the best managers.

This indepth insight and the very clear recommendations should be required reading for all managers and highly recommended for anyone in the workforce.The book is also really well laid out. It's organized in short chunks, which make it very easy to pick up for 5 minutes or so at a time. Of course, there were a few times that I had a hard time putting it back down, though.If you're going to read one management book, this is the one to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"The old way of treating employees doesn't cut it in today's world. Every employee is different, and so you can't treat them all equally. But you can treat them all FAIRLY.

You can't argue with statistics, which is the basis of the authors' argument. This is one book I will always have handy on my desk!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Management guidelines based on facts!","review":"Unlike many management books whose findings are based on anecdotal evidence, Buckingham and Coffman write this book based on the results of a massive Gallup poll.Their results are interesting and provoking - even more so because it is backed by empirical data. Others reviewers have summarised their findings, so I won't repeat them here.They do not put forth a theory of management, of things to do, attitudes to adopt, and declare that as a silver bullet. This is not a motivational book.Instead, the authors describe certain key principles in providing an environment which employees can flourish and put in their best at work. I believe this work will be a major contributor to the theory of management in the years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear, concise, insightful and MUST READ!","review":"Refreshing!

Unfortunately, this trend did not continue through the book.The discussion of talent and it's implementation make for some of the best management reading ever. Some very pertinent examples and data are given in the first chapters which strongly support their points.However, the writing style is very dry and repetitive. The phrase \\"The best managers believe...the best managers don't....\\" becomes common to the brink of insulting. With no examples or statistics the last half becomes a real chore.I recommend skimming through this book: readers should be aware that the ideas in this book are mere stepping stones and not taken as gospel. The book succeeds at providing a good general management philosophy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Agree with a previous reviewer","review":"I liked the book and learned from it. However, I agree with a previous reviewer who said that this book doesn't go far enough by addressing real-world leadership issues.

Maybe it's because I jumped into it right after \\"Good to Great\\" from Collins. I mean who can stand next to Jim Collins right? This book seemed amateurish and made poor cases in comparison.

This is one of the better business books I have read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Icononclastic, challenging, articulate, & innovative","review":"Marcus Buckingham and Curt Coffman are consultants for the Gallup organization and, based on 80,000 interviews offer sound and persuasive conclusions about what makes for great managers in First, Break All The Rules: What The World's Greatest Managers Do Differently. They expose the fallacies of standard management thinking and in seven chapters, debunk some dearly held notions about management, such as \\"treat people as you like to be treated\\"; \\"people are capable of almost anything\\"; and \\"a manager's role is diminishing in today's economy.\\" Icononclastic, challenging, articulate, innovative, and at times inspiring, First, Break All The Rules is enthusiastically recommended reading for business students, entrpreneurs, managers, corporate officers, and CEOs.

So, now that we realize the importance of having quantifiable methods of managing, hiring, focusing, etc. our employees, what is the most simple and accurate way to achieve the data? I know of an organization that does just that, and preaches he results of this Gallup study."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Hard Sell of Pop-science","review":"Seems that Buckingham and Coffman have gone for the sales approach of a TV shampoo commercial - baffle them with science. From the extensive references of their research which they assure us goes beyond any research done previously, to their neuro-science analogy of highways and dead ends, the authors manage to fill 200 pages with - what? We get a checklist of questions that a manager should ask themselves. We get a serious rewrite of the Mercury programme and of the responses of the astronauts. We get a bizarre overview of what they believe talent is (complete with a highly amusing and faulty series of word activities). And we get a hard hard sell that they have the answers we are all looking for.This book falls squarely into the idea-as-hero category. Read with a critical eye, it is full of pretty fluff and little substance. I cannot recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply great","review":"I am the recent MBA grad with 15 years of managerial experience.

And approached the question in a scientific manner, first doing research to determine who the best managers in the world were, and then examining their abilities and actions from every angle (along with the abilities and actions of average managers) to see what set them apart.The result is deceptively simple and decidedly powerful; focus on the strengths of those who work for you. It obviously gets more involved than that and explains how to deal with the weaknesses of your reports, but I've put these principles into action in my business and have gotten measurable results.I recommend this book for any manager. It helped me in a very real, measurable way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tools, Concepts and Ideas Needed to Transform any Corporate Culture","review":"This Marcus Buckingham book was among the first which tossed me down my almost obsessive path of learning what great managers do to unlock the potential of others.

It was $800 retail or so if I remember correctly and I thought I got a deal at $450ish... Had to replace battery after one year, then the chronograph timer stopped working a few months later. 2 years into ownership and had to pay $275 to completely rebuild watch as everything stopped working suddenly. I got another 2 years out of it before it stopped working again and the inside moves around in the case. I suspect it needs a rebuild again and I am NOT going to do it. Guess it will be a nice light paperweight now. In all fairness I wore it daily and showered, slept etc. with in on. I love the feel and look and its super light, but I have about $700 dollars into a currently non-functional watch. Bummer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice looking, light but mechanism questionable","review":"This watch has the nice features of a solid watch. It has a sapphire crystal and screw back case. It does keep pretty good time and I like the lightness of the titanium band. It also is dressy and rugged enough to wear everyday.There are a few shortcomings though for this price range. The battery died after only one year which is very unusual for a nice watch. When I opened the case I saw that the case was made in China. So much for the swiss made watch. I also noticed the mechanism looked like a cheap sieko watch. When I opened my movado though it was quartz it was still an impressive jeweled mechanism.This watch looks a lot better on the outside than on the inside. For the price I expected a better mechanism and the whole thing to be swiss made. I also wish it had some glow in the dark markers because it's impossible to read in the dark.UPDATE: Died at 18 months. Mechanism is cheap."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie","review":"This is the self-penned true story of the Dutch war hero Erik Hazelhoff Roelfzema, and his college friends from Leiden who endured the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands and, who eventually, lived to see the Liberation.

Once I moved to Holland, I thought I'd check out his older Dutch movies. I found an English-subtitled version through Amazon.com and I wasn't dissappointed. It is one hell of a war movie. One of the best I've seen. It was pretty cool to see Rutger Hauer acting in his native Dutch language before he went off to Hollywood as well. Another recognizeable actor, Jeroen Krabbe, is in this too.I didn't even mind reading subtitles through almost the whole movie(some parts of it are in English).If you like war movies, check this out.

Krten defines the problems of real-time development and demonstrates solutions implemented in QNX. He provides plenty of code fragments to illustrate his points. These would be more effective if the lines were numbered and specific features were called out in notes. But, his method of writing paragraphs to explain the workings of the code also communicates.This book, when used with the QNX C library reference manuals will greatly reduce the time it takes to learn real-time development under QNX. I found it complemented Gallmeister's POSIX.4: Programming for the Real World and Kolnick's The QNX 4 Real-time Operating System quite nicely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice curtain, does the job.","review":"It's not the most heavy duty curtain in the world, but it works well and it's long enough to prevent the water from splashing out of the tub.

This is the only theory of economics that has any value, the rest of economic theory is simply a justification for a few people to hoard resources at everyone else's expense.So, this is an inexpensive blender and 2 important pieces of information are:1) It does chop ice, but it does not chop as well/fast and the blades do not stay sharp as long as more expensive blenders.2) After several years of once daily use the plastic stem just below the blades started to split. I replaced the blade assembly (for just shipping cost, it was still under warranty), but now the stem is splitting again after 3 years. Eventually this will make the blade stop moving and I'll have to evaluate whether it is better to replace it for $10 (and another 3-4 years use), or buy a new blender."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Hamilton Beach","review":"I have not used this particular model, but the hamilton beach that I bought (a more expensive model w/ 14 speed) was a complete waste.

In sneakers (New Balance) I remove the wimpy insoles and leave these Lynco L420's in permanently. I have another pair of L420's that I switch among my dress shoes and Top Siders.

It is a genuinely awful book. The style was (for me, at least) indigestible. The main thesis of the book, that *meaning* -- as opposed to bit configurations -- can be *quantified* is not just nonsense, but *frightening* nonsense, since quantifying everything gets funded these days.

Great product, I gave it 4 stars because it says its 6 feet, but they must have measured from the tip of the cord, to the end of the power strip."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would give zero stars if I could.","review":"I received a defective model. The red light doesn't work, and the power that gets through is erratic. I tried it in two different wall outlets. It caused flickering in the lamp that I plugged in.However, even if it had worked correctly, I probably would have thought about returning it. Before I realized that it was defective, I tried to plug in the various electronics that I planned to use with it. Granted, I have a wide transformer. It used up its entire space and partially blocked the first regular outlet next to it. I could have lived with that. However, the other outlets are too close together. I could not plug in my laptop's AC cord and my photocopier next to each other. I tried to leave an empty outlet between them in order to plug in a normal lamp, and it did not fit between them. In other words, for me this would have been a 3-outlet surge suppressor, rather than a 6-outlet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basic power strip with good right angle plug","review":"In my search for the perfect basic power strip, I needed something that is simple, low profile, has a good power/surge protection warranty, has a right angle plug so I can plug it in behind the couch, and has the individual outlets turned such that large transformers will not interfere with each other (i.e. think about if your power strip can fill every outlet with the Macbook/iPhone/iPad charger. This one does all that...it's a good name, I love my other CyberPower surge protector, and the price is right.Yes the switch is low profile and the LED light hard to see, but I never look at or use this stuff anyways. If anything, the switch is harder to hit accidentally, and the LED is not an eye sore at night time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent value","review":"This power strip is a very nice, and very basic device that offers very good value. I am impressed that it uses an intelligently designed plug as shown in the accompanying photo from Emily Goodin. The outlet layout allows for 2 power blocks to be plugged in without obstructing other outlets.The overall appearance is functional, but obviously not expensive. Does it actually provide protection against power surges? I don't know, and hope never to find out.The one design element I do not like is that the tiny red light to indicate it is powered on is not visible unless one is looking down from almost directly overhead. This increases the risk that it will needlessly be left on, resulting in a phantom load. I much prefer a power strip that has the indicator light incorporated in the switch, or at least has an indicator light that protrudes so it may be seen from across the room."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nearly impossible to plug things in","review":"As a new poorly constructed piece of exercise equipment, this gets 5 stars. As a power strip it's the worst power strip I've ever used. I didn't even know that there was such a thing as a bad power strip.The outlet plugs have metal contacts that are nigh on impossible to actually plug something into. I had to use almost my full weight on each plug to get it to actually plug in. Now that they're plugged in... I guess they're staying plugged in. I might need to cut it apart to get something out--and that's only a slight exaggeration.I don't know that it deserves 1* but seeing as that's the only metric by which I know how to judge a power strip: whether or not you can plug something into it I guess it fails miserably.I almost considered sending it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice","review":"what can you say about a surge protector.

At 900 joules of protection is exceeds what is recommended for the bed. The specs of this are pretty impressive, especially for the price. It is a snug fit when you plug something into it but not too excessive. I like that it is a secure plug and I don't have to worry about things wiggling loose and unplugging. The orientation of the receptacles is good so that plugs don't block each other. Also there are 2 receptacles spaced out farther for larger plugs with DC transformers. I won't really know if it works unless I get a power surge, but until then at least I can sleep soundly."},{"rating":"2","title":"This thing works great","review":"I love that it has a flat back plug, makes it easier to push things up against it.

The woman doing the demonstration part is really enjoying herself and her body. Then when she is touching her clitoris, it was refreshing to see the way she touches herself. I saw visible changes in her during her orgasm. Most models of female orgasm are usually presented with a build up toward a climax which is fun.

You had the soulful Bob Mosley, the crazy Skip Spence, the rockin' Don Stevenson, the mellow Peter Lewis and the superb guitar playing of Jerry Miller. They burst onto the music scene like a supernova but burnt out just as fast.

Feels like a cheap toy. The buttons feel as if they will break at any moment.Out of the box, the unit will lock up if you press any button twice. Or if you press \\"menu\\". Or if you look it at the wrong way. There's no way to reset it when it locks up other than removing the battery, and the battery cover is so cheap that it will only last a few open-and-close cycles.

However, he does not teach parents how to control their kids. He teaches how to set up situations where the child learns for himself. Parents have a tendency to enable self-destructive behavior in their kids because of the \\"pyschobabble\\" they have been taught. Rosemond helps parents avoid that trap. It is about gaining control of the child by setting it up so that the child controls himself, the opposite of the \\"micro-manageing\\" that many parents fall into. I especially like the reality Rosemond introduces about our kids: that they will never be perfect, that they will probably do something we wish they wouldn't, and that they will probably turn out okay anyway. Rosemond's approach is tough, but in a realistic and not \\"mean\\" way.

The anecdote about \\"The Creep\\" broke my heart. You take a clearly depressed 14 year old, and instead of asking her what's wrong, you're supposed to mock her, belittle her, play games with her? Sometimes teenagers ARE having a hard time, they DO have problems, and if they act depressed, it's not meant as an insult to their parents. Telling her she's not \\"actually human\\" is supposed to improve her attitude? IRL, that might drive her to suicide. Is there any room in Rosemond's agenda for compassion and understanding? Or is it all about the parents and what they want?Unless I somehow missed where this is a satire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Parents are bona fide authority!","review":"These days we are definately using too much psycho-babble to come to an understanding of our children without realizing that psyco-babble doesn't work to shape and define character in children. Children will try to worm their way out of being accountable to authority and we, by not recognizing that the establishment of parental authority is necessary, will let them avoid responsibility for their own behavior. This book gives very good examples of how to establish parental authority and responsibility in the child. It stresses giving the child freedom with responsibility. Too often parents give freedom without responsibility, leading to narcissistic, self-indulgent teens who carry those attributes into adulthood."},{"rating":"1","title":"frightening","review":"I opened this book expecting to enjoy a cogent critique of Israel that would jibe with my prejudices. However, i was shocked to find a troublingly inaccurate portrayal of Benny Morris' position. NF claimed that Morris said things that i could not find in reading Morris. There were no citations just inaccurate claims. I would welcome some evidence that Morris said what is claimed. Until then i am very suspect of this authors honesty and usefulness.

How does a few decades years erase the proposrity of all the other centuries??2. Were not the al-Muwahhidun dispised by Spain's Muslims? (the answer is yes)3. Salahuddin saved Maimonades....duh!!

If he had done so, his book might have been at the least honest.As it is, he is so busy vilifying Zionism and praising everything and anything opposed to this evil straw man he has set up in his mind, that he is simply incapable of writing a scholarly work on this conflict.A pity because he is obviously a gifted writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Profound ignorance and pathological lie","review":"I made a statistical analysis: I analyzed background those reviwers who gave 5-star points and those who gave 1-star.

My old bag used a Velcro strap to attach to the vacuum blower discharge nozzle. The new bag requires a zip-tie to secure. While this new system could be viewed by some to be an improvement, it does require a cutter of some sort to remove, then a new zip-tie with each bag dump. Thus, another tool to keep handy and more objects (zip-ties)to buy and keep up with.

It is a great book to read. It isn't too long or too short, either. The magic and the time travel are some of the main plots in the story. The best part is when the ship full of orphans come.

The dialogue is up-to-date and geared towards a more adult audience (did they remember those of us who were reading in the sixties, after all?). The art work is stunning, and the \\"how the Four got their powers\\" story works better than the original; their reactions as each of them discover their new found abilities is a hoot. I like the interaction between Sue and Reed in this version, and, as in the originals, Torch and Thing baiting one another is a great deal of fun.

William Edmundson starts at some specific notion of rights and follows its reasoning to the end: either the reader sees the final consequences or Edmundson sees the arrival of a new question. Or he begins with the contrast between two apparently similar ideas, and then follows this contrast as far as it will go. The result is a fertile field for classroom discussions.Edmundson frequently offers an abstract line of reasoning without supporting examples. In places almost every sentence could open a lengthy exchange. The result is a book where ideas travel fast and the reading is often dense.

There wasn't a place on the returns drop down list that fit my reasoning for sending it back other than Did Not Want, so I ended up paying $13 to send it back.FYI, this heater is not be installed in the vertical position per manufacturer directions inside box.

This is a problem if you change rechargeables often. Alkalines should last long enough that it wont matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great player... while it works","review":"I actually bought this as a gift for a friend, and she loved it. The player was small, light, had decent sound, and was working great until just a short while ago. The player just spontaneously died (just sitting on a desk... it wasn't being jostled around while running or anything). To my horror, I've discovered problems with the Nomad II line are fairly common ... To top it off, the unit was past its short 90 day warranty, so there's a [monetary fee] (plus shipping) just to have Creative examine the player for repairs. After they assess the problem, they'll charge extra money for repairs. For all that time and money, you may as well just buy a new player from another company. Stay away from this product. It seems like a great deal, but they are manufactured cheaply and prone to break down. Creative itself doesn't even have enough faith in their own product to back it up with a better warranty."},{"rating":"2","title":"128MB SmartMedia cards *are* supported.","review":"There seems to be some confusion about the size of SmartMedia card supported by the Nomad IIc. 128MB SmartMedia cards are supported, but you will probably need to upgrade your player's firmware to version 1.05, downloadable from Creative's website. You can check your firmware version by accessing the Info menu on your player. My player shipped with firmware version 1.01.It's possible that some brands of SmartMedia may not play nice with the Nomad, but 128MB SmartMedia support is definitely a feature.Note: I'm not sure if Creative has provided a mechanism for Macintosh users to upgrade beyond firmware version 1.04 without having access to a PC."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best and the most affordable","review":"Excellent sound quality and offer the most features. The best part of all is it utilies the standard Smartmedia card (up to 128 MB with the latest firmware) which the memory card is getting cheaper and cheaper. Also, it supports the standard SSFS for handling files store, that means you don't have to rely only on their software to transfer mp3 files, you can use other means such as any USB Smartmedia reader and just copy files like you do with a removable drive. I find it much faster to transfer with a SanDisk reader, 128 mb transfer in a matter of minute."},{"rating":"1","title":"Software doesn't work","review":"We did a lot of research before buying this and saw that a few people had trouble with the software, but didn't hear it from others.

His \\"comedic\\" personification of Hefneresque wolf-whistle culture is grotesque in the extreme. It's hard to imagine that people really found this funny as opposed to offensive.

This book will put you to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who's the real \\"Mr. Boring\\"?","review":"I have read this book through and through, and I have read the brief review pannning the book and the response by the author, Eugene Taylor. I had two reactions: First, I found the author's \\"rebuttal\\" rather spooky. It was a mean-spirited response, not at all polite or -- dare I say -- spiritually enlightened, although the author hints at his own ability to see into the great beyond and to know more than the rest of us who are not blessed with such . . . experiences. He is apparently thin-skinned, and perhaps, after I read this book, I now see that he has reason to be. Which brings me to my second point, my review of the book: I found myself in total agreement with the reviewer from Lincoln, Mass. I'm sorry to say this, but the book is boring. And repetitive. And offers a thesis that is not very original at all. I have read many books on the history of New Age spirituality, and this is just so-so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not useful and not very well written","review":"Like some of the other reviewers I cannot say that this is an interesting book.

I believe it's the first time Two3 has ever been recorded as composed, it's certainly the first time anyone released a recording of it anyway.

I was very nervous and it helped me calm down and see things in the proper light. I'm so happy I received it as a gift. I hope every pregnant woman reads it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book of personal opinions, not facts","review":"I bought this book because I am prone to anxiety and thought it might help alleviate some of my pregnancy fears. This book basically gives instructions for how to be one of those parents who puts themselves first. Some of the advice given by this book: eat all the sushi you want, feel free to drink wine, make sure you keep getting your fake nails done (no harm in breathing THOSE chemicals), but when asked whether a pregnant woman should go camping? Well, this book basically says, \\"Why would you want to?!\\" I'm not interested in this recipe for a marginal child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprised...","review":"I'm pretty surprised that your book didn't touch too much on the reality for the small percentage I fell into...stillbirth. I'd be interested to read more about how to cope with anxiety during pregnancy since it will be a 'real' part of my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disservice to pregnant women","review":"The title of this book alone makes me cringe. Pregnancy, for many women, may be problem-free. However, there is an unbelievably large population of parents out there whose babies die each year through miscarriage, stillbirth, or neonatal death. Valid worries and fears exist. \\"Fearless pregnancy\\" does not exist once you have lost a child, as I have. This book does a huge disservice to women in pregnancy, making light of potential problems and leading to possible harm to their unborn babies. And for those who do experience anxiety in pregnancy, this book, title alone, diminishes that anxiety, further isolating the women who are struggling so. Obstetricians and midwives need to focus on providing support to their patients through the fearful time of pregnancy, not spending time writing books like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money","review":"This book deals with pregnancy in a perfect world, not how things can and do happen. I, like others, aren't concerned about trivial things like morning sickness and backaches - I want to know and I worry about whether or not I'll be able to bring home a baby at the end of my pregnancy. I also fell into another category.....stillbirth. This book is great for those not wanting to deal with reality. I am amazed that it is written by a doctor, mom and midwife."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunate","review":"I recently read an article from Victoria Clayton, and she is so misinformed. I like another mom who posted a review of this book think this is a HUGE disservice to many mom's to be out there who just want to bring home a baby PERIOD. Which many women don't.

I just need to worry that my baby is going to be alive in 9 months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoorah!","review":"There are many great reviews of the film on this site so I'll just add my little bit. Although the film is primarily based on the graphic novel of the same name, the relationship between Enid and Seymour only exists in the movie.

It mixes together comedy and drama really well. Steve Buscemi was great in his role as the nerdy record collector. The movie was about an 18 year old girl, Enid(Thora Birch), who just graduated high school and doesn't quite know what she wants out of life. Her best friend, Rebecca(Scarlett Johanson), keeps nagging her about moving into an apartment with her. While playing a prank on a lonely middle-aged man, Seymour (Steve Buscemi), Enid becomes very close to him and learns that he is very interesting. Although this film stars teen actresses, it is not a teen movie. I highly reccomend this to everyone, it was THAT good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Partisan Politics Provide Poor Analysis","review":"Unfortunately, instead of an thorough analysis of the genesis, justifications, and problems with overarching property rights, DeLong acts as a mouthpiece for other property rights activists. DeLong covers some of the same ground as Congressman Richard Pombo in his 1996 This Land Is Our Land, simply emphasizing anomalous examples instead of practicable solutions. DeLong's denial of the externalities resulting from uninhibited development leave his analysis unbalanced and ill-founded. DeLong's politics overcome his analysis. This book is similar to his condemnation of industry for their recognition to the denial of carbon dioxide emissions. (...) His political agenda overwhelm his rationale"},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrible edition, badly printed","review":"I was very disappointed in the quality of this reprint. It looks like a very poor scan of the original, with blotchy, hard-to-read type (poor resolution, perhaps, or somebody turned up the contrast on the scan too high in an effort to get rid of stains or some such thing), and it's been over-enlarged to make the page margins too small. It is painful to read, which would not be so awful if it were a short work but is downright prohibitive in a book of this length. I will go and seek out a better printing; this was a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"AMAZING BOOK - Horrible scan of original version","review":"Excellent book, horrible scan.

From a musical mindset, Buffy Sainte-Marie was and is still an all time favorite. Her unique repertoire, from topical, protest music to old Childe ballads, she moves music above the ordinary and makes it an event. Whether she sings her own songs or those of Leonard Cohen and Joni Mitchell, she delivers. I first remember hearing her sing a song from a later album, entitled simply Buffy--not yet available on CD. The song is \\"Sweet Little Vera.\\" I saw her perform this on television around 1974, and I was mesmerized! She sang and danced on stage like a Native North American Tina Turner. This 17 year old fellow has been a fan ever since. In short, anything you buy by Buffy Sainte-Marie will delight.

I definitely would recommend it.Some issues: currently there is no Level 2. Even after completing Level 1, I think I will have a long way to go and will have to search out other learning approaches. Although it runs in an MS window, I don't think it is a real Windows program, so when going through the typing exercises, it gets glitchy at times. And some of the user interfaces are a bit awkward. For example in the typing exercises, it would be nice to be able to hit Enter to submit your response, but instead you have to switch over to the mouse to push a button. Also, to switch activities or lessons, there is no menu bar -- you have to hit their \\"Go Back\\" button.But overall, I am learning to speak Hebrew."},{"rating":"2","title":"Standup and Proclaim the TRUTH!","review":"I've been on both sides of the fence concerning integration (Psychology and Christianity), and I've always believed that the two could coexist; however, I was wrong despite my sincerity. Psychobabble: The Failure of Modern Psychology and the Biblical Alternative opened my eyes. Richard Ganz shows his readers that Psychology and Christianity cannot be united. Throughout this book Ganz shares insights from his own personal journey, and encourages his readers to take a bold stance for Christ. This is a book that confronts modern psychotherapy with the Word of God. Within its pages we see Ganz cutting away the fluff of this \\"feel good\\" theology that has crept into our homes and churches; he reveals the \\"Psycho...\\" fields true motives. Armed with only the Bible he successfully confronts many of societies crutches (self-esteem, etc.). I would highly recommend this book for those who truly believe God's Word is sufficient for ever need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book About Biblical Counseling","review":"Ganz's book has shown me that pursuing a higher degree in the field in which I already have an undergraduate degree, namely psychology, would be futile. I always felt that the line between \\"Christian\\" psychology and secular psychology was very blurred; nevertheless, Ganz has confirmed my belief that God's Word is sufficient for such needs. Why run to the world for answers when we serve the Prince of Peace? There is so much in God's Word that confirms Ganz's position about Biblical counseling. I feel that his position on this subject is timely as many Christians have compromised with the world in this area. It is time for us to believe what God says in His Word. \\"Do not be anxious for anything...\\" (Phil. 4:6-7)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good intentions, poorly argued.","review":"I was initially impressed by the topics to be covered in this book however found that few areas were well discussed. Whilst myself exploring the differences between modern psychology and Nouthetic counseling, this book failed to completely discuss the areas detailed in its contents. I was particularly disappopinted with the chapter \\"The myth of intergration\\" which had very little to do with intergrating modern psychology with Biblical concepts. Examples were biased and information appeared to be delievered without the thoroughness that such texts require for today's critical minds. As this review is titled, I believe the author had good intentions, however with exposure to Jay Adams and the like for his work, this book offers very little useful information."},{"rating":"1","title":"A potential problem with using an all region dvd player","review":"I purchased this dvd because I have an all region dvd player by Toshiba.
